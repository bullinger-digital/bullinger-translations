      <p>Greetings. I greatly wished, but was unable, to write very lengthy letters to you, most distinguished Bullinger. The Jesuits are now moving to Munich, otherwise occupying the splendid nest of Ingolstadt; their task is to manage the literary school not only in Munich but also throughout all of Bavaria under the leadership of Staphylus. I see that unless the Lord is present with a mighty hand, papistic errors will grow more severe and worsen day by day. A large part of the blame lies with the mute, tongue-tied, and idle dogs, who, due to their gluttony, prioritize their stomachs in the greatest public matters.</p>
      <p>Canisius preaches here in the cathedral church; without a doubt, he is up to something. I give eternal thanks for Jeremiah.</p>
      <p>Someone wrote to me, as this document shows; if you can help, I ask you to do so. Neogeorgus is said to have written an excellent poem against the Catalog of Heretics condemned by the Pope. Do not pay anything to the courier.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly. September 22, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Gereon Sailer.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, theologian and friend, to be honored with the utmost reverence.</p>
