      <p>I understood, most distinguished man, from our Erastus that the letters, which I recently sent to you through Mr. Marius, have been delivered to you and were pleasing, therefore I write to you again, so that you may understand that you and all yours are dear to me and all mine.</p>
      <p>We eagerly await your response against the monster of ubiquity, and we would wish it to be published both in Latin and German, so that those who do not understand Latin and whose minds are already bewitched by opinions may be admonished by a German writing. It cannot be said how much the authors of this most pestilential doctrine strive to spread their monster and daily inculcate it into people. We are wholly engaged in purging our churches from these dregs, but not without great difficulty, envy, and danger. However, the Lord (to whom the whole matter belongs) provides both counsel and governs the outcomes.</p>
      <p>I have heard for some time that your earlier booklet, which you wrote about the words of Christ (in my Father's house, etc.), has also been published in German, but I have not seen it, so I would like to know for certain from you. For if it has not been published, we will make an effort for it to begin to speak in German as well. Peter Martyr's book on the same matter is already almost translated.</p>
      <p>We have learned from your letters and those of others that the affairs of France are going quite well. At the request of the King of Navarre, we sent two theologians there, pious and learned men known to you (if I am not mistaken): Mr. Michael Tiller and P. Boquin, whom you understand to sincerely favor sound doctrine. If only others who were sent there would do the same.</p>
      <p>We are surprised, however, that they have been in France for almost six weeks and have not written a word to us. And as far as we can understand or conjecture, we fear that the letters have either been intercepted or the couriers are being hindered. Therefore, you would do us a favor if you would inform us of the state of the whole cause at the earliest opportunity, and if couriers are lacking, send someone to us at our expense.</p>
      <p>For it is in both your and our interest to share counsel. I would like you to be persuaded of this once and for all about us, that we have hitherto given and will in the future give our efforts to defend, propagate the recognized doctrine, and impede the plans of the adversaries to the best of our ability.</p>
      <p>We need a man of mature judgment, doctrine, piety, and authority here in Heidelberg, whom we would gladly receive into the ecclesiastical senate, and to whom we would entrust the inspection of our neighboring churches and a single sermon a week. If you have someone, most illustrious man, whom you can spare, help us. And may you and all yours fare well in the Lord. Greet all your colleagues in my name. Hastily, in Heidelberg, November 13, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Christoph Ehem, Palatine Counselor</p>
      <p>Mr. Probus and Cirler greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Minister of the Word of God among the Zurichers, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
