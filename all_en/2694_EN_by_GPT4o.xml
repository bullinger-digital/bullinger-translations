      <p>Greetings and blessings. Reverend man and dearest brother. When copies of your writing: πεςί δίϰαιοϭμνης peri dikaiosunhs, were brought, I immediately bought and read them, and I was delighted by the agreement of your churches and ours. Later, I received your letters and the book you sent. Therefore, I thank you both for your kindness towards me and for the gift. I also read what you responded regarding Servetus' blasphemy, and I approve of your piety and judgments. I also judge that the Geneva council acted rightly in removing the stubborn man who would not cease his blasphemies, and I was amazed that there are those who disapprove of that severity. I am sending brief pages on this question, yet they are witnesses of our opinion. Some of my old friends threaten to write against me on the matter of bread-worship. If they publish anything specifically against me, I have decided, with God's help, to respond, even though I would prefer to avoid this conflict. It would be more useful for the pious and learned to discuss such a significant matter calmly. I pray, however, that the Son of God may govern us all and heal the wounds of the church. Farewell happily and prosperously, dearest brother. On the 20th of August. I wish greetings to Lelio and to all of you.</p>
      <p>Philipp Melanchthon.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man, outstanding in learning and virtue, Lord Heinrich Bullinger of the Church of Christ in the renowned and ancient city of Zürich, his dearest brother.</p>
      <p>He speaks of my book, which I published in the year 54, On the Grace of God Justifying Us for Christ's Sake through Faith Alone without Good Works, while faith in the meantime abounds in good works, in four books to the most serene King of Denmark. HB author.</p>
