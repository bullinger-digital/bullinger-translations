    <p xml:id="regest1">Since they are reliant on God-fearing pastors to counteract the damages that have arisen from the unlawful expulsion of their former pastors, they turn to the pastors of Zurich [as well as Basel and Strasbourg], who have already proven [in May 1538] through their advocacy for Farel, Calvin, and Coraud that they care for the church of Geneva just as much as for their own congregations. After God has united the people of Geneva, they now request support for their efforts to bring back the exiled; they send them a letter to the council [CO XI 221-226, No. 312; Corr. des réformateurs 129-132, No. 985] along with a copy, but leave it to them whether they wish to forward it or present the matter orally.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You are not unaware, dearest brothers and friends, of the tumult and horrendous scandals we have encountered, since our pious pastors and ministers were unjustly expelled from our city, more by tumult and conspiracy than by judicial order, which was indeed a great injustice. We cannot remedy this, nor can we tend to such a dangerous wound, unless we have pious pastors and ministers, skilled, wise, and God-fearing, to repair this ruin.</p>
      <p>For this reason, we turn to you, whom we know to be as concerned for our church as for those entrusted to you there: considering its edification or destruction to be equally yours, as you have abundantly demonstrated by trying with all your might to persuade our magistrate to restore the ministry of our dearest brothers and faithful ministers, Farel, Calvin, and Coraud, to their former state and office. This could not be done at that time due to the obstinacy and defiance of those who were the agitators of the people, which drove a great crowd of pious and honest men to sighs and tears, seeing our city so shaken by God's wrath. Now, however, since the most merciful Father has visited us with His kindness and gathered us into one flock, we ardently beseech you in the name of the Lord, who have labored so much in restoring our faithful brothers and pastors, when they were rejected by those who pursued their own desires rather than God's will, to now also help us in recalling them, as they are sought by the magistrate and the entire people, fully realizing the grave loss they have sustained and still endure. Therefore, may it please you to assist us in this great work, according to the tenor of our letters written to your magnificent lords and princes, which we send to you along with a copy, so that if you deem it necessary and useful, they may be delivered, otherwise retained. Act entirely as your providence and counsel deem most expedient, whether you deliver them or approach your lords' excellency on our behalf, proposing to them what is contained in these letters. We entrust everything to your judgment, confident in you as in ourselves, fully persuaded that you will extend your helping hands with all your might in this grave and serious matter of the Lord. By doing so, you will demonstrate how much care and concern you have for the Christian church, with what vigilance you watch over His flock, and with what love you pursue our republic. May the Lord fill you with every blessing and grace to complete and illuminate this work entrusted to you. Farewell. Geneva, 26 May 1541.</p>
      <p>Your sincere friends, the Syndics and Senate of the city of Geneva.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and prudent pastors and ministers of the church of Zürich, our friends in the Lord to be respected.</p>
