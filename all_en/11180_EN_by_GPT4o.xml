    <p xml:id="regest1">Requests to kindly receive Luther's letter [No. 1126]; contrary to the suspicion [of the Swiss], Luther has long fought against the heresy of attributing salvific efficacy to external signs. Even if the sacraments are received unworthily, it is Christ himself who acts in them; since [the Lutherans] teach about this according to Scripture, there is no fear of a return to the old error. Warns against unjustified criticism of Luther. Conveys greetings, especially from Matthäus [Zell], who is deeply impressed by his visit to various German churches. Recommends Otto [Werdmüller]. Reproaches himself that he and Grynäus allowed themselves to be dissuaded by Erasmus [Ritter] from accompanying [Calvin and Farel] to Bern and Geneva.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Luther writes to you, dearest Bullinger, from a friendly heart. You will receive his letters with an equal spirit; for this is fitting for your modesty and humanity. Modesty; for although you do not approve of everything from such a great man, so experienced in the work of Christ, whose ministry the Lord has blessed and continues to bless so greatly, you do not demand that he finds nothing lacking in your writings. Humanity; for if he writes and speaks in such a way as to abundantly show his true love towards you, you will suspect nothing different. He sees well enough that while you cautiously and carefully admit the manner of speaking about the mysteries, which he follows as handed down in the scriptures, he has not yet approved himself to you and still remains in grave suspicion among you, as if he were someone who wishes to attribute part of the power of our salvation to external rites, words, and symbols, when, as the first among us, he opposed this error, and today yields to no one in combating it. Therefore, he could be offended not lightly; yet he accommodates himself to retain and promote your friendship with you.</p>
      <p>It is certainly not a small thing to be considered an insincere preacher of faith, when no one has defended the sincerity of faith earlier, more consistently, or with greater success.</p>
      <p>But what disturbs you is that, following the scriptures, he speaks of words and symbols and the whole sacred matter, considering them as the words, symbols, and actions of the Lord, which the Lord himself offers, provides, and advances, however much he uses our ministry here, while you look at those who receive these things as men. For it is often due to their unbelief that they do not experience these gifts of God, as the Lord offers them. But this cannot make it so that we should not commend the mysteries of the Lord as he himself commends them to us. "But from this, the common people will again admit the old error, that they have those salvific things for themselves, even when they use them without true faith." How can this happen, when it is so diligently inculcated that Christ is the one who teaches us with his word, washes away sin with baptism, feeds us to eternal life in the Eucharist, and makes us certain of forgiveness in absolution? That he alone is the one who works these and all salvific things for us, and if anyone receives these things without solid faith in him, he takes destruction upon himself. Since they never fail to diligently instill these things, from their very words no one will learn to place trust in anything other than in Christ alone, and whether they rightly and piously confirm this trust in Christ when they teach and exhort with such devotion that people lift their hearts to Christ in the whole sacred ministry and recognize him as true in his words and symbols and do not doubt that he provides regeneration in baptism and the life-giving eating of himself in the Eucharist? For thus his words have it, thus also the church has always understood and used them.</p>
      <p>I beg you in the Lord, my Bullinger, to weigh these things yourself when Luther's words offend you, as if they attribute too much to external ministry, and to explain them to others whom you understand to be offended by the same. For it is very true that Luther and his followers think and speak orthodoxly about these matters, because according to scripture.</p>
      <p>For he establishes no other presence and exhibition of the body and blood of the Lord than precisely that which the words of the Lord express and which neither distracts the body of the Lord from places nor extracts it from heavenly glory.</p>
      <p>But we have sufficiently testified about these things in person. We know before the Lord that there is nothing in Luther's doctrine that should rightly alienate you from him; therefore, we are concerned that a false persuasion about his doctrine may disturb you somewhere. I love and respect you; therefore, we seek and desire that you may be fully united in spirit with those whom the Lord has united in his ministry, and that you may persevere united. However, we earnestly desire to avert that you may offend Christ the Lord in each other. For Plato very truly says in Minoo: "For there is nothing more impious than this, nor anything that should be more carefully avoided, except to sin against the gods both in word and deed, and secondly against divine men," and a little later: "For God is indignant when someone blames one similar to himself." You, with your candor, take all these things in the best part. God knows - and unless it is so, may he cast me away - that we are held by the truest zeal for you and write these things. May the Lord grant your ministry the desired success and make you happy in all things.</p>
      <p>The brothers and our Matthäus greet you, who visited not a few Hessian, Saxon, and Swabian churches; for he went as far as Lübeck and Hamburg to the Baltic Sea, and was received everywhere with great kindness.</p>
      <p>He swears that he has never experienced so much learning, piety, and humanity; he would not want the expenses of the journey, which were not insignificant, to be repaid to him threefold and not to have made this pilgrimage.</p>
      <p>There is no need to commend your and our Otto to you; for you have previously loved the man excellently, now you will love him more for his own merit, as he returns to you enriched with the nobility of manners, learning, and prudence.</p>
      <p>Farewell, sweetest Bullinger, and when you have leisure, write back. Strasbourg, June 10.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>How very poorly we advised the brothers in Geneva, when we left them solely to the Bernese! How much Erasmus erred here! For if he had not frankly said to us: "If you go, I will completely withdraw from their cause," Grynäus and I would have certainly led them to Bern and Geneva.</p>
      <p>As we and Contzen hear, the Lord would not have failed us and would have given us to avert such a great evil, indeed he would have averted it himself using our work. But some flee too much from communicating with these brothers and interpret all communion with those whom they think have a little more influence as servitude. Then they fear those rumors of the common people: "they are taught by others, corrected" more than is reasonable. Not so in former times were the holy and true ministers of the church. My conscience now bites me greatly, that we did not follow the advice of the most pious Basel council.</p>
