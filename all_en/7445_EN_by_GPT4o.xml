      <p>I send to you, most revered father, what I have only now finally obtained, as I could not write before about what was still unknown. Part of this was reported to my prince-elector and part to others by the one who completed the journey from the city of Paris to this city in the span of 8 days; namely, the one who brought with him the printed edict of pacification. Consider these things favorably, as they were written in great haste, and always keep me recommended to you, I pray, my father.</p>
      <p>Heidelberg, April 21, 1568. Your most obedient son, Gregor Thoman.</p>
      <p>Postscript: The one who made this report, as mentioned above, and brought with him the printed French copy of the established edict of pacification, also revealed that the queen in France, among other things, in her current farewell taken from him, with weeping eyes, so that one tear had to flow after another, acknowledged that she had at that time received a letter from her daughter, the Queen of Spain, which contained the information that her husband, the King of Spain, had fallen into such an illness that there was no longer any hope for his life, as he had already lost the ability to speak. The king's son, the Prince of Spain, was said to have freed himself through treachery, as reported, and along with those who were imprisoned with him, had fled the kingdom and, as they received the report, had already embarked in England.</p>
      <p>I wrote these things in German so that you may share them with others, which I send to you. Again and again, farewell, most illustrious man and/or father. Given as above.</p>
      <p>Your obedient son, Gregor Thoman.</p>
