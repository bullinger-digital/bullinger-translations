      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, I thank you and Susanna for the hare you sent me this week; it has arrived well. In return, I am sending you these 2 roast fish; accept them kindly, and eat them joyfully together. Cousin Josue also sends you both these two beautiful little things for the bath, wishing you a healthy and pleasant bath; he greets you sincerely and asks you to accept them kindly from him.</p>
      <p>As you requested, I am sending you a note; you may send it well. The new news is also included. I sincerely thank you for your news. To Hans Peyer and you, I wish from God that it may have happened as you said; that the governor has ridden away, if it were true, the seal would be on the letter. May God grant grace and victory. Greet Hans sincerely for me.</p>
      <p>Those coming from Italy say that the Venetians have not lost Zaram; they stood well in battle, but retained it. They alone, with their ships and without the help of the Spaniards, have defeated and captured Ochiali and, in a skirmish, destroyed and captured 40 Turkish ships with a glorious victory.</p>
      <p>If it is true, we will soon hear about it. From Lyon, Geneva, Strasbourg, Nuremberg, and Augsburg, I have nothing at this time, nor anything from Chur, waiting evermore, etc.</p>
      <p>The little bottle for the elecampane wine was arranged for you by my Dorothea; if we survive the autumn and you do something good for me in it, I will earn it for you. May God be with you, Susanna, and the children. Everyone sends you greetings.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, 29th August 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>To my dearly beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
