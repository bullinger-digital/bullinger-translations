      <p>Greetings. If you have not received any letters from us, most learned Beza, esteemed lord, and dearest brother, know that this was not due to us but to the fault of those most turbulent times.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, your memory has never faded from us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we have done what we could, commending you and France to our Lord God with our constant prayers.</p>
      <p>We have always recognized that all fortune and all dangers are shared with you and that you even risk yourself for our sake.</p>
      <p>Hence, we do not cease to give thanks to the Lord since we have learned that some kind of peace has been restored to France and that you have returned safely and unharmed to Geneva.</p>
      <p>We pray, however, that the Lord may confirm the peace and remove all obstacles to the course of the word and bless you.</p>
      <p>For since the Lord has granted much to France through you, we encourage you, as we know you will do otherwise, to continue to assist the churches of France with advice and help.</p>
      <p>Satan will try everything before he allows himself to be cast out: now, therefore, if ever, there will be a need for prayers and advice.</p>
      <p>We are saddened that Mr. Calvin is ill, and we pray to the Lord to grant him to you and the entire church, otherwise most afflicted.</p>
      <p>He, endowed with such humanity, has communicated to us all that you sent from France through you.</p>
      <p>Hence, for that diligence of yours [and for the most recent letters written this month], we give your piety the greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>I send here the icon of the blessed memory of the most holy man, Mr. Peter Martyr, not so much in my name as in the name of all my fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>For all the pastors and professors of our church and school have ordered me to write this, that is, to congratulate you on your return, to give thanks, to encourage you to continue to assist the French churches with advice and help, to embrace us in true love, and to kindly accept this token of love.</p>
      <p>Everyone wishes you all happiness.</p>
      <p>In recent days, I have sent letters once and again to Mr. Calvin, with which I joined letters sent to him from Poland.</p>
      <p>I hope all of them have now reached you.</p>
      <p>I give the greatest thanks to Mr. Jonville for deigning to write to me so diligently.</p>
      <p>I beg you to excuse me to him for not responding.</p>
      <p>The perpetual duty of preaching has hindered me these days.</p>
      <p>You will tell him that Mr. Christ.</p>
      <p>The third Pole left here on May 6th.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother, and commend us and our ministry to the Lord in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Greet all fellow ministers, especially Mr. Calvin, our esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>A certain Lithuanian will come to you, a man not unlearned, but exceedingly Brentian, along with three students.</p>
      <p>They wish to converse.</p>
      <p>Be prudent.</p>
      <p>They hunt to see if they can detect any dissension among us in the doctrine of heaven and the right hand of God.</p>
      <p>You know what Brentius's doctrine of ubiquity is and what he has written against me.</p>
      <p>They say he is now preparing a new writing against me.</p>
      <p>Again and again, farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 31, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Théodore de Bèze, the most faithful minister of the Genevan church, honorable lord, and my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
