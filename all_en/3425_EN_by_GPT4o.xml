      <p>Greetings. I received a letter from our excellent brother, Mr. Konrad Bischofberger, written to you, which I am now returning. I also understood that you are seeking my judgment in this matter; but I would have preferred to hear yours first. Nevertheless, I will say what the Lord has given, and indeed in fewer words than you might wish.</p>
      <p>I truly know that many among you have no need, as I am writing to the most skilled, not the unskilled, and I feel that my affairs draw me to other matters as well. I believe we all agree that a child being baptized by a layperson is neither done correctly nor in order; yet I do not think that such a baptism should be repeated, because many things are sometimes done differently than they should be, which nonetheless, once done, we do not retract or rescind. Many examples could be provided; but one will suffice: In the past, those baptized by heretics, provided the proper formula for baptism was observed, were not rebaptized, even though they had been baptized not by ministers of the church, but rather by a minister of Satan. The ancient custom of the church, preserved up to our times, should move you not a little, by which the baptism of such persons was never repeated.</p>
      <p>If you wish to hear testimonies, here they are readily available: The Council of Elvira, celebrated in the time of Emperor Constantine, chapter 42, makes an exception for necessity. Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, who preceded Athanasius in the episcopate, forbade the repetition of baptism given by Athanasius as if in play and imitation, as reported in Ecclesiastical History. St. Jerome, against the Luciferians, says, "Hence it comes that without chrism and the bishop's command, neither a presbyter nor a deacon had the right to baptize, which we know is also frequently allowed to laypeople if necessity compels." Read Ambrose himself in the Epistle to the Ephesians interpreting these words: "And he gave some as apostles," etc. Augustine also writes in his work against the Epistle of Parmenian, book 2, chapter 13: "And if a layperson, compelled by necessity, has given baptism, I do not know if anyone would piously say it should be repeated; for if it is done without any compelling necessity, it is an usurpation of another's office; but if necessity urges, it is either no sin or a venial one." I believe he spoke according to the custom of the church of his time. And would that he had not judged too severely about infants dying without baptism. Since I have discussed this at length in my Decades on baptism, there is no need to repeat it at length. However, because through baptism a child of the faithful is visibly inserted into the church, of which he was previously a member, by a solemn action, perhaps the pastor, if (as he writes) he orders the child previously baptized by a layperson to be brought to the sacred assembly, where the pastor explains the act and not only declares the child to belong to the church of the faithful, but also diligently warns everyone not to admit such a thing in the future by teaching that there is no danger of falling from salvation if someone dies by some necessity before they can be baptized by a minister of the church, may be seen as not sinning. You have in very few words what I think, always saving a better judgment.</p>
      <p>I know, however, that in the ancient church this cause was judged no differently.</p>
      <p>Because I could not write these things down nor give them to anyone to be written down (for I was in a great hurry), I ask that you return this letter once it is copied. I can write nothing now about other matters, but will write later.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus bless you.</p>
      <p>But how is it, my Philipp, that you no longer write letters to me?</p>
      <p>Farewell, excellent brothers; commend me to the honorable councilors and friends and brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 3, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men in piety and learning, Mr. Philipp Saluz and Mr. Johann Fabricius, ministers of the church in Chur, their most esteemed and beloved lords and brothers.</p>
