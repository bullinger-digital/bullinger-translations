      <p>Greetings and blessings. I received your letters, esteemed brother, and understood what you request. I am indeed ready to assist you and your son; for this is deserved by your kindness towards me and your son's virtue. He brought with him truly excellent testimonials from England; but in what way your son can be helped and your otherwise large expenses reduced, I cannot easily say. I wish it were convenient for you to come to us sometime, and perhaps now to be present with us at the celebration of Charles; we could discuss this matter more intimately. And there is no need for you to seek another host than me; since my father-in-law has passed away to the Lord and my relative has changed residence, I do not see with whom you could lodge more comfortably than with me, your most devoted and loving friend.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell happily with your whole family. In great haste, Zurich, January 22, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned, and faithful Mr. Hans Stumpf, pastor in Stammheim, his kind dear lord and brother.</p>
