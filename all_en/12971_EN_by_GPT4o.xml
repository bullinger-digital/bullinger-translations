    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Fortunately, Vadian was informed about Bullinger's stay at the spa [Urdorf], otherwise he would have been worried about his long silence. Hopefully, the bathing was refreshing! In the meantime, there were only false reports everywhere and nothing special to report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Hieronymus Sailer wrote from Augsburg. Vadian encloses the letter here, as it contains the answer to the question that Bullinger [did not receive] in his last letter. Bullinger should return it. It also reports on a peace agreement, which is, however, doubted. Emperor Charles V seems to have made peace proposals. However, Duke Johann Ernst of Saxe-Coburg is said to have rejected them, and they are still waiting for the response of Elector Johann Frederick of Saxony.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Yesterday, the St. Gallen messenger Hans Büllentretter returned from Nuremberg. He reported that around May 22, ten mercenaries from the Emperor's camp arrived in Nuremberg. They were completely destitute, barely clothed, and carried white staffs. Four of them were severely injured. They were admitted to the hospital free of charge. The others were accommodated in the infirmary. When questioned, they only stated that they came from the Emperor's camp and were not allowed to speak about the circumstances of their injuries for a while, as they had sworn this to God and the saints. Several thousand imperial troops are said to have fallen near Wittenberg. The messenger said that people were tired of the Emperor. However, the imperial estates are suspicious of each other. Moreover, they do not want to see clearly! The prospect of special rights divides them and harms them. May the Lord deliver us from evil!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I would have been troubled by your long silence, had I not been informed that you were spending some time at the baths, which I hope are beneficial to you. Meanwhile, I had nothing to write about from all the rumors and tales that are circulating everywhere without any credibility.</p>

      <p>Hieronymus Sailer wrote to me from Augsburg, and since he recently mentioned the matter you wished to be answered in your last letter, I have decided to enclose his letter with mine, so that once you have made good use of it, it may be returned to me. He mentions new developments and writes about a certain peace, which others claim does not exist; conditions were indeed proposed by the Emperor, but they were rejected by Ernest, the remaining prince of Saxony.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, one of our messengers, named Hans Büllentretter, returned from Nuremberg. He reports that around May 22, ten mercenaries came to Nuremberg from the Emperor's camp, very poor and naked, carrying white staffs, among whom four men were badly wounded; they were received into the hospital out of charity, and the other six into the common infirmary. They were then questioned about their experiences, etc. They said they had to swear bodily oaths to God and the saints that they would not speak for some time about the harm and where it befell them. That time has not yet passed. They will therefore reveal nothing, except that they came from the Emperor's camp. Near Wittenberg, he certainly lost not a few thousand men. The messenger himself informed me that people everywhere bear noticeable resentment against this tyrant. The plague, however, is among the estates, as no one trusts the other, and they all look through their fingers. Whatever monopolies exist, they are remarkably factious and harmful. May the Lord deliver us from evil.</p>

      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, on the first day of June, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the renowned church of Zurich, my singular lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
