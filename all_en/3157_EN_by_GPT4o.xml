      <p>Greetings. I know indeed, most esteemed lord and godfather, that you are expecting my letters; however, since I do not have much to write about that would be of great importance, we still have no certain news, and we are waiting to see what our merchants will bring us from Frankfurt. We hear and regret that our apiary has fallen into some kind of madness at those fairs; we will hear on what occasion or how this happened when the others arrive.</p>
      <p>I received letters from Mr. a Lasco, which he wrote to you, and I thank you greatly for having deigned to share a copy of them with me. We are exceedingly glad that Philipp and others are so inclined towards concord. We also agree with Philipp's judgment and advice; more will be achieved through private conversations among good and learned men than if it were to be convened and celebrated publicly in the name of the princes; everything will be discussed more freely here, and minds will open up more widely, which otherwise, constrained by the authority of their princes and magistrates, would not dare to express what they will dare to express when it is a matter of asserting pure truth from free consciences. Indeed, there is the danger that more morose magistrates might take it more unfavorably that it is being conducted privately by their own; but let them take it as they will, as long as truth prevails and advances. I have certainly conceived much hope, and although that future convention of learned men will be private, it will nevertheless obtain much and perhaps more authority among most princes and even men than if it were public. Regarding our own, that is, the Swiss churches, one scruple remains for me, who can be sent and how this can be done conveniently. I would like you to be involved entirely; but I am not unaware that you cannot undertake this duty without the authority of the magistrate. Therefore, I ask you to write what seems right to you here. Among our people, Musculus would not be unsuitable, nor Viret or Beza. Calvin will not be lacking in this matter; but I do not entirely trust the French temperaments. I would like Peter Martyr to be associated with you; I do not know how expedient it would be for him to act alone. I do not trust Sultzer (who nevertheless involves himself everywhere, not unlike Bucer) (I speak to you) and I would like him to be far away from these matters; for I fear that he might syncretize with the Lutherans. Therefore, I would like to hear your judgment. I consider these things too childishly, yet I desire the truth to be promoted.</p>
      <p>Musculus himself will also write to you about this matter. I thank you for your sermons, the first of which is all the more pleasing to me because I have also heard it pronounced from your mouth. Yesterday, among others, Mr. Nicol. Diespach was elected to the senate, on whose behalf I congratulate the republic and all of us; for he is a pious, prudent, and moderate man, and entirely the kind this republic requires. He sends his greetings to you; as does our Haller, whom Muralt the surgeon visited at your urging, for which he himself thanks you greatly and also sends his greetings.</p>
      <p>My mother and wife also send their greetings to you, as do Musculus and other brothers. May all of yours be well. Also, convey my greetings to my lords, brothers, and your fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most esteemed and dear lord and godfather.</p>
