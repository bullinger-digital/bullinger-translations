    <p xml:id="regest1">Trebellio, who never doubted that Peter Martyr [Vermigli] is dear to Bullinger, is now completely convinced of it. Vermigli, who is like a father to Trebellio, asked him in a letter [not received] to forward the letters from the Zurichers or Bullinger to him. Trebellio offers the same to Bullinger. He now sends a letter from Vermigli [No. 2191], with which Vermigli dispels the accusation of negligence. Trebellio does not regret that Bullinger suspected Vermigli, as it is pleasing that Bullinger [thereby expresses that he] makes use of Vermigli's service. Bullinger should rather attribute [the interruption of correspondence] to the unfaithfulness of the messengers than suspect the so reliable and devoted Vermigli. Trebellio assures Bullinger of his affection. - Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Rudolf] Gwalther, and the other brothers.</p>

      <p>Greetings from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I have never doubted that Peter Martyr, our Italian, is always very dear to you, but now I see that some new factor has arisen, which has completely removed any possibility of doubt for me in the future. I was wonderfully delighted by Peter's letters, in which he wanted to inform me that if any letters from you or the Zurich church were sent to him, I should take care of them properly; in this matter, as in no other, I cannot refuse my duty to this man, whom I regard as a father. Thus, I am pleased to promise you the same with the same faith and eagerness of spirit. Therefore, I am sending you the letters with which he (as I believe) dissolves the accusation of negligence, for which I am not at all sorry that he was suspected by you, since it is more pleasant for his service to be required by you than for him to be accused of negligence. However, I ask you to attribute this rather to the unfaithfulness of the messengers than to suspect anything less than candid from such a sincere man who is so devoted to you. So that this does not happen again, you will ensure that the letters you wish to be sent to Strasbourg are delivered to me. As for myself, I would like you to promise yourself what you would expect from a good and very devoted man; believe me, I will surpass your expectations with my services. Farewell, most holy pastor.</p>
      <p>Please greet in my name the esteemed father Pellikan, the most learned Bibliander, as well as the most erudite Gwalther, along with the other brothers of your holy church, whom the Lord God may strengthen with the word and spirit of His mouth. Amen.</p>
      <p>In Basel at the Bishop's residence, the day before the calends of August 1545. Your servant and the servant of the entire Zurich church, Theodosius Trebellius, the Italian.</p>
      <p>To the most holy pastor of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, whom I hold in the highest regard. To Zurich.</p>
