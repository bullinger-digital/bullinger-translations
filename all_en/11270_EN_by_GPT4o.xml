    <p xml:id="regest1">His inquiries have revealed that the establishment of a Secret Council is out of the question. Zürich will also not engage with powers outside the Confederation; however, they are prepared to defend themselves if necessary. The obligation to provide assistance based on existing alliances will be fulfilled. If something needs to remain confidential, it is customary for the mayor and the chief guild masters to handle it. They stand firm by the Gospel but will not take any action as long as the Confederation is not concretely threatened. Myconius is to return this confidential letter.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>Friendly, beloved, and especially trusted lord and brother, I have understood your very earnest letter and have discussed it with some kind-hearted individuals, among whom I could find nothing else but that it is not possible to establish (achieve) a secret council, not only because of the recent discord between city and country, but also because everyone fears the example of the last secret council, which was organized before our war; for all the burden, all the displeasure, all the misfortune once fell upon them. Since one must also arrange the war with the community, the simple people also want to know what is being dealt with, and there is always a suspicion of the secret council until it comes to action, where it is well known and an old custom to organize war councils.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I cannot understand that one would engage with anyone outside the Confederation, neither in understanding nor in war. It is believed that if something should or would arise in the empire, there is still enough time to deliberate, while in all other ways one is prepared to resist whatever may arise. And in summary, I find that they are firmly determined to wait and see how God will arrange things, and meanwhile to persist in the word of God, to give everyone good advice, to strive for peace, and if nothing else helps, to prepare for resistance, as our people can thus be kept most courageous and willing.</p>
      <p>As for alliances and other understandings, I hear and trust that they will be faithfully maintained, and that you and others will be faithfully supported if the need arises.</p>
      <p>However, I am also informed that my lords have a custom that, concerning matters that affect the city and country and should remain secret, the mayors and chief guild masters may handle them quietly, as they deem useful and good.</p>
      <p>And in summary, I find all loyalty and honesty and hope that, if the need arises, they will faithfully and bravely stand by the Gospel. However, that one would, before any current temptation affects the Confederation, engage with anyone or hold long deliberations, meetings, and the like, I do not think will happen.</p>
      <p>I wanted to show you, my especially trusted one, in confidence. Please, I ask you to return the letter to me well preserved, as I trust you.</p>
      <p>May God be with you and all who love God. Let us always be entrusted to you in faithfulness and wish you well as we do ourselves.</p>
      <p>Zürich, 18th of February 1539.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned, and faithful Dr. Oswald Myconius, preacher of the church in Basel, his especially trusted lord and brother.</p>
