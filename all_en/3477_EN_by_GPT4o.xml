      <p>S. P. D. Your letter, which you recently sent to me, was delivered to me upon my departure; for I was invited along with my guest and all my household to the magnificent lord of Anwil, the archprefect, at Retele Castle. If I had received it a little earlier, I would have responded to you at that time.</p>
      <p>But, although no one is as lazy in writing as I am, especially because I have barely touched this way and method of writing with my fingertips (as they say), your letter, written in very good Latin and with great kindness, has encouraged me and made me not fear to write to you now with unpolished and rough words instead of polished and refined ones. Therefore, I am glad that I have been answered and in a way provoked again to write, indeed with letters full of duty and fatherly affection. I am also greatly pleased by your most learned letters; indeed, the memory of me has not yet been erased from your mind, which nothing can be more pleasing to me. For after reading your letters, wherever I turned, I felt the traces of your love towards me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I love your goodwill and give you immortal thanks and will do so as long as I live; for I cannot affirm that I will be able to repay you.</p>
      <p>For the fact that you wrote to me with such an open heart and raised my spirit from lethargy with your excellent exhortations, I can neither fail to praise nor forget. For when I recall them to memory, I am accustomed to perform my duties more eagerly; as if you have spurred a horse. Therefore, I do not seem to be able to respond to your great services, unless perhaps, as you have most gravely and eloquently written, you will consider that I am repaying your kindness when I keep your exhortations in memory.</p>
      <p>You indeed speak and advise beautifully, that we should begin with the fear of God above all; for those who direct their studies and all actions to this standard as to a rule, can hardly fall. Another thing that should not be omitted in silence is that we must avoid one thing: that while the opportunity is offered to us, we do not waste time on trifles and disappoint the opinion our parents have conceived of us, so that we think we are placed in a position where it is necessary either to perform the play with the highest praise or to be exhausted with the greatest disgrace.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will strive to especially satisfy the honor of my homeland and republic, and then to meet the expectations of my parents. Farewell and love me as you have begun. January 17, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your most observant son in Christ, Nikolaus Dluski, Pole. To the most illustrious lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich, lord and father in Christ to be observed. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
