    <p xml:id="regest1">The dispute of the Reformed Rheintal pastors with the priest [Sigmund Wäch] of Berneck, who insulted the Reformed and their faith, should - after consultation with Vadian and others - be brought before the Diet, as the courts of the abbot are biased and the pastors feel unfairly treated by the bailiff [Konrad Hässi]; requests to inform [Johannes] Haab. Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg intended to travel to King [Ferdinand], but instead set off to [Lauenburg], to Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse]; Jörg von Hewen, who was supposed to accompany him to the king, stayed at home. A murderer, who was executed in Rorschach, professed Christ until his death. Greetings.</p>

      <p>My lord, beloved brother, you will understand from my lord mayor of Wädenswil's letter and report to you, etc., concerning a long-standing legal dispute, which all the preachers in the Rheintal have legally pursued against a mass priest, now in Berneck in the Rheintal, who is notoriously offensive. In short, he has insulted, not only them, but all those who believe or hold as we do, calling them rogues, heretics, and scoundrels. This has been legally brought against him through acquaintances and has dragged on for a long time, and all the preachers, some of whom have children born in the land, have had to endure it. And as often as they sought comfort against the mass priest, he has been supported by someone; therefore, one longer than the other, as all this will be clearly found in letters at the Diet in Baden, as I suspect. Furthermore, the other courts, where the case was conducted, belong to the lords of St. Gallen. Regardless, the abbot has given the mass priest assistance in the legal matter from his officials. How to account for this, you may judge. Now, at last, the matter is before the high court, and the preachers intend to follow the judgment and have asked the current bailiff of Glarus for his response, also reminding him to take the mass priest in the same manner as they do in comfort, so that he does not flee from justice, which is feared. In short, it has not yet happened. So now, as one suspects, the priest and those who help him may perhaps intend and feel that they do not want the matter to come to Baden, the bailiff has approached the preachers, saying there are many pious people who intend to handle the matter amicably, etc. To this, the preachers have given my lord doctor and others' advice. It seems to them and others not to act in any way, but to send one of them to the Diet in Baden; for it does not only concern them, it may also touch the honor of Zurich, Bern, Glarus, Appenzell, and others of this faith, who may perhaps also involve themselves against the priest, or as you think. Also, that the abbot's assistance should be seriously presented to the bailiff and him through Master Haab and the dishonor and unequal comfort considered intolerable. Therefore, you should seriously inform Master Haab, so that he may bring the matter to Baden and the other preachers of their honor, also to prevent great harm, so that others may fear, as you well know, etc.</p>
      <p>Further, today I have read a letter from someone, stating that the Duke of Württemberg has prepared with 200 horses to the king, but for reasons refrained. Especially, he is certainly with 100 horses to the Landgrave. Many princes are coming together, etc. It is something, whether it meets the king in Münster or down there, I do not know. But also, Lord Jörg von Hewen is at home, who was supposed to be with him to the king with 6 horses. Also, the murderer, as I hear, was executed in Rorschach, confessed his sins in great torment and loudly proclaimed that he died in faith, that Christ, the Son of God, died for him and washed him with his blood from his sins.</p>
      <p>Greetings to both of us, your entire household.</p>
      <p>In haste. Acted in St. Gallen, Friday after Urbanus in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your obliged, willing Hans Vogler of St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>To my especially beloved lord and friend, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to hand.</p>
