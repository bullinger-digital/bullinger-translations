      <p>Greetings in the Lord. The books you wanted are not available; but after the Strasbourg fair, you will receive them; however, I will send Celius' booklet shortly with a list of books.</p>
      <p>A certain Spaniard recently brought a dog from the Netherlands, which gave birth in one litter to two wolves and two dogs simultaneously; I saw the dog with the monstrous litter at our public inn in Stork. The servant will take the dogs to Spain. The Emperor headed to Ghent; he regained his former health on the wooden leg; now, what he has consulted so far, he will bring to an end. Ferdinand's delegation stayed overnight with us to examine witnesses in Ensisheim against Duke Ulrich of WÃ¼rttemberg.</p>
      <p>I would like to kindly ask you to help me with the third volume of Zwingli; I have spoken with Lord Christoph; he is willing to make this whole for me. I already have the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah, so he should send me the first pages, and what is printed at the front and back, as he promised me; because he says he still has it in defect. Afterwards, I would also like to have the first pages in the fourth volume, which I already have, namely in the Gospels and Pauline Epistles. What I would owe Christoph for this, I will send him kindly, so that I do not have to incur any more costs; for through your generosity I have obtained the first two volumes, and since the fourth is almost complete for me except for a few pages, you might remind him, so that I can obtain these pages; for it will not harm him and will benefit me. You can inform Lord Christoph of this through a servant, who will take care of it well, I know.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May 28, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>The news I wrote to Lord Theodor, he will undoubtedly share with you, which you can ask him for. Take care of your health and in some way set a limit to your studies, so that you may serve the church for a long time.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious theologian Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, his perpetual lord to be honored.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
