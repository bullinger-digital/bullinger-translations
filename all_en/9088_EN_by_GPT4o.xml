      <p>S. D. Eight days ago I wrote nothing for no other reason than that a certain discharge from the right side of my head settled in my teeth and tormented me very much. Besides, I had nothing worth mentioning, as I do not now. I write, however, so that you may know that I have somewhat recovered. From France, nothing favorable is reported; there is famine. There are those who regret the most heinous crime, but too late; they see that they have stained the entire kingdom with cruel treachery and treacherous cruelty. Among the papists, the most honorable are indignant at the inexcusable crime; yet you will find those for whom enough has not yet been done, those who think that all who refuse to kiss the pope's feet should be eradicated. From the Netherlands, we hear that Count William of Orange, at the persuasion of the French who were with him in the siege, surrendered; he complains bitterly that he was shamefully imposed upon by the French king. Certainly, the French, who are said to have been the authors of his surrender, were cut down when they reached the borders, and indeed by the Guises, if what is reported is true, awaiting their arrival. The prince has gone into winter quarters.</p>
      <p>His troops are said to be dispersing, while the troops of Alba are said to be increasing in a remarkable way and recapturing cities that had previously surrendered to the prince. Many of the German princes are taking every care to ensure that nothing is taken away from the Spanish tyranny, evidently so that they themselves may finally be overwhelmed and miserably harassed in recompense for their iniquity. From Bern, it is written to me that the Roman pontiff has requested a fairly large sum of money from the Bishop of Sion for the execution of the council (see what the beast is plotting); the bishop replied that he did not dare to contribute anything without the consent of the people; but the people are most indignant at what he demands and do not want anything to be contributed. Note: May the Bishop of Chur do the same if anything is requested of him. But will we bind a rod to our own backs? - I suppose it may be much talked about among you that my lords inspected the armor of some of their people. But it is thus: it was indeed commanded to many that they be armed with armor and weapons, in case something should happen, that they might be prepared; yet no one had their armor inspected except in the county of Kyburg; for they are to swear allegiance to the new bailiff, Junker Hans Lux von Escher. There the people were summoned to four places to take the oath and obedience, and at the same time to come with weapons and armor. This happened over four days, from Monday to today, at Kloten, Altdorf, Oberwinterthur, and MÃ¤rstetten, and there were found to be between 5000 and 6000 ready, well-armed men, obedient, willing people, more than half of whom were not expected. May God grant peace, that we may not need the weapons, and that we may rely on God's strength and not much else. The Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and family, the honorable councilors, Pontisella, Bonet, Campell, Gregor, Victor, and all our acquaintances in order.</p>
      <p>Zurich, the last day of October 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, faithful pastor of the Church of Chur, my lord and honored and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>To Tobias Egli, preacher in Chur.</p>
