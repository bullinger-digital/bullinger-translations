      <p>S. We have been experiencing continuous rain for several days now, and therefore, as I was writing this, I was uncertain whether any of our people would set out; nevertheless, I wrote to at least excuse myself to you; for I feared that I might appear more negligent since I returned from Zürich. However, I wrote 14 days ago and I doubt whether they have been delivered to you; I would not want them to be intercepted, especially since most of them are in German and about Swiss matters. But why, my dear father, do you write nothing at all? Are you well, and is everything in order with you, or, as I fear and would not wish, is it otherwise? Certainly, there was a persistent rumor here, which lasted for several days, that the Bernese garrison was cut down by the Savoyard in some pass (in der Cluß). The author of this rumor was Jodocus Tschudi; but it turned out to be false. Meanwhile, there was a great rush to me of people eagerly inquiring whether I had any certain news from you; but since I returned, not a letter from you or my family. On the eighth of June, Marx Sittig von Unterems, the nephew of the bishop, passed through here (returning from Rome); the pope, along with two other brothers, Hannibal and Gabriel, has made him a count, and now sends him to Ferdinand to name the place of the coronation; this is supposed to be Bologna. And when our people, some of whom are related by marriage, understood this, everything is supposed to be put into action within two months (yes, if it doesn't rain on the parade). To this nephew of his, Marx Sittig, he promised to send a cardinal's hat to the emperor's court; therefore, he and his people have boasted much about it here, also saying much about how the papal holiness will use all possible diligence to bring the Christian church to unity. This new cardinal has long been a man of war; he is said to be a man of remarkable impurity.</p>
      <p>When he was supposed to mount his horse in our square and step out of the inn, and the horses were not properly equipped (for they had ridden hired horses), he said openly to one of the Stadions, his cousin, who was with him in Rome: "May God's thousand sacraments shame you; how well you have managed the matter. I should stick the sword in you" etc.</p>
      <p>These things were told to me by Georgius Carlin and the one from Marmels, who heard them; for they are related to them etc. Oh, the holy father, he has more sacraments than his mother, the church.</p>
      <p>Those coming from Venice say for certain that the Turk has unexpectedly landed with an armada in Africa and taken 28 cargo ships and 25 triremes from Philip, and is said to have brought many thousands of people there, among them some notable captains etc. If this is true, as it is firmly asserted, Savoy will be occupied with other matters etc. These few things in haste.</p>
      <p>I will write to my father-in-law, Mr. Collin, in 8 days, when I am freed from these disturbances of our synod and market. Farewell, reverend father, with all your people, for as long and as happily as possible.</p>
      <p>Chur, 10th of June, in the year of our Lord 1560.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church in Zürich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
