      <p> S. From Italy, we have no certain news, except that it is rumored that the Venetians are proceeding vigorously against the Turks, who have lost their primary pasha, their kinsman, and first leader by their side, to death, and that they have begun to lose some of their fervor due to this considerable dismay. - Since we hear that the bookseller is held by Froschauer's debt, we will carefully ensure that if he suffers any misfortune with foreign goods, he does not incur any loss, and it is not necessary for Mr. Froschauer to be very concerned; for the wife of the poor and ruined man is so greedy and devoted to all merchandise that if they have accumulated any foreign debt, they will easily pay it off. However, nothing has been finally settled with him yet because of the upcoming Pentecost festival, which they wanted to remain free and quiet; but they have recently been warned by the bailiffs to prepare themselves for tomorrow and not to be seen by anyone further, or they will face imprisonment and all disgrace. The butcher, who is of the same misery as the bookseller and has almost stubbornly professed Anabaptism for a century, openly declares: he will neither listen to our sermons nor even change his place at the command of the magistrate; he wants to await the utmost and would rather be led to prison and beheaded than obey. Without a doubt, the bookseller also harbors this mindset and even professes with words that it will not be grievous for him, even if his head is removed; for he will attain something far more glorious in eternal life. Thus, they are obstinate. But no one intends to endanger their lives; they would rather endure any loss, as long as they confirm their disciples in their obstinacy. But I know this: unless they sincerely promise correction tomorrow and attend sermons, they will face severe exile, whether they like it or not. In the meantime, we will always remember Mr. Froschauer and will not allow him to suffer the loss of a single penny here. </p>
      <p> Farewell, most esteemed father and brightest light of our age, together with all yours and your most renowned church and school, and with Erni, who is most dear to me. </p>
      <p> Mr. Consul, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Carolus, who expresses great gratitude for your kindness, Mr. Gantner, Mr. Bonettus, Mr. Campellus, whose letter I received the day before yesterday, all send their regards to you. </p>
      <p> Your most devoted and submissive Tobias Egli. </p>
      <p> Chur, May 15, 1570. </p>
      <p> I believe you know that a military draft was recently held in the County of Tyrol; however, they have led away a legion, namely against the rebellious Beticos. What the splendid imperial delegation and the response of the Protestants from the Pope, with whom they wanted to discuss exclusively, have received, is unknown to us. </p>
      <p> For the Pope pretended to be ill and opposed them with 9 cardinals, whom they refused to accept, and unless he himself provides a benevolent hearing for the execution of the imperial mandates, they will depart; but this matter will not end well for them. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the primary and most illustrious and faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, my singularly revered and esteemed lord. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Pastor in Zurich at the Great Minster. </p>
