    <p xml:id="regest1">In order not to appear as a flatterer, Serin conceals his joy over the letter from Bullinger [No. 2246] handed to him by Wilhelm [Reublin] in Znaim, to which the [“Orthodox Confession of the Church of Zurich”] was attached. Through [Reublin], who can report everything further, Serin now does not want to miss the opportunity to at least send a written greeting, so that the people of Zurich do not think he is upset because of their writings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [P.S.:] Should Bullinger have time to send a letter with [Reublin], Serin would be pleased.</p>

      <p>Greetings, most beloved brother in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior. Wilhelm from Znaim presented me with your letter along with the most welcome booklet. I will not say how eagerly I awaited all of these things, and with what joy and exultation I received and cherished them, lest I appear to flatter. And this much I was allowed and indeed obliged to write now, so that I do not seem so offended or upset by your writings, dear brothers, that I would disdain to greet you fraternally through a convenient messenger in the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As for my affairs, Wilhelm will be able to tell you. Farewell most excellently, my dear Bullinger, along with all your fellow ministers and the whole church, and commend me to the Lord Jesus in your prayers.</p>

      <p>If you have time to reply, it would be most welcome; but let it be done through this same messenger.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the Church of Zurich, beloved and esteemed brother in Christ.</p>
