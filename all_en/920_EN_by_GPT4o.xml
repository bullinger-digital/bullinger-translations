      <p>When you so wished, most holy man, that I should write to you what I think about your dispute with the most learned Mr. Calvin, I do as you commanded. Although the things you sent me on this subject were delivered to me later (namely, those sent a year ago I have only now received: which indeed happened because of my constant travels throughout this year), yet, since I can deny you nothing when you command, who can command me everything by your right over me, behold, you have my opinion on the same subject: although I fear that I may seem not only to have added nothing to your last response, but also to have taken something away from it through my own infancy. However, I rejoice greatly, and I congratulate the church of Christ in a greater way, that you have progressed so far in your dispute.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant this finally through His ineffable mercy, that under this dispersion of the churches we may all unanimously teach everything for its pacification. Amen.</p>
      <p>To 1. No pious person in the church of Christ has ever denied that sacraments are beneficial to salvation: but whence they have that power and what their power is, this indeed seems to have been controversial among many until now. We therefore teach that they are effective because they are institutions of Christ, to which the Holy Spirit, otherwise a perpetual witness and glorifier of the doctrine and institutions of Christ, cannot but always be present, and does not allow them to be vain and idle in His church. But just as the external symbols in the sacraments, when they come into our senses, figure and shadow forth and as it were place before our eyes their mysteries, namely the communion of His body and blood with the Lord Christ long since granted to us, so also the Holy Spirit, assisting our ministry, strengthens the minds of the pious in the faith of the same mysteries, and as it were seals them with a certain seal, so that what we have long possessed by faith, we may have more firmly in our minds day by day, and also have it as it were sealed by the testimony of the sacraments. Hence we also call the sacraments with Paul the seals of the righteousness of faith, that is, of our gratuitous acceptance into the grace of God for Christ's sake, which must be apprehended by faith. Not that the sacraments themselves by themselves seal our minds in the faith of that very righteousness of ours, but that in their legitimate use, by the Holy Spirit assisting our ministry, our minds are sealed in the faith of the righteousness granted to us gratuitously. Therefore, because of this perpetual presence of the Holy Spirit in the ministry of the sacraments, we undoubtedly acknowledge in the administration of the sacraments the sacramental union of the symbols with the mysteries for the salvation of all the faithful. We say further that the power of the sacraments is such according to Paul, that they are not only external symbols of our righteousness in Christ, but that they are also internal seals in our minds, and indeed effective for the salvation of the church of Christ, in the same way that the gospel is called by Paul the power of God for salvation.</p>
      <p>To 2. We do not willingly say that something is offered, exhibited, and given by the sacraments themselves, although we do not deny that it can be said in a certain way: especially since we see that contentions about the efficacy of the sacraments have almost arisen and are still growing from such expressions. If we had a contest with those who denied that the sacraments are effective signs of divine grace towards us in Christ, it might not be inappropriate to speak of the sacraments in this way with a true explanation added. Now, since the aim is not to nourish contention and thus also superstition by attributing too much to the sacraments, and these forms of speech are usually referred by the unlearned not so much to the work of the Holy Spirit in the ministry of the sacraments as to the external action of the ministers, we prefer to speak of the sacraments in this way, and indeed more plainly as it seems to us, so that we confess that in the legitimate use of the sacraments, by the Holy Spirit as author, we are strengthened, sealed, and further exercised in the faith of those mysteries which are figured, designated, shadowed, represented, and as it were placed before our eyes by the symbols of the sacraments, that is, by their external ceremony. For even those things which we did not have before are said to be offered, exhibited, and given. Since this cannot truly be attributed to the sacraments, we think it safer to abstain from such expressions in this particular controversy. However, we know and confess that the righteousness granted to us in Christ, that is, our adoption as children of God, the remission of sins, the restoration of eternal life, and other such things are eternal, and cannot cease unless we ourselves drive them away by our own impiety, and therefore they are always perpetuated in us, and thus finally also perpetually offered, exhibited, and given to us, most significantly in the use of the sacraments. Yet we do not say that they are therefore offered, exhibited, and given by the sacraments themselves, that is, by the mystical action itself: but that by the Holy Spirit as author we are strengthened and sealed in their undoubted faith in the very institution of Christ, except that Scripture often attributes to our ministry what is the proper work of the Holy Spirit, so that it may proclaim and commend to us His presence and divine power always assisting in our ministry.</p>
      <p>To 3. Since there is nothing controversial here, there is no reason to add anything here, and what has already been said has sufficiently explained the whole matter.</p>
      <p>To 4. The response taken from Augustine is pleasing in every way, nor does the comparison of ministers with signs seem entirely appropriate. For ministers are co-workers of Christ according to function: inanimate signs are not, unless we transfer what belongs to ministers to the signs themselves. But even Scripture itself, which teaches that God acts through ministers somewhere, elsewhere explains it more clearly with the added particle: as if God were beseeching you through us (1 Cor. 5). Indeed, it shows that God Himself acts in us by Himself, but so united with us in our ministry, that what He otherwise acts by Himself by His divine power, He is said to do as if through us united with our ministry.</p>
      <p>To 5 and 6. Nor do I think anything needs to be added to your response here.</p>
      <p>To 7. And here in every way the last response is pleasing. It is more correct to say now that God acts through His signs, than it was formerly said that the signs themselves exhibit by signifying. For what does the sign itself exhibit? since the exhibition itself does not allow the sign to be in any way, which contains the power of exhibiting the things themselves designated.</p>
      <p>The observation of the ends for which something is established or instituted is also pleasing: so that we may consider the distinct orders of things and not estimate dissimilar things from dissimilar things. For we see that the argument does not proceed: Among inanimate things the sun nourishes the earth, bread sustains man in life, therefore the sacraments also perform the same in their kind. But we understand that it is enough if we do not take away from the sacraments that for which we know they were instituted, namely shadowing, representation, and sealing, just as we know the sun was established to nourish the earth, and bread to sustain our life here.</p>
      <p>To 8. Since everything agrees here, there is nothing to add.</p>
      <p>To 9. I do not labor whether "at the same time" and "similarly" mean the same thing. It is enough that Calvin interprets it this way. But in those Pauline passages, he does not prove that we first die and are buried with Christ in baptism, or put Him on, since they are sacramental expressions. And therefore he does not also make it that we become partakers of grace in the very use of the sacraments. But this doctrine remains, that we are, not become, partakers of grace by the use of the sacraments, and that the sacraments are testimonies that we are, not become, members of Christ. For what becomes, certainly could not have been before: so we also deny that we ourselves were members of Christ before, if we confess that we become His body by the use of the sacraments.</p>
      <p>To 10. Here we join our prayers that we may all follow and uphold that simplicity with one heart and mouth, as they say.</p>
      <p>To 11. Various forms of speaking are to be borne if there is agreement on the matter, and therefore they are also to be embraced in the church, lest the spirit be extinguished: but simpler and clearer ones are always to be preferred to more obscure ones.</p>
      <p>To 12. Calvin urges that we believe Christ, once given for us, is meanwhile offered to us daily as food, so that we may be one with Him. And so he makes two parts of the supper: one, the memory of Christ once given in sacrifice, the other, the daily offering of Him as our food, by which we are inserted into the communion of His body, and He dwells in us. This is how Mr. Calvin, as far as I can understand. And indeed, the memory is confessed by all: but if we acknowledge that the remembrance of the Lord Christ in the supper is the work of the Holy Spirit in us, do we not at the same time include in it also the sealing of our minds in the faith of His benefit, and therefore also His dwelling in us, and thus also the communion of His body? Truly, we cannot remember the death of Christ truly from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit without faith and communion with Him, and therefore not without His dwelling in us, and the saving food of our souls through the communion of His body and blood. Why then should we distinguish memory from communion, and make two parts of the supper?</p>
      <p>Then, when he says that Christ is offered to us daily, we indeed confess that He is perpetually offered to us without any interruption, as far as this gift can never cease, why should we say that the most important part or member of the supper is that eternal, let alone daily, communion with Christ in His body and blood, which unless we have before the use of the supper, we cannot truly partake of the Lord's supper? and not rather say much more simply and clearly, that our minds in the supper, in our eternal and never again to be interrupted communion with Christ in His body, are strengthened and sealed, and that His memory is renewed to us by the constant use of the supper to stir us up to thanksgiving and to declare the duties of our gratitude in the church of Christ? So that I do not now touch on this: whence it is established that the bread and wine in the supper and not rather the action itself, that is, the eating and drinking itself, are the signs of our communion with Christ in His body and blood, about which otherwise there would be a much greater field for speaking.</p>
      <p>To 13. In this place everything agrees between us, except that you say the perception of Christ grows in us with the increase of faith, while Mr. Calvin affirms that we grow and progress in the very communion of Christ by the use of the supper. Here, since the word communion of Christ includes two things in itself, namely both our perception from Christ and Christ's perception from us in turn, I think it should be explained more clearly by you, whether you both equally feel that we grow in the increase of faith, and are increased and progress from both parts of this reception or communion at the same time, or only from one part.</p>
      <p>For as far as the Lord Christ unites Himself to us, and in a way transfers us into Himself so that He is in us, He immediately becomes all in all for His ineffable mercy, and communicates all His things to us fully and perfectly, so that He wants them to be considered and reckoned as entirely ours in the judgment of His Father, without any now either decrements or increments of His union in us, unless we ourselves drive away this benefit of His by our destined impiety. However, as far as He, already united to us, unites us to Himself in turn by our faith through His Holy Spirit, we gladly acknowledge the increments of our communion with Christ from this part, according to the increase of faith and other gifts, and we undoubtedly feel that we grow, are increased, and progress in the perception or communion of the Lord Christ by the legitimate use of the supper.</p>
      <p>To 14, 15, and 16. Nor do I have anything to say here, except what you also bring from that Pauline place in Ephesians 5, namely that, although Paul there says that we are flesh of Christ's flesh and bone of His bones because we draw life from Him, it does not therefore follow that Paul is not speaking there of that bond of Christ with us which we have with Him through His incarnation. For we also draw our life from His incarnation, whoever does not despise His benefit in this part. For in Him our holy flesh of all was made through His incarnation, and therefore we also draw our life from His incarnation. Indeed, since in that place Paul, taking from our mystical bond of marriage with Christ, tries to approve the duties of husbands towards their wives and the observance of wives towards their husbands. But the mystical bond of our marriage with Christ consists in no other thing more than in His incarnation, that is, in a certain betrothal of God with man in our flesh, so that from Him, as from our head joined to us in our flesh, we may draw all life. Indeed, if in any other place, it is certainly to be established that Paul was speaking of the incarnation of the Lord Christ in this most important place. Nor does it matter that the merit of Christ's incarnation can be transferred to all men, since the merit of His death, as far as He died for all and took away the sin of the whole world, can be transferred in the same way, nor does the merit of His death and priesthood pertain to impious despisers more than the merit or bond of the incarnation.</p>
      <p>To 17. What Mr. Calvin professes is entirely pleasing, but we also teach that the Lord's supper is not only a heavenly but also a terrestrial action at the same time.</p>
      <p>Heavenly, as far as it was instituted by the Lord Christ Himself, it includes heavenly mysteries, which being withdrawn there through the Holy Spirit, we enjoy in our hearts to eternal life: terrestrial, however, as far as earthly elements and symbols are applied to it and it consists of human work, even if it was instituted by the Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>To 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. I rejoice beyond what can be said, and I congratulate you for agreeing here, and I myself profess the same and pray to God that He may want us to be unanimous here forever.</p>
      <p>To 23 and 24. Everything is pleasing here too, except that, since not so much our senses as rather our minds are sealed by the use of the sacraments through the Holy Spirit in the faith of the mysteries shadowed by the symbols, we say that the mysteries themselves are designated, represented, and proposed to our senses by the symbols: but we say that the sealing of the mysteries is the internal work of the Holy Spirit in our hearts: and therefore we teach that our hearts are sealed in the faith of the mysteries not outside through the symbols, which otherwise do not reach our heart, but through the Holy Spirit within us, while outside they are designated, shadowed, signified, and as it were placed before our eyes.</p>
      <p>You have, most pious man, in a few words my opinion on your and Mr. Calvin's dispute, and I am very grateful to you for making it available to me. Nor do I doubt that if others also conferred among themselves in this way about all controversies, we would, by the grace of God, reach unanimous agreement on all the heads of doctrine. May the best and greatest God grant us His Holy Spirit, that united by His divine inspiration we may feel and teach the same in the Lord, to the praise and glory of His most holy name and the pacification of the church, now otherwise disturbed. Amen.</p>
