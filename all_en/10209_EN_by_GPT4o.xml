      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>In every way, make an effort to calm the spirits of your people. For they are currently too easily provoked. By ignoring, the most serious fires are extinguished. And if it can be done in any way, ensure that the magistrates, in the public name, either through letters or, as we would prefer, through some wise citizen, request the assistance of our people, who could similarly be sent from here to Hesse. In this way, you could secure the strongest support.</p>
      <p>Farewell and give many greetings to all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
