      <p>Greetings. We have received, honorable lords and dearest brothers, through a certain messenger from France, that great disturbances have been stirred up by the Guise faction (with the help of some conspired magnates in France, especially cardinals, bishops, and the clergy) and that extreme cruelty is being exercised daily against the faithful. To help you understand everything more clearly, I am sending what I have received from Orléans, where the army of the faithful is gathered, to be shared with you dear brothers. First, you have a brief description of the abominable cruelty of the Guise faction, which they have exercised against the church of Vassy; from this, you can gather what plans these men have conceived against all the faithful churches throughout France. Then I am sending the protestation of the most illustrious Prince Louis, Duke of Bourbon, who is Prince of Condé, published and printed in the French language, but here translated into German by Mr. Georg Cellarius at the command of the most honorable magistrate of this city, who has the French original. Therefore, there is nothing in it that should be suspect to you. From it, you will understand the whole matter, and that our people are not seditious against the king, but are trying to bring the conspirators and seditious ones against the king into order, to free the king and restore peace to the kingdom, etc. I have also attached a letter from Mr. Beza; for he wished that I would share it with the brothers in Basel, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, and the Rhaetians. You see what needs to be done, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>You must cry out diligently and without ceasing to the Lord, and exhort the church to supplication.</p>
      <p>Our faith entrusted to the church must also be strengthened; for if the papists prevail in France, driven by nefarious deeds, they will threaten us as well. But our papists are no milder than those, and there is no doubt that the council of Trent was begun for no other purpose than to provide plausible pretexts, at least among the common people, for the most cruel persecution, which they have been fabricating for several years now. Would that we might truly meet the Lord with repentance and faith, for He is merciful to forgive the sins of the penitent and powerful to save His own.</p>
      <p>Farewell in this, honorable lords and dearest brothers. Zurich, April 23, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>4000 Swiss are requested, and therefore a diet is convened at Solothurn on April 26.</p>
      <p>To the faithful servants of Christ Jesus, the ministers of the church of Chur and the other churches of Rhaetia, his honorable lords and dearest brothers. Chur.</p>
