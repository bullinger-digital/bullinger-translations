      <p>S. D. From your kindness, I received letters, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. The former were written on January 28 and included the acts of the French affairs.</p>
      <p>The latter, bringing very unfortunate news, were delivered by Linerus. I know how overwhelmed you are with labors, and therefore I thank you more for your diligent writing. This inconsistency, levity, and foolishness of theirs reminds us of the divine command: "Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannot save" [Ps 146, 3 (145, 2f Vulg.)]. God, who works these things by His power, wants to perfect strength in weakness, so that all glory may fully return to Him alone. We must pray to Him without ceasing to break the counsel of Ahithophel and to deliver and restore the endangered David. I especially wish to know from you whether he has submitted himself to the Council of Trent and sent envoys from France to the council? For our enemies boast something of this: hence I would like to know something certain. On January 16, they opened the council in Trent, lifting its suspension, and decreed the first session to be held on February 26. It is said that they began this work of theirs with a public supplication. In the supplication, there were about 112 mitres, many indeed horned asses.</p>
      <p>Our allies and neighbors, the five cantons, are said to be sending their delegation there as well. They fully submit themselves to the council.</p>
      <p>I hear that the Hermit Abbot and Amanuensis Lussius Subsylvanus are to be sent. Therefore, we must expect a solemn citation before the Easter festival.</p>
      <p>I do not think there will be any among us who will judge it fair that some should be sent to respond for our religion, etc. I hope you have received my letters which the truly noble man Hartmann von Hallwyl sent to you, in which I explain what some German nobles offer and promise of cavalry and infantry, if the princes of France wish, to gather, etc. Meanwhile, I have received various things from different places, which I thought worth indicating to you, so that through our Beza, if it seems appropriate, you may present them to the princes of France. Although, if the rumor is true, Prince Condé is dead: which I pray to the Lord is false, if true, that He may heal the deadly wound.</p>
      <p>A certain man of no ordinary rank writes from Strasbourg: Prince Guise is expected at the Taverns in Alsace: here will come Prince of Württemberg, and the Count Palatine of Zweibrücken will join him, they will converse with Guise: for so he requested here. Various reasons are reported for this meeting.</p>
      <p>Some think that Guise will request that the Germans do not oppose his efforts and help the heretics in France. For to some German princes, Calvinists and Zwinglians are judged to be heretics no less than Anabaptists. Others think that Guise will implore assistance from these princes so that, as I say, they may interpose themselves as mediators between him and Nemours and the King of France. They add that the Guises promise to gladly embrace the Augsburg Confession.</p>
      <p>Indeed, to disturb all of France.</p>
      <p>I warn you of these things in time: you know what needs to be done now.</p>
      <p>I pity our Beza who is thus stuck in intolerable labors and fights with so many serious adversaries. His health must be diligently entrusted to the Lord with unceasing prayers.</p>
      <p>Greet him in my name.</p>
      <p>It is written from Leipzig that three bishoprics, Magdeburg, Halle, and Merseburg, have voluntarily accepted the gospel and rejected the papacy. Marriage is permitted to the canons, fornication is prohibited: monks and nuns and priests are given a certain prescribed time in which they must either give their names to the gospel or leave. The letters were written around mid-January.</p>
      <p>It is written to me from Marburg on February 1: The King of Denmark has taken several ships loaded with ample wealth from the Hamburgers by force: hence the matter seems to point to a fierce war, in which many may easily be involved.</p>
      <p>Not far from Cologne towards Aachen, soldiers are being recruited for Philip or the Guises. We hear from Italy that the subjects of Count Petiliano have defected to the Prince of Florence.</p>
      <p>With the Pope's consent, he has established a new order of knights (like the Knights of Rhodes), which he calls the Knights of St. Stephen, as they are called the Knights of St. John. And indeed, he has now ordained 200 and sent them to the island of Elba to fight against the Turks. He has also given an annual income of 25,000 ducats. There is also much rumor about the French war, and in Italy, it is affirmed for certain that France will be subdued. This indeed was feared by him who professed to be an obedient son of the Roman Church.</p>
      <p>It is written from Heidelberg on February 12: The Weimar princes have finally expelled Illyricus, Wigand, Judge, Musaeus, and some others, because they understood what these were seeking, and because they disturbed everything with harsh writings. They are said to have migrated to Pomerania to disturb that as well.</p>
      <p>Letters were sent to me from Heidelberg, included with these of mine, along with a book by Tilman Hesshus, a man of brazen face and insane.</p>
      <p>It was requested that I send these to you promptly. I received them yesterday, I send them today. I will also read them when I have finished my response which I give to Brentius, about heaven, the right hand of God, the personal union, and the Lord's Supper. It is being printed and is almost finished.</p>
      <p>I write in Latin and German: You know indeed that he wrote against me in both languages. Therefore, I could not remain silent, although I fight unwillingly.</p>
      <p>Nor did I give him just cause, nor did I write anything against him by name before. He teaches that heaven, the seat of the blessed, and the right hand of God are everywhere, and the body of Christ is everywhere, etc. If you wish to respond to Hesshus, I beg you to respond briefly and clearly and to the point, ignoring his person and disregarding his insults. But what does a pig know of Minerva? etc.</p>
      <p>I do not think Castellio should be appointed to the school in Lausanne. For when I heard something of this, I seriously warned friends to beware of this man. I know that Haller also resists with hands and feet.</p>
      <p>A synod was called in Bern, but again postponed due to those disturbances and other reasons. They are trying to consult well on other matters.</p>
      <p>I will write to you more fully about this matter at another time when there is more leisure. For this matter, your faithful work will also be needed.</p>
      <p>It is strange that Coignet has been absent for so long. I truly fear lest it be done by art and with malicious intent.</p>
      <p>But let us commit all these things to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I beg you, my brother, to promptly indicate whether mine have been delivered to you, and if you have anything worth mentioning from France, add it, but especially indicate whether the kingdom of France has sent envoys to the council. Farewell.</p>
      <p>May the Lord eternally preserve you and yours.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you. Greet all friends and brothers.</p>
      <p>Most hastily.</p>
      <p>Zurich. February 20, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Geneva.</p>
