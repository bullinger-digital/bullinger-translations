      <p>Greetings. Recently, I received a letter from Augsburg stating that Herr Nikolaus von Gravel, the chief counselor of His Imperial Majesty in Augsburg, where he also had his wife and child, has died and was taken to Besan√ßon in Burgundy on the 30th of August. There is great joy and sorrow everywhere. May God soon help many people with grace! He was a powerful man and the emperor himself. Keep me in your prayers. Dated the 12th of September, 1550.</p>

      <p>Regarding the former governor in Thurgau, it is said that he is imprisoned in Lucerne; let me know through Jeronimo; he is coming back today.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
