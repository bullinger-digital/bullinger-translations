      <p>News that has been written as certain at the Margrave's court: From France, it is certain how peace has been made, but with what conditions, there are various claims; however, these are supposed to be the main points: Firstly, the old queen regent shall remain in France until the king comes of age. The Prince of Condé has been released and has become the highest governor in France instead of the King of Navarre, likewise, the constable has also been released and remains constable, and after his death, his son, the Lord of Montmorency, shall take his place, and he has also become the grand master in France instead of the Duke of Guise. The admiral remains in his office, the Lord of Andelot has been appointed as the highest marshal over all foot soldiers, and otherwise, all lords remain in their previous offices. The king shall pay the Condé's German riders and soldiers, those who were not against him but in his service; however, nothing is said about their departure. The Spaniards, who were on the side of the Duke of Guise, have been praised; the Castilians, who were with Condé, numbering five thousand, have been sent to Metz for the garrison. As for religion, in the cities that Condé now holds, which are few, the gospel shall be freely preached; in other cities, however, it shall not be allowed, especially where the parliaments are. Yet, they may build churches at their own expense in these suburbs, and they shall not be hindered, and the papists shall be left undisturbed and peaceful in their churches. Everyone is satisfied and content with this peace, except those in Paris, who would still like to resist it, etc. The nobleman who shot the Duke of Guise was torn apart by four horses in Paris, and when asked before his death why he did such a thing, he insisted that no one commanded him to do it, but he did it out of Christian zeal because he saw that the Duke of Guise was persecuting Christians so much and that this ruinous war was the sole cause and that France could not come to peace during his lifetime; therefore, he did not regret it, and if he had not done it, he would still do it if he could, for he had done a good deed, as then evidently after his death the peace followed, which would not have happened during his lifetime; otherwise, the war would have just begun, as the Pope and Spain had intended to provide him with substantial help and, conversely, England had agreed to help Condé; he would also not have been abandoned by some German princes, as a large number of riders had already been recruited, etc. And now one expects nothing else but a good peace in Germany and France. There has been much and various talk of war here for some time; many lords and young lords have also equipped themselves at great expense; but all this has been completely calmed and extinguished again by the death of the Duke of Guise and the subsequent peace in France, which the riders and landsknechts are very dissatisfied with. In Italy and Rome, there is also much and various discord not only between the Pope and cardinals but also between secular potentates and rulers. Likewise, at the Council of Trent, there is also great discord between the Spanish and Italian bishops concerning the Pope's supremacy; for the Spanish do not hold him in such high regard and want to let the council be above him as the Italians do, which is why there was a great commotion among their servants in Trent on the 11th of March, so that twelve of them were killed and 50 were seriously wounded, and the bishops are so afraid that they do not dare to leave their houses; some say they do it so that they do not have to go to school so much. The Roman imperial majesty is said to have written thereupon that all necessary arrangements should be made with the guardian and in other ways. The Queen of England has recently offered the admiral 200,000 pounds as aid, which the parliament and estates in England have reluctantly approved, and the estates have, in turn, urged her most vehemently to declare a future successor and heir, which she, however, does not want to do at all, and it is believed that if it came to a negotiation because of this, most and most significant votes in the estates in England would fall on the Queen of Scotland. Regarding religion, an edict was passed at the last diet: whoever does not recognize the queen as the supreme head in England in spiritual and secular matters and otherwise adheres to the papal religion shall for the first time forfeit all his movable property and his immovable goods shall go to his heirs, provided they adhere to the gospel. Otherwise, three or four lords in England are said to have been imprisoned, who have had various dealings with the Duke of Guise; with them, it is believed, justice will be done shortly. It is also written from England that the parliament is still in session, and they do not want to return Le Havre to France unless the French give them Calais back, etc. From Poland comes certain news that the Muscovite is advancing with several hundred thousand against the King of Poland; he is said to have already captured a powerful city called Polotsk in the seventh storm with great damage to himself, where he has tyrannized cruelly, which is not to be written about, and has taken away 20,000 people; his desire is to become king after the current king, who has no heirs, and it is to be feared that he will succeed. There is certain news that the Elector, Count Palatine Duke Friedrich, has died, as their electoral grace intends to travel to the Upper Palatinate and reform the churches there concerning the sacrament and some other external ceremonies. As their electoral grace was on the way with over 300 horses and wanted to race with their horse, it fell and dragged the elector, so that he died immediately afterward. Many people interpret it badly and say it happened to him as a warning and punishment from God because he had accepted this heretical and Zwinglian opinion in the sacrament. May God forgive him and them! In the land of Saxony, the Duke of Brunswick and the Count of Altenburg are said to have entered into an armament, also the King of Denmark and the Duke of Holstein against the King of Sweden. Whether this is so and what will come of it, time will tell.</p>
