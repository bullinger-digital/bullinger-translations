      <p>Greetings. Last winter, I sent you a rather lengthy letter, in which you were informed about the matters happening here. However, I am very much afraid that it has been lost, as you did not mention a word about it in your letter, which Mr. Hooper received from you three days ago. If that is the case, I am exceedingly sorry. I am even more saddened that your letter to me, sent through Mr. Hales, was lost at sea, as nothing could be more pleasing to me than your letters. However, since it seemed to be the will of the Lord, it must be borne with equanimity.</p>
      <p>In a few weeks, with the Lord's favor, I will be traveling to Gloucester with Mr. Hooper; since he himself asked me to join him, I could not refuse him in this matter. May the Lord grant that I may be useful to him or rather to the church of God with my presence or work. Furthermore, Mr. Johannes a Lasco, who is very devoted to the people of Zurich, is now here with the Archbishop of Canterbury. This man has decided to live here, and has therefore summoned his wife, children, and household from Friesland. I can hardly express how much he is appreciated by the king and the nobles of the kingdom (I speak of the pious), especially by the king himself, who has shown how much he values the man by assigning him an annual pension from his treasury. For this reason, we are certainly filled with great joy; for there is no doubt that he will greatly promote the kingdom of Christ here; his entire effort is currently focused on obtaining a properly established German church in London, where there are many thousands of Germans. Some nobles and councilors have given us some hope here; we have already labored a little in this matter; however, it is uncertain what the outcome will be, although it is more likely that the matter will eventually succeed according to our wishes, which God may grant for the glory of His name. Our Martin Micronius, a great assistant to Mr. Hooper's studies, is to marry a chaste and truly pious girl on the first of July, who left her homeland and parents for the sake of the gospel. I sincerely congratulate him on this treasure in the Lord. He has been preaching among private walls in Flanders since Lent and continues to do so not unsuccessfully.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I commend to you the cause of a certain Valentin Wernemuller, whom we here have freed from chains for the sake of piety, otherwise he would undoubtedly have died for a very small matter. He claims to be from the Wernemuller family; whether this is true, I do not know. But if it is so, please see to it and make an effort that the money we collected here among ourselves to free him is sent back, so that it may be used to support other poor foreigners (of whom a great number are likely to gather here more and more in the future). If there is any hope of restitution, you can entrust the money to Mr. Bricmann, whose faith is as highly regarded by you as it is by me.</p>
      <p>Please greet for me Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Ghesner, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Butler, Mr. Lelius, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Sebastian, Mr. Zwingli, and Mr. Otho.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell, most honorable man and respected teacher in the Lord, to whom I commend your ministry with all my heart and as much zeal as I can.</p>
      <p>You can learn the rest from the one who delivers this. Regarding Valentin, whom I have learned you remembered in Mr. Hooper's letters, you can inquire more diligently. He now says it is the tenth year since he left his homeland, and he says his stepfather is called Felix. Mr. Hooper, by order of the magistrate, is departing tomorrow for Essex, a region of England full of danger, where last summer great tragedies arose, a day's journey from here. He is to preach to them for ten days or more, so that, having heard the word of God, they may return to themselves and be retained in duty. When Mr. Hooper returns, I expect he will immediately take up his bishopric.</p>
      <p>May the Lord God grant that he may administer it successfully and to the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Around Michaelmas, we are to return to parliament with the Lord's favor, which undoubtedly will bring not a little good to the church, as we can conjecture from certain indications; may God, the best and greatest, prevent us from being disappointed in our expectation through our ingratitude. You have a letter from Mr. a Lasco, which no doubt has been pleasing to you; he, overwhelmed by the multitude of affairs, could not send you a letter, but will make up for it later, as he could not now. Again, farewell in the Lord, who may accompany you with your dear and chaste wife and your whole family with His spirit for the sanctification of His name and the edification of His church. Amen.</p>
      <p>London, penultimate of June 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours truly and sincerely, Johannes Utenhovius.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man in both piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant ecclesiast of the people of Zurich.</p>
