      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The Lord afflicts us, as He has for some time now taken away from the council many old, pious, and wise men; now He has also called away Martyr, an incomparable man, from us. He passed away in true faith on the 12th of this month, having been bedridden for only a few days. The deaths of so many men, whose gifts could have greatly benefited the church, disturb me greatly, as I fear it may be led into severe turmoil. If only Mr. Musculus would take on the task of responding to Brentius on behalf of Martyr regarding the issue of personal union and the two natures remaining in Christ. The Council of Trent is proceeding excellently. The Cardinal of Lorraine has arrived there with the prelates of France. They intend to settle the matter, and their plans are astonishing; we do not believe any of it. May God open our eyes. Otherwise, I fear a great downfall, etc. However, those from Glarus have been pacified until the day in Baden on January 3rd, to which they have been summoned. Tschudi has been drawn away from them to Rapperswil. Not a good omen.</p>
      <p>I live an unpleasant life; but because it pleases the Lord, I endure it for the Lord's sake. I have served the church for almost 40 years now, as I began in January of the year 1523. I would therefore sincerely wish that the Lord would free me and call me to His kingdom. I would follow His call with the greatest joy. But may the Lord's will be done. Farewell in this.</p>
