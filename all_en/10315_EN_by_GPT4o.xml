    <p xml:id="regest1">The enemies of the Reformation are consistently pursuing their work, while the Reformers, on the other hand, are at a loss. God only helps those who help themselves; this should be taught to the people. In the critical situation of the Reformation in Solothurn, little good can be expected from Zurich, especially if recently even the federal envoy Johannes Haab has spoken in favor of leniency and against "the priests." Request for news.</p>

      <p>Greetings. "If God is for us," as He is for us, "who can be against us?" [Romans 8:31]. This is the good I can write, beyond that, nothing. The world is full of evil plans, not to mention Switzerland. The wicked labor day and night to extinguish all piety. The pious, on the other hand, are at a loss for plans. I do not know what the cause is. This seems to me to be impiety rather than anything else, because God is being tested no differently than if you were to fall into water, where you could swim to emerge, you wait for God to save and pull you out. These things must be taught to the people until they have thoroughly understood the matter. These days, when I ask how the Zurich council is behaving in the Solothurn turmoil, a good, upright man of great authority responds: "I have indeed heard nothing pious, but what should I have heard? Haab, one of the envoys who are now in Solothurn, recently said in Baden: 'Sammir botz etc., they will not judge us immediately because of the priests!'" See, my Bullinger, what wickedness is in people. If he says this, and indeed in front of good men, who is considered very evangelical, what is hidden in others? Is this misery because of us? Are we the cause of the dissension? May the Lord have mercy on us and grant that after we have once learned the greatness of His mercy towards us, the knowledge in us may grow to the perfection of life, until enough has been endured in this world according to His will.</p>
      <p>Farewell. If you have anything, send it back, and briefly. For it is no consolation to me if you take away the letters of good men.</p>
      <p>Basel, November 10, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the very learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, brother in his Lord.</p>
