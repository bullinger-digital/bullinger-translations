      <p>S. I received everything you recently sent through the brother, and I give my utmost thanks to your piety. Meanwhile, we hear that Malta has been lost, though not with certain rumor; thus the Christian princes are vigilant, while they turn their force rather against their own entrails than against those common enemies of the Christian name; therefore, they rightly suffer this scourge of God.</p>
      <p>As for our affairs, you will understand everything from these two, who are sent there to the assembly, which was instituted because of the currency. Mr. Nikolaus von Diesbach is entirely of the French party, so to speak; for he inclines there with all his might, so that the alliance may be accepted. I am glad that on this occasion he is put into your hands, so that you may confer with him about this matter; for I hope that by your authority, which he greatly values, it may be possible to bring him back to the right path and make him understand what evils will follow from it.</p>
      <p>The other, Samuel Telamon, is upright and has not been able to be moved from his purpose by any persuasions or any authority of the others. I commend them to you, but in such a way that they do not learn that I have communicated anything to you.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the matter stands thus, that they are still waiting for an answer from the king, and it is heard (though I do not know if it is so) that the answer is supposed to be ready, and the king accepts all articles as they were prescribed to him; however, the one from Orbais, the legate to Solothurn, does not want to give the answer from him until the Confederates are back home, who have gone there to seal; some of them returned and stayed here overnight. Meanwhile, everyone shouts that the legate is a traitor and I do not know what else. They are thus confused among themselves and see that they are being deceived; yet they cannot guard themselves and enjoy some hope and promise themselves great things. May they be frustrated in this hope! As for the Genevans, about whom I wrote to the brother these days, the matter is temporarily settled, so that it comes to the right. Mayor Krug in Basel is supposed to be the mediator.</p>
      <p>I would not want them to understand that I have communicated anything to you about this; you will hear from them how the whole matter stands. I am glad that Daniel of yours is finally given to us and at the same time this Epitome, whose preparation I remember seeing with you at some time.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord that He may keep you safe for us for a very long time, so that you may have new fruits of your labors from time to time.</p>
      <p>Our Steiger, Amadeus, father-in-law, Musculus, mother, wife, and finally all friends and brothers greet you. Give my regards to all yours in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 13, 1565.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Various writings and messages to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger of blessed memory.</p>
