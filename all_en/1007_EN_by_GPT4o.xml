      <p>I send you this so that you may clearly understand that there is never a cry of "wolf" without something being nearby. From these, you will easily be able to comprehend the present state of these churches and what is soon to come. Let this be the end, and there is nothing to add or subtract from the letters written last week.</p>
      <p>Why should I doubt that you received them, since the bearer was a certain master of ours from Zürich, from whom you learned more certainly whatever else there was, whether about others or about myself, whom I am amazed to be your most devoted and will be forever. If you have any doubt, if you still have any scruple, if you have, let me know and I will remove it. If you do not have, advise the same to your fellow students, so that they may persuade themselves and declare to me as if using their own matter.</p>
      <p>This is all I ask, this is all I request from you, allow it to be granted and show it to be granted, and farewell most happily in the Lord, Wittenberg, August 20, 1550.</p>
      <p>Lelio Sozzini.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and best man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
