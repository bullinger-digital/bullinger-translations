      <p> Greetings. Your advice has been approved by me. For much time would have been consumed in sending letters back and forth, and many would have been more troublesome in a matter still fresh, whom I hope will be fair and compliant. Therefore, I immediately gave the booklet to the printer to be printed. However, unless you provide fault, this haste will not be free from envy. But when your authority intervenes, no one will bother me. Especially among the Bernese brothers, you must insist, unless you want me exposed to the unfavorable speeches of all and eventually to clamor and turmoil. In the Grisons, St. Gall, and Schaffhausen, I suspect you will have no trouble. I fear Sulzer may be held back by the favor of the Saxons. However, there are sufficiently strong reasons that should reconcile that church to us, unless it completely forgets itself. I wrote to all in the same form, of which I send you a single copy, lest any jealousy arise if they happen to communicate among themselves. It is unnecessary to ask you to ensure that the bundles are delivered to each. For I am imposing no burden on you that you have not voluntarily requested. Although the people of Mulhouse are closer to the Baselers, since the pastors of that city are unknown to me, and I had no doubt that a recommendation added by you would be very influential among them, it seemed best to leave this task to you as well. </p>
      <p> The cause of the Locarno brothers has rightly wounded both you and all of us with the most bitter sorrow. First, it was disgraceful for them to be deserted by their patrons, but this is a greater scandal that professors of the gospel endure that associates of the same faith are recalled to a perfidious renunciation in their name. And yet it would have been far better to expose the pious brothers to execution ten times over. For it is a misguided clemency to spare the lives of men while exposing the sacred truth of God to mockery. And they are so shameless of their own disgrace that they almost attempt to break the virtue of others with reproaches. </p>
      <p> Would that I soon hear that they have been repulsed by yours with the severity that is fitting, so that they may finally begin to feel something. For they must be exceedingly dull who are not yet moved by such a scandal. </p>
      <p> I would like to relieve the wretched brothers with some consolation, so that they might understand that we care for them: except that their status is unknown due to the distance of the places, and I do not doubt that you have diligently fulfilled these duties. </p>
      <p> Farewell, most excellent man and brother to be cherished from the heart. May the Lord continue to guide and protect you and your colleagues, bless your holy zeal, so that through you He may triumph over those perfidious Pilates, while they scourge Christ to remove Him from the cross, unjustly marking your dignity with the name of contumacy. Greet your wife, sons-in-law, and daughters at home. Geneva, January 13, 1555. </p>
      <p> Your John Calvin. </p>
      <p> To the man of exceptional piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed and beloved brother in the ministry. </p>
