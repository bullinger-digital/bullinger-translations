      <p>S. At this very moment, as the messenger is about to depart to you, I implore you through Christ not to be angry with me for not writing anything. I recently received your letters along with the booklet and I am very grateful to you. I fully agree with your judgment on these current and very dangerous movements, and my mind entirely foresees the ultimate disaster of our Germany, of which these seem to me to be the beginnings, even if it might be possible for the pious people of this time to breathe a little; for they too will soon be gathered to their fathers. The fact that the best men are continually being transferred from your excellent and learned company is something we should congratulate them on, although it does not happen without serious loss to the churches.</p>
      <p>What you recently sent, on the very day I received it, I entrusted to faithful men to be delivered to Neuchâtel and Lausanne.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing certain here, except what occasionally comes from Basel. There they write at night that four members of the Basel council have been sent to the king to ask him not to destroy Sundgau and Alsace, etc. What they will achieve is unknown.</p>
      <p>Elector Maurice has been summoned by Ferdinand for a conference. May the Lord avert all evil schemes! People are very worried, as strange practices seem to be underway. Adam's child can do much.</p>
      <p>Many monks and priests are fleeing to Basel, where, as they write, they have found a good place.</p>
      <p>But what meanwhile of the most miserable and thrice-lost Constance? We hear that Überlingen is besieged by Albertine soldiers; they affirm that it is already completely occupied. Ulm, they say, wants to defend itself until the emperor comes to help; they have let their land be completely burned; it is thought that they have suffered damage worth eight tons of gold. Oh God, the poor people! But war does not do otherwise.</p>
      <p>The writings of the French, also of Margrave Albert, have reached us, but the official writings of the new allies have not yet arrived.</p>
      <p>It is again generally held that the emperor is dead; for the Augsburg legates, who are nevertheless accepted, have not been able to come to Innsbruck just before the capture of the city of Augsburg; this causes great suspicion among those in Augsburg, etc.</p>
      <p>Nothing special is written from Augsburg, except that now Huberinus and the other two new preachers have given up salt and lard and everything and are now acting as before, wanting to be completely innocent, patching themselves up to stay. You know well what was written to Meuslin. I do not know what kind of Satan has entered the game, as now even the Augustans are contemplating the Saxon church rites anew, by which a great window seems to be opened to me for new and internal dissensions, unless perhaps their ceremonies are now purer than they were before, when they were excessively diluted with intolerable superstitions.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ soon look upon His church with His most present presence and may He receive us, once delivered from these evils, into the most peaceful harbor of the blessed rest.</p>
      <p>Pray for us. Greetings to all brothers and friends, especially your fellow ministers, with Buttler and Mangold, to whom I am not allowed to write even a single word. I commend myself to the pious prayers of all of them. Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother. If only it were possible to discuss the present state of affairs with you for even one hour. Let us urge repentance with indefatigable zeal and effort, without which we cannot hope for any solid victory.</p>
      <p>The papists are undaunted in many places, saying and writing that the setback is not far off; the emperor will soon bleed and tire out both ours and their supporters; when they are settled, he will rekindle the game anew. But they will not succeed any more than we will; for if it is to be achieved in that way, then the ground must be completely out of Germany. Given on May 6. The letter is snatched from the hands.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
