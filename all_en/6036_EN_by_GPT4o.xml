      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father, I return your letters and give thanks, as much as I can.</p>
      <p>I had already read the complete records, as they were sent to the Senate of the Three Leagues. Now I have nothing new.</p>
      <p>When I write to Mr. Martinengo, I will do as you command. Recently, I wrote about the proceedings of our assemblies and I believe everything has already been delivered to you. Gabriel von Ems, the cardinal's brother, rode through here at the last market; among other things, he spoke before some who were present in the company, saying that the Holy Father, the Pope (as he speaks), has again arranged sixty thousand ducats for the Catholic cantons in the Confederation. If this is indeed the case, I hardly believe that they will do anything lenient in the Glarus affair; for they will prolong the matter as much as they can and are able, until they receive the money.</p>
      <p>Not that I think they are serious.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, those who were around the Philippian messenger assured me that they understood from him that the five cantons have sought help from Philipp.</p>
      <p>They did not grant it; for Philipp replied that he could not make friends with the five cantons and find ten against them.</p>
      <p>From this, it can be deduced, if it were so, as it is solemnly affirmed to me by those who claim to have heard it from the envoy (though secretly), among whom is Hercules, that they might perhaps let the milk flow and, whatever they would do further, only do it to make a little ball for the Pope, so that they would receive money, etc. This is sudden.</p>
      <p>Farewell, Reverend Father.</p>
      <p>Chur, February 9, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his always honorable father in Christ.</p>
