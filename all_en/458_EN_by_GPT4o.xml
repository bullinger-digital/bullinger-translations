      <p>Strasbourg, March 12, 1549.</p>
      <p>Greetings and Peace. A truly miserable and tear-worthy matter has presented itself to us in Strasbourg. Bucer, and that man, who is both more eloquent and, in my judgment, more solidly learned, Paulus Fagius, have been removed from their duties as preachers by the authority of the magistrate, and will be forced to leave the city unless they wish to be handed over to the Emperor.</p>
      <p>We still have the remaining preachers, and nothing has changed, except that we are compelled to eat fish during this Lent, and on Fridays and Saturdays throughout the entire year. The bishop is expected daily, and whatever changes he makes, you will learn through my letters. I have already received letters from England, in which there is nothing new. Nothing has been published by decree of the parliament. It is said that the Emperor's son arrived in Heidelberg today, accompanied by Duke Maurice and others. In Saxony, I hear that the Saxons are gravely troubled by being pushed from the Gospel to the Interim. It is rumored that the maritime cities have responded to the Emperor that they cannot accept the Interim. It is said that the King of Denmark, Poland, and some duke, if I am not mistaken, of Silesia, have entered into an alliance with the maritime cities. These are the few things I had to write to you, so that you do not accuse me of forgetting you. Other matters call me away, and do not allow me to dwell on these any longer. Our Hooper wrote to me that the Swiss have come to an agreement, which I wish were true; but I also wish to know the same from you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours, as you know, John Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, wise Mr. Bullinger, preacher, my kind lord and friend, residing at the Muster in Zurich.</p>
