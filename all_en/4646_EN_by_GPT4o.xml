      <p>Greetings. With your letter written on the 27th of this month, I received and read all the remaining pages with great pleasure. The name of the King of Navarre does not appear now; but it will suffice if they are addressed to the King of Navarre; for there is no more honorable title. Through my brother, I will ensure that what you deem appropriate is done.</p>
      <p>I believe your letters will be most welcome to him and will bring about fruitful results; moreover, you will bind the republic to you with this service. The Bishop of Redon will read it most willingly.</p>
      <p>He writes to me from Vienna on the 8th of this month that the Pope has sent two bulls, one of indulgences or jubilee, which I think you have seen.</p>
      <p>In the other, because the princes were demanding a new proclamation, not a continuation, he used these words: "We proclaim, with all suspension removed." He himself believes there is no reason why we should so greatly insist on a new proclamation, nor why they should refuse it. The Emperor thinks that the words "with all suspension removed" will prevent the Germans from consenting. Of the three papal nuncios who were there at the time, two decided to travel throughout Germany to inform all the princes of the Augsburg Confession and others of the plan. The Emperor did not want the first bull to be carried to Vienna, as it made too explicit a mention of continuation. They fear from the Voivode and Transylvania.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Mantua is to marry the Emperor's daughter. The King wrote to the Genevans not to allow preachers to incite riots in France, but to recall those who might be thinking of stirring up seditions. I sent to the Queen what you once wrote to me about this matter.</p>
      <p>The states are requesting amnesty.</p>
      <p>There are those who request churches where pure preaching and administration of the sacraments can take place and where princely officials are present, so that they may more certainly know how much those who are called evangelicals desire peace and abhor riots. I am waiting to see what will be done about this matter.</p>
      <p>All the pious are in good hope.</p>
      <p>Greet the most honorable council and all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
