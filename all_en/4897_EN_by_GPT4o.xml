      <p>Greetings. Your letters were delivered to me by Paul Altorfer, and as for him, he was already known to us; we wish him well, but he will find it difficult to secure a position with us; however, we will do what we can. At almost the same moment I received your letters, Mr. Coignet also writes to Musculus about that booklet dedicated to Wurstemberger and at the same time sends a copy to him. Your letters soon arrive.</p>
      <p>The brothers thought it should be reported to the senate; for Gribaldo is undoubtedly the author of this confession, indeed blasphemy; for almost the same words are contained in this as in those booklets which he left with us and for which he was forced to recant. That domain, which he has, is located in the Gaiensian prefecture, hence, after he was again granted the use of the Bernese territory, he insinuates himself to this prefect. I know, however, that this dedication will be very serious for the good man if he understands what the book contains; yet I am surprised if he is not warned by his ministers. Perhaps this rascal has found among the ministers as well (as such diseases are wont to spread) those who lend him their ears.</p>
      <p>The senate is very indignant, and I think it will happen that he will be apprehended; for he has not only brought grave infamy upon the prefect, especially since he claims to have written these things by his order, but also casts some stain upon the entire Bernese dominion, where it will be necessary to ensure by all means that it is wiped away. Meanwhile, we hear that Mr. Beza has set out to you, from whom you will learn all about the French affairs. Friends and brothers all, and as many as there are who have the Lord's business at heart, demand and request that, since they hear Mr. Martyr is being sought by the queen mother for a conference as her compatriot, you do not refuse, nor does he refuse, to render such a service to Christ and the church. No one is ignorant of what he can accomplish and how great his learning, authority, and skill in such disputations are. We know he is an old man and now seeks rest; but this labor will be of a few days. Would that he could still triumph over the kingdom of France! How great will this glory be, not only for all of Switzerland, but especially for the church of Zürich? The splendor it has had until now will be small compared to what it would have henceforth. We must also therefore put all our efforts into this work, since it appears that our neighbors and confederates can be tamed in no other way than if France yields to our side. The matter is also without danger; for besides the fact that the French nation is not given to malicious arts, there are princes and the greater part of the nobility who will receive him as an angel, indeed as Christ himself.</p>
      <p>I write this not only from myself but in the name of all the brothers and many other illustrious men. I would write more, but you have already learned everything abundantly from Beza.</p>
      <p>Therefore, farewell.</p>
      <p>Mr. Musculus, my father-in-law, Diesbach, and Steiger greet you in return, to whom I have delivered your letters. Bern, July 27, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
