      <p>Greetings. In my last letter, I omitted something I should not have, but you will forgive my memory and haste for that.</p>
      <p>It seems to me that I did not clearly explain what I meant about the abode of the blessed who are in heaven, as if it could be inferred that I imagine heaven to be everywhere in the manner of the Brentius followers. But that vain opinion never came to my mind, which I have rightly detested and still detest. I only wanted to respond to those who deny that blessed souls, upon leaving their bodies, are received into heaven and enjoy immortal life until the day of resurrection, and indeed, that we should not affirm or inquire anything more than what Scripture has revealed about the state of the dead. However, when it pronounces blessed those who die in Christ, those who imagine a place or receptacle where souls are kept until the last day, apart from the sight of God, whether they rest or sleep, seem to me to diminish or rather overturn that blessedness. In affirming this, I did not wish to proceed further nor did I think of anything else. Meanwhile, I give you the greatest thanks for advising me as a friend and brother, and I ask you again and again to continue doing so in the future. I commend to you from my heart Nicolas Picot, my godfather, to whom I gave this letter to you, who is bringing his son to you.</p>
      <p>Since I presented this same son in holy baptism and pledged on his behalf, some care for him also returns to me. Therefore, please ensure that he understands that my recommendation has had some weight with you. I am very eager to know whether my letters have been delivered to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed man. May the Lord keep you safe for a long time for His church.</p>
      <p>Geneva, May 28, 1570.</p>
      <p>Yours, Nicolas Des Gallars.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, senior minister of the church of Zurich, lord and father in Christ, whom I honor greatly. In Zurich.</p>
