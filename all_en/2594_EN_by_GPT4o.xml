      <p>Greetings. Concerning the Diet of Augsburg, however it may proceed, I am no longer as anxious, since their leader has already shown by his actions that he has prejudged the matter of religion and is against it, so that we can expect nothing but impious schemes. For Ferdinand has expelled all the ministers of the Gospel from Bavaria and has burdened his own people with edicts against sincere piety, which he calls a sect. And now, through his people in Ensisheim, he also harasses Rapoltsweiler because of certain pious exiles from Lorraine who were admitted to hear the preaching of the Gospel in his court and the Christian education of the sons of Lord Heidegg, his nephew. But the Lord is the one who will uncover the masked hypocrisy and will confound it in His own time. Therefore, the princes of Saxony and WÃ¼rttemberg have done rightly (in my judgment) in deciding not to be greatly concerned with the decrees of the council or the deliberations of the colloquy, but to stand firm in the truth of Christ once recognized and to profess that they will endure the utmost for that reason.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman rages against his Trojans in Champagne, where several counselors and distinguished men of the first nobility have been condemned for heresy, and execution is expected as the ultimate punishment. Likewise, four noble law students from Dole were betrayed by their own servant for reading Calvin's books and were condemned, who are known to have confessed Christ fearlessly, especially one from Paris among them, with such remarkable cheerfulness, courage, and skill that even the monks and others were amazed. And because they were famous, the indignation of the rest caused a tumult, who threatened that if their fellow soldiers and brothers were burned, they would ensure that all the monasteries and perhaps the entire city would be set on fire in one night. These things were reported from Montpellier in recent days by letters. Meanwhile, it is said that 100 students have escaped by flight, and many have been thrown into chains, perhaps to be condemned to the galleys.</p>
      <p>About the action of our Calvin in Bern, I have not yet heard what its outcome was; if you have any information, I ask you to let me know.</p>
      <p>They say a collection is being made there in the name of the Locarnese brothers in the city and countryside. I hope we could easily obtain that our people would imitate this example, provided it is clear whether this is done at their request or initiated by the Bernese from Christian compassion. But it would also be useful to know what your people are doing in this matter.</p>
      <p>As for the symbols, my dear Bullinger, I do not think there is such a great diversity of doctrine between us that we cannot preserve Christian brotherhood and unity in the Lord. Nor do I think or speak otherwise than candidly about you, your ministry, and the church. I honor you as a man of God, a distinguished instrument, and a venerable brother without deceit, just as I do Calvin and all the pious and learned. But you will pardon me for being more averse to this controversy, because I seem to have learned from experience that it brings much human filth, with emotions incited and pernicious scandals opened up by that occasion. Therefore, I ask to be granted exemption from that warfare, if it can be done, while in other matters I will refuse neither labor nor danger. But farewell, my dear Bullinger, with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 23, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>My colleagues greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
