      <p>Greetings. Since our Friedrich from Salis is coming there, I do not think it necessary at all to write anything about our affairs and those of Italy; for no one can report better on the details. I had requested the Bible of the version by Judah Leon in the largest format of royal paper sheets, neither stained nor poorly bound. You found it for a friend; I am sending here the price, namely three Rhenish gold coins.</p>
      <p>In these days, our bookseller here will come to you; he will bring me the book, if it cannot be delivered earlier. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe in this world for a long time. Amen.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the last day of January 1558.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours in kindness, Philipp Saluz.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, most honorable lord.</p>
