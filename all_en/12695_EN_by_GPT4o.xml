    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Hallwyl was able to clearly recognize and assess the far-reaching impacts of the current war on the Swiss Confederation from Bullinger's letter [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Recently, there has been no significant attack against the nearby enemy. However, the war effort has been advanced by other means. To harm such a cunning enemy [like Emperor Charles V], one must proceed in various ways.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] For years, the Emperor has used intrigues to estrange the Germans from King [Francis I] of France, in order to rule over Germany like a monarch. This is also evident in the last peace with France [of Cr√©py-en-Laonnois]. Had this not been his goal, he would have behaved differently towards France. And only because he managed to set the Germans and the French against each other, could he dare the current war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] In light of this fact, it is understandable that the [Protestants] are contemplating remedies and initiating negotiations with France against the Emperor. They wrote to France. So far, no response has been received. Even though King [Francis I] has already expressed his goodwill, he apparently is still waiting. Presumably, he wants to first ensure whether the [Four Protestant] places of the Confederation will go to war and whether they would welcome his support. If so, he would certainly be all the more helpful.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It is, of course, clear that the King would not undertake anything for the Germans for the sake of the Gospel, but in his own interest. [For the Protestants], however, it would be good if the King and the Emperor were to quarrel, so that the Emperor would have to divide his forces. Otherwise, he will continue to try unimpeded to wear down the [Protestants] through a prolonged war, especially since his tactics are not based on combat, but on cunning and betrayal. Hallwyl does not need to elaborate further here. Every knowledgeable man knows what he means.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Based on his experience gathered in this war, Hallwyl can confidently assert that the [Four Places] can only escape the imperial tyranny if they take wise measures. The Zurichers and the other authorities [of the Four Cities] have to decide on this. With this letter, Hallwyl has fulfilled his task. Bullinger should inform all those who can be helpful to the cause. Hallwyl can provide further information upon his arrival [in Zurich].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] May the Lord preserve us!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [P.S.:] Apart from constant skirmishes, there is nothing noteworthy to report.</p>

      <p>My good will in advance, dear sir, especially trusted, dear friend. From your letter, I have sufficiently learned how the matters concerning the war are with us, and have thoroughly considered the incidental and detailed causes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Recently, nothing significant has been undertaken against the adversaries (which, however, has advanced this war in other ways). But be it as it may, our utmost necessity against our cruel and cunning enemy requires that we inflict various damages upon him and thwart his plans and undertakings, in which he acts wonderfully and cunningly, destroying and oppressing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Especially, he has practiced (intrigued) and acted for many years, how he moved the Germans to become declared enemies of the King of France. With this, he has removed the only means that always hindered his undertaking of monarchy, which the last peace he made with France sufficiently proves. For if it had not been his intention in the war to take away the trust between the Germans and the French, a different counsel would have been created against France at that time. But he sought this (and succeeded), otherwise, he would never have dared to undertake his current plan.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Since we see that he is strengthened by this, it is appropriate that we consider how to deal with it. Therefore, I do not want to withhold from you my very good opinion that our religious factions should be in constant negotiation with France, to establish some understanding and friendship against the Emperor. And for this reason, some correspondence has been drafted and sent to France. So far, no response has been received. It is interpreted among us that France, like all other potentates, wants to weigh the matter somewhat better, although some very good will is said to have been offered. And it is believed that this is mainly because the King wants to first learn how the places of the Confederation, which should take a more appropriate stance for the sake of the Gospel than he, the King, would adopt. And if he learns that the evangelical cities are seriously burdened with the matter or that, if the King were to engage in understanding with these factions, they would have special favor and will in it, the King would be all the more inclined and willing to all matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Now it is no less important that we know what the King intends; that it is not being handled for the sake of the Gospel, but for his own benefit. No one should be deceived. If we could, with these means, bring the King against the Emperor, it would be well done. One must drive out evil with evil. If this or the like does not happen, that one will also give the Emperor something to deal with in other places and he will be able to keep his power and strength together in one place, it is to be feared to the highest degree, if the Lord does not wonderfully preserve his own, he will wear us down with the length of the war. His wars do not rely on honest deeds, but solely on false cunning and treachery. I do not want to show all the reasons why I am concerned about this and that what is being negotiated with France would bring benefit, good, and advancement. Every sensible person can well assess this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>But believe me all the more, that I have seen and experienced so much of this war, that if good counsel does not happen in these matters, we will not escape all the tyranny of the Emperor. Now, how this can happen and with what means, you and our other lords have enough to report on this themselves. I want to conclude my action with this notification. If you can, to whom you consider good, to be helpful in these matters, report this. If you then require further my report, I will give a more detailed report on my arrival.</p>

      <p>May the Lord God preserve us in all good. Dated Giengen in the field camp, the 29th of October in the 46th year. Yours always willing, Hartmann von Hallwyl.</p>

      <p>At this time, nothing noteworthy worth writing about is happening except for constant skirmishes.</p>
