      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You have refreshed my spirit, believe me, with your most pleasant and pious letters, which I received on the Ides of January; you had sent them to me on the Kalends of December. For when I observe that the same things happen to me that were so impiously inflicted upon our head, Jesus Christ, and the rest of his members, I cannot help but rejoice greatly and for that reason, I resolve my mind, so that I do not doubt that everything will be done excellently with me and that this glorious and honorable task, which the Lord has stirred in me for the praise of His name, will not be completed shortly and successfully.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Christ himself would never have been affixed to the cross, had not the traitor Judas, by the decree of the highest Father, handed him over to the hands of the impious with a kiss, so that the saying might be fulfilled: a man's enemies are the members of his own household. So we too, who are called and are his brothers by his grace, cannot be afflicted by the impious unless the diligent work and deceit of those who sell themselves as our brothers, when they are nothing less than brothers, also contribute. I was previously tormented far more bitterly than I should have been, often contemplating how I endured more severe troubles and dangers from those whom I had regarded as brothers and for whom I had never omitted anything that pertained to their benefit and safety, than from the papists themselves, and I could not alleviate the sickness of my mind in any way, as I could not yet grasp why these things were being inflicted upon me. You finally opened my eyes with a kind of eye salve of your letters, so that I clearly understood that it is God's will to stir up these sycophants, whose venom and wickedness would make my faith, thus tested, more precious, and then they would reveal themselves for what they are, so that they might be recognized and avoided by others.</p>
      <p>See, I beg you, with what blindness of mind the Lord has struck them, that they were not ashamed to utter so many lies against me, indeed against Christ and his gospel, so many execrable blasphemies. All of which you have, as I see, encompassed in two main points: the complaint of the most serene King of England's envoy and the crime of bigamy perpetrated by me.</p>
      <p>Of these, one, because it pertained to a secular matter, it would have been better for me to pass over in silence, content with the testimony of my conscience and the retribution of the divine Father, to whom I had voluntarily referred this entire matter, had not the enemies of Christ taken from it, as it were, a handle for more frequent calumny. I will therefore run through certain things by which I can easily dispel any suspicion you may have conceived about me.</p>
      <p>These wretched informers say that I served the envoy unfaithfully. To which I reply, that either they are such as have stayed in Venice for a long time and have had such dealings both with the envoy and with me, that they could have known both his character and mine at the same time. Then let them tell me, I ask, what reputation the envoy had both among the Venetians and among others before I served him. If they want to tell the truth, they are compelled to affirm that he was plainly unknown, so that one might rather say he was hidden than famous, having obtained the title of envoy when that cause began to be handled through me before the Council of Ten and was finally decreed after many discussions, and the insignia of this dignity were granted to him, as well as the authority to bear arms; for previously he could only have four armed servants with him; eleven were added to him, which is the legitimate number of royal envoys.</p>
      <p>Previously, he was not summoned to public events by the senate like other envoys, nor were new matters communicated to him, as is customary. His house was scarcely frequented by any man of condition; it pleased the Lord that through my work, he became known not so much to Italy, but to Germany, Hungary, and to you yourselves, so that he almost became a refuge for all the faithful. Indeed, if it is permissible to boast in this foolishness of the flesh, I would dare to say that the gospel of Christ spread almost throughout Italy from there, not by the authority or favor of the envoy, who often forbade me the use of these matters, even adding threats, but by the grace of God, who always rendered me indefatigable in executing this task. Those who are with you also know how often the envoy prohibited me from distributing books, which the common people call Lutheran, as a matter ignominious to him. I handled the king's affairs with such care, faith, and diligence, that I seemed more English than Italian, not without harm to piety, and some even blamed me for defending the royal dignity so tenaciously; from this matter, I contracted the utterly hostile hatred of both the French and the papists. In seeking out news, I saw no one more curious than myself; the envoy enjoyed this privilege, that he possessed more certain and recent news than all others. I alone bore the labors, vigils, troubles, and journeys; he remained at home, indulging his inclination and his wife, and above all this, he provided me with a stipend so meager that it scarcely sufficed for a month and a half to support my family.</p>
      <p>For eight years, I lived with him so miserably that I would not wish that condition even upon the enemies of Christ. Finally, I obtained this reward from him, that I was dismissed not without great danger to my life. Those forgers also add that I wrote letters against him both to England and to Padua. I confess that I often complained about this man's obstinacy and harshness towards me in both places, I also confess that I publicly sent letters to the court about new matters, often encouraged and urged to do so by the letters of Lord William Paget, since the envoy did not at all fulfill this duty of writing.</p>
      <p>Because of this matter, when those princes were quite inclined to grant me an annual pension, by which I could live more honorably, he opposed it with all his might. And since I could not hide in Italy, not because of my own, as these sycophants babble, crimes, but because of the gospel, and I intended to withdraw to England with my wife and son, he refused to give me letters of recommendation, which he would have granted even to any unknown person. I remain silent about the other insults with which he impiously affected me to the point of satiety. But if these whisperers have never been to Venice, I wonder with what face, with what conscience they dared to affirm things they are completely ignorant of, and if they heard it from someone, they could be deceived. But you, who are pious, consider with yourself whether these things I did while I was with the envoy are those of a less than faithfully serving mind? I truly confess that I erred in this, that I did not bear this man's obstinacies with the patience, constancy, and equanimity of mind that befits a Christian man; for we ought to serve not only good and modest masters with a willing mind but also the disobedient. I also confess that I often spoke ill of him, not without detriment to his dignity. For which fault and offense I have been struck heavily enough by the Lord; others should not further reopen this wound and add affliction to the afflicted. You have what pertains to the envoy's cause, sufficiently elucidated; if I have said anything rashly, pardon my foolishness, which compels me to wander too much. But since the Lord, by His goodness, has so calmed the bitterness of my heart, that I have not only laid aside any bitterness I may have conceived against the envoy, but I also pity him and earnestly pray to the Lord that He may be as gracious to him as He is to me, there is no need for others to reproach me with his deeds, especially since the matter is not secular, but sacred, not of men, but of God, as I will show below.</p>
      <p>The other matter, because it entirely results in the insult to Christ, the scandal of the gospel, and the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, if I remain silent about it, I will be like them, a liar and reprobate, I will not allow it, lest I reveal to you what it is.</p>
      <p>These lost scoundrels say that I lost all favor with the most illustrious Venetian senate because of bigamy and that this crime is the reason why no place remains for me in Italy, not the gospel of Christ for which I suffer these things.</p>
      <p>They add, to make their lie more easily accepted, that that horrendous monster, another wife, fled from me after breaking into and plundering my chests and repaid me the just reward of my deed, leaving me stripped and naked.</p>
      <p>Good God, into what darkness do we fall, or what crimes do we not dare to commit if we are deprived of your spirit or grace! The devil himself would never have devised this, or if it had come to mind, I would have hoped he would be affected by some shame, although he does not know how to blush, at least he would have noticed that such gross and vain lies would soon come to light. When I first reached Italy, I went to Venice and, postponing all other business, approached the Venetian senate. Where I said many things with the highest commendation of what I had done for them or endured for their sake; I only sought that I might, like others, use and enjoy their citizenship and that I might not suffer any injury or violence because of religion. To this, I added letters of recommendation. I was most welcome to all, so help me God, they ordered me to withdraw a little, intending to consult in the meantime what response they would give me. Summoned shortly after, I received a response to this effect; I will therefore recount it and the words with which their most serene leader addressed me with a very kind countenance, which, whether they are so, I call God to witness upon my soul, before whose tribunal we must stand to give an account, as each one has acted. I will put them in Italian: Messer Baldisara, we have understood your intention and read the letters of those Swiss and Grisons lords and we tell you that if you wish to remain in this our city, where you will be appreciated, honored, and cherished, you must live under our religion. To which I added that I was not without religion and indeed a good and holy one. Then one of the councilors, who was sitting beside the prince, burst into these words: Messer Baldisara, you must go to mass, confess, and communicate once a year and hold the sacraments as we do. I replied that I had not come to give an account of my faith, but to obtain the favor of being able to live safely in Venice. However, I promised to lead a life without complaint concerning myself. Then the most illustrious duke said: We cannot receive you otherwise unless you profess our religion, which is observed everywhere and is called Roman. To which I replied: I cannot do that with a good conscience; I only pray that I may live safely in Venice, submitting my body, if it has done anything wrong, to all punishments. Again they forced me to withdraw, then they ordered me to be summoned and their duke pronounced the final decree in these words: Messer Baldisara, we cannot assure you either for the past or for the future; you know that we have established a magistrate over these matters of religion and given him all power, nor do we wish to diminish it in any way, but to increase it, if they see you walking through the city without any doubt they will call you to account for your faith; if you say something that pleases them, well indeed, otherwise you will have to publicly recant in a pulpit and the second time they will have you as a relapsed and your life will be at stake. Then I said: Therefore it will be better for me to leave than to do these things. Finally, the duke added: Indeed, we urge you to do so.</p>
      <p>And because he said this with a grim look, perhaps with that art, to instill fear and compel me to flee from there sooner. Which I did quite accurately; I immediately boarded a boat heading to Padua, intending to proceed from there to Florence; but fearing that the roads might be closed by the enemies of Christ, because I had stayed in Padua for eight days due to a horse I had left in Friuli, I changed my mind and decided to go to Bergamo and, having taken my wife and son, to bring them with me towards Florence through unfrequented places. But because I did not want to commit myself to the journey without having received letters on this matter from a certain Panciatico, whom our Lelio has long known. In the meantime, I was with a certain Brescian citizen, who was among the other faithful of Christ most intimate with me, together with my wife and son, and since no letters were brought from Florence, I left alone towards Ferrara, to see if I could hide under the protection of that duchess, from whom nothing could be obtained, since her husband, the Duke of Ferrara, was persecuting the pious to death. From there I went to Florence; I met Panciatico, a man otherwise futile, from whom I could obtain nothing good, finally, I approached the prince, who, like others, also has his carnal considerations; finally, he granted me free residence, provided I did not publicly profess the kingdom of Christ. I returned to Brescia after many dangers of travel, expenses, and life; I stayed for some days with the same Brescian citizen named Lord Giovanni Andrea de Ugonibus. With whom, having been for four months at his expense and with his complete hospitality towards me and my family in all things that pertain to Christian hospitality, for he spared no expense or danger for Christ, for whose glory he often endured dire things from the impious, but always with an indefatigable spirit, so that I might not be a further burden to him, I went to a nearby village also in the Brescian countryside, I brought with me my wife and son, who are my delights, I have always had them and still have them as the most faithful companions of my persecution, which whether it is so, this noble and pious man, having pitied my troubles, attests with his letters, to whom whether he can be rightly believed, you will be able to learn from Bishop Vergerio, who is with you if you wish. I have no doubt about my wife; for the Lord has rendered her truly faithful to me, not so much in carnal matters as in spiritual ones, indeed this is the only remaining consolation for me in such bitterness of the cross. I now come to bigamy. I confess that I once had another wife; whom, when I caught in adultery, I dismissed her.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, overcome by the entreaties of the brothers, I took her back again; she fell again; I took her back again and a third time, always she like a dog to its vomit. Finally, by the counsel and authority of many brothers, who publicly discovered her adultery, she was dismissed by me, and since I could not be without a wife to avoid fornication, I married another, with whom I now live, God knows, chastely and modestly. These things were not done by me in corners, but in the midst of the brothers, in the face of the church, using the counsel and authority of many faithful, who very often exhorted me to this, when they saw the fires and flames of my flesh, and among others a certain bishop, who still lies hidden under the papacy, by whose work these second and more than legitimate marriages were contracted. Is bigamy committed in this way? Or what have I done that is foreign to your and other churches of Christ? Far be it from me to commit such a crime as to defile or insult the gospel of Christ, for whose sake I am tormented even to the shedding of blood; indeed, I have used in this matter, as in others, the liberty of the Spirit approved by Christ. Why then do these wicked detractors blame me for what results in the highest praise of God? A viperous race, which sins no less by attributing to flesh and blood what is of the Spirit of God, who adorned me with this cross for His glory against their own conscience, than those Pharisees did who said that Christ cast out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons. Nor has anything yet been detracted from the favor of the Venetian senate; they only wish that I do not dwell in Venice because of religion; they have never said a word to me about bigamy, indeed while the pope's envoy among other things brought up bigamy against me before them, so that I might not be received by them in the name of the Protestants, he was publicly ridiculed.</p>
      <p>If they had wanted to take action against me, they would have publicly proclaimed and condemned me, nor would they have allowed me to remain in these places in any way. Let the impious therefore be silent and cease to blaspheme against God so sharply. He knows, and the faithful rightly know, whether I suffer exile for the gospel or for bigamy, which is false. If there are other weaknesses of the flesh in me, which I freely confess, the Lord does not afflict me because of them, but for the glory of His name. Why do they not rather congratulate me, if they have the Spirit of Christ, that I have made a good confession before the world, and earnestly pray that I may persist in it to the end? But I rightly recognize the cunning of Satan, who would like to drive me to recant under this pretext. For it is certain that if I wanted to become a partaker of the abominations of Babylon, then you would know whether I was expelled from Venice for the gospel or for bigamy. If it were permissible, I would gladly send to you all that has been done with the most illustrious Venetian senate; but it is impossible to know their acts so secret. If these are not enough for you, go ahead with the most illustrious magistrate of your republic, so that he may inquire from the lords of Venice whether I was dismissed by them for religion or another cause, lest I seem to have abused both their favor and your benevolence, as you write. For I am not of such a kind, as you could have known for more than six years, who would so easily squander the grace of God and openly defile the acknowledged truth of life with impropriety in blasphemy of the name of Christ, to whom I give thanks, that in the midst of Babylon, in the very navel of Italy, where the antichrist reigns, He keeps me safe and free from all suspicion, and I hope that in the future He will keep me better, especially aided by your prayers, whom I again and again ask not to lend such easy ears to these informers. You know that charity itself does not think evil, it takes everything in a more benign part; nor is unnecessary suspicion without fault. I am indeed very amazed that Lord Bullinger, whom I know holds me most dear, thinks such things of me, and much more that he said that if Lelio, to whom I will owe, as long as I live, had not been present at our cause, he could easily have been led to believe that those things which were so falsely circulated about me were true.</p>
      <p>Why did you not rather defend the cause of your most devoted friend most vigorously and vindicate his innocence from all calumny? You say you received these things from not trivial men. I do not inquire what kind they are, I wish they understood how important it is to detract from someone's reputation and to unjustly harass the innocent; they are ignorant that God will be the avenger of all these things, I fear they will pay far heavier penalties than I would wish. If Socrates, if Plato, if another Cato, if Paul himself had told me these things about Bullinger, unless I saw with these eyes, I would never believe it, but would sharply defend him. I wish that you would rather strengthen and raise my weakness with the best examples than completely extinguish any lack of spirit in me with these rumors. But I thank you for urging me to the pursuit of innocence; I will take care of it as much as I can; for that should be the mind of a Christian man, to hasten daily to better fruit. I would like these letters to be common to you and the other ministers of this church and to all who have heard these things about me. If they are not enough to dispel this calumny, behold, I am preparing to go to Venice, to gather more certain testimonies for this cause from the brothers.</p>
      <p>If they are less able, then I will leave the judgment to the Lord, who will judge the living and the dead on His day. In the meantime, my conscience will be enough for me.</p>
