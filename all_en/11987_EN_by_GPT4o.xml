    <p xml:id="regest1">Has already reported on the influx of people from Basel to the French troops [No. 1937]; Myconius and Markus [Bertschi] preach against the mercenaries, as does the entirely imperial-minded, hypocritical Jakob [Truckenbrot]. Gast has remained silent about this until now and asks for advice. Others have already reported on the Chamber Court's demand for money from Basel; Emperor [Charles V], whose whereabouts are unknown to Gast, will bring war over Germany; his army is said to suffer from disease and hunger and live off plundering; Gast knows nothing certain about the army of Duke [Henry] of Brunswick[-Wolfenbüttel]. Will search for the [book by Luther desired by Bullinger] at the booksellers. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. I wrote extensively in my last letter about how our citizens, both from the city and the countryside, have rushed into the French military service. But what can be done now, since what is done cannot be undone? Myconius wanted to excommunicate them last Sunday, Markus preaches against them in all his sermons, but only in their absence; Jakob, the pastor of the small town, is entirely imperial-minded and curses them with all evil; if they were present, the hypocrite would not dare to mutter against them.</p>
      <p>So far, I have not mentioned this matter even with a word, as I know it is a lost cause. If only some had been bold enough before they left, so that the citizens would have remained in their duty! I seek your advice here. I know David is praised for sparing the seditious. Now, those who have not yet been touched by the French gold must be consoled.</p>
      <p>You have heard from others what the Chamber Court demands in terms of money from us. A cruel war is escalating. The Emperor will not rest until he has engulfed all of Germany in warlike turmoil. I hear that the majority of soldiers in his army suffer from dysentery, endure hunger, receive no money, and live off plundering. Where the Emperor currently is with his army, I do not know. I cannot say anything certain about the army of Duke Henry of Brunswick until I know more.</p>
      <p>I will diligently search the booksellers' shops to see if Luther's booklet is available. Farewell with your wife and children. Greet D. Theodor and Frisius in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 11, 1544. Yours sincerely, Johannes Gast.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zurich, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
