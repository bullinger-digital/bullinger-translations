      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Bucer has written to me for the third time, urging me not to neglect inviting you. He is coming with some good and learned brothers, primarily for your sake. Therefore, to fulfill my promise to Bucer, I am sending another messenger with Bucer's letters attached. After you have read them with Leo and Pellicanus - as they are currently unable to reply - do what is appropriate. It would perhaps be better for the brothers to know each other face to face. Therefore, for other reasons as well, your presence would be more beneficial than the sacrament. But if you are going to be delayed by a day or two, let me know through this messenger. I will ensure that the good men stay with us until you can conveniently come to us.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord with all your heart that what Bucer attempts for the common advancement of the gospel may succeed most happily with the Holy Spirit as the author. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, December 15, 1534.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>By all means, stay with me, regardless of the companions you are bringing along.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Zurich church.</p>
