    <p xml:id="regest1">Simler and his wife [Verena, née Huser] thank Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther for finding accommodation in Basel for Josias [Simler] and [Huldrych] Zwingli [the Younger]. Simler would have requested a letter of recommendation for Josias if Bullinger had not already offered one on his own. Simler will send Josias with money, as Bullinger wished in his letter [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger should not take his son Heinrich away from Peter Simler. Simler wishes to take care of Heinrich as long as it is beneficial for the boy. As soon as this is no longer the case, Simler will inform Bullinger, as he would not want to disadvantage the boy in any way. - When Josias [returns to Zurich], he will gladly first visit Bullinger's house. Bullinger should encourage him to study diligently, especially since Peter Simler, who is already sixty years old, wishes to witness his son's return.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Peter Simler and his wife [Verena] wish [Anna Lavater], the daughter of the mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater], a beautiful wedding. Unfortunately, they cannot attend the celebration. The enclosed small gift should be given to the bride by [Anna Bullinger, née Adlischwyler] or Josias, especially since Josias will bid farewell to [Mayor Lavater].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Regarding the management of the Kappel Monastery, Simler would gladly offer advice if he knew what would be best. Instead, he must lament his troubles to Bullinger. Bullinger knows how diligently and faithfully he served his position [at the Kappel School] before and after the [Second Kappel] War. Nevertheless, he was criticized. In the year [15]39, the [Zurich] authorities sent [Monastery Overseer Jörg] Müller, the [Accountant] Hans Edlibach, and the Bailiff [of the Fraumünster, Bartholomäus] Köchli to Kappel. They were satisfied with Simler's administration. Yet, there were people who thought Simler acted like the abbots and that appointing a [steward] would be cheaper for the city. When [Hans Steinbrüchel] was appointed as [steward] by Müller, Edlibach, and Hans [Konrad] Escher, Simler naively handed over everything that could be useful [for the administration]. In doing so, he forgot his own interests. [Hans Rudolf] Lavater also pointed this out to him; and indeed, attempts were soon made to prevent the construction [of the new parsonage]. The officials sent to Kappel in the year [15]43, Lavater, Müller, [Jakob] Kumber, and [Jakob] Funck, could not agree, so nothing was accomplished. Now the whole matter is resurfacing. If only actions were taken in the interest of the matter and not just for personal gain!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger should forgive Simler for the inconvenience.</p>

      <p>Beloved, dear godfather, as Josias was arranged with Zwingli through Lord Rudolf Gwalther (in which my wife and I had previously agreed), we are pleased with the arrangement and express our heartfelt thanks to you and Lord Rudolf, with a willing heart to repay it if we can.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest2">
      <p>And regarding what I should rightfully request from you with earnest plea, namely to write a letter of recommendation, you have already offered it yourself. Therefore, I entrust Josias to you, to handle his affairs in a way that you think will honor God and benefit His church. May God grant grace for this. I will provide him with money, as you wrote. Regarding your Heinrich, you should not consider taking him away from me. If you were to do so now, it would greatly distress me and make me believe you wish to separate from me. Therefore, my request is, as long as God keeps me upright, you should leave him with me as long as it is beneficial for him. When I then believe it is no longer to your and his benefit, I will inform you; for I would not want to harm him willingly. I also know well that when Josias returns home with joy (may God grant it), he will first seek out your house. It is also my request that you speak earnestly with him, so that he does not delay his studies for long, but rather earnestly continues, so that he returns home more learned while he still finds his father. I would rather see him alive than dead. But my 60 years of age are here. I see so many passing away that I do not hope for a long life here. May God grant us eternal reconciliation.</p>

      <p>To my dear lord and cousin, Lord Mayor, and his daughter, I wish much happiness from myself and my wife and apologize that we are not coming to the wedding. I do not fit into the world right now; my wife would not be a joyful wedding guest, as the son is leaving. But a small gift, which I send herewith, you should let your wife give to the daughter, and ask her to accept it kindly, or, if you prefer, let Josias give it to her, since he will bid farewell to the Lord Mayor.</p>

      <p>That I should advise much on the household and cost management at Kappel, I would be inclined if I knew what would be best. However, I must burden you with my troubles (although you are already burdened with many other things). You know with what diligence and faithfulness I acted before and after the war. Nevertheless, I was criticized.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6">
      <p>In the year 1539, the authorities sent Mr. Müller, young Lord Hans Edlibach, and Bailiff Köchli to Kappel, and I showed them the order of my services and the entire household, and they were satisfied. Yet, there were always people who thought I acted like the abbots; if a steward were appointed, the household would be managed with lower costs. When the steward was appointed by Mr. Müller, Edlibach, and young Lord Hans Escher, I was so faithful or almost so foolish that I showed them and the steward everything that could be of use and harm. And it was so important to me that I did not think of my own matters until my Lord Lavater (who had ridden out for my good) said: "When will you report your matters? I tell you, what you do not accomplish now will proceed slowly afterward," as it then happened to me at that time, that I would have liked to have been hindered in the construction of the parsonage, which was decided by the council and citizens. Then, in the year 1543, my lords sent to Kappel Mr. Lavater, Mr. Müller, Kumber, and Funck. And they could not agree, so nothing was accomplished. Now it comes up again. Now I must frankly say (if good advice were to be given for the matter, namely if everyone cared as much for the common good as for their own), where there is a lack, all advice fails, and then the blame is placed on those who gave the advice. But whatever it may be, may God grant that the best is advised here for the glory of God and the benefit of the neighbor.</p>

      <p>Do not be angry that I trouble you so much. Entrusted to God with all the household. Dated March 12, 1546. Your always willing Peter Simler.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and godfather.</p>
