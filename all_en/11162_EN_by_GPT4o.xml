      <p>Greetings. The situation is such that I can neither deny nor agree at this moment. Some have spoken with me about the same matter, and if indeed their children arrive as I expect shortly, there will be a place for yours as well. If not, you see how it is not fair to dedicate effort to just one. Indeed, I have long since rejected this responsibility, but the persistence of people, or should I say authority, is such that I cannot maintain my own purpose in studies. However, my dear Bullinger, as it is right to gratify all good people and as I wish to be counted among the good, I will diligently strive to comply and, as much as possible, deserve your love.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>The day before the calends of April.</p>
      <p>Your Simon Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>You will receive a response shortly.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished Lord Heinrich Bullinger, brother in Christ.</p>
