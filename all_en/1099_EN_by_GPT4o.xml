      <p>Greetings. Your letters, incomparable friend, bring me great joy, believe me, you are exceptional to me. I received three letters from you in a relatively short interval, with great pleasure indeed; however, I was saddened that some letters previously sent to me were either lost or intercepted. I responded very briefly to the most recent ones, hoping to see you in person soon, which would have already happened if not for the harsh weather and difficult journey; therefore, my journey will have to be postponed until the next spring.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I would love for you to consider how your brother, with his wife and child, will arrange the rest of their life. Here, I seem to live not only in danger but also in filth, although the Lord has so far protected me from the plots of many.</p>
      <p>What will happen to the pious (I speak in human terms) is unknown; however, we know that this age threatens many disturbances. The people of Magdeburg have not yet subscribed to the Interim constitution. Duke Maurice of Saxony has attempted something significant against them, but as I hear, he has abandoned the siege without success. Farewell in golden freedom with the most distinguished brothers, to whom you will convey my heartfelt greetings. From Kaufbeuren, December 4, 1550.</p>
      <p>I am eager to know how the lords of the council are doing, how Theodorius is in the reed, and whether Schertler is still staying in Basel.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Frölich (Laetus).</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, the diets are held continuously; however, none of the imperial estates know what the ultimate outcome of such matters will be. Some say that soon more kings will be born to us, that Emperor Charles will yield the crown to his brother Ferdinand, and that Philip, the Prince of Spain, will be crowned King of the Romans. The rest show the face of war.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the esteemed Antistes of Zürich.</p>
