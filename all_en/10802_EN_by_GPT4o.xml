    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends the freshly printed [Württemberg] church ordinance, which [Duke Ulrich] had finally purged of superstitious elements. The visitation was interrupted due to the [Bavarian] war-mongering, although the Duke is reassured by the princes, including King Ferdinand. The alms ordinance is in print. The Duke has once again declared war on altars and images. Blarer is pleased about the successful [Basel] meeting and encourages the people of Zurich to work for unity. Greetings; longs to return home, as his situation is burdensome. Wishes well-being and requests news.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my venerable and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>I am sending the church ordinance, still hot from the press. Some things will seem to you, I am quite sure, more superstitious than genuine simplicity would allow. But you know in what way you should take these things, since not everything in such matters depends on me. Initially, they were outlined in a way that I would almost call more foolish; but, having been diligently advised by some good men, the prince took care to have them pruned; about which I neither want nor ought to commit more to writing.</p>
      <p>The inspection of the churches has now begun, which, however, is again interrupted by these warlike disturbances, certainly to the great inconvenience of the priests. The Bavarians are plotting something; but many other princes, among whom is also King Ferdinand, have sent very friendly letters to our prince, instructing him to be completely at ease. He obeys, but in the meantime, he thinks he should prudently remain vigilant.</p>
      <p>The ordinance of alms, which will be established everywhere, is also being printed now.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, as far as our affairs are concerned, everything is quite calm, except that the prince has declared war on those altars and images, which have long stood as a grave offense to worship.</p>
      <p>I greatly rejoice that Christ was present at your assembly with such a divine presence, and there is hope that the course of the gospel will be more unimpeded with that grave controversy seemingly removed by the Lord's favor. Indeed, the concord of the churches would have been achieved long ago, if Satan had not delayed it with wondrous tricks and thrown one obstacle after another, so that they would not understand each other. You, who by your singular modesty of spirit and authority, which you possess, diligently ensure with your fellow ministers that nothing is lacking in your duty. We are of Christ, whose glory alone we must bravely vindicate at the expense of all other things.</p>
      <p>Commend me most dutifully to the excellent man, Consul Rösti, Pellican, Leo, Theodor, along with the most courteous men who were with you in Konstanz, and earnestly intercede with the Lord for me with pious prayers, that once matters are successfully settled, I may someday return to my own. It cannot be expressed, Bullinger, how inconveniently I live, not only because I am abroad, but also because I am almost overwhelmed by countless and very serious, even most odious matters, which at this very moment, to avoid writing more, unwillingly distract me.</p>
      <p>Farewell then, my ever-respected Bullinger, and continue to love me steadfastly in the bowels of Christ as you have done so far, and inform me accurately about your affairs whenever possible. Farewell again, my soul.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, March 17.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to your most chaste wife.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Church of Zurich, friend and brother in Christ.</p>
