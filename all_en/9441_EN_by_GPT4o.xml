      <p>Indeed, I would not have disturbed your venerable old age, most esteemed lord and dearest brother Bullinger, with my crude letters, if my brother Christian had not, by his overly long silence, aroused suspicion that he was not in good health. Therefore, it pleased me to send my son to see how he is doing. However, when he began, unbeknownst to me and at the instigation of I know not whom, to undertake a task not of evil (for until now he has pursued the study of medicine with my permission, though not with my approval), to translate your homilies on the Apocalypse into German, and I happened by chance to come across this work, I indicated that these homilies of yours had already been translated long ago, but those you published on Isaiah and Daniel, I do not think have yet been made available in German. He did not rest until I provided them, which I did gladly, in the hope that perhaps this might incline his mind towards theology. He has therefore translated several homilies on Isaiah, which he has not yet had the opportunity to review. He will present them to you and hear from you what needs to be done, whether he should continue or not. I remember that I once urged you to ensure that these prophets, which you have explained, be translated into the vernacular language; a task which, if I could have undertaken it, would have been pleasing to you. For that is how you responded. If now my son has pleased you, I will rejoice and assist as much as you indicate you wish and as my own duties allow. And since he is going to his uncle (as I said), I thought it advisable that he meet you in person and commend himself to your piety. Would that his studies please you and that you might guide his will, so that, setting aside the medicine of the body, he might turn his mind to the medicine of the soul and present himself as a servant to the LORD.</p>
      <p>Amen amen amen.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, our affairs are [...]</p>
