      <p>S. P. I received letters from you, my lord and eternally revered father, to which I did not respond three days ago through Froschauer, because I hoped to send along with the letters the three-part commentary of François Hotman, which you requested. However, since none of our booksellers had that book, lest you think I was little moved by your most gracious and to me most pleasing letters, I decided to write these few things to you until I can also send the book; indeed, one of our booksellers informed me that he had purchased only one copy in Frankfurt, which he will receive in a few days. I ordered it to be reserved for me and will send it to you, God willing. Moreover, my lord and father, I have not sent you any letters for a long time because I had nothing worthy of writing and did not want to burden you with my trifles while you are occupied with more serious matters. Many things are often spread here by uncertain authors, which I do not wish to write about, lest I feed you with uncertainties.</p>
      <p>The news you wrote to me was pleasing; the same is also reported here.</p>
      <p>I had not heard that one thing about the death of the Duke of Longueville and the Turkish preparations.</p>
      <p>But the most pleasing of all was what is contained in your later letters about the peace among the Rhaetians, which is hoped to be stable and firm. No one who is somewhat prudent trusts this latest edict of peace in France; they indeed hope for a better condition for Christians in France after that leech of Christian blood has departed to Poland. I am sending the conditions prescribed to the Duke of Anjou by the Poles; I received them in French from a certain learned Frenchman, a great man, who, sensing the massacre in France a year before it happened, took refuge in this city three years ago; I dare not affirm that they are true. I have nothing else new at all; when I hear something, I will inform you. The day before yesterday, I dealt with that printer in Lausanne, to whom I had entrusted my French translation of your book "On Persecutions" to be printed, and when I complained that he had not kept his promises, he made some fig-leaf excuses and promised to print it as soon as possible. But since I have now received letters from Geneva for the third time, urgently requesting the same translation, I have decided to send it to Geneva to be printed there, lest that man from Lausanne deceive me a second time. I do not doubt, my lord, that you are so afflicted by cares, labors, old age, and recurring illnesses (as you write to me, which is your kindness), that you wish to be granted heavenly rest, but I also rejoice that, although you have already rendered faithful and diligent service to the Church of Christ for many years, you are still prepared to serve the Lord as long as He grants you life, which I pray to the best and greatest God, along with many other faithful, to prolong for you for a very long time to the glory of His name and the edification of His Church through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>All those whom I greeted in your name wish you very much health in return; I have not yet visited all, but I will do so when I am a little stronger.</p>
      <p>I wish you to convey my greetings to your sons and daughters, to Herr Gwalther, my lord Herr Simler and his wife, and to Herr Lavater. Farewell, my revered lord and father.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God guard and preserve you. Basel, on the calends of October, in the year 1573.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johann Baptist Müller. To the most distinguished man and exceptional servant of Christ, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my eternally revered lord and father. To Zürich.</p>
