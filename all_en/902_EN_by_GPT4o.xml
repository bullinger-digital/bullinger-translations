      <p>Most excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>While I was traveling here for the sake of some brothers, by chance at the inn of the Angel, I met Mr. Marcus Roist, your compatriot.</p>
      <p>When he told me that he was going to travel towards Venice, I could not, due to our old acquaintance, refrain from recommending him to my friends, so that whether present or absent, I may, as I ought, assist the people of Zürich in whatever way I can. Farewell in the Lord and greet the other friends in my name.</p>
      <p>Given in Ferrara, May 9, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Balthasar Altieri.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, always to be honored as lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
