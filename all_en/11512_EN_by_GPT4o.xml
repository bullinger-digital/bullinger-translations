    <p xml:id="regest1">Explains why he could not write to them individually. The meeting [in Worms] fell so far short of expectations that it is mainly necessary to report what did not happen there. Report on the arrival of the delegations and the delayed arrival of the presidents; list of delegates. Preparatory discussions of the Protestant theologians on faith and works, mass, monastic vows, and papal authority. Diminishing hopes placed on Emperor [Charles V.] due to news about the heresy edict issued in Brabant and the associated persecutions, but also because of the ban imposed on Goslar. Delayed opening of the meeting on November 20, reading of letters from the Emperor and his orator [Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle; statements from both parties and response from the presidents. Arrival of Granvelle [on November 22], reading of imperial letters and Granvelle's speech [on November 25]. Outrage of the Protestants over the speech and discussions about an appropriate response; explanation of the circumstances that only allowed a joint response from both parties. Proposals from the presidents for organizing the discussion. Criticism of the procedure that put the Protestants in the role of the accused. Their objections, especially against the unanimity principle; submission of the Confessio Augustana [variata] and the Apology; list of nominees from both sides for the discussion. Response from the presidents on December 2 to the Protestants' statement from November 28. Their renewed objections are largely rejected. Further concessions from the Protestants and response from the presidents on December 3; the Protestants comply in the hope of an immediate start of the discussion. Further delay of four days due to negotiations of the presidents with the opposing side and the imperial orator, as well as the holding of a Mass of the Holy Spirit. Surprising appearance of the papal nuncio [Tommaso Campeggio, on December 8]. Discussions about a response to him; rejection of an official representation of the Pope. Dispute over the oath formula of the notaries presented on December 9. Embarrassment of the opponents due to the Protestants' accommodation and due to disagreement within their own ranks, especially between Johannes Eck and Ambrosius Pelargus; mediation efforts by Granvelle, who praises the unanimity of the Protestants. Reasons for their resistance to the confidentiality obligation provided for in the oath formula. Statement by Granvelle and the presidents on the Protestants' objections; after a seven-day dispute, they agree despite concerns. After the supposed overcoming of all obstacles on December 18, renewed measures by the opponents to delay the start of the discussion: attempt to suppress evangelical sermons; pressure on the Palatine, Brandenburg, and Cleves delegates; proposal to hold a private conversation. On December 26, complaint by the Protestants about the obvious futility of the efforts; the presidents refer to the framework conditions adopted in Hagenau and propose to receive the majority opinion of each party and forward it to the other side. The Protestants insist on open discussion; statements from the Protestant councils and theologians. In their response on January 2, the presidents demand that the discussion be limited to two colloquents and that only the results be recorded. Rejection of corresponding concessions by the Protestants on January 5. Response from the presidents on January 12; agreement of the Protestants to the conduct of the discussion by two colloquents. On January 13, swearing-in of the notaries and setting the start of the discussion for the following day. Summary of the four-day debate by Melanchthon [and Eck] on original sin; the details of the discussion are still unpublished. Granvelle's attempt to reconcile the positions; contrast between Eck and Pelargus. Satisfaction of the Protestants with the consensus formula achieved; astonishment that this could even be contentious. Suspension of the discussion by imperial mandate on January 18; abrupt end of the meeting. Summary assessment: The opponents wanted to delay the discussion until the arrival of the Emperor and blame the Protestants for it. Despite extensive concessions, the Protestants could not achieve a timely start of the discussion; they had the arbitrators against them, except for the Palatine [Ludwig V.], and the timeframe was too tight from the beginning. Grynäus does not want to report on the private conversations here. What to expect from the upcoming Diet in Regensburg remains open.</p>

      <p>To the dearest brothers in Christ who proclaim the Gospel in Zurich, Simon Grynaeus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Due to the constant running around at the Diets, the greetings and addresses of friends, the business and occupations of the matters being conducted, and finally the short span of the winter day, all my time was consumed, and I was unable to write to each of you as I most wished and as I confess I should have. Therefore, having returned home and found the leisure to write down what I had noted, I now wish to satisfy all of you with one letter, writing everything that happened there, if I can. But you should be persuaded about me as I have always professed to you, that I am a brother in Christ who truly loves you and a guardian of our common ministry and public salvation by divine election, to whom nothing in life could be more pleasing than if we adhere with true and solid unity of our minds. I call Christ as a witness to this confession and my zeal towards you. Not only did the occupation I mentioned prevent me from writing to you until now, but also because there was no one to write down what I wanted, or what I myself wished to write was either nothing or very little. For I know that you, due to the fame of these Diets and the gathering of people from everywhere, have imagined something great and admirable and a certain meeting among the leaders of both parties that posterity would marvel at. And this was also my expectation: but it deceived me so much that unless I write what was not done, I cannot write what was done. Indeed, although it is not my place to speak grandly about a matter that is not great, I will now tell it as it is, so you may understand. At the beginning, when the main delegates of both parties were almost all present on the appointed day, they were forced to wait for the arrival of the presidents until the twenty-second day. For from our side, the Saxons, Hessians, Württembergers, Brandenburgers, Lüneburgers, some came before, some on the day, a few on the second or at most the third day after. Only the Pomeranians, being the most distant, arrived later than the others, but the city delegates from Strasbourg, Augsburg, Ulm, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Constance, Hamburg, Bremen were all present almost on the day itself. Nor was there any delay from the opposing side. The presidents arrived late, the Cologne delegates on the tenth, the Trier delegates on the fourteenth, the Mainz delegates on the eighteenth, the Palatinate delegates on the twentieth day after the appointed term, and indeed from the nearest place (I believe because they had come in vain before the others), after this even the Pope's and Ferdinand's delegates arrived. The names of those who were sent to these Diets are as follows. From the Emperor, Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle was the delegate, and with him first two sons, one the Bishop of Arras, then two familiars, one Gerard Veltwyck, a man of all kinds of learning, especially skilled in the Hebrew language to a miraculous degree: the other the Provost of Marville, Joannes a Navia, and three Spanish doctors, one Malhanda, another Muscosa, the third de Hortis, alumni of the Parisian school came. But from the Pope, indeed the Bishops of Feltre, Aquila, Modena, also Peter Paul Vergerius, and whom we mentioned above, the Bishop of Arras, and whom we will soon mention, the Bishop of Seckau, and after these Poggio, the perpetual legate from the Pope at the Emperor's court: and finally from the King of England, the Bishop of Winchester, who came when the Diets were already dissolved. The doctors were Thomas of Modena, Master of the Sacred Palace, Robert Rogt. Scotus, Peter Gerard, a Frenchman. From King Ferdinand: the Bishop of Seckau, Fridericus Nausea, Joannes Cochlaeus, Martinus someone. From the Archbishop of Mainz: Joannes Erenbergius, Julius Pflug, Conradus Bruno, Jodocus Butzfeldius, Joannes Minsingerus, Ambrosius Pelargus. From the Archbishop of Cologne: Dietrich Count of Manderscheid, Bernard of Hagen, Joannes Groperus, Ebrardus Bellingus. From the Archbishop of Trier: Joannes Hussingus, Georgius Eltzius and someone else. From the Palatinate: Ludovicus Fleckenstein, Henrichus Has, Henrichus Stoll, Matthis Keiler. From the Elector Margrave: Christopher Scherding, Leonardus Cellarius, Alexander Alesius, Joannes Embeccus, Joannes Pannonius. From the Archbishop of Salzburg: Martinus Marstellerus, Nicolaus Apella, Joannes Winterus. From Strasbourg: Joannes Count of Isenburg, Jodocus of Sebach, Christophorus Welsinger, Joannes Armbrusterus. From Ludwig and Wilhelm of Bavaria: W. Sebelsdorfferus, Joannes Eckius, Joannes Kretzems, Joannes Apella. From the Duke of Jülich: Joannes Vlatenus, Conradus Heresbachius, Albertus Regius came. And these indeed are the names of those who came from the opposing side. These are ours. From the Elector of Saxony: Joannes Deltzius, Franciscus Burckardus, Chilianus Goldstein, Philippus Melanchthon, Caspar Crucigerus, Justus Menius. From Henry of Saxony: Andreas Camitianus, Andreas Francus, Nicolaus Scheublin. From the Duke of Lüneburg: Nicolaus Hostein, Urbanus Regius: but he was expected, he did not come. From the Margrave of Brandenburg: Friderichus Knoblochsdorffius, Sigismundus Schneewyß and someone else. From the Duke of Württemberg: Bernhardus Göler, Balthassar Giltlinger, Philippus Langus, Erhardus Schnepfius, Balthassams Cuslinus. From the Landgrave of Hesse: Alexander of Tanna, Hartmannus Schleyer, Joannes Feyus, Adamus Krafftus, Gerardus Noviomagus, Joannes Pistorius. From the Duke of Pomerania: Vuolfgangus Vueddelius, Jacobus Esselems, Nicolaus Glossenus. From Strasbourg: Jacobus Sturmius, Joannes Calvinus: And with the Strasbourg delegates. From Basel: Bonifatius Amerbachius, whom illness diverted from the intended journey, Simon Grynaeus. From Nuremberg: Erasmus Ebnerus, Huldrichus Vuerdhemems, Andreas Osiander, Vuincelaus Linckius. From Ulm: Georgius Besserems, Martinus Vueickmannus, Martinus Frechtus. From Augsburg: Matthias Langmantellus, Jacobus Herbrotus, Joannes Heelius, Vuolfgangus Musculus. From Hall in Swabia: Joannes Brentius. From Bremen: Daniel Burrenus, Joannes Amsterdamus. From Frankfurt: Oierus Melenius. From Constance: Joachimus Malems. From Hamburg: Nicolaus. And these indeed were the parties. But the presidents and as it were the future arbitrators of the whole colloquy: from the Palatinate Ludovicus Fleckenstein, from Bavaria V. Sebelsdorfius, from Mainz first indeed Julius Pflug, who because he was more liberally educated, was immediately recalled so that he would not deal with us: after him Joannes Erenbergius: from Strasbourg, Count Isenburg, were sent. And indeed the names and arrival of the parties and presidents were such. But no delay was brought to the colloquy by the parties. For in these the arrival of one or another not necessary, since it could not hinder the others, was not even expected: but the delay of the presidents, because it was necessarily expected, prolonged the matter until the twenty-second day, and alone delayed the colloquy for a while. Therefore, during these twenty-two days, while the necessary arrival of the presidents was awaited, our people wanted to try and present the future contest about doctrine. This meeting was such. For the learned men of our party would meet among themselves, and some article would be proposed in common, and the opinion of all on that matter would be heard in order. Not only what should be answered to the adversaries, but also how our own should be confirmed, was examined. In this circle Melanchthon presided. The others each for themselves expressed their own opinion. The first discussion was about faith and works, in which it was debated whether faith itself is righteousness, or the cause of righteousness, or neither righteousness nor the cause of righteousness, but only stands in place of righteousness for us. Then whether those who are reborn have any righteousness of their own, or indeed none of their own, but only the righteousness of faith in judgment. Finally, because it was often objected, "He who wishes to enter into life, let him keep the commandments," and "many things are forgiven to him who loved much," and "if we forgive, it will also be forgiven to us," and "if anyone has all faith, but does not have charity, he is nothing": it was asked whether in any way the newness of life of the saints would merit life. These were the matters of the first discussion. The second was about the Mass, in which two matters, the application of the work and the sacrifice of the body of Christ, were acted against the opinion of the Schools. The third was about monastic vows and elective worship. The fourth was about the primacy of the Pope and the power of the Church: which indeed had these questions: Whether Peter and his successors had any power above the others to ordain and confirm the others. Also, whether the Pope can err in faith: whether, if not by divine right alone, the Roman bishop is the highest, any obedience is owed to him. Whether the degrees of priests and bishops are so divided by divine right that they hold the right of ordination. Whether bishops can institute new rites and ceremonies, and whether they can establish traditions concerning order. Whether they hold the right of occupying and governing empires: whether there exists a singular privilege of prophecy above the apostleship and episcopate. The fourth discussion was instituted only about penance and its parts. While these things were being done by our people, it was said that the presidents had already arrived. Therefore, since a true contest with the enemy itself seemed to be at hand, this most useful meeting came to an end. While these things were being conducted at the Diets, and while there was some expectation of peace and concord, a hostile and most horrible edict of the Emperor was brought to us, published a few days before in Brabant, in which our doctrine was publicly proscribed in those places, and whoever dared to profess it was to be exterminated by sword and fire. With this edict, which was circulated in pamphlets there in the French and vernacular language, a rumor of dire persecution was also brought. For our people, who were then returning from the Emperor's court, reported that any suspicion of heresy was capital. If anyone did not uncover his head at the sight of an image, if anyone had no images at home, if anyone had used any word incautiously, if anyone had shown any slight contemptuous judgment, all these were considered certain suspicions of heresy, and they showed that it was enough. They also added that people who had no image at home were buying them just to free themselves from capital suspicion. Moreover, anyone on whom suspicion of heresy had once fallen was immediately dragged to judgment, and whether that suspicion was judged sufficient for inquiry was immediately decided in judgment, after the judge pronounced it sufficient, the person was immediately taken to torture and forced to confess the crime. Anyone who recanted a confession of heresy extorted from him was punished only with death, anyone who persisted in professing it was burned alive, not so that he was turned to ashes, but so that with his body burned and his form blackened and horrendous, he was affixed to a stake and hung up as a terror to others. Even the clothes of the condemned were kept hanging in temples in a conspicuous and open place, so that the memory of both the living and dead heretic would strike and deter everyone with fear. They also added that from this inhuman and cruel kind of inquisition, some people most dear to the Emperor himself could scarcely be rescued by the Emperor's highest authority: for the Emperor was so bound to these inquisitors. When these things were brought, they seemed astonishing to our people, since he who had begun to deal with us about reconciling peace, and had designated time and place for that matter, was almost in sight, and in the very beginnings of making peace, was so hostilely attacking our doctrine, and was sending a legate to us, aware of all those counsels and deeds, with hands still bloody with our blood, about peace. Therefore, the minds of all, previously raised to some hope of concord, were dismayed by this rumor, and no one was found who judged that any faith should be placed in the Emperor's promises: who, while promising peace, was meanwhile exercising hostilities. For wise men judged that since the Emperor was so persuaded that his opinion about religion was true, and ours false, that he intended to confirm this with the most exquisite tortures and to extirpate that, it was not necessary to simulate peace and at the same time to threaten hostilely. At the same time, it was reported that the greatest and most ancient city of the Empire, Goslar, was publicly proscribed in that cause, and by those people by whom it had previously been absolved in the same cause, but he who had been condemned in whose favor it was now proscribed. For it seemed to our people that at this time even in the highest and most certain causes, it was necessary to moderate the freedom of judgments for a while, and to suspend such grave sentences, and not to stir up the most odious and grave matters in the Empire, while public peace was being considered for all. But indeed, after a good cause was condemned by a hasty judgment, our people judged all this hope of concord to be in vain. But this Goslar cause, as it stands, will be narrated elsewhere and by other people with a complete and perfect account. But let us return to the narration of the Diets. Therefore, on the twentieth day of November, which was the twenty-second day of the appointed colloquy, after the presidents had arrived, the parties were called into the court, and they showed that they had come as legates appointed to the colloquy by their princes, and were ready to listen. Therefore, they said it seemed time to come to the matter, and they prayed that the parties would conduct themselves with all moderation, and they requested that Ferdinand's legation, which had already arrived, be admitted to the colloquy. They then presented two letters, one from the Emperor, addressed to both parties, the other from the legate Granvelle, addressed only to one party. In these letters, they tried to excuse the delay. In the Emperor's letter, it was shown that Granvelle, who had been destined for these Diets, was hindered by sudden business, and the Emperor prayed that if he was not present in time, such a great matter should not be postponed, nor should expenses be made in vain, but that the presidents appointed to the colloquy should proceed, and that they should not wait for him. This letter, dated the twelfth of October, which should have been delivered on the first day of the colloquy, was finally delivered on the twenty-second, having been retained by the presidents for twenty-two days, and presented to the parties later than it should have been. Therefore, the same thing by which the presidents wanted to excuse themselves, they openly called themselves into suspicion of having caused the delay. Granvelle, however, in his letter to the adversaries, first complained that he had been excluded from the business and could not be present at such a great matter in time, although he had tried with the greatest speed of journeys and the utmost diligence in managing business. He then indicated that he was sending Joannes a Navia, a man whose prudence in the same matters had been proven, to excuse his occupations to the parties and to ensure that such a great matter would not suffer delay. Finally, he prayed that they would not wait for him. The end of his letter promised singular goodwill and zeal towards preserving the old religion to the opposing party. This letter, dated the second of November, was delivered on the twenty-second, also arguing that the delay sought, not avoided, by the presidents and the legate. For there was no doubt about the legate. For how could any private matter, with which he was occupied at this time in Vesontio, sent to hear such a colloquy at the Emperor's command, have been able to hinder it? After hearing the speech of the presidents and reading those letters, the adversaries first, and indeed for themselves, responded that they were pleased with the diligence of the princes: that they were ready for the colloquy: and that they would not cause delay: that they promised the utmost moderation: that they did not oppose the admission of Ferdinand's legates to the colloquy: that they requested that the form of the colloquy be established before anything else. Thus the adversaries then. Our people, having taken time, responded in almost the same sentiment, that they also rejoiced at the diligence of the presidents and princes in the cause of religion, which should now be recognized: and that they were also ready for that matter: but with all the protestations of the previous time preserved. They promised to do everything very kindly when the manner of the colloquy was proposed. As for the legates of King Ferdinand, if they were admitted, all the others said they did not oppose, provided that the law of the colloquy proposed at Hagenau was preserved, and the same freedom was permitted to our people, whom it was also likely would come here to observe. The Saxons, however, testified that they did not recognize King Ferdinand as legitimately elected. To these responses of the parties, the presidents, with a few words, praised the moderate approach of both parties, showed that great hope had shone for them if the rest were done in the same way. They showed that they would consider the form. However, as for the private protestation of the Saxons, they opposed a protestation, affirming that Ferdinand was rightly and legitimately elected king. Meanwhile, since it was said that the Emperor's legate was approaching and would be present within two days, they thought the matter should be postponed for his arrival, during whose absence all this action was hindered. These things were done on the twenty-second day, and such was the beginning of the Diets. Then on the twenty-fourth, when the legate came, he was honorably received by all the bishops who were there at that time, with everyone going to meet him. The next day he was separately greeted by the leaders of both parties and addressed about the proposed matter, he responded kindly and promised most amply. Then on the third day after his arrival, which was already the twenty-sixth from the beginning of the Diets, the parties were called together, and first he presented and ordered the letters and mandates of the Emperor to be read: The summary of these was this. The Emperor had always tried in every way to compose Germany, therefore he had left the Spaniards and come to Germany not without danger, therefore he had always hastened to our Diets. But hindered by the Belgian tumult, he had previously sent the principal men, and recently even his brother for himself, therefore he had taken care on this ninth day, so that the whole matter might be known at some time, therefore he had wanted to come to the Catholic colloquy himself, but hindered by the same cause and the same movements, he had appointed this legate, from whom all his opinion could be understood, to this colloquy with full mandate. Therefore he prayed that they would have faith in him as if the Emperor himself were present, and that they would conduct the matter well. Such was the sentiment of the Emperor's mandate and instruction. After presenting the letters and mandate of the Emperor, the legate then used an exhortation of this kind. First, by diminishing himself and proclaiming his zeal and goodwill towards us, he sought to capture benevolence. Then, after he had discussed some things about the zeal of Charles, the German Emperor, towards the Germans, some things also about the state of Germany, both what it had been and what it was now, then some things about the calamities that had followed this civil discord, not inappropriately for concord, he finally tried to soften the minds with prayers poured out to tears and with the greatest entreaties. That speech was not received in the same way by the parties. The adversaries marveled and praised, our people criticized, and said it was not the part of a prudent man to alienate and deter with words those whom you wish to bring to you in reality, and what you should have concealed in the whole matter, you could not even dissimulate at the beginning: finally, about the matter you come to know, before you have heard, to pronounce in favor of one party, which you ought to reconcile, and against the other. As for the benevolence he boasted of, since both the Brabant mandate (of which he was believed to be the author) and the cruelty exercised against our people in Vesontio a few days before, which he had also tried to execute with the authority of the imperial judgment, opposed, no one believed him. Our people also gravely and bitterly resented that all the cause of domestic evil, and as much as there was in neighboring nations, was attributed to us as pestilent heretics. Especially the legates of the princes were very moved, each one judged that this injury should be repelled from his prince. And a sharp response would have been given, if the consultation that followed these movements, partly, partly the industry of the presidents and the legate, had not mitigated them. For our people thought that what had been said about both sides and in common should not be transferred to themselves alone: and the legate himself, having been informed by someone who had mixed himself in our consultation about the indignation of our people, sent a familiar and learned man to our people, and entreated that the speech should not be taken otherwise than he had understood it: And the presidents, to whom this speech was commonly addressed, judged that it should be answered in the manner of the empire, commonly, and not separately. But the new way of conducting public counsel in the Empire is this. Public counsels are first compared from the three orders, first of the electors, then of the other princes, lastly of the cities. And the electors indeed deliberate separately, the princes and other states separately, then these two orders confer their counsels among themselves, then whatever they have concluded among themselves, they finally refer it to the third order, which consists of the imperial cities, in such a way that the reason is only for communicating counsel, not for seeking opinions or collecting votes. For the cities have no vote in these deliberations as if none. Moreover, in that second order, which we said is of the princes, those who exist in a lower degree, counts, barons, abbots are numbered. And when one or perhaps two from the order of counts are admitted to these counsels, almost no abbot is absent: so it happens that one abbot in giving an opinion in the consultations of the Empire can do more than all the cities. But formerly the matter was otherwise, and opinions were given with equal liberty and right of all orders. But this new custom arose from the fact that when the princes necessarily always came to public counsels, the cities, because the cause seemed either not great or not very concerning to them, often did not come, it happened that their votes seemed necessary, those of the cities not necessary. Therefore, as if the cities had ceded their right, the princes believed that the whole moderation of the counsels pertained to them. Therefore, since our people indeed wanted to speak for themselves, and the legates wanted to blunt their freedom, but the presidents and adversaries did not want to offend this one, but could not openly oppose our people, and yet contended that it should be answered in common, they easily prevailed by the number of votes, then they also moved. If our people insisted on their proposal to respond for themselves and separately, they would also respond to the legate separately, but outside the public meeting and privately in his house. Therefore, our people were driven from this proposal. For it was not believed that the legate would hear us publicly, after he had heard them privately: and our speech would be without witness with him, with the adversaries, in whose favor he had indulged himself against us, and the presidents, whose opinion about us had to be remedied, removed, it seemed to lack all grace and utility. Therefore, when our people saw that they would alienate both the legate and the presidents, and those who seemed to study concord among the adversaries, with a sharper response, especially at the beginning of the colloquy, and that they would achieve nothing with this apology now, they conceded to a common response. In that response, thanks were first given to the Emperor, then to the legate for his benevolence and zeal towards the Germans: then to that complaint, which was grave and bitter in his speech, it was thus answered. It seemed to be done in vain for anyone to complain about the great inconveniences of the Empire at this time and place, where deliberation was instituted about finding the causes and remedy of the evils. Here the legate of the Emperor, here the princes, here wise men from all nations had come, not to vex themselves with mutual complaints and quarrels, but to clearly understand at some time what was disturbing the Christian world. Therefore, it would then appear who provided the cause of a just complaint; when the colloquy was rightly concluded. For that to be rightly conducted, the work of wisdom, faith, and constancy of the good was necessary. Here they promised their effort as much as they could. And indeed such was the legate's speech, and such was the response to the legate. The form of the future colloquy proposed by the presidents was such that the places and names of those men who had been appointed to the contest from both sides should be presented to the presidents in order: that the legates of Ferdinand should be admitted to the colloquy, and that they should be numbered among the eleven, and have a place for voting: that the form of the colloquy at Hagenau should not be departed from, in which it was provided that no one should be admitted to the colloquy beyond twice eleven, nor did it seem fair that anyone should demand the same for themselves and their own as was permitted to King Ferdinand: for it was not fitting that the Prince who had been the author of instituting this disputation should be excluded from it: that not individuals, but that the eleven should constitute single votes, and that the number of persons should not pertain to the multitude, but to the certainty of votes: that the eleven on each side alone should speak in the disputation, the others should not be actors, but advocates assisting the speakers: that only four notaries, two from here, two from there, should be appointed, bound by oath: that the legates of the princes should communicate the acts to their princes in such a way that nothing of all should be published before a report was made to the Emperor: that the articles on which we wished to dispute should be reduced to order and described to the presidents, not paradoxical, but Christian, and apt for concord: that they would take care of the rest. This form of conducting the disputation, proposed at the beginning by the president, was later found to be a matter sought for avoiding, prolonging, and weaving delay in the disputation, by the industry of those men who seemed to carry everything that appeared to pertain to concord, but fled concord itself. But before I speak of the discussion of those articles and as it were a certain action of law between us and the presidents, a few things must first be explained about the whole manner of the colloquy. The whole colloquy, as it was instituted, was supposed to consist of three parts, the arbitrators, the accused, who were us, and the accusers, who were our adversaries. For our confession was to be examined as some voice worthy of the severity of judgment, and the change of religion made by us as some infamous crime to be punished with grave penalty, both according to the common rule of Christ's doctrine, with the presidents hearing and judging, the adversaries accusing and refuting, and us defending. That disputation, as we said above, although it was not to have the definition of a sentence, but the estimation of the cause and controversy, was nevertheless to be like a prejudice, so that as our cause appeared there, such would be the sentence of the other men about us in the council. But what is customary in all litigations as well as arbitrations, that he who is an arbiter in some matter should not communicate in the same matter with him whose arbiter he is, or not more in one part than in the other, this was not at all observed here. For by the counsel of those who were on the opposing side, those who were arbiters conducted everything, and you would see the same men, when it was necessary to act against us, standing among the adversaries: when it was necessary to arbitrate about us, standing among the arbiters, and indeed most of them were most hostile both to the truth and to us, as their most seditious pamphlets recently issued openly declare. Moreover, the three arbitrators were not those who could place themselves in the middle, since they professedly defended the cause of one party, and one legate of the Palatinate could truly seem to perform the office. For how could these bishops, one of whom holds one of the greatest bishoprics, another the two greatest, the third three of the greatest, and among them two archbishoprics, all these against all divine and human law, and who never perform any office of a bishop in life, either arbitrate equally about those men or constitute themselves as fair arbiters in hearing their cause, who professedly execrate this whole kind of tyranny in the Church as blasphemous and impious. For as far as the Emperor's legate was concerned, no more evident argument could be expected of his and his prince's, whose legate he was, opinion about us and our doctrine and deeds, than that mandate, which was issued at the same time against us as if judged certain, which although they were such, our people nevertheless thought it seemed right to render an account of their doctrine, which they knew to be solid and firm, even in a place however iniquitous. To this form of the future colloquy proposed by the presidents, although we do not know what the adversaries responded, it is not difficult to conclude, since it had been composed and established by their counsel and vote; for the presidents did nothing without their counsel, nor could they even act. Our people, however, necessarily desired many things in these. At the beginning, it was burdensome, not that Ferdinand's legates were admitted to the colloquy, but that they indeed were admitted, while our people were excluded, who above these three times eleven were few and outstanding men, and finally such that it was necessary for these three times eleven of ours to communicate all their counsels with them. Therefore, it seemed absurd to exclude from the colloquy both the legates of the princes to this colloquy and those who were the associates of all the counsels of those in the colloquy. But they judged that it should not be concealed in any way that they were trying to make single votes from the eleven votes. For although our people agreed that nothing should be defined by the multitude of votes in the free and sacred colloquy, they nevertheless judged that it should not be done that no one's vote should not be noted. For what exposition of the disputed controversy would be made, or how could a true estimation be made in that matter, in which the chief moments were read, and the opinions of men disputing about religion were dissimulated. Therefore, they believed it was not so much in their own interest as in the Emperor's, if he were instructed as clearly as possible about the matter as it had been conducted. The rest, although they were agitated, had a light dispute: such as that nothing of what had been done here should be published before it was reported to the Emperor, then also that two notaries from here, two from there should be appointed. For in the former, it was burdensome that our people needed to refer to those princes from whom they had been sent about the matters being dealt with at that time, and they could not promise about the publication of those matters, which should be published or suppressed, then it could be known when it was understood in the cause of religion now to be judged how the judgments of men had been revealed, not when the Emperor himself had been informed about their judgments or had pronounced his own opinion. In the latter, there was no difficulty unless a new interpretation of that article was later found by the adversaries. For since these men, whom our people had designated to record the acts due to the present necessity, were of such a kind, not who had come to describe, but who had come to weigh and evaluate the disputation, so it was judged unfair to impose the labor of describing the acts again on honest men. Therefore, it was requested here that each notary should be allowed to have a substitute. The rest were agreed upon. For the confession and apology of our people offered to the presidents in place of those articles which they had previously requested from us, was such that all the disputation of the future colloquy would exist in them. But the names and places of the doctors whom our people had destined for this disputation were exhibited at the beginning. The arrangement of this matter was such on both sides that three times eleven men from here and there were appointed to this contest according to the number and place of their princes and cities. And from us indeed for the Elector of Saxony: Franciscus Burckardus, Philippus Melanchthon, Justus Menius; For Hesse Joannes Fry, Martinus Bucerus, Adamus Fuldanus; for Henry of Saxony: Andreas Camitianus, Joannes Brentius, Nicolaus Schoublinus; for the Margraves Georg and Albrecht: Fridrichus Knoblochsdor, Sigismundus Schneewyß, Chilianus Goldstein; for Lüneburg: Nicolaus Holstein, Joannes Calvinus, Joannes Sturmius; for Württemberg: Balthassar Giltlinger, Erhardus Schnepff, Balthassar Cuselin; for Pomerania: Nicolaus Glossenus, Jacobus Philippus, Vuolfgangus Weddelius; for Strasbourg: Wolfgangus Capito, Jacobus Sturmius, Simon Gryneus; for Augsburg and Ulm: Conradus Helus, Georgius Bessems, Martinus Frechtus; for Nuremberg: Erasmus Ebneres, Vincelaus Lingkius, Andreas Osiander; for Bremen, Magdeburg, and Hamburg: Nicolaus Ambsdorfius, Joannes Amsderdamus, Daniel Burenus stood. But the phalanx instituted by the adversaries was such. It stood for Mainz Mihahel Heldling, Ambrosius Pelargus, Conradus Bruno; for Trier: Joannes Hußring, Georgius Eltz, Nicolaus N.; for Cologne: Bemhardus ab Hagen, Ebrardus Billig, Dietericus a Manderschid; for the Palatinate: Henricus Stoll, Mathias Keiler, Henricus Has; for the Elector Margrave: Leonhardus Keller, Alexander Alestius, Joannes Ludovicus; for Meissen and Halberstadt: Joannes Minsinger, Conradus Mucosus, Jodocus Hutzfeldus; for Salzburg: Leonhardus Marstaller, Nicolaus Appell, Joannes Vuetzler; for the Bishop of Strasbourg: Joannes Armbrester, Christophores Vuelsinger, Joannes a Seebach; for Wilhelm of Bavaria: Matthias Kretzeres, and a Franciscan minister; for Jülich: Joannes Vlatenus, Conradus Heresbachius, Albertus Küng. And in this way indeed both sides were ordered and instituted for battle. This response of our people to the proposed articles was given on the twenty-eighth of November, in which nothing but the intolerable was rejected, nothing but the necessary was requested, and the notaries were then brought into view, and the confession of our doctrine was offered, and finally the catalog and order of our forces were exhibited, and a protestation was made about the right of the previous Diets and agreements, when nothing more than the congress was expected, the response of the presidents greatly disappointed our hope and expectation. It was proposed on the second of December, and it was of this kind: All except twice eleven were excluded from the colloquy according to the Hagenau arrangement. Therefore, they could not change it, and therefore it was in vain to dispute about admitting others either already present or to be present in the future to the colloquy. What should be done about the twice eleven votes should be seen by the legates of both parties. They would take care of what they believed to be their duty, so that a diligent report of the matter conducted would be made to the Emperor. In our arrangement, more than eleven states were counted: therefore, the superfluous should be rejected. What our people had responded about Ferdinand was pleasing. It was also pleasing about the notaries, but so that their substitutes would be bound by the same oath, excluded from the colloquy, and the form of the oath to be proposed to both by them. As for the moderation of the princes in publishing, they indeed did not doubt: they thought it should be considered how great and how just the Emperor's indignation would be if these acts were published before they were reported to the Emperor. Finally, as for the offered confession, they easily understood that one copy of the confession was not enough, therefore more should be offered. The presidents needed one, the Emperor's legate needed one, the adversaries needed one. As for the Nuremberg and Augsburg agreement, if they remained within this form, there was no danger. This response, since it clearly rejected one of our principal requests about admitting the remaining legates, and obscurely rejected the other about not noting the votes, but introduced a ridiculous request about the copies, and equally light about the multitude of states, our people briefly responded in this way. They still requested, as before, that the others who had come here as legates, not destined for the number of votes, should be interested in the colloquy: then that the voices of individuals should be valid and noted. As for Ferdinand, they had never fought, but as for the substitutes, it should not seem strange that they should be interested in the colloquy, whom it was necessary to make true witnesses of all things both for the description of the acts and for the office of legation. They accepted the form of the oath as it was proposed to the notaries and as both parties had agreed to it. As for the fact that more than eleven states were counted in their arrangement, it was done without fraud. Therefore, they were prepared to correct that matter and attribute only one state to three persons. For this was criticized by them, that in our arrangement we had coupled cities either two or three in some places. As for the copies, there were none now indeed recent and clean, but within a few days there would be an abundance of many, then they would abundantly exhibit them, meanwhile, they should accept such as they might now happen to have. But it seemed strange and incredible that the adversaries had come to that disputation, in which the Augsburg confession was to be examined, without copies of that book. Thus our people responded: and this was the second discussion about the articles. To these things, the presidents again refused everything to us as before, and persisted in their opinion, that the arrangement of the colloquy had been constituted at Hagenau, and they could not change it. Therefore, they would not admit any other auditor than those who were involved in the colloquy itself. They decided the same about the voices of those voting as before: they also removed the substitutes from the colloquy to cut off all superfluous: they decided that the form of the oath was in their power, but they would do this not without the consent of the legate. What they had appointed three persons to one state, this pleased them. If any response of ours was offered after this writing, it should be done in both languages. This response had a refusal of three things. For it excluded both our remaining legates and substitutes from the colloquy, and denied that the voices should be defined in voting, and introduced a new request about offering responses in both languages. Therefore, the next day, which was already the third of December, our people, after they had shown that their requests did not obstruct the arrangement conceived at Hagenau, but greatly contributed to the proposed matter, nevertheless, because it seemed otherwise to the presidents, and it could not be obtained from them, they showed that they did not want to break off the colloquy for these reasons. Therefore, they deferred to their authority about excluding the remaining legates, and also yielded about removing the substitutes from the colloquy: they would not dispute further about the form of the oath if it was first given to be inspected: they had arranged the persons according to the number of states: finally, they would not reluctantly offer all responses in both languages from then on. Therefore, they hoped that after they had conceded everything for the sake of hastening the colloquy, the presidents would take care that the twenty-two voices would be heard separately, then that in each article the opinion of each would be diligently noted, and that they would remove all delay from then on, indeed no one of ours after this liberality of our people would tergiversate either the presidents or the adversaries. But indeed the presidents praised all the other things that we had conceded, but responded as before about numbering the two votes, that they would satisfy the Emperor in that matter with their care and diligence, and that they would exhibit the form of the oath comprehended by them and the legate to us by the response of the presidents given on the third of December. Our people, after a long alternation of several days, had permitted everything to the presidents, and had even dissimulated that slippery and doubtful response about the votes for the sake of hastening the colloquy, they did not change anything more from their opinion, they only insisted by praying that the matter should be started at some time, and that they should come to the colloquy, and it was fully persuaded to us, who were no longer receiving anything more, that the colloquy would necessarily follow. But the presidents began another new and as it were a web. With certain things already rendered from our side, they also pursued it with the other side: then that divine aid should be implored in a grave and great matter, finally that the whole matter should be communicated to the Emperor's legate, and so then it should be come to the matter. Four days were consumed for these four things to be accomplished. On the first day, it was acted with the party, on the second it was communicated with the legate, with both being well aware of all things beforehand, on the third a Mass of the Holy Spirit was sung by them, a public sermon and prayer were held by us, on the fourth it was finally announced to us that we should be ready for the next day. Indeed, this play deceived our opinion so far that it did not even come to anyone's mind to suspect that another matter was being conducted than what was promised. We believed that the conditions of holding the colloquy were seriously proposed, that the adversaries were seriously moved by their difficulty, that the divine service was seriously performed. But when we saw nothing being done, after we had seen everything that is usually done being done, and after we had conceded everything about ourselves, we began to doubt from then on, and to believe that whatever was done was not truly done. Therefore, on the eighth of December, after the sacred rites were performed on both sides, when we came from the temple to the court, expecting nothing but that signal, a far different and new spectacle was presented. For the legate of the Pope, the Bishop of Feltre, entering through the middle of the parties standing on both sides and expecting what should be done, and placed in a lower place than the Emperor's legate, had a speech of this kind: "Our Lord Jesus Christ, most illustrious men," he said, "and before when he lived among mortals always, and then migrating to heaven, prayed to the Father for one thing most of all, that we all might be one. He gave this new commandment, he always inculcated this mutual benevolence of charity to all. The same divine Apostle Paul did everywhere and assiduously. Indeed, this is the one true law of living, and the sum of life, all other things are vain and nothing. If we had been mindful of this precept," he said, "such great enmities would never have arisen among us. But when charity was left behind, and the commandment of the Lord was neglected, you see that this your fatherland is filled with tumult, then slaughters and deadly wars followed, which indeed were so great throughout Germany for some time, that I who had seen it before, can scarcely recognize it now. Therefore, the Roman pontiffs often having pity on this Germany, when they tried to succor its calamities, could never achieve at least to be heard. Paul, the Roman Pontiff, recently called all to a free council with great zeal, both expected by you and often also requested. But when he announced it, and our legates were repulsed, and the mandates were despised, and finally the whole matter was left unfinished. Although he was then forced to defer and reject the council, and to change that proposal for the same reasons, he nevertheless deferred it with the intention that, having found a suitable time, he would at some time pursue what he had begun. And so far indeed no occasion has presented itself, although many have been sought. But now Charles, the firstborn son of the Church, to execute that council of the Pope (as he is the faithful advocate of the Holy Roman Church) has instituted this colloquy and the soon-to-be Diets at Regensburg as a way and access to the general Council, and he ordered and wanted me to be here with you. And because this day is now present, on which the greatest deliberation is held about public safety and the highest dignity of the Church, and about the greatest matters, I pray that you may consider what it is fitting for you to do, and I beseech you by all divine and human laws to have regard for conciliation. I promise all zeal, as far as it concerns me: You give your effort, so that it may be truly understood that you have striven for peace. May the Lord be with you." This was the sum of his speech. But the cause of the introduction of the papal legates seems to have been this. The papal party was very much laboring in the matter of religion, believing it a crime for the authority of the Roman Pontiff to be absent from it, and they were seeking how the power of the Pontiff might be applied so that it would not be intolerable to our people, and so that it would not be openly repelled. They thought this could be done if the legate of the Pope, who was present at that time, was introduced not in the name of the Pope, but of the Emperor, not with a rigid mandate, but with a bland exhortation, not only to us, but to both parties, and thus they would introduce him to us. Nor did this plan deceive them. For since he professed that he had not come in the name of the Pope, but of the Emperor, he was not excluded by a direct protestation from our people as the legate of the Pope. But after this speech, a long deliberation both between the parties themselves and separately, and between the parties and the Emperor's legate, intervened while it was being sought how the legate of the Pope should be responded to. The Emperor's legate, judging it more tolerable that the authority of the Pope should be entirely dissimulated than that his legate should be afflicted with any ignominy in his presence as a witness, when he believed that our people would use a grave protestation against the Pope, labored with all zeal that a response should be given not privately, but as a common response of both parties. Our people, because the adversaries called the Pope both lord and father and most holy and acknowledged him, while we most often noted him as Antichrist and as an enemy of the truth, judged that they could not respond to the same speech with such different sentiments. They said that not even the Emperor himself could obtain this, that they would acknowledge the Pope in those causes. Therefore, they prayed the Emperor's legate that he would respond to the Pope's legate for himself as he most wished and judged best: but that he would either remove this necessity from them or make room for them to respond freely. After a long contest, the legate finally obtained from our people that a response should be given to the Pope's legate as to a private man, with all mention of the Pope omitted. In that response, thanks were first given for that exhortation to peace, then zeal and goodwill towards concord were declared, both in few words, with all mention of the Pope omitted. But there were two things in that speech of the papal legate that our people necessarily had to mention: one, that the Pope, occupying tyranny for himself in the kingdom of Christ and the Church, had given cause for tumults and deadly wars by the division of charity, still destroying those in whom any charity remained with flames. You, as defenders and vindicators of the kingdom of Christ and the Church against his tyranny, by divine grace having arisen, desire nothing else than to preserve charity. Then it had to be shown that if he professed that he was present by the command and authority of the Emperor, not in the name of the Pope, we would willingly bear him as a guest and spectator and helper of peace, and would have thanks: but if he offered us any mandate from the Pope, and declared that what he did here he did by some authority of the Roman Pontiff, we would now at the beginning protest that we would have nothing to do with him here. When all things that are usually prepared for such contests were transacted, and this discussion about the conditions of the future colloquy seemed to be composed, behold, the adversaries found a new and more copious matter for litigation. For on the ninth of December, the form of the oath proposed to the notaries was full of intolerable conditions. Therefore, our people, seeing that the matter was being dragged out deliberately, and that the colloquy was being simulated, not sought, began to look around more diligently for the cause. Before I come to the form of the oath, a few things must be said about that matter. For although this has been the opinion of the Roman Pontiff for many years, that no just colloquy should be held with us, nevertheless, because our people always urged it, it was necessary for the adversaries to at least simulate some meeting. Therefore, when two things were proposed to them, one, to fight outside the range and provoke the enemy from afar: the other, to turn the cause of the delayed and intercepted colloquy onto us: they wanted to achieve the latter by many iniquitous conditions proposed, and the former by spreading rumors and the consensus of many people. But both things turned out against them. For we did not reject all the iniquitous conditions, but we accepted them, with perhaps one and the last excepted, as will soon be understood: and contrary to their expectation, the greatest part of those who were in the colloquy stood with us, not with them: among whom they labored as much in recalling to themselves and averting from us as in finding and proposing iniquitous conditions. Moreover, another and indeed greater difficulty surrounded the adversaries. For not only did those dissent from them on their side, whose opinion about religion was professedly different, and who openly agreed with us: but even those who most wanted to conspire against us with them could not agree among themselves. The theologians and monks were contradicting each other and quarreling daily, speaking without order: especially those who led that troop, Pelargus and Eck. Eck, a veteran soldier, despised Pelargus as a monk and a new man in those contests: on the other hand, Pelargus, as one poorly versed in letters, could not bear Eck as a barbarian and rustic man, inflated with foolish victories. This contention was so great that the Emperor's legate was forced to send his Spanish doctors to mitigate the minds and extinguish the fire, which he would not have obtained unless the fear of the enemy existing nearby had restrained those men for a while. And the anger of the sophists was so great that in this assembly someone could obtain the praise of moderation who was the greatest and most impetuous brawler. About which the legate's response was beautiful, for when our people were urging the hastening of the colloquy assiduously, he confessed at some time that we were not divided, they could not be composed. Therefore, he did not see how the colloquy could proceed, in which all hope was placed in our dissension. But now let us return to the form of the oath proposed by them, which was the matter of the colloquy being protracted until the arrival of the Emperor. It was of this kind. All writings and sayings of this colloquy, annotated and arranged in order by themselves, the notaries should preserve, and neither add nor detract anything: they should make no copy of the acts for anyone outside the colloquy: nor in any way communicate anything about it to anyone, but as soon as they were described by the amanuenses, they should receive them back: afterwards, when the colloquy was finished, with the copies of both sides collated and conformed, they should ratify each other's copy with their subscription. And this indeed was the form of the oath proposed to the notaries. But to the substitutes, that the acts entrusted and credited to them, and described by them, should be returned intact with the utmost fidelity and revealed to no mortal, as soon as they had described them, they should return them to the notaries. In this form of the oath of both, first indeed our side was excluded from all the copy of the acts, then our notaries and substitutes, who were also legates sent to this colloquy, were bound by the religion of the oath not to be able to report anything to those from whom they had been sent when they returned home. Therefore, with these things dissimulated here, our people corrected two things in this form. One, that after the colloquy was held, when there were four autographs of the four notaries, that one should be given to each party, the other two should be reserved for the Emperor. The other, that since these notaries and substitutes were the same or the legates of their princes or cities, they could report about the acts to those from whom they had been sent, and perform the office of both notary and legation with equal fidelity. Finally, it was added, which the nature of things demanded, that it should be allowed to substitute another notary for a notary in some necessity. These things were desired in that proposed form of the oath by our people at the beginning, after that clause was more diligently considered, which provided that no one should communicate anything to anyone, lest anyone should understand this about those who were involved in the colloquy itself, whom it was against the nature of the action to exclude from the copy of the acts, it seemed necessary to add that it should be understood only about those who were not destined for the colloquy. But our people were very much struck by this new request. For first, when the copy of the acts was denied to those who were not legates, then even to those who, although legates, were not destined for the colloquy, it was finally explicitly taken away from all, so that whatever was done would be sent back to the Emperor's legate alone by the presidents. But it seemed against the nature of the action that the parties involved in the action itself could not know what was done. For our people greatly desired and hoped that the autographs of the acts would reach the Emperor, rightly believing that he would at some time have a better opinion about our doctrine when he was informed about it. But that the copy of the acts was not made for the parties, they judged that it was not tolerable in any way. For although the colloquy was to be free and arbitrary, yet because it was to be referred to the next Diets, and from it a prejudice was to be made about our doctrine, they believed it was very much in their interest to know what was done. Certainly, recently in a matter in which our people had no copy of the acts, the adversaries tried to show by the faith of their copies that we had already agreed with them on many things at Augsburg. Moreover, since these matters, about which the disputation was held here, were of such a kind that it was most expedient to know them, whether they were true, so that they should not be dissimulated at all, or false, so that they might be detected as a dangerous error, so that it might be easier to remove the error or restore the truth in a public council, our people did not see to what end it pertained to suppress those disputations, whose arguments it was fitting to be placed in the light, and it seemed that the copy of the acts should be preserved with both parties for the memory of such a matter. They also thought it was unjust and against the faith of the legation that the substitutes, whom we had joined to the notaries as a support from the number of our legates, should not dare to report what was done even to those from whom they had been sent when they returned home. When these same requests and reasons were exposed by our people to the Emperor's legate on the same day, the legate judged that the copy of the acts was not necessary for the parties because this colloquy was free and outside the danger of definition, then he thought it seemed unsafe to entrust it to the parties. For it could not be published without great offense to many, and all this turmoil had arisen from the uncertain publication of books. The Emperor himself, if there was anything useful in the publication, would consult the public good. Here, when our people showed that they could not acquiesce in these conditions, the legate suddenly said: "Therefore you want to impede the colloquy," he said. He then added that he saw no reason why our people should urge the copy of the acts so much, except because they were hastening to publish it. This discussion finally progressed to the point that he said it was up to the Emperor to permit the copy of the acts to whom he wished, and that he would act with the presidents about it, and he showed that he had scarcely brought the matter to this point with great difficulty, that they had tried to deal with us far otherwise, that he dissimulated many things, while they meanwhile cried out that they were being lost. These things were acted by our people with the legate, whom they hoped would be more favorable to the cause than the presidents. From this, they then came to the presidents themselves. They responded that the form of the oath proposed by them still pleased them: that the originals should be returned to the Emperor alone: that he would take care of the rest, that the copy of the acts could be obtained from him in due time, that it was also permissible to request the originals from the Emperor, that it was not fitting to disturb the colloquy because of the substitutes. This response was given on the sixteenth of December, when the form of the oath had been disputed for more or less seven days. The next day, although our people saw that the prejudice of these Diets was dangerous for them, and that whatever was done here would be considered as if it were transacted at the next Diets, although they understood that the Emperor's mandate supported them, which testifies that he appoints notaries to the colloquy so that the parties have something on which to weigh the acts: nevertheless, before they wanted to delay the instituted colloquy, they responded that they accepted these conditions, and would be content with the bare copy of the acts without the autographs, provided it was permissible to request it from the notaries of both parties. They then appointed new substitutes, and finally requested that the colloquy be held without delay. It was already the eighteenth of December when it seemed that everything about the conditions of the colloquy had been completely transacted, and when it was believed that nothing remained but the colloquy itself, the adversaries again excited new causes of delay, and sought a way to extend the matter until the day of the next Diets, which was near. For they also tried to avert the public sermon, and to snatch the votes of the three who stood with us among them, and to make a private colloquy out of a public one. We will speak briefly about each matter. They complained about the sermons, as most hindering concord, to the legate most gravely. Therefore, he so pressed the matter that he greatly disturbed the Senate, for he was indeed acting that the sermon should be abolished at this time. This was new and unexpected to our people, who were voluntarily prohibiting their own from preaching. For they were content with the public sermon, and restrained their own from preaching privately, lest the vehemence and freedom of speech, which the truth of God's word brings with it everywhere, should incite the adversaries, especially since that republic, in which the assembly was held, was not yet completely composed, fluctuating with its factions, as is the case in many places today, leaving equal opportunity for both parties to teach the people, and it had been preached for more than a month and a half without anyone interrupting. But since (as it happens) the preacher who truly proposed the doctrine of Christ in our manner far surpassed, so that the whole people flocked to him alone, leaving the other, and filled the whole temple, especially at this time, when the most excellent men who were present for the controversy of religion attended his sermons, this concourse and applause of the people was intolerable to the adversaries. Therefore, to prohibit this sermon, they acted through the legate. And to make it easier to achieve, they were also prepared to abolish their own sterile one, to which outside of one or two old women no one went: so that during this whole time, while the assembly was there, no sermon would be held. They were about to restore the rite of confirmation, which they had omitted for twelve years, on the day when the people coming to the sermon would be expecting it in vain, so that the matter would present the appearance to the people as if the kingdom of the Pope was restored, and the kingdom of Christ had collapsed in that city on that day. This fomentation seemed sufficient to them to either completely dissolve these Diets or to extend them until the new Diets. Our people, having approached the Senate, showed that the man who had preached for thirteen years before, and now during the whole time of the Diets, without anyone interrupting, could not be removed at this time and in their presence without their ignominy, who had come here for the sake of defending the gospel. It would be shameful for them if, through their fault, not only was the course of the gospel not promoted, not only elsewhere, but even in that place, where they were now especially intent on that matter, it was hindered. Nor was there any example of that matter, since in so many places for twenty years now, both parties had often met about the same matters: but the proclamation of the gospel, about which the contest is, had always been free in those public assemblies. Once the Emperor had obtained that during the time when the Diets were celebrated, the doctrine of the gospel would be silent: but this had been permitted to him then for certain reasons, so that it was excepted with a certain protestation, that he would never ask it from us again. But if silence was imposed on this one, they hoped that they would not deny the place they had denied to this one to their own preachers. They would take care to substitute ten for one preacher, and would guarantee their moderation. But if they also rejected this most honest request, they would signify to their princes that neither their legates nor their doctrine had any place here anymore. The Senate, both led by its own reason and moved by this speech of our people, judged that the sermon should not be abolished at this time. Therefore, they ordered him who had preached so far to continue. But when our sermon proceeded contrary to their expectation, they exhibited the spectacle of confirmation they had instituted on the same day. And indeed about averting the sermon only. But now let us speak briefly about the discussion that was held with those men. There were three legates of the princes who professed our doctrine in these Diets contrary to the adversaries' expectation. The first was the preacher of the Palatinate at Heidelberg, whose opinion the prince knew before the Diets, that it agreed with ours in all things, and that of the others whom he had as theologians in the same academy did not agree, he sent him, passing over those who disagreed with us, whom it was certain would agree. Therefore, it cannot be doubted that this prince singularly studied evangelical concord. The other two legates were the pastor and the theological professor of the Brandenburg Prince at Frankfurt. That prince, offended by the deeds of our adversaries at the last Diets at Hagenau, returning home, immediately made room for the gospel throughout his dominion and not only received the doctrine of Christ, but cultivates it with incredible zeal for himself, so that no one today is believed to read these books about religion more diligently or understand them better: a distinguished and full example of immense consolation for all good people. The last two were the legates of the Duke of Cleves, Conrad Heresbach and Joannes Vlatenus, each of whom with admirable zeal for the public concord of Germany, according to the singular wisdom with which they are endowed, labored. Their prince, as far as is permitted by youthful age and at the beginning of his government, defends the doctrine of Christ excellently, and provides the most certain hope for all good people about himself. But now let us return to these men. Certain forms of speech were proposed to them, so tempered in words that they might seem not well guarded to agree with our doctrine. But when these men first spoke their opinion for themselves and were understood by the adversaries that words were being given to men in vain, they began to deal with the legate of the Palatinate, that he should restrain his theologian, who was obstinate in words, and have him under control. This is what the Bavarians, this is what other princes do, and he should not allow this freedom to the theologians, but respond according to what seemed to them, not to their princes. It was also acted with the prince of the Palatinate himself. But to this most impious request, the legate responded excellently, that the prince of the Palatinate had sent this theologian because he had judged him to be a good man: that he was instructed with this mandate, to apply the rule of a good man's conscience, and according to this to say and do everything in those disputations. The prince could impose a law on the citizens, but not on the consciences of men. Struck by this response, the adversaries, when they saw that they were achieving nothing by this way, attempted another, and began to call each of them to themselves privately, and to examine them, and to propose their opinion in those soft forms, as we said, as if a honeyed medicine, and to give it to be swallowed with all their strength. All the contest was about the merit of congruity, which they affirmed, about the righteousness which is by faith alone, and about the remnants of sin in the saints, both of which they denied. They first made an experiment of this matter with the theologian of the Palatinate, intending to come to the others in order. But indeed that man stood immovable in all things. Therefore, when they had struggled in vain for a long time against this rock, having despaired of the matter, they abstained from this attack on the others, thus it was acted with them. Therefore, when the adversaries had tried all ways in vain to conduct the public colloquy as they wanted, they turned themselves entirely to the plans of a private colloquy. At the beginning, the legate acted through a private man with our Melanchthon, so that he would consent to that matter, showing many things, that unless he did, the colloquy was indeed completely over. The same cause was for the adversaries as for the delay. Melanchthon showed that he was prepared to speak publicly with anyone, and to render an account of his faith. But indeed he would not be the author of departing from that form which had been proposed by the Emperor and received by both parties. He knew and had often experienced that in private meetings, matters are attempted and accomplished by the favor and authority of a few. This was what Philippus said for himself, whose counsel, however, did not abhor any public or private way of seeking concord: but he was impeded by other causes. But our legates responded that they could not act privately because they had no mandate from their princes about that matter, and they had come to the Diets instructed otherwise by them. And this indeed was the cause our people presented: but there was another and greater reason why they judged that this kind of colloquy should be avoided. For they judged it unsafe to deal with those without a witness, whose faith towards them they were compelled to doubt for many reasons. Therefore, this hope of a private colloquy was also cut off for the adversaries. It was already the twenty-sixth of December when our people, having been frustrated in their hope so many times, no longer expected any colloquy, but rather looked homeward, and wished to escape this play, which was being played there with such great expenses, such a waste of time and things, with such ignominy. Therefore, they seriously began to expostulate with the presidents. The speech of our people was grave there: in which many things were said most amply about the greatest contempt of all good people and public judgment, about the greatest neglect of public safety. But indeed the Emperor was not yet near enough to end the battle: the Diets at Regensburg were not yet near enough to call away the contenders. Delay was still needed. Therefore, to the expostulation of our people, the presidents responded that it was not their fault that the colloquy did not proceed: they saw no way to begin it, unless the institution of the Hagenau mandate was observed. Its sentiment was this: that each party should propose its own opinion on the proposed question, not collected from the votes of all, but of the majority, to the Emperor's legate and the presidents either through an interpreter or in writing. Thus constituted and conflated from the votes of the majority from one party, and proposed to the presidents, it should then be handed over to the other party to be examined. There they were prepared to concede that if anything said by one party was not approved by anyone from that party, who was indeed of the number of the majority, that he could offer his opinion to the presidents either in writing or present with them, but both privately and outside the colloquy. But the opinion of those who, in collecting the votes, had not what the majority, but what the minority had felt, should neither be brought into the colloquy nor shown to the opposing party by the presidents, but should be kept in writing until the matter was reported to the Emperor. If our people accepted this, they very much hoped that the colloquy could be held. To these things, our people: that the excuse of delay was weaving delay, and now finally after two months a new form of the colloquy was being sought, and that the sentiment of the Hagenau institution was not this, that a single opinion from one party, collected only from the votes of the majority, should be proposed to the other party, and that if there was any opinion of the minority, it should not be proposed, but reserved, and separately exhibited to the Emperor. They knew that nothing was to be defined here, nor did they even demand that anything should be decided by the plurality of votes: and they understood that the Emperor's rescript was sufficiently clear about this. And these words about holding a Christian and friendly colloquy could not be understood otherwise than that by a free and pious voice, each one chosen for that colloquy, should say things agitated piously and modestly. And that no one admitted to it should be deprived of the free pronouncement of opinion. Finally, if it were done otherwise, it would not conduce to this matter, for if the colloquy were to be conducted according to the proposed manner, the adversaries would want to propose certain dictations of theirs to their own people to urge them to assent, then it would happen that an opinion would be pronounced with them before the other party was heard: nothing more intolerable could be devised in the matter of religion than this. But that they were trying to suppress the opinion of a few dissenters so that it would not become known to the other party, this could not be done without the injury of those princes whose legates those few were, and it would meanwhile perhaps happen that those whose opinion was better and more moderate would be excluded from saying their opinion. Moreover, by this form, which they were now proposing, not so much the plurality of votes, which no one here sought, but the votes of the chosen ones were entirely removed, if only two were given the place to speak, and silence was imposed on all the others. But it was strange why only two should speak, when eleven on each side were destined to speak. But if these eleven were to be silent, what did those twice eleven added from here and there want: about whom it had been provided that they should not say their opinion, but only be present as advocates to those saying their opinion in the cause. Now because it was known that the opinions of the minority were most often better, especially in these matters, in that colloquy where the truth alone was sought without prejudice, it could not be done without religion to suppress anyone's opinion. Therefore, it is certain that neither they themselves understood the Emperor's mandate differently than that the voices and opinions of the chosen ones should be free in this colloquy, and that all should be referred to the Emperor. If this were not done, some princes previously destined by them for the colloquy would now be excluded by the same. Therefore, since this new form contradicts both the Emperor's writing, the mandates of the legates, and the nature of the colloquy, they cannot accept it. Hence, it should not even be asked whether it pleases, for it cannot please. Furthermore, although the adversaries, having already prepared their writing, intended to fight with us, knowing that they were better equipped with style, yet because infinite delay would be caused by writing, they did not want to enter this method of battle. For it was not necessary to convene a colloquy and gather so many learned men if they intended to dispute by writing, and it could have been done better at home, with the adversaries having spent so many weeks here perhaps forging one article: what hope is there if they attempt to pursue all others by writing? But if they propose only brief articles in which our doctrine would be condemned as if by stated opinions, they would endure this much less. There is a controversy about great matters of the Church, which should not be buried with concise opinions and brief definitions, but should be unearthed and revealed in the present colloquy so that they appear, and be copiously confirmed by powerful writing. Therefore, they demand a legitimate form of colloquy, from which if they flee to some other prejudicial forms, they want to testify that it is not to be endured by them and theirs. We have almost reported this form of our response in the very words. Thus, the legates of our princes. In the same sentiment and among the same learned men of ours: They do not ignore what kind of judgments people have about them, but they testify to God that they truly seek concord and profess this doctrine with pious zeal, and believe it pertains to the utmost necessity of the Church: the infinite hardships they have endured for this reason are the best witness. Therefore, having embraced this doctrine with a good conscience, they have come to its defense with the most upright zeal. They beseech the Presidents, since they have come here to be kindly and pleasingly informed about the doctrine, not to allow brief articles to be objected and themselves to be insidiously pressed with bare questioning, but to ensure that the whole cause is handled with a copious and clear exposition. For they were not sent here to receive articles flexibly and insidiously written by the adversaries and bring them home, but to relieve the adversaries' weakness or error with present help, industry, and faith in uncovering obscure matters and aiding the truth. It is unjust to go to votes with both sides not yet heard, which the adversaries are certainly doing and instituting. For it can happen that, having heard the opinion of many on one matter, and having been engaged in the disputations of learned men, some may desist from their opinion. Therefore, this is a grave and intolerable prejudice when votes are preempted before the knowledge of the cause from both sides. They refused the Papal Synod because they would not want to bear the same as judge and adversary. But here there would be less danger for them than here: if indeed, with the adversaries' articles proposed, without any of their handling, it must simply be either contradicted or assented to. They know that it is often said and judged by many that the controversy here is about words, not things, and that it can be removed by a slight moderation of harsher words and a fitting interpretation of the parts. But indeed, those who say this do not see how gravely each side is violated by their opinion. For they themselves are cruel if they shed blood only for words. This is too barbaric a thing, and as if a Sarmatian wanted to kill a German because he uses another language, not his own: we have hitherto suffered too harsh penalties for ignorance if we are punished because we cannot babble enough with the adversaries or speak equally eloquently. We are even accused of crime by them if we disturb the tranquility of the Church and the state with unnecessary word quarrels. Some word battles arise from the impetus and vehemence of those who have descended into this arena, just as we see in almost every contention, that the incited parties exceed the bounds of moderation, willingly conceding and knowing that this is the case. But they are neither difficult to remove nor have they ever litigated about words, although they admit that the propriety of speech should be maintained in the Church. But outside this word battle, the controversy here is about the highest matters: the true worship of God against idolatrous and corrupt, the true invocation of God against superstitious and feigned. If these things are to be called logomachies, then the dissensions and contentions of all nations about religion are logomachies: But Christians should be far from this horrendous way of philosophizing, one true religion exists, handed down and based on the certain word of God, confirmed by the confession of the Catholic Church of Christ, the testimony of the prophets and apostles, in which Christ, the true Son of God, both reigns and imparts salvation to his worshippers. Since this is so, and since the contest is not about trivial words but about the greatest matters, they earnestly pray that new articles, new forms again, do not entangle the matter, time is not drawn out, the cause of Christ is not ridiculed, the freedom of votes is not subverted by art and deceit, but that a free and Christian colloquy is directly approached according to the method of the Hagnoic institution, and with the truth revealed, error is eliminated and removed. The prefects of the colloquy will feel the moderation and leniency of our men here. They truly affirm this about their zeal for concord, desiring to die for it to be piously reconciled. If the adversaries had wanted to bring this sincerity to the reconciliation of sacred doctrine rather than either confirm wicked superstitions or seek a feigned concord, they would have acted no differently than according to our demand, being persuaded that the invincible Emperor Charles's virtue is such that he wants the truth to be revealed, true benefits to be consulted rather than either errors to be defended or the greatest inconvenience of the Church to be longer dissimulated. Therefore, they pray that this request is judged not impudently but from a pious mind. If the adversaries continue to preempt votes, all good people everywhere will easily understand with what mind they came to concord. For it will be that we necessarily complain about such prejudices. But they hope that the Presidents will interpose their authority and bring it about that, once the truth is revealed, with one mind, with one voice, all the Churches celebrate and glorify Christ. Finally, they ask that they be kindly answered to this. This request of the brothers, which we have almost rendered in the words in which it was made, the legates of the evangelical princes together with their presidents both proposed and showed that it pleased them, and at the same time asked that the matter, having been prolonged for so long, find some outcome at least. It was the last of December then. Meanwhile, the legate of Cologne and the Palatinate were appealed to about the same matter. But to these complaints of our legates and learned men, on the second of January, the presidents responded in such a way that they first persisted in their previous opinion, then introduced a new condition, which was by no means suitable either for concord or for the investigation of truth. For they wanted that not the acts individually, but only the main points, in which the parties either agreed or disagreed, be noted. This was then the main opinion of the Presidents. In which, as it was that first natural, and in almost every dispute necessary, that one should speak for many, and two should be composed in a contest, which our men not only willingly admitted but also had long since voluntarily instituted, so in that colloquy, which was about sacred matters and free, and where nothing can be silenced and dissimulated without religion, to give one the power to speak in such a way that silence was imposed on the others (if it seemed good to the other), was completely abhorrent to all reason and greatly inconvenient for uncovering the truth. For it often happens that something comes to mind more easily to the one sitting in the last place, especially where places are attributed not according to each one's industry but according to the status of the Princes, than to the one sitting in the highest place. But that, which was against all forensic use, and against the nature of every public and private action, that the acts should not be noted individually, but only in the main points, our men were very surprised at, and it was completely unexpected why it was now finally denied, which had been previously established by them. For in the very form of the oath, it was provided that the acts should be written individually. But indeed, conclusions, torn from their demonstrations and odious to the adversaries before, now seemed to excite more hatred, having been thrust after the contention, as they could establish the mind of no one: meanwhile, as matters involved, exposed to the calumnies of all, they were twisted and distorted wherever anyone's mind led. There was also this difficulty, that no legate could make a report of the acts to his Prince, at least a just one, if nothing had been noted at all. Since therefore both of the two demands were unjust, whether the chosen ones in the colloquy were prohibited from saying their opinion in the colloquy, or in the action of the greatest matters what had been done was suppressed, as far as it pertained to their part, our men showed that they could concede neither. As for how much the adversaries would concede of their own, they judged it should be cared for and committed to them. To this speech of ours, which was held on the fifth of January, the Presidents responded with difficulty on the eleventh day after January. Therefore, since the Emperor was now near, and the days of Regensburg were approaching, and if a battle were to be entered, it seemed it should be suddenly resolved, the presidents ordered our men to be present the next day and to learn the mind of the Emperor's legate. Their opinion given to our refusal was such. That instead of the others, only two men should speak in the colloquy: from our side, if anyone wanted to add something after them, not fighting with his own side, but agreeing, he should be allowed to do so: (as if they were concerned about us, lest we fight among ourselves) That the acts should be written individually and integrally: that the protests of previous times should be safe for both parties. But whether the opinion of fewer should prejudge the opinions of more, and whether this matter should be referred to the Emperor, or not, did not need a dispute. That matter should be established according to the advice and convenience of each one. On the same day, which was the twelfth of January, our men responded to this in such a way that, since only a response had been given to their request, which aimed at having the voice of all free in this colloquy, from their own side, they understood it to be denied to them from the other side. But they would let it go, as they had done with many other things hitherto, provided that the acts were noted individually, and with the protests of previous times safe, the colloquy would have some outcome at least. The next day, the oath was proposed to the notaries and substitutes, and received by them, and the colloquy was announced to us for the following day. Then there was a four-day disputation, which will appear how it was conducted when it is fully published. But its summary was this. With our confession proposed, the adversaries began to examine the articles in it in order. They agreed on the first ones, for in the common formula of faith, and the most pleasing of the Trinity, no one objected to anything. In the third article, the dispute began about what remained after baptism from the original stain and the depravity of nature, whether it was truly called sin in the saints, which dispute seemed to be the foundation for both parties for the confirmation of their doctrine. For if this force of contagion is not so great that it infests us throughout our life in such a way that it is always ready to destroy and overthrow, as far as it exists in its nature, a very great doubt can arise about the merit of men and the excellence of good work. About which matters the greatest contests exist between the parties. Therefore, our men believed that the utmost care should be taken here. In which matter the incredible power of understanding and speaking and the industry of our Melanchthon was. But the speeches of that man, although of a few days, continuously held about this matter, and what is placed in this controversy, and how ridiculous the contention of the adversaries was, will teach more than enough. On the eighteenth of January, with two men chosen from each side, and called to his house, the legate, when he said that he now understood this matter sufficiently and was sufficiently instructed to inform the Emperor, tried to conform the opinions of the parties. But the adversaries did not have the same opinion on this matter. Some confessed that the remaining original, and from sin, and that it generates sin from itself, and that it naturally opposes the divine law, and that the Apostle speaks in this way about this matter, and therefore it is called sin. Others openly opposed this opinion and testified that they would by no means concede this to us. In the former opinion was Eck, in the latter Pelargus. The other leaders followed these. We could be content with this form brought forward if what was professed in words was truly persuaded to be done by them in reality, and it was strange that in such a manifest matter, after such clear testimonies of Holy Scripture, anyone could hesitate. For if a madman is enclosed in bars and can harm no one, he is not therefore not harmful by his condition. Nor if one can touch hot iron without injury, who is equipped with tongs for that purpose, is the iron therefore not hot by its condition, or unable to burn the holder. Indeed, it is by the grace of God that the raging force and fury of sin in us, surrounded and enclosed by his bars, and grasped by the tongs of faith in Christ, we can hold without injury to ourselves. In which matter it is incredible how that kind of sophists is deluded. They owe that stupidity to scholastic and philosophical teachings, in whose books it is never found, nor does it have faith in their schools, that the infected nature of man, mortally by that contagion, needs to be restored and repaired by the art and power of the Spirit of Christ alone throughout life. But let us return to the remaining narration. While these things are happening on the eighteenth of January, a mandate from the Emperor was suddenly brought, ordering everyone to hasten to the next Diet at Regensburg. Therefore, the legate himself, now completely dismissing both the disputation and the conformation of those opinions, and having only returned the mandate to the parties, was the first of all to leave with great speed, the day after that day when it was sufficiently light. On the same day, which was the nineteenth of January, with all public meetings omitted by both parties, everyone was preparing for departure. Finally, the next day, everyone left. Therefore, this was a three-day and a half-day disputation, and the preparation for disputing was almost three months. This was the end of these Diets. There are two things that spontaneously present themselves to be conjectured by the reader of these. One, that they did not want to hold a colloquy, but to prolong the matter until the arrival of the Emperor: the other, that they tried to turn the cause of the delayed colloquy onto us. The latter matter was sought with unjust demands, as if it should be said that not those who proposed unjust conditions, but those who rejected them, sought delay and fled the colloquy. But it was unjust not to allow the acts to be noted in the main matter: not to permit the chosen ones in the colloquy to speak their opinion: to deny the agents the access to the acts: to exclude the legates sent to the colloquy from the colloquy: not to want to hear the votes of individuals in the sacred matter: to have the accuser speak in the latter place. In which matter they were deceived, because we accepted all these conditions, except for two at most, beyond their expectation. Whence it is clear that our men by no means avoided the colloquy. But when we said in the first place that they avoided the colloquy, it is evident because it was in their power to begin the matter at any moment, it was never in our power. And since we always most urgently demanded it from the beginning, we could never extort it from them. Then they indeed had the arbitrators all from their opinion and faction, except for one legate of the Palatinate, we, on the contrary, had all turned against us. These things are clear, and it is therefore without doubt to see through whom it was prevented. But it is most manifest of all that the colloquy was completely avoided by them, because immediately at the very beginning of the Diets, a day was set for new Diets, and as if a term was set for these Diets with such a narrow interval, that even if it had been agreed to hold a colloquy, yet after such a late arrival of the legate, it could hardly have been instituted, let alone held. But I wanted to be content with a bare narration and leave these things to you to judge. Therefore, mindful of this institution, I will now close the letter in this way. For it would be long to speak of the private colloquy. But as for what we hope for from the future Diets, almost nothing is certain. Farewell in the Lord, and love me as you have begun.</p>
