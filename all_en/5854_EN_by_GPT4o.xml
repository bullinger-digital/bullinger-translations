      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Although I fear, most excellent man, that my unlearned and frequent letters may be bothersome to your excellency, yet because I wish to express my gratitude and cannot do so in any other way at this time, your excellency will therefore forgive me if I act against decorum by writing so often.</p>
      <p>Now indeed, although we have had nothing new at this time that we would consider worthy of your excellency's knowledge, I thought it would be unfair if we were to miss such an opportunity to send letters to your excellency, so I did not hesitate to write some things that were heard here.</p>
      <p>It is heard here that the Muscovite has sent envoys to our king for the purpose of forming an alliance, promising to hand over his son to be educated by him, but on the condition that after the death of our king, he would succeed to the kingdom. However, he suffered a rejection, but obtained the alliance until the feast of Michaelmas.</p>
      <p>Letters were delivered to us not long ago from a parent, from which we understood that we must remain here through the winter for the sake of learning the German language.</p>
      <p>He himself is now setting out against the Muscovite.</p>
      <p>We have so far enjoyed good health by the grace of God, although the air here is not very suitable for Laurentius, as he has been afflicted with a headache for some time, and has also been under the care of a doctor for a while. But the Lord God, who is the true physician, can easily soothe all these pains and restore him to his former health if we call upon Him.</p>
      <p>More I cannot write to your excellency now, as neither the matter nor the time permits.</p>
      <p>Therefore, most excellent man, farewell, and do not cease to love us with your piety and paternal affection.</p>
      <p>Given in Leipzig on the 25th of August in the year of our Lord 1563. Your excellency's most observant Stanislaus Czikowski.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, lord and most esteemed patron in every way. In Zürich.</p>
