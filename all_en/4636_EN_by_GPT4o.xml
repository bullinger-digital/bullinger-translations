      <p>S. I arrived here later than I had planned because, when I wanted to leave Solothurn, I was seized by colic, which tormented me in a remarkable way for three days; but I have finally recovered. Here, I found not a bad beginning of pacification and the people of the Five Cantons finally brought to the point that they accept the path of justice. I will speak privately and familiarly with their envoys and freely reveal to them what I think about this whole matter and their obstinacy. The Lord sometimes allows that, while some provinces enjoy peace after the long inconveniences of wars, others, which have been quiet for a very long time, are set ablaze by foreign or civil wars. Such are the vicissitudes; but those who revere the Lord are preserved, and they enjoy the benefits of peace in Him and also move what is necessary. I am convinced that I will leave nothing undone in this pacification.</p>
      <p>My wife sends you some condiments and cheeses sent to me from the Dauphin√©, which are not bad; you will receive them with a benevolent spirit and love us. I received your three bundles of letters with the leaves, which are most welcome to me.</p>
      <p>The letters will be safely delivered to the one who is in the household of the King of Navarre.</p>
      <p>The authority of this king increases daily, from which many conceive good hope. I am waiting to see what has been concluded in the assemblies, only I fear that peace may not be established among the princes of France. There would be a need for a firmer amnesty than the one that was after Caesar was killed.</p>
      <p>There are various rumors about Philip's death, but still without an author. Greet all friends.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Baden, January 21.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the word of God in Zurich, to be delivered safely. Together with a package covered with linen cloth.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
