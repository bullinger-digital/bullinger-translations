      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. Behold the remarkable turn of fortune. While these are being delivered to you by the messenger who acted on behalf of Johannes Schmid with you, there stood by me another messenger, who was to set out to you the next day, asking that if I wished anything to be sent there, he would diligently take care of it. I truly thank you for that brotherly concern with which you are troubled on my behalf.</p>
      <p>May the Lord, in His usual mercy, who has overwhelmed you with so many gifts of the Holy Spirit, free you from all ailments that hinder your labors for the church of God. Who can doubt that the day of the Lord is near, when iniquity abounds with charity neglected and the Lerna of all vices reigning. Heinius the scribe has sent no booklets, and likewise the brothers have not received the book on Justification; some of the brothers have already bought it in Strasbourg. Therefore, you or rather our Heinius should see to whom they have been entrusted.</p>
      <p>I would write news, but there is nothing new under the sun. Everything is boiling with wars; it has become known that Margrave Albrecht of Brandenburg was indeed defeated, and that Brunswick has declared war on Duke Christoph, but the matter will perhaps be settled by some princes, postponed to another time. In May, there was a meeting of Saxon theologians in Naumburg; Melanchthon was present. Schwenckfeld was again condemned, and it was decreed that neither papist nor Interimist doctrines should ever be accepted, even though both superstitions powerfully reign there, etc.</p>
      <p>They are struggling with the phantoms of Osiander in Prussia; some envoys were sent from Tübingen, among whom the chief is Doctor Jacob Buerlin. If they had done this seriously at first, the matter might have been better; resist beginnings, etc. The Lord will preserve the steadfast and true worshippers of piety. Amen. Many are called, few are chosen.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray for me, as I will do the same for you. Farewell again and forgive the hasty pen. Riquewihr, July 12, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erbius.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, brother in Christ to be respected.</p>
