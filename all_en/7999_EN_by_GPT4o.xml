      <p>Gentlemen, although the principal help and support we can seek in this lamentable time is the fervent prayer of the good and faithful servants of God such as you, and of whom we humbly beseech you to assist us in our necessity. It is also for the relief of the infirmity of many poor desolate faithful that it seemed expedient to those who, by the grace of God, have been saved in these parts, to seek some means such as the bearer, a minister of the word of God, will make known to you, in which I humbly beseech you in the name of the poor remnants of the French churches scattered in these parts to lend us favor, counsel, and assistance, as those whom God proposes to you the necessity they have. I will not extend this letter further, leaving it to the sufficiency of the said bearer to declare to you what he has heard and seen of the desolation that is in our kingdom. I pray to God that He may appease His wrath upon it and grant you, Gentlemen, a very happy and long life with continual increase in His holy graces, humbly recommending myself to your good graces.</p>
      <p>From Mömpelgard this 12th of September, etc.</p>
      <p>Your humble and obedient friend and brother, Vezines.</p>
      <p>Gentlemen and good friends, Messrs. Bullinger and Gwalter, faithful ministers of the word of God in Zürich.</p>
