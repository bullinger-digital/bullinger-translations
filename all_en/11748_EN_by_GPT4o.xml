    <p xml:id="regest1">We have learned that the Basel Council wants to release the Quran for sale if a foreigner takes on the role of publisher and neither Oporin nor Basel is mentioned; Theodor Bibliander, as the actual author of the publication, who had a lot of work comparing manuscripts, is willing to do so, but did not want to act without their knowledge from the very beginning. In view of Bibliander's good reputation, who wants to combat the Turkish faith with his work and promote the Christian one, they hope the council will be satisfied with this. If a single name should not suffice, all the signatories would be willing to vouch for Bibliander, but the glory for the arduous work belongs to him alone. They are convinced of the great benefit of this work; just as the Pope was not overthrown by the weapons of pious emperors, but by the public debate with his [canonical] law and doctrine, they hope the same will happen to the deceiver Mohammed. Oporin may use this letter [towards the council]; for this purpose, they have signed it by hand.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, especially trusted and beloved lord and brother, we have joyfully learned that the honorable council of the city of Basel has opened the possibility for you to have someone else take on the role of publisher for the Quran and release the book in his name, without mentioning yours or the city of Basel's name, should he wish to sell the books. Our dear lord and brother Theodor Bibliander, reader of the Holy Scriptures in the church of Zurich and our faithful teacher, has also informed us that he intends to take on this task, to have his name set for the book, in the manner that an honorable authority desires, since he is actually the author of this book, which is printed, and has undertaken great work in collating the manuscripts, etc. All of which he does not wish to do without our prior knowledge, since he initially acted with our knowledge and advice, etc.</p>
      <p>Such a proposal and intention could not displease us, as we know thoroughly what great work, diligence, and effort he has put into the aforementioned book, also with the intention of seeing nothing else than the honor of God, namely that the shameful Turkish faith is broken and opposed, and the holy Christian faith is promoted. We are also of good hope that an honorable council in Basel will be satisfied with the aforementioned lord Theodor's name and offer, since he is actually the author, and also has a good and excellent reputation throughout all churches, due to his office and also particularly high gifts, richly bestowed by God.</p>
      <p>However, if his name is not yet so well known among some, which we cannot imagine, and therefore it might be considered that a single person is not enough, we truthfully and with good intention inform you with this present writing that the aforementioned our dear lord and brother Theodor does this with our unanimous advice and prior knowledge, and therefore has all of us and each one in particular to support him; also desiring from the bottom of our hearts to partake in the good work, so that the holy Christian faith is protected and the shameful Turkish and antichristian is opposed, and as far as fairness and justice may allow, and also if necessary, we would endure that our names are also set for it. However, it is neither fair nor right that those who want to bear the same name in the honor and praise of the good deed with the rightful author, who have not suffered as much effort and work as the rightful author; here our beloved brother Theodor is the rightful author, therefore we gladly grant him the honor, which he will certainly have among the churches; but we do not separate ourselves from him in this matter, but we stand entirely by him. We are also entirely confident that an honorable and wise council in Basel will be satisfied with his or even our support and will return the books to you.</p>
      <p>And certainly, we would not take on or burden ourselves with this matter so highly if we did not think and firmly hope in God our Lord to achieve much benefit with it. We know that nothing could be broken from the Pope with the sword of the powerful emperors Frederick, Henry, and other pious emperors who fought against the Pope; but as soon as the Pope's law was opened and dealt with in writing against his doctrine, he fell. We hope the same will happen to Mohammed, the greatest deceiver. May God grant grace for this.</p>
      <p>You may also use this letter, if necessary, for this purpose we have signed all our names with our writings below, given in Zurich on December 14, 1542.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church at the Great Minster</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>Caspar Megander, pastor of Zurich at the Lesser Minster (Fraum√ºnster).</p>
      <p>Rudolf Walthard, pastor of the church of St. Peter Zurich.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Schmid, deacon at the Great Minster Zurich.</p>
      <p>Conrad Pellican, minister of the church of Zurich, professor of sacred theology.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, our especially trusted and beloved lord Johannes Oporinus, citizen of Basel.</p>
