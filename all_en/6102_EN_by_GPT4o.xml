      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you a few days ago, and our Calvin also, who now again, if ever before, struggles with the most severe pains. Since that time, we have only received this news: that Brissac, one of the four marshals of France and the governor of Normandy, by the grace of God, has died of illness in Paris. By the grace of God, I say, because he was a most impure man and a most hostile enemy of the truth.</p>
      <p>However, who will succeed him is still unknown, except that it is probable that some autocrat not much better will be chosen.</p>
      <p>It is added that an agreement has been reached on the conditions of peace between the French and the English, which I wish were true. Yesterday, someone passed through here along with that regular envoy of the king to us, who seriously discusses entering into a common alliance with all our people. However, what I think of the envoy I have already written to you before.</p>
      <p>I am glad that a more religious, as I hear (for otherwise I do not know the man), and more prudent count has been attached to him. I cannot see what could prevent you from entering into an alliance yourselves.</p>
      <p>Indeed, there seems to be no better way to strengthen the French churches and especially ours, which otherwise, as far as I can guess, is brought into extreme danger, since many do not doubt that soon, with the restoration of Savoy's dominion, we will be surrounded by him, who is well known not only to be entirely inclined to our destruction of his own accord but also to be incited by the pope and that whole faction with certain rewards proposed to utterly destroy us.</p>
      <p>He will indeed promise much, but who will fulfill it? Therefore, I see that we must fix our anchor in heaven, where our God reigns, who will certainly save us even if we are deserted by all.</p>
      <p>I ask, therefore, that if ever before, now you be concerned about our altars and hearths. Moreover, these days I read Brentius's response, that is, a horrendous example of infamy.</p>
      <p>I will also perhaps respond with something, in the name of the French churches, if only I can obtain his French Catechism.</p>
      <p>For I wish to seize this opportunity and dedicate a book to Prince Christoph, although I will await your judgment before I undertake anything.</p>
      <p>I lost the only copy of our Martyr's Dialogues that I had in France, along with many other of my belongings. Therefore, I would like to buy it there, since I could not obtain it here at any price, as our booksellers are more negligent than is fair in acquiring good books. Our Calvin could not see the Consul of Chur, whom you had recommended to me, not even on his return. I gladly visited and greeted him.</p>
      <p>In the case of the Pelisari, what I had predicted to them happened, namely that their embassy fell at a very inconvenient time, with almost all of ours absent from the court, so that I could not help them with any recommendation, although otherwise, I would have gladly done so for your and their sake. Farewell, my father, and help this church afflicted in many ways as much as you can, and earnestly commend it to the Lord. All the brothers and colleagues greet you.</p>
      <p>I also wish that all the brothers and fellow ministers there be very much greeted from me.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you and all of them and bless your holy labors. Geneva, April 11.</p>
      <p>Yours, Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a father to me much to be respected and a truly faithful pastor of the Zurich church. In Zurich.</p>
