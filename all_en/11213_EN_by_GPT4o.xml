      <p>By no means, most learned man, does that Athenian seem to think rightly, who asserts that the proverb: "Friends who live far away are not friends" is the most inhumane of all, as if the memory of absent friends is usually erased from the tablet of the human heart, when in fact the saying itself has not provided people with an occasion to act inhumanely, but the inhumane forgetfulness of some fickle friends has found both place and use for the proverb. For indeed, some lukewarm lovers become so immediately sluggish and almost lethargic, that when friends are first removed from their sight by even a slightly longer distance, forgetfulness creeps into their minds even suddenly, just as they assert that those who have drunk from the river Lethe become forgetful of their former life and past things. Therefore, fearing such a destructive erasure of my acquaintance in your mind, because I had heard that greetings and letters were being sent back and forth and yet no mention at all was made of Beat (Batt), although now not your dearest friend, yet once your most faithful and hardworking comrade, I could not restrain myself from providing and stirring up a new reminder of myself with these my letters, lest by burning with vain hope and panting with fruitless expectation I do nothing else than those who await hyperborean and very late fruits, if indeed I had not been so troublesome and importunate as to have thus anticipated you by writing, if I had not assumed that my name had not yet been erased from the list of your friends. I do not wish here (as many most idle laborers are accustomed to pretend) to put forward such arduous affairs, as if either I had not the slightest leisure left to write, or you could scarcely read the letters of friends. For both of us have time to do both, if only we wish. Therefore, since I not only anticipate you but also boldly provoke you, I earnestly ask that you take it in good part and respond and provide me with instruction or information on how I might be reconciled to your synod. For hardly anything pains me more than being excluded from the congregation of presbyters.</p>
      <p>But perhaps it is fruitful for me to hide away for a time as if excommunicated among the filth and there with labor somehow provide for my sustenance, so that my spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord, so that this does not perish like the body, and thus my whole external man with all temporal things almost perishes. I earnestly ask and beseech you by Christian charity, as much as you can, to strive to help and assist in these very difficult matters; when you do this, you will both imitate Christ our shepherd and render a most pleasing service to Beat (Batt).</p>
      <p>Farewell, and always remember me. Greet, I pray, in my name your brother, my dearest companion and godfather, your mother and wife with all dear to you.</p>
      <p>In Basel, from the Hervagian press, September 8, 1538. Beat (Batt) Gering, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and renowned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
