      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I give great thanks to God for the pacification of the prince of the Republic of Geneva. For as each point of the pacification seems not only tolerable in my judgment but also good, the wise decision to extend the time to the 23rd year is by far the most useful, and that for many reasons, which all prudent people see. And in this respect, it seems that this republic owes much to yours, which has led the rather uncertain matter into this quite safe harbor, if only it is wise. I pray to the Lord to bless this pacification and to lead it to the most holy and best end. But the treaty struck with the prince is not at all disapproved by me, as its conditions do not seem to conflict with the word of God, but also somehow benefit the church. For I hope they will be better received, which were recently returned to the prince by our/your most honorable magistrate. What is more, this aid from the prince seems to deter those who only consider these civil matters, from whom there is even more danger than from those who know God and do not judge only according to the flesh. God certainly has various ways of preserving His own in peace. Meanwhile, as time is drawn out, minds also soften and change. It is rightly said: "Rome was not built in a day." Nor did the church throughout the world grow and attain peace within a few years. The efforts of those who wanted to disturb or completely overthrow the peace in every way are displeasing. For I believe that saying of the Savior to be very true: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God." Thus, secret and deceitful practices have never brought any good. From Heidelberg, Mr. Dathenus, the court preacher, writes to me and is almost angry with me for not disapproving of Erastus's theses, which he says open the way to atheism, etc. I will respond to him. And I think this is a splendid example of future actions. Whoever does not worship these men and extol their excommunication to heaven will be considered atheists and impious by them, no matter how excellent their faith and blameless and holy life may shine.</p>
