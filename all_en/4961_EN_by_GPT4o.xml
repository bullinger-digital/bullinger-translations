      <p> Greetings. I wrote to Mr. Gwalther the day before yesterday about certain matters, as I thought our Usterius was about to leave; but he is reluctant to part from here, so he still remains. Meanwhile, we have received further news from France that Beza is preaching at the court with great applause, that the state of the kingdom has convened and three of their parties are seeking a colloquy, with only the fourth opposing, among whom are the ecclesiastics, as they are called. They excuse themselves by the Pope's interdiction, which prohibits them from discussing anything about religion outside of a council. Cardinal Ferrara, the Pope's legate, is focused on this; other messengers sent by the Pope follow him daily. He arrived in Lyon on the first of September. </p>
      <p> It is also written that Ferrara has orders, if he can achieve nothing, to proceed directly to Spain to Philip and incite some unknown disturbances. The Duke of Cond√© and the Duke of Guise are in such a sharp conflict with each other that it almost leads to a bad massacre; however, the old queen intervened, and it was reconciled on the 26th of August. The Duke of Savoy has ordered an inquisition in the land of Piedmont concerning the faith, especially among the nobility, and those found to be Lutheran are to be punished as much as their higher status allows. But his judges and administrators have reported that they cannot do it, or they would have to flee the country. This is also the state of affairs here. </p>
      <p> The devil is active everywhere; but God is always stronger. I wanted to add these things quickly to the previous ones. </p>
      <p> May all of yours be well. </p>
      <p> Bern, 13th of September, 1561. </p>
      <p> Your H[aller]. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished Mr. Bullinger, his dearest father and compatriot. Zurich. </p>
