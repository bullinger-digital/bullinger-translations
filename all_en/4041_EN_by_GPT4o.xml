      <p>Greetings. Ungnad, who writes to you, most illustrious men, although he is a man of great stature due to the glory of his illustrious deeds, yet I dare to promise and affirm before God that he surpasses all in piety. Therefore, whatever you bestow upon this man, consider it as given to God the best and greatest. I urge you to hasten the matter, and if possible, write your judgment through this messenger, who must be here within five days (for he is to be sent to Ungnad). But if your affairs prevent you, I ask that you consider the matter as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The one I send, I affirm to be a simple, good man; he would serve a good man faithfully in domestic matters, I have recognized his own, or he would not be too inconvenient even for an innkeeper. If you can assist him in this matter, I will take upon myself all your actions.</p>
      <p>Greetings and farewell, most excellent men.</p>
      <p>Many greetings to Frisius.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 11, in the year 59.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted F. Herold.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger and Theodor Bibliander, lords and friends.</p>
