      <p>Greetings. I received your earlier letters, which you arranged to be delivered through Lutius' son, and the later ones, which some good man delayed for three whole days upon the young man's return. In those letters, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, you admonish us about lifting up our heads, and you do so with words that reflect both Christian prudence and fervent charity, and indeed the spirit of Christ. This moves me greatly, as the matter itself seems to urge me in that very direction wherever I turn, unless, God forbid, we wish to knowingly and prudently be swept away and perish with the world that is soon to collapse and fall headlong.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore pray to Christ, the best and greatest savior, to lift us up from the ground where we lie so miserably, and to hold us firmly once we are raised, so that we do not fall back. May He open the eyes of the blind and lift them to Himself, so that all our endeavors are directed with utmost zeal towards Him alone, as the goal of our entire life. For thus, even if we must pass through fire and water to find relief, we will break through all the world's evils with lofty and unyielding spirits.</p>
      <p>Do not doubt that the blood of the saints is craved by that abominable monster Giovanni Maria del Monte, which the hinges of hell have finally released after a long incubation and thrust into the Christian world. What else would the Hermaphrodites produce, frolicking between heaven and earth, but neither men nor women, as a pasquinade humorously alluded to here, writing that Pope Paul had to become an old woman in hell, just as once a woman received the papacy. Let there still be a mixed gender, namely Maria of Palestrina, etc., who will plot against the blood and safety of both sexes!</p>
      <p>How much happier and of far better omen is your offspring here, my Bullinger, which brings public salvation to all, provided they are willing to receive it, as certain as the other brings imminent destruction to many. Then, just as these carnal cardinals have formed the pope, marred by execrable blasphemies, into that beast which will open its mouth in reviling against God and those who dwell in heaven, and which all who dwell on earth will worship, whose names are not written in the book of life, and to whom it will be given to make war with the saints, so you, in the dedicatory letter of your third decade, are bringing forth an angelic King of England, who is entirely shaped to the divine hand and uniquely desires in every way to propagate the kingdom of Christ Himself. And here, my soul, what can I say to you and how much do I owe you for the firstfruits of your labors given to me, that is, for the first copy of your most Christian sermons that came from the printing office? So much indeed, that I will never be able to repay it. Certainly, for many years I have often anxiously pondered how I might testify to you a grateful heart in return for those great and innumerable benefits you have shown me, and yet I never found anything worthy of you, even when my fortunes were still intact; how much less, therefore, now that they are so greatly diminished, will I find! I see clearly that I will be overwhelmed by your more than princely munificence, unable to match it, even if I were to give myself entirely as your servant. But there is one Father in heaven, from whom every good gift comes; whom I will continually beseech with earnest prayers to fulfill my part with His inexhaustible kindness and to bestow upon you and all yours, from the full horn of His riches, both temporal and eternal blessings of body and soul, and this all the more because He knows that He Himself is so greatly loved and honored by you in me, a man of no account, and adorned with such honorary gifts.</p>
      <p>In your other letter, it was most pleasing to learn that you would have helped Alexander's cause even without my recommendation, but that you will now assist much more diligently after my recommendation. Thus it cannot be otherwise than that Alexander, his mother, and I will achieve our desires. Would that it were so, for we very much wish it, so that we might be able to respond in some way to your great benevolence and service!</p>
      <p>That you so lovingly invite me, not once but through our Butler, and now also through your sweetest letters, to visit you there, and offer yourself as a host and your house as a lodging, both of which are by far the most welcome of all, I consider it a remarkable benefit and am most grateful.</p>
      <p>And I would have long since anticipated this invitation of yours with my timely arrival and resolved to present myself to you, my incomparable and truly greatest friend, and to the other most learned and holy men who are with you, had not uncommon reasons, among which these have been the chief, detained me until now, namely that I always greatly fear lest I be an untimely interrupter to you or cause you to lose time and resources on my account.</p>
      <p>Having experienced it myself, and many others also know, your excessive and very costly hospitality in receiving and treating guests, which alone could deter me and those like me who are more frugal from daring to come there. Yet I hope that we will be together sometime this summer and embrace each other in the Lord and take mutual consolation through your faith as well as mine.</p>
      <p>At the end of the latter letter you wrote, you ask that I diligently read the book you sent; which was not necessary, since I hold your books in such high esteem that I greatly wish to be able to handle them continuously day and night. Then you also ask that I deal with you candidly and brotherly, that is, freely, to show what I think should be placed differently or omitted, which was even less necessary to add; for not only modesty but also my love for you prevents me from assuming that role; for it says that I owe it, and this indeed denies that I can perform it, lest you be unaware of what kind of judge affection, and especially love, is believed to be. I will say once and truly that nothing that comes from you can displease me. Farewell in our Lord Jesus Christ with your most chaste wife and sweetest children and your whole household, whose sacred and faithful prayers we uniquely desire and hope to be aided by before the heavenly Father. The most pious and best men, the venerable leaders of this church, reverently greet you and commend themselves to you. Greet in the Lord those who are your fellow ministers and assistants there. Farewell again. Winterthur, March 14, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable and greatest friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
