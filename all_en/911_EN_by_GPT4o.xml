      <p>S. The marriage of such close blood relations, about which I spoke with you at length when I was in Zurich, has rested in ashes for some time; but now, with the husband's return from Spain, it has flared up again; such is the obstinacy of the ministers of our church, who deny that they can be absolved from the conscience of this bond.</p>
      <p>The matter displeased Antonius Zilius at first so much that he implored my help to persuade the senate not to admit such a foul and scandalous matter. When that was achieved, he, persuaded by Fortmüller, I believe (for I cannot convince myself that he was corrupted by gifts), completely defected from me. Kessler also, who previously wavered himself, went along with Fortmüller's opinion. Only Sertorius remains, who, although he thinks differently from them, does not openly dissent, certainly with a damnable dissimulation, which he excuses by the pretext of avoiding offense. Fortmüller says that the third degree is permitted by divine law for marriage, whereas I, on the contrary, say that it is permitted according to equal law and the second degree, because Scripture has not excepted this. He himself admits, however, that it is not permissible to contract in the second or third degree if the magistrate has forbidden it by enacted laws. I deny and strongly deny that human laws should be valued more by churches than the law and will of the Lord, especially if they disagree. These two things, however, disagree: to permit and to prohibit, and the apostle did not want to restrain by his own decrees what the Lord had left free.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I asked Fortmüller why he does not adhere to this law of God, which commands that minors, who are under the power of parents or guardians, should neither pledge nor contract, since the same laws of princes and magistrates have provided for and nullified what has been attempted by them under a prohibiting law. Is the marriage bond so light and vile that it should not be held by that law? And is it credible that these words: I take you as my husband or I want to have you as my spouse, etc., have such divine legal efficacy that even if uttered by a simple and minor girl without the knowledge of her parents or guardians, they make a sacred marriage, even if she was persuaded by deceit and arts or certainly seeks her own advantage for the sake of a dowry, with blood protesting? To conclude briefly, most learned Bullinger, openly and not without offense to our church, the ministers and magistrates disagree; but they disagree in such a way that our senate conducts itself very modestly. For it acknowledges the authority of the priesthood and even reveres it in the name of Christ, while in the meantime the ministers press their case with great contention. Our senate, however, requests from yours that it be diligent in this matter, so that, since not all ecclesiastics of other cities, as we have heard, agree with you, this matter, along with others perhaps to be discussed, may be brought to a clear conclusion in a friendly conference at some convention, appointed for a certain day with the good grace of other cities, by the leading ministers of the cities sent to Zurich; and perhaps it would be advantageous, in those critical times and circumstances, to hold a synod of learned men, lest we seem to have completely neglected each other or abandoned the mutual care of religion. The senate has also decided that they should fully acquiesce to what has been decreed with your consent.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the senate has ordered me to ask you to ensure that it is so arranged among your people that the truth may be consulted in our churches (to which alone deference is always due). We would send Fortmüller and Zilius or perhaps Kessler, so that they might either teach others or be taught themselves, etc.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, a council has ordered the establishment of several hundred more horses than before, and certainly a related imperial diet is to be held, as today a letter was sent to my lords by an imperial chamberlain, which I have now received; and they think well, if it is heard, that the same will be sent to my lords of Zurich, although the chamberlain told me that it is to be sent in the same manner to the cities of Basel and Schaffhausen, the abbot of St. Gallen, and others in the confederation. He mentions making the rebels of his religion more obedient, who have long since submitted to the recognition of a legitimate Christian council.</p>
      <p>One of our native citizens recently had something to accomplish with the abbot of Kempten, to whom he came to the castle of Liebentann, etc.</p>
      <p>And when they were discussing the diet at a banquet, he asked his grace whether the emperor, under the name of rebels, would also include the Swiss? (for this abbot carries not a little knowledge of the emperor's affairs).</p>
      <p>The abbot said he believed not. There will also not soon be any dealings concerning the rebels and a council, before and until his majesty brings his secret plans to an end for his own matters; for he intends to recover the imperial crown from the electors after his death, and his first words will be: This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased; listen to him. Thus the abbot cited the scripture, as is the manner of monks. And yet the emperor does not indicate this with any word in his proclamation; for it is entirely contrary to his brother Ferdinand.</p>
      <p>I am concerned here about all sorts of treachery from the prince of Savoy, which we (as I fear) will experience; for I have credibly heard that the cathedral provost of Basel, from Lumpen- or Gumpenberg, along with his associates, is seeking restitution with the common confederates and that the nobility is said to have promised them support. So, Don Ferdinand Gonzaga is said to have his agents in the three leagues, who are undertaking to alienate them from the king of France and to persuade them to make friendship with the emperor and king, etc. This is now a clear example of the division he intends to create among us. I have also learned from trustworthy honorable people (though in great secrecy) that King Ferdinand, after his arrival in these lands, intends to dissolve the land court in Thurgau by means of letters and seals into his hands and to finally secure it from the city of Constance through appointed officials, and some N. are said to have already pledged to him. All these will be attempts to seize a confederation and seek an occasion to make them rebels and have good cause to outlaw and ban or to wage war against them.</p>
      <p>The people of Constance are said to have resolved to detain no one against their will and pleasure, but to let them leave their city, yet with the reservation that one who departs should leave the tenth penny of his goods to a council and the government therein. And recently an honorable citizen has given up his citizenship and asked a doctor, who is an associate of the one from Polweyler and yet very well connected, for advice on where he thinks it is appropriate to move, and he has expressed a great desire to join a confederation. To this, the aforementioned doctor said that he should by no means move into the confederation, but should await the current imperial diet, after which he will learn well where it is appropriate for him to move, etc.</p>
      <p>Now no one can follow the plans of these people with certain calculation, whether they are doing it to frighten and hold back or whether they intend to take the direct path to fetch the lord among us or not. But be it as it may, it is good to be vigilant, as otherwise no one is favorable to us.</p>
      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, May 24, 1550. Your Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious city of Zurich, to be revered in every way.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
