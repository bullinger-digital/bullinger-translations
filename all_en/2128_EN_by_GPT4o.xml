      <p>Meanwhile, while I write nothing, the unfortunate Servetus was thrown into prison in Geneva. Our brothers conferred with him. The beast resisted arrogantly and stubbornly. Finally, after the debate, the most honorable senate of that republic sent him to us. We approved the judgment of the brothers. We condemned the blasphemies of Servetus. The same was done by other churches, those of Bern, Schaffhausen, Basel, etc. And since he persisted in his blasphemies, he was burned at the end of October in Geneva. That wicked man published a book full of horrendous blasphemies. You will report this to the most illustrious prince, whom I am surprised remains so silent.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 29, 1554. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Matthias Erb, pastor of Riquewihr, his esteemed and dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr.</p>
