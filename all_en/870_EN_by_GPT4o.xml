      <p>Johannes Blasius to his Bullinger, Greetings.</p>
      <p>I finally received your letter, along with the Decade, addressed to the most reverend bishop, on the 27th of March, at almost the same hour when the distinguished orator of the city of Z端rich was about to depart. In these letters, among other things, I noticed your kindness, wondering greatly why I have not deemed it worthy to write to you about our perplexing affairs. About which I have so far thought it better to write nothing than little; however, I will write shortly, when I have obtained the conclusion of this tragedy; yet all controversy still hangs under judgment, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I will deal with the bishop as you have instructed me; you will know shortly who will receive me. Those favorable news about the progress of the gospel from England were most pleasing to us.</p>
      <p>Finally, nothing at all is written from Italy; everything is still calm. Mr. Vergerius has been called to Engadin, which is part of our federation; there he preaches not without fruit. He writes that he will soon visit the people of Z端rich and Basel, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Given at Chur with a hasty pen, 27th of March, 1550. The same yours, Blasius, from the heart.</p>
      <p>All the pious greet you. In the meantime, I have also received those things which you sent to Mr. Baccaria; they will be taken care of with diligence.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian, pastor of the church of Z端rich, Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Z端rich.</p>
