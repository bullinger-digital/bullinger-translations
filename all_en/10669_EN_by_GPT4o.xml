      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ Jesus, along with my willing services beforehand, dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Since Doctor Johannes Zwick has not had the opportunity to write to you as needed, he has asked me to step in and request you to kindly speak to the bearer of this letter and assist him in his matters, as well as provide him with advice. What these matters are, you will learn from him directly. Although he is of little renown, he is a born powerful nobleman from Vienna in Austria, furthermore very learned and a lover of all scholars. He has asked Doctor Johannes to provide him with counsel in his matter. Perhaps he will also request one from you. If he shows you other counsels, you should also demand Doctor Johannes's counsel, if he does not show it himself, and you should not neglect this, as Doctor Johannes has earnestly instructed me. Whatever new events there are in Rome, from where he will soon ride, he will inform you well.</p>
      <p>I hereby send you a letter, recently issued in Augsburg, from which you will learn the latest news regarding the Emperor's campaign.</p>
      <p>With this, you are always entrusted to God along with your dear wife. Tell her also, she should not be worried, I will soon send her a pretty apron.</p>
      <p>Given in Konstanz, 25th of August, in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Gregor Mangolt, your always willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the man of notable piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his lord in Christ, always to be respected.</p>
