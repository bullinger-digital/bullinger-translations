      <p>S. Regarding my judgment in that marriage case you mentioned, I will inform you within a few days, and I ask you not to reply to anyone before you have read my letters. But I have learned well from your letters that you will do so, unless I am mistaken.</p>
      <p>Recently, we have received the following certain news: that the Emperor (Kaiser) arrived in Ulm at the end of June and sent his son, Prince Philipp, to Donauw√∂rth to travel to Nuremberg, where he is supposed to have his lodging until he receives further instructions from his father. This is all the more credible to me because it has been written from Nuremberg to here that the gentlemen there have prepared a remarkable small gift, etc., to honor the prince according to his appearance.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is moving with a large number of cavalry to Augsburg, and stables for 7,000 horses have been prepared; he certainly has wonderful plans in mind.</p>
      <p>It is feared that heavy burdens will be imposed on the cities of the empire; and it is currently believed that he will leave Switzerland in peace until he brings some under the yoke according to his liking. In summary: the most severe plans are against those who have been and might remain Lutheran. May God support the truth. Some think that the Duchy of Swabia will be reestablished. In summary: there is no doubt that from the grim conspiracy of the shorn council with the princes, who are hostile to the truth, tyrannical plans and decisions will be sufficiently present, etc. King Ferdinand is still at the beginning of this month in Munich with Duke Albrecht, his son-in-law, but not stronger than with 1,200 well-equipped horses. He might also move closer to Augsburg upon the Emperor's arrival.</p>
      <p>It is also said that Pope Julius will arrive in Augsburg with a strong delegation. He currently has no runners (messengers) in Baden (as I hear), neither Rosinum nor Frankum. They might be courting in other places, as time will reveal.</p>
      <p>Our Laelius Coccinus, a learned and upright man, went to Nuremberg the day after he arrived, having obtained a pleasant companion, treated very amicably by our people and honorably by the Italian merchants, of whom we have several.</p>
      <p>He said he would send letters to yours from Nuremberg. We gladly received the news from England that you indicated. I gave the letters to the ministers to read, who express great thanks to you. Truly good men in every way, except that they are so greatly mistaken in that marriage so wickedly and impiously contracted. Farewell and expect longer letters. St. Gallen, July 6, 1550.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the City of Zurich, a man to be especially respected.</p>
