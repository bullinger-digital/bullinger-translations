      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote to you through Andreas Jodocus and now I truly have nothing to add, except for those common matters, which you will learn with less trouble from the one who delivers the letters, Master Albert, for which you will forgive the brevity. Indeed, the reason I do not commend Albert himself to you is because your singular love and benevolence towards his father, Georg von Stetten, I know, will not allow you to rest until you have ensured that he meets our expectations, which will be easy for you; for he is not of such a nature that we can promise ourselves something remarkable about him (I speak, however, of the cultivation of his intellect and learning); yet he is progressing somewhat, if not further. I have not yet received anything from Haller. I would like to know what is happening with the boy pharmacist, as the horses from Stetten are to be returned empty. I wrote to Dr. Gwalther and Wolf last month; since they have not replied, they will not be surprised to receive nothing from me now, but you will convey my many greetings to them as well as to Haller and Simler. As for the rest, farewell, my most humane Dr. Bullinger, and continue to love me.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, 10th of September, 1567.</p>
      <p>Matthias Schenck, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, to be respected and friend.</p>
