    <p xml:id="regest1">A letter from [Kaspar] Hedio made Gast sad, because soldiers have devastated the Bishopric of Fulda and are moving into the land [Hadeln], which was once as free as Switzerland, not far from Hamburg, which they are ravaging with murder. The Duke of Lüneburg [Ernst] is said to be standing with a large army in arms to destroy those who allegedly belong to Emperor [Charles V]. - The chancellor [Jakob Omphalius] of the Bishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] is said to be a traitor and is supposed to have taken refuge with [Charles V] or the Cologne clergy. - The Count Palatine [Friedrich II of the Palatinate] has scheduled a shooting in Heidelberg for the princes. There, they will undoubtedly deliberate about Germany, because they must finally come to an agreement to be able to expel the Spaniards from Germany. - Gast asks Bullinger to recommend the extremely suitable, evangelical-minded, and educated Martin Peyer as a successor for the deceased city clerk [Werner] Beyel to the [Zurich] councilors. - He is expecting Bullinger's letter. He will soon send a catalog of new publications to [Konrad] Gessner, who will pass it on to Bullinger. - [P.S.:] If the Zurich printers do not want to publish [Gast's] sermons on the first five chapters of the Gospel of Mark, Gast will have them published in Basel and asks Bullinger to return the manuscript in this case.

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Alas! The letter from Hedio brought me great sadness, because a bunch of soldiers have completely devastated and ravaged the Bishopric of Fulda, and have also consumed everything that was there. They are moving into a land that was once as free as Switzerland. These have previously killed many soldiers who have caused mischief there. And the land is not far from Hamburg, about ten miles from the Elbe. They are said to have laid the land completely waste, stabbing women and children. Furthermore, they say that the Duke of Lüneburg is in arms with a large army, intending to destroy them completely. They say the soldiers belong to the Emperor or were instigated by the Emperor. I do not know anything certain to write about this matter.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, they say that the chancellor of the Bishop of Cologne was a notorious scoundrel and a traitor of secrets. He is said to have fled to the Emperor, as is the common rumor, or to the Cologne clergy and is hiding there.</p>
      <p>The Count Palatine has arranged a shooting in Heidelberg. Many princes and lords will come to it. They will undoubtedly deliberate about the affairs of Germany; for it is time that they once again come to an agreement, so that the Spaniards may be expelled from the borders of Germany.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I would like, since your chief scribe has died, that if you could in any way, you would have Martin Beyer, whom you perhaps know, recommended in this matter, and describe him to your councilors, if there is any hope of obtaining this office. You cannot have anyone more suitable, convenient, faithful, or more devoted to the Christian religion than him. He will adhere to the brothers of the gospel. He is moderately learned in Latin and Greek. He has an excellent stature and is otherwise a humane and civil man. He would exercise himself in writing and would adorn his speech from the habit of speaking, even if he is quite apt for everything to which he applies his mind. If you can conveniently, remember him.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Basel, 1545, October 4th.</p>
      <p>I am expecting your letters. I will soon send a list of new books to Gesner, who will share it with you.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius. If your printers do not want to print the annotations on the first five chapters of the Gospel of St. Mark, send back the copy, and I will perhaps have it printed in Basel.</p>
      <p>For it seems to me to be of great benefit if these sermons are read in German by the people of our city, in which the morals of our people are criticized in all sermons.</p>
      <p>Farewell again with your wife and children. You will greet Gesner and our Theodor with Pellikan in my name. The rest will be narrated by our Fries.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and humane theologian. Zurich.</p>
