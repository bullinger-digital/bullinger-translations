      <p>Grace and peace. On September 1st, those at Ehrenberg fortress made a sortie with 60 men. They drove 200 Italians into flight. Subsequently, the enemies captured the nearby Katzenberg and fired upon it, so much so that yesterday, September 7th, the people of Constance set out to rescue and relieve them. Other cities will also come to the aid of the people of Constance.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I wrote to you before about how Castellalto went there with 6 cannons and 10 companies from Heiterwang. You ask, what is Heiterwang? What should it be? It is the name of a place, not far from Ehrenberg. I have never been there myself. I am just conveying to you what is written here. You should then look it up on maps. I know nothing more about it.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>If you have any news from Lower Germany, let me know. The people of Augsburg have requested preachers from us. Today, three have been appointed. Be aware, the messenger has likely also been to you by now.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>No more for this time. Greet Johannes Gast for me, share this new news with him, and give him this list. Rudolf Gwalther, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and the others send their regards. God be with you.</p>
