    <p xml:id="regest1">Gast is doing well. - He writes rarely because he has nothing significant to say and does not want to disturb Bullinger in the composition of the writing ["True Confession"] against the "new Pope" [Luther]. It is good that the people of Zurich, supported by the Holy Scripture, defend Zwingli as well as Gast's teacher Oecolampadius against Luther. Gast asked [the pastors and theologians in Basel] if they would at least write a letter to defend their church against Luther's madness, but received a negative response. - He intends to publish some Psalms this summer, perhaps together with an [introductory] epistle, in which he plans to defend Oecolampadius's teaching on the Lord's Supper, if the brothers approve. - If only Luther had remained silent! The response [from Zurich] will surely make any further conflict with him unnecessary, especially since he no longer wants to respond and also does not want to read the letters [from the Confederates]. - Luther is said to have regretted that the Duke [Elector Johann Frederick of Saxony] confiscated more than 1000 copies [of the "Short Confession"]. In Augsburg, [the] Lutheran booklets have been banned. - In Strasbourg, the employee [...] of a printer [...] sowed a sack of grain on the streets and proclaimed: "What I sow now, the Turk will later reap"; he was arrested, outlawed, and suddenly died in the open field near the city. - Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander], Pellikan, and [Johannes] Fries. - [Charles V.] is said to be in Worms; the princes are hurrying there. Merchants report a triumphal procession of the Turk [Sultan Suleiman I] with all his princes in Constantinople.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I am doing well, praise be to the Lord.</p>
      <p>The reason I write rarely is that I have no subject worthy of you, and I constantly fear disturbing your study and labor in responding to the "new Pope" [Luther]. You do well to humble Luther's arrogance with the Holy Scriptures. And the Lord has granted this opportunity, so that it may finally be recognized by all that he is a man and can err. He has a proud spirit, which makes him more arrogant every day. I strongly approve of your efforts to defend Oecolampadius, my teacher, along with Zwingli. For I have spoken to our church leaders about this matter, asking if they would at least publish a letter to defend our church's doctrine against Luther's madness. They replied that they have no business with Luther, that the booklet is fanatical and furious. I remained silent at these words, pondering something about those to whom the church's business is entrusted.</p>
      <p>I intend to publish some Psalms this summer, to which I may attach a letter defending Oecolampadius's doctrine on the Eucharist, if it seems advisable to the brothers, so that we do not appear completely mute.</p>
      <p>If only Luther had remained silent and our church would be more peaceful! Nor do I doubt that you will respond in every way, so that there will be no need to contend with this beast any longer, since he no longer wants to give any response and does not want to read the letters sent by us.</p>
      <p>I hear, which makes me cheerful, that the Duke has suppressed more than a thousand copies in Wittenberg - I do not know whose counsel it was - which grieves Luther.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, Lutheran booklets have been banned; oh, how wisely the prudent men acted!</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, a printer's assistant bought a sack of grain and began to run through the streets of the city, sowing the grain and saying: "What I sow now, the Turk will later reap," and he shouted this in a loud voice.</p>
      <p>He was captured and thrown into chains, eventually outlawed, and barely half a mile from the city, he died suddenly in a field. See what the Lord intends with these people of ours!</p>
      <p>Farewell. February 9, 1545.</p>
      <p>Greet Theodor [Bibliander] and Pellikan with Fries.</p>
      <p>They say the Emperor is in Worms. The princes are flocking there. Merchants consistently affirm that the Turk had a triumph in Constantinople with all his princes, and we can guess what he is planning there.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear, gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
