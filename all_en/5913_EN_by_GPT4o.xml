      <p>Greetings. This evening I was at dinner with the most honorable gentlemen of the Pellizari family, when letters from Mr. Martinengo arrived late at night, along with a sharp and vehement speech by Peter Fontidonius, etc. This could be inferred from the preliminary letter. I did not read more this evening. I am sending Mr. Martinengo's letters, not because they contain anything particularly worthy of your knowledge, but so that you may understand our diligence; you will return Mr. Martinengo's letters at some point. If Froschauer has brought copies of Fontidonius and Cardilli against me, he will have done a most pleasing thing if he sends them; for I intend to return this Fontidonius, which I have in hand, to Mr. Martinengo. If Mr. Tobias Egli comes to you, you will encourage him, for your own and paternal kindness and humanity, to continue to adorn the office he once took up; certainly, his diligence and modesty have been of great benefit to me so far, and for that reason, I owe him much. There are indeed many difficulties, not only public but also domestic, with which he struggles; but all of these are such that they can be overcome by divine grace. I do not doubt, given his modesty, that he will very easily comply with your paternal and faithful advice, due to his utmost respect for you. This is written in haste. I also ask your paternity to kindly consider this haste. If you wish to write anything to Geneva through the most honorable Peter Martyr Pellizarius, you will have someone to whom you can safely entrust it. Farewell, reverend father. Written in haste on the evening of October 18, 1563. Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. The plague is gradually approaching us. In Pr√§ttigau, it is said to be affecting quite a few; among us, no one has yet died of the plague, etc.</p>
