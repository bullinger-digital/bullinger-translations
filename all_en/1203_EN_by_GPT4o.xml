      <p>S. D. Your letters were most welcome to me, as are all your writings, my esteemed brother Calvin, and I congratulate us on that most beautiful agreement, undoubtedly arranged by divine providence, so that while you request the publication of the Consensus, we are working on publishing it and have already published it of our own accord. From these and many other favorable signs, we predict that it has been published not without great benefit. Recently, I sent you the first page printed only on one side. For I had snatched it from the press. Now I send the complete Consensus.</p>
      <p>Send one of these copies to Mr. Viret. What is it that you and I are moving the same stone? You undoubtedly do not know what I have done so far, and I will do with all diligence with the most serene King of England and the kingdom's advisors, to guard against that impious Council of Trent. Nor have I learned anything from anyone about your plans and counsels. Now, as our public works come forth, it appears to all that both of us are engaged in the same matter. Although you, due to the excellence of your gifts, act more learnedly and precisely. The preface intended for Mr. Vergerio pleased me greatly. And I thank your kindness for deigning to share it with me. I will send him this and letters through the first trustworthy messenger. For due to our lake being frozen over, few come to us from Rhaetia, nor do our people go to them. I will hasten, however, so that I do not neglect anything maliciously.</p>
      <p>Let us love and help each other, Calvin. For great snares are being laid for us by the most cunning and impure of men.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has decided, in his obstinacy, to absolutely convene a council. And there is no doubt that they will accuse and attack us as enemies of Christ. And would that the Emperor himself does not pretend to make an expedition against the Turks, which he later turns partly into Piedmont and partly into Switzerland. For he is known for his arts. And there is no doubt that he seeks something other than what appears publicly with this council so anxiously convened. But the great princes will eventually experience it, and especially the French, whom I hear, quite imprudently, want to support and adorn that treacherous and pestilential council. It is most certain that the Emperor wants to set the Swiss against each other through the occasion of the council, so that they may not assist the French, indeed so that he may eventually seize them when they are torn apart. But the French do not believe, they see nothing, even when these things are shown to them clearly. May the Lord open the eyes of the magnates so that they may see what the Spaniard holds hidden in his bag and what the little fox is planning. But there are some who are wise after the fact. It will be ours to constantly pray for the face of the Lord, to invite all to repentance and steadfastness in faith, and to expose those bloodthirsty and deceitful plans. Farewell. The brothers greet you. Greet all your fellow ministers. May the Lord bless us all. ZÃ¼rich, March 7, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
