    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Melanchthon's letter [No. 1881] with the judgment on his commentary on John; he would like to convince those who consider the [Holy] Scripture to be uncultivated and disordered of the opposite and help the old Church of Christ regain its former glory, but heresy and divergent views must be suppressed. Melanchthon easily convinced him to refrain from the discussion about monogamy and polygamy; in response to [Johannes] Lening's letter [No. 1710], in which he defended polygamy, which he called digamy, Bullinger deliberately replied only briefly [No. 1723] and will now gladly keep his distance; this example must be resisted with the wholesome teaching of the Gospel, as Melanchthon also demands. Contrary to Melanchthon's admonition to [the people of Zurich] to silently accept provocative letters [from the Lutherans], one cannot remain silent about the insulting letter from Luther to Christoph Froschauer [from August 31, 1543, WA Correspondence X 384-388, No. 3908]: According to Luther's opinion, [the people of Zurich] have nothing in common with [the Lutheran] preachers, they are heretics, their churches are devilish synagogues, they are damned and have been sufficiently admonished to come to their senses; but against this opinion of Luther, it must be argued that it was the Swiss churches that presented Luther with their confession of faith [WA Correspondence XII 265-275, No. III-V] and the declaration [of the Zurich Synod from October 24, 1536, WA Correspondence XII 274f, No. V], without ever receiving a response from Luther; even more bitter are Luther's threats to become a public enemy [of the Swiss church], which will befall Zwingli's judgment; there is no doubt about [the authenticity of this] extremely offensive letter. Luther's anger is theologically unfounded and incomprehensible; the struggle [of the people of Zurich] against Epicureans, impious people, and criminals is a laborious contribution to the welfare of science and the state, for which many gave their lives; if other churchmen in Saxony are similarly minded, there is great danger for [the people of Zurich]. Melanchthon could remedy this evil through his authority by admonishing his own to modesty, equality, and justice; they should read the writings [of the Swiss] more carefully before condemning them; moderation can create a spiritual connection and contribute to better mutual understanding, for which Bullinger will also advocate; more will be reported by [the bearer], the young Hungarian Joseph [Macarius]; Bullinger asks for Melanchthon's response to the autumn fair. Greetings from Kaspar Megander, who studied with Melanchthon at Georg Simler's in Pforzheim, also from Rudolf Gwalther, Erasmus Fabricius [Schmid], Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Johann Jakob Ammann, Rudolf Collin, Konrad Gessner, Otto Werdmüller; greetings to the church leaders and professors; blessing wish.</p>

      <p>You encourage us to, if any harsh letters are written from your regions to us, bury the evil in silence and soothe it with our skill. But what will you say, my Philipp, if such letters are such that it is difficult to remain silent about them, nor can they be soothed by any skill? I am speaking of Dr. Martin Luther's letters. Whether you know or not, we are unaware, Luther wrote such letters to our Froschauer (Christoph Froschauer, a printer in Zürich) (which he undoubtedly did not want us to ignore or be unaware of) that good and learned men who read them cannot sufficiently wonder what happened to Luther, that with such immodesty, not to say something harsher, he poured out such dire accusations and insults against us.</p>
      <p>And because you might not know what he wrote, I will briefly pour out into the bosom of a friend and brother whatever injuries there are. Right from the beginning of the letter: Neither I, he says, nor any of God's churches can have any communion with your preachers. So, according to Luther's judgment, we are cut off from the fellowship of all saints, as impious and obstinate heretics.</p>
      <p>Therefore, our doctrine is most corrupt, therefore our churches are not churches of Christ but satanic synagogues. For the apostle commanded the saints to abstain from such communion. But what, I pray, could be thought more atrocious against us? Indeed, he immediately adds to these: I grieve that they labor so much and yet are damned and lost. We would therefore lack true faith in Christ: for whatever is not of faith is sin. And he who does not believe in the only begotten Son of God is already judged. Again: They have been sufficiently warned, he says, to repent from error and not to drag miserable men with them to hell, but they have no ears for sound advice, etc. Who, I pray, my Philipp, ever warned us? Who convicted us of error in doctrine? Indeed, the Swiss churches offered their confession of faith to Luther, submitted to him also a declaration of the articles concerning the ministry of the word and the power of the sacraments. Yet in all these, Luther condemned nothing, convicted us of no error, withdrew us from no false doctrine with any admonition. I also wrote privately to Luther and entreated him, if he knew of any error in our doctrine, to indicate it amicably and fraternally. I wrote finally by the command and in the name of all the brothers and ministers who serve the church of Zürich. But he did not even respond with a word. Now we have been sufficiently warned, we have no ears for sound advice, and we drag men entrusted to our faith with us to hell. These are atrocious things, but more atrocious things follow. I do not want, he says, to be a partaker of their damnation and blasphemous doctrine, indeed I will pray and teach against them until the end of my life. Behold, he calls all our condemnation, calls our doctrine blasphemous. He promises to be our public enemy before God and men.</p>
      <p>Before God with prayers, before men with doctrine. Nor is there hope that he will ever return to grace with us, since he promises to fight against us until the end of his life. Moreover, he adds this: May God be with the pitiable churches, that they may finally be freed from those false preachers and seducers.</p>
      <p>What, I pray, has even the pope ever thundered more horribly against us? We are now, even to Luther, false prophets and seducers, worthy indeed to be overwhelmed with stones, and against whom the sword of every most just judge should be directed, to whom fire and water should be forbidden. And with all this, he has not yet sufficiently poured out the heat of his mind against us, unless he also added this at the end of the letters: They laugh at these things of ours, but they will weep when they find the judgment of Zwingli whom they follow. May God keep the hearts of the innocent from their poison! We do not laugh, Philipp, indeed it grieves us not a little, that such a great man, snatched from himself, rages so against the undeserving, and disgraces himself most shamefully. He thrusts Zwingli of blessed memory, who deserved well of piety and letters, down to hell: he binds us with the same judgment, whose doctrine he judges not to be the water of life, but poison and the cup of eternal death. By what skill, I ask, can we soothe such a great evil, and indeed an evil incurable by Luther's judgment? Nor is there any doubt about the letters. I know Luther's hand and sign, since I have also previously received letters from him. We do not believe, however, that he could have poured out more atrocious things against the plainly impious and manifest enemies of the word of God. But even if we concede that we err in the matter of the Eucharist, were we to be so rejected, condemned, trampled upon? Now indeed, since the doctrine of repentance and the free remission of sins in the name of Jesus Christ is sincere and pure in our churches, since we do not differ in doctrines even a hair's breadth, as they say, from the doctrines of the apostolic and primitive church, since the use of the sacraments is holy and legitimate among us, finally since our life, with God's help, indeed working through us, is blameless, and the most holy churches are witnesses to us, our ministry is a holy and just testimony, and true signs of legitimate apostleship, why does such a great man overwhelm the undeserving with such great insults and reproaches? Moreover, our books are most abundant witnesses of our faith and doctrine. We contend against Epicureans, against impious and wicked men, against infidels and antichristians, for orthodox faith and Christian discipline.</p>
      <p>With great labors and cares, we restore studies and the republic. Many of ours have shed their blood and given their lives for the testament of God. Why then does Luther condemn, reject, and trample upon those who have happily fallen asleep in the Lord, and us who today still labor in the Lord's vineyard according to our measure and the grace given to us by Christ, as the most wicked of bipeds? This injury with which he has affected us overflows into the holy churches of Christ, of which we are ministers, and indeed legitimately called ministers. That reproach also overflows into the Lord Jesus himself, our head, king, and high priest, to whom we believe, adhere, and serve.</p>
      <p>We complain of these things before you, Philipp, a friend and brother before the Lord, and we lay these things before a faithful and most just lover of justice, so that from these you may understand what kind of letters are written from your regions to us. We could also exhibit other letters of this kind, which we have hitherto devoured and digested through Christian patience.</p>
      <p>There is also doubt among us about the judgment of other learned men among you, since he who holds the primacy among you judges so malignantly of us. But if other learned men and church leaders throughout Saxony are of the same mind towards us as Luther is known to be, who does not understand with how much scandal to the churches, with how much pain and detriment to good and simple men this ulcer will someday erupt? For if they continue in this way, we will eventually be compelled to defend our and our churches' innocence, truth, and integrity. However, if you, most humane and pious Melanchthon, apply the strength of your intellect and shoulders to a matter otherwise quite dangerous, as you eagerly undertake everything that serves the glory of God and the safety of the churches, you will be able to soothe this evil among your people: namely, if by your authority, which you rightly wield greatly among your people, you interpose yourself, and gravely and frequently admonish your people to modesty, equity, and justice, so that they may diligently read and consider our writings before they condemn us, and also consider that we too are ministers called to this holy ministry by a holy and legitimate calling of Christ the Lord, who through our ministry and that of those who have long since fallen asleep in the Lord, has converted barbarous and untamed, and even Antichrist-addicted peoples to himself, and has certainly established many illustrious churches among the Swiss, which have done and endured many great things for Christ, which embrace and invoke Christ with true faith, and cultivate true religion, charity, and innocence of life, while fleeing Antichrist and all superstition and impiety. Among us, there is no need for an exhorter, since the minds of all are inclined to peace and holy concord, and they love you especially, most pious Philipp, and then all others like you, pious, learned, and modest, from the heart. This moderation and mutual union of minds will ensure that if there are any things that seem to be taught and done in our churches in a different manner from yours, such as the matter of the holy supper, confession, and private absolution, finally the matter of images, with love and mutual zeal growing, with time and more exact knowledge of things, and with experience as a teacher intervening, each will be understood and judged more rightly by both, with affections set aside, more purely. For you rightly admonish from Basil, that the left hand is not so much needed by the right as the concord of the teaching church. Therefore, what you promise to take care of, that our churches do not fall apart and be torn apart more, but that they be more closely bound, you will promise this same thing from us to you and yours. For we will also strengthen our union, we will not dissipate it. And this is my will and that of the rest of the fellow ministers, about which you wanted me to write back. I write these things with a simple and sincere mind before the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, June 22, in the year of our Lord 1544.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours from the heart.</p>
