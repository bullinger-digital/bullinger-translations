      <p>S. I. D. I recently received from Peter Mechlin, most illustrious man, your most learned Commentaries on the Apocalypse of John, with which you have enriched me, as usual, with your kindness towards me, a gift most acceptable to me for many reasons, for which I truly confess that I owe much to your kindness, by which I am continually overwhelmed with new benefits. I wish that some occasion may arise, through which you may understand that you have not bestowed your kindness on an ungrateful man. Although I have been afflicted by a disease hostile to my studies by the kindness of God, yet by no wickedness of it can I be torn away from the sacred scriptures, and then in my spare hours from historical reading, so that that part of life, which perhaps remains for me for a few more days, is by no means troublesome to me by the kindness of God. The poet sings that one must pray for a sound mind in a sound body.</p>
      <p>But for me, a sound mind in a weak and utterly languid body suffices, and I praise the Lord, that He has humbled me with His grace and paternal affection towards me, while I feel that the giver of all good things has dealt kindly with me, in that He has only so much harmed my otherwise fragile body, lest I perish in the vanities of this world always rushing to destruction, but has preserved my reason unharmed from the beginning of the disease even to this day by His mercy, and furthermore allows me to fight against all the wickedness of the disease with the remedies of constant reading with the greatest delight, which hitherto I have been able to bear, not to say overcome, by divine kindness, so that I am fully persuaded that it has gone well with me. There has also come your pious consolation to me through letters, by which I have not only been greatly strengthened, but also encouraged to endure greater things. I completed a month ago my collection of prodigies, which, however, since Heinrich Petri is always harassed by various public affairs, he neglects his workshop and has a completely unskilled corrector and no reader at all, they have been printed so uncorrected and corrupt that there is hardly a page that is not filled with many errors, so that I am so annoyed by the labor and effort that I wish the book had never been published. I could not myself oversee the workshop and the press, as I very rarely go out; however, if God wills, I will take care that in the second edition everything will come out more correctly and also more fully. I send a copy, so that if you find anything that displeases or is omitted, you may kindly and paternally advise me according to your kindness towards me. I have not accomplished in that kind of argument what I ought to have done by merit, but what I could at this time and in such bodily weakness and wickedness of disease, as I did not want the collected things to perish altogether; it will be the part of a fair reader to receive them candidly and to forgive much to my weakness.</p>
      <p>Would that someone might someday come forth, who, aided in some way by my work, might transmit this argument more learnedly and fully to posterity. I return all your good things, as I hope, in good faith, in which although I found many things that I had long possessed, yet there were many things that were hidden from me and could be added to my great... collection. Hence I confess myself bound to your kindness and benevolence, and if anything can be done for you through me, command me by your right. However, you can never do anything more pleasing to me than if you would sometimes interrupt me with your most learned letters, when you have leisure from more serious matters. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 3, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Conrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, true bishop of the city of Zürich, a friend to be greatly honored.</p>
