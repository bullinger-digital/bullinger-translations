Assumes that Bullinger has already been informed by the council about the outcome of the Frankfurt meeting. Duke George [of Saxony] is said to have been ready for the Reformation shortly before his death; this is reported by a messenger of Count George of [Württemberg-]Montbéliard. Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg is recruiting soldiers for France, Joachim of Brandenburg is reforming his churches, and in Worms, the Imperial Estates are negotiating Turkish aid, but this is likely a deceptive maneuver.</p>

      <p>Greetings. What is it, I ask, that you do not console us in any way about the university's harassment, after I wrote that they are trying with all their might to see us subjected to them and to force Dr. Grynaeus to accept a degree if he wants to be a lecturer in theology? You wrote once, I know, what the matter is; but because they are asking us anew, I too desire something new, from which I may understand more how ridiculous these people are, who want to precede the chariot, follow the horses, subject the shepherds, and rule the sheep. But they deny this vigorously, saying: "We do not attempt to hinder or subject the ministry, but the ministers." I beg you, how will you separate the person from the ministry here? And if this is possible, how will you separate the doctrine from the ministry, which they are trying to take upon themselves to judge? We are so happily idle in such great matters that we play with sticks and nuts with the children.</p>
      <p>What is happening? Meanwhile, the church is perishing, believe me, it is perishing. Whose fault is it? So that I do not accuse anyone else, perhaps it is mine and Grynaeus's; for he does not want to be forced by law to a degree, and I do not want to betray the ministry. "But," they say, "beware lest you seek yourself while you pretend the freedom of the ministry." Tell me, my Bullinger, what seems to you here: Even if I were seeking my own freedom, should I pretend that the ministry should be destroyed? Please respond, and briefly, if you can in your leisure. Enough of this.</p>
      <p>Unless you had already had the acts of Frankfurt, I could send them in full. But because I hear they have been sent to the council by our people, there is no doubt that you also have them.</p>
      <p>But so that I write nothing, take this story: Duke Georg (George), after he fell ill, anxiously called his preacher to him and diligently asked him what he thought of Luther's doctrines, whether they tasted of heresy or were consistent with the Holy Scriptures. The preacher was silent; for both fear and truth had closed his voice. For if he had spoken the truth, he feared punishment, and yet he could not pronounce against it with a resisting conscience. While the prince urged him as he hesitated, he finally extracted this response, that Luther's writings do not disagree with the Holy Scriptures, but agree with them very well. The Duke indignantly said: "Why then did you not warn me before, so that I would not have raged so much against my own, who were truly devoted to religion?" And he immediately declared openly: "If I recover, I will support this doctrine." But he passed away, hopefully to Christ. He left Heinrich (Henry) his brother as heir, whom he had hitherto persecuted severely because of the gospel. This from a messenger whom Georg (George), Count of Montbéliard, had sent to Saxony for certain private matters, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Count Wilhelm (William) of Fürstenberg is re-enlisting soldiers recently dismissed, but for France, because the emperor has not restored Milan as promised, and refuses a marriage (I do not know between whom). Also, Joachim of Brandenburg is said to be reforming his churches. Today in Worms, the Imperial Estates, including the present princes and evangelical cities, are consulting on how to act against the Turk, if he attempts anything against piety. Indeed, I deceive myself more than enough impudently, unless under the pretext of the Turk a fraud is lurking.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with yours. Greet our Pellican diligently. Basel, May 22, in the year 39.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, President of the Zurichers, his brother in the Lord to be respected.</p>
