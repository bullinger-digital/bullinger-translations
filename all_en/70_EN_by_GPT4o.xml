    <p xml:id="regest1">Gast has gratefully received the [requested copy of the Zurich marriage court statutes for the divorce of lepers] as well as Bullinger's book "Series et digestio temporum" in the past few days. He will show his gratitude for it on occasion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Should Bullinger be interested in Martin Bucer's work on the failed Regensburg religious discussion [«Disputata Ratisbonae in altero colloquio»], Gast would gladly send it to him, especially since today the printing of the [last] part concerning the English church [«Gratulatio Martini Buceri ad ecclesiam Anglicanam»] [in Basel] has been completed. [Even during the printing process] Bucer had many pages altered to avoid offending anyone in light of the defeat suffered in the Schmalkaldic War.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Gast would like to know if [Thomas Naogeorg] in his booklet about the past [Schmalkaldic] War [«De bello germanico in laudem Ioannis Pedionaei»] has, in Bullinger's opinion, hit the nail on the head in downplaying the reasons for the war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">There is no news from Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Queen Maria of Hungary is in Strasbourg, and the people of Strasbourg are celebrating ridiculous pompous masses for her. The [Protestants] are so inconsistent in matters of religion!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">The Ensisheim [government] is sending their riders everywhere. They demand an oath from all suspected military men not to enter the service of King Henry II of France in the next four years. These riders are everywhere and almost [also] captured Count George of Württemberg-Mömpelgard.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Soon, Gast will report on the newly published books [in Basel].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have received the transmitted tables and the book, which I received in these days, on the series and arrangement of times, etc. For these gifts, I give immense thanks and will also express my gratitude when the opportunity arises.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>If you desire Martin Bucer's book on the failed Regensburg colloquy, write a single word, and I will send it. For today, the part concerning the English church has been completed. He has changed many pages to avoid offending anyone due to the unfortunate outcome of our war.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am sending the booklet on the recent war, awaiting your judgment on whether this good man has hit the nail on the head, who tries to downplay the beginnings of this war.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We have nothing new.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Queen Maria of Hungary is in Strasbourg. They have grand and quite ridiculous masses. We are more pliable in our religion than any wax or twig.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Ensisheim authorities have their riders roaming everywhere. Wherever someone might look like a soldier, they make them swear an oath not to join the French in four years. They roam back and forth. Duke George of Württemberg was almost captured.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I will write soon about the newly published books.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell. March 13, 1548. Basel.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, dearest in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
