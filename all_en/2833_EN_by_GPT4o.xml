      <p>Fran√ßois Hotman sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I am writing this letter very hastily in the house of Mr. Martyr, where I was greatly surprised to hear unexpectedly that your son was present. Having embraced him, I asked if anyone was going to you. He replied that a certain man would be leaving immediately; therefore, I quickly wrote this letter partly to inform you of my relocation and partly to inquire whether you have received two letters from me, one of which I entrusted to J. Budeus when leaving Geneva, and the other I handed over to Mr. Sulcer in Basel, asking him to ensure it reached you, which he most certainly promised to do.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when I learned from Mr. Wolphius's letters and Mr. Lochmann's conversation that you had heard nothing about me for these entire five months, I was very distressed by the loss of those letters, fearing that you might suspect that my long silence indicated a decline in my former respect for you. Rest assured, my father, that I have always cherished your memory in my heart, and I have been so pleased with your most blessed church, adorned and equipped with so many exceptional men, that if I had not been advised by my brothers that this place was most suitable for me to recover my patrimony, I would have certainly come to you. For residing in Geneva would have resulted in the loss of my patrimony if I had stayed there long, and shortly, as I hope, my brother-in-law Praenoldus will follow me. I asked your son to visit me; if he does not, I will go to him, for I have resolved to show him how much I respect you, and if my services can be of any use to him in any matter. I have indeed recognized a father's qualities in him and hope he will also have such a character. I believe Mr. Gessner received my letters from a certain young Pomeranian, which I entrusted to him in December.</p>
      <p>I greatly wish to send my regards to him and to Mr. Wolphius, to whom I am not permitted to write now, and to your noble sons, the most learned men, and to your entire family. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 14th day before the calends of March, 1556.</p>
