    <p xml:id="regest1">The French envoy Guillaume du Bellay is friendly to the Reformation and reported from his conversation with Pope Clement VII in Marseille that the Pope, although displeased with certain aspects of the Mass, would not abolish it but could adapt it to an older rite. The private Mass, which Vadian considers an abomination, was not discussed. The "light-shy" Pope would allow a council only in Italy at most. At the meeting in Marseille, the Pope proposed to the French King Francis I a military campaign to crush the Zwinglians and Lutherans. The King declined this but would protect the decisions of a free council. France is allied with Hesse and Saxony, and even Protestant cities agree with its policy. No one fears a conspiracy against the Protestants. Rightly, the Pope fears his downfall if a synod could decide freely according to the truth. A document about the meeting in Marseille is enclosed. The letter may be shared with loyal friends. The epitome will soon be completed.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The French envoy, whom I previously wrote to you about, is an exceptionally learned man, a supporter of the purity of Christianity, but he desires that the old and dignified profession of religion, worthy of apostolic gravity, be restored with some moderation. For he believed that the disease, which has been introduced into the world for so many centuries and has occupied the body of the church like a certain leprosy, as he said, could only be cured slowly and with moderation by applying soothing remedies.</p>
      <p>He claimed to have spoken with the Pope himself in Marseille (for he was continuously for two years the envoy and ambassador in the name of his king at the Pope's court, so that he learned the Roman ways thoroughly) and discussed many things about the council, ecclesiastical concord, and the abolition of certain things that long-standing abuse has introduced without much circumspection. He said the Pope admitted there was something displeasing in the Mass; therefore, he said it could not be conveniently abolished, but it could be refined and adapted to the old use and thus be made better. I asked whether he had discussed the private Mass with the Pope, which is known to be nothing other than a foul abuse of the Lord's Supper instituted for profit. He said the Mass was discussed in general and that the Pope did not seem to be of the mind to allow its abolition, but rather to permit it to be conducted in another rite. For the wretched man sees how much he owes to it, to which he attributes both wealth and kingdom. But because he has no defense for the confessed error, he continues to deceive with cunning, as if he seems to be about to allow some things and not permit others, as if it should be judged by his nod and not rather by the prescription of the scriptures and faith concerning that abomination. He showed himself so difficult about the council that, unless it is to be held in Italy or some city of his or the Emperor's, he would not agree by any means. By this, he clearly indicated what he promises himself and his party if they are to come forth to that light of apostolic doctrine and be judged by it. For he is a fugitive from the light, very conscious of his own wickedness.</p>
      <p>But listen to this wonder: At the very first meeting, he proposed to the King to consider whether, with forces prepared, soldiers enlisted, and an expedition prepared, with the help of the Emperor and selected pious princes of Germany, they should come to crush the Zwinglians and Lutherans, so that, terrified by the atrocity of the example, the rest might hasten to obedience to the Roman church and the true and old religion might be retained. He did not obscurely indicate that he was equipped with the help of many for this, provided the Frenchman did not refuse his assistance. There the Frenchman replied that it did not seem to him to be in the interest of piety or religious concord, since from the recent dissension of some articles and places of scripture, both the Zwinglians and Lutherans appeal to and loudly call for scripture, that he desires nothing more than that the matter be decided with scripture as the judge - to deviate from this means (so he said) to take up arms or any force. For by this suspect action, said the King, the religion of those who proceed to defend their faith not with scriptures but with arms would become suspect. Therefore, it seemed best to him that the Pope, with a free council and without any suspicion of hatred, first examine and decree what is consonant with our faith and the Catholic church by the consensus of the best and most learned. When this is done and it is clearly established what the synod, legitimately convened, has received as pious and consonant with the church in such great disputes of dissensions, then he would be prepared to defend what has been received and decreed in this way, and also to restrain the rebels with equal zeal, sparing no expenses.</p>
      <p>The Pope did not willingly accept this response, and by the suggestion of some, the matter was conducted in such a way that he conceived much hope, although in vain, of persuading and inciting the King. But the King remained immovable. The reason for this and with whose advice it was done is now clear, since we see the Frenchman so greatly allied with Hesse and Saxony. Moreover, the matter is so arranged that I think it likely that even the cities conscious of Christ, who are of all things, are not averse to the Frenchman's efforts. So far from it is anyone greatly fearing that they have conspired against us or that they have begun this plot against our religion, although no one in such a great matter can clearly perceive what is in the minds of the princes. However, it is certain that nothing is more troublesome to the Pope than the fear that he will suddenly be thrown down from his position if any synod is given the freedom to decide according to the truth. For he knows by what arts his affairs have grown, nor does the poor man have any defense if he is not allowed to engage in some unfortunate war with arms and factions.</p>
      <p>These are the things I had to write to you, almost conceived from the mouth of that great man. To which I have added that triumph of Marseille, with which I might delight you, even if you are very busy, with a spectacle worthy of the chair of Peter. Oh, the times, oh, the customs! But be assured that the Pope at Marseille was given excellent words and that no old man was more deceived in any fable.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and if you please, entrust these things to friends, but to faithful ones. For everything is full of Coricaeans.</p>
      <p>I will bring the epitome to an end shortly with the Lord's favor.</p>
      <p>In the year 1534.</p>
