      <p>Greetings. The envoys have returned from the mission to the cantons.</p>
      <p>They diligently presented the matter of Claron and exhorted the cantons to concord; they were kindly received. They promised to give a response at the first assembly in Baden, which is to be held soon. In turn, I wish to hear from you what is happening in Worms and why the princes have gathered there, whether it is because of the Council of Trent or because of Grumbach; I fear for Germany and for us not a little.</p>
      <p>Strange things are said about Philip, the King of Spain; but since they are uncertain, I leave them aside. The Pope will certainly send a legate and envoys to all kings, princes, and republics with the decrees of the council, urging them to accept; otherwise, action will be taken against them according to the decree "Ad abolendam": take off the pants, bring out the rod.</p>
      <p>These cardinals or bloody robbers have once again conspired to set all kingdoms against each other; they have done so not infrequently before, as I have shown in my two books on councils.</p>
      <p>Would that God does not visit our life, which knows not how to repent, and our most shameful dissensions. Lord, have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Return Beza's letters with the next messenger along with those you have received from friends about German affairs. I see there are many intrigues; may the Lord scatter the plans of the impious!</p>
      <p>During this winter, Bernardino hid in Nuremberg; he is said to be writing against us. He will travel to Poland, presumably to build his marvelous church there.</p>
      <p>I have already seen part or a few leaves of Brentz's book against me, indeed against orthodox doctrine, and I expect the rest; we have nothing else to do in these poor times.</p>
      <p>God will certainly not fail to come, and it would be a shame if He did not; may He find us according to His will and grace! etc. Greet your brother, sister, Gregor Ulm, and other excellent men, the magistrates of your city, Bernhard and Konrad. Farewell with yours. March 17, when I was quite exhausted from writing letters all day, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Winterthur.</p>
