      <p>S. I received the book of the late Vadianus of blessed memory and I am sending back to you the chapters that you sent to me, along with the letters and rhymes of Mr. Montius, which you requested to be copied. Meanwhile, Mr. Diesbach is writing to you, and since he has more and more certain information than I do, as he attends the senate daily, I will write less and turn to other matters.</p>
      <p>Regarding the people of Basel, I do not know what to decide. Sultzer, since he first learned letters, has almost exclusively pursued and continues to pursue everywhere the imposition of Lutheranism on the churches, and he is so cunning in this matter that he seems to have been prepared and born for this by some evil spirit who does not wish well for the Swiss churches. He has pursued this here for many years; but the angel of this church expelled him. I wish the guardian of the Basel church would do the same! I only fear that if we take any action, it may seem as if we are acting out of hatred for him and from emotions, as is often accused of the pious. However, I would like your envoys, if it is still possible, to discuss this matter with ours at the diet, so that this issue may be presented to our senate through this means. I have also spoken with some about these matters; but they seem more astonished than willing to take counsel. If, therefore, it were to proceed from there, they would undoubtedly contemplate a more serious business.</p>
      <p>However, I am surprised that the people of Basel can endure this; I wish the Lord would instill in them the spirit to imitate the example of our people! Otherwise, it will not be good. As for the Saxons, these dissensions are indeed lamentable; but in these, the just judgments of God also appear. May He protect us from evil! We have not yet learned what is happening in Heidelberg and what the outcome of the wedding was. We hear that Beza has something under the press about church discipline; however, this is not solidly confirmed to us.</p>
      <p>I wish he would refrain from these and grant the churches their freedom! Although discipline is necessary, wanting to impose the same form on all churches seems similar to wanting to fit the same shoe to all feet. All power is granted to us for edification, and I place discipline among those free matters that pertain to the governance of the church, in which no one can prescribe anything to another. It is not a matter of faith; no explicit command about it exists in the scriptures (I speak of exclusion).</p>
      <p>Therefore, it should be accommodated to the churches, whether private or public, as the condition and edification of that church can bear. The situation is different for those who do not have a magistrate, and different for those who do, and the magistrates are also dissimilar. Therefore, a tolerable form should be established that suits each church; however, reckless and forced exclusion carries much danger within itself. Geneva has experienced this, from which several seditions have arisen and several citizens have suffered miserable slaughter and expulsion. I fear that the Palatine may also bring about such things for himself and his people. Let us continue in our moderation and mediocrity; as it has less bitterness, it will also be more enduring, and from it, other republics will also take an example at some point.</p>
      <p>I believe I recently thanked you for your sermons, but I thank you again and will continue to do so forever.</p>
      <p>The people of Geneva had great hope for peace in France and were almost convinced of it; but behold, unexpectedly, both the Swiss and the Saxons are summoned. Therefore, it seems that all hope of it is now removed; for our people, who are preparing themselves, there is none. Let us therefore pray to the Lord, that He may extend His hand all the more powerfully, as His enemies now seem to boast more insolently of victory, and I hope He will do this; for thus all glory will fully return to Him. How I wish we could see and celebrate it! They say that a war is also arising between the Florentine and the Ferrara, instigated by the pope; but you will have more about these matters, if they are true. The same is written elsewhere about the Turk and the Moors. They were saying that Alba had died; but it is now confirmed that this was false.</p>
      <p>As for our paper maker, I know nothing else than that he is well. Steiger, Graveried, Manuel, my father-in-law, etc., and all of mine send you many greetings. Diesbach himself is writing; therefore, I will end my letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell. March 7, 1570.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
