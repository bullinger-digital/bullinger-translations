    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Wolfgang Haller hereby sends an impartial and intended for the school supervisors of Zurich testimony about the student Burkhard Leemann, which Bullinger had requested [letter not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Since Wolfgang took over the school management in Kappel, Leemann has been quite well introduced to the Latin language and has not only grown older but also made good progress in his studies, piety, and conscientiousness. Wolfgang would wish that all his students were like him! Even in Greek, which he has been learning for barely a year now, Leemann has already achieved quite good results. With his abilities, diligence, and perseverance, he has laid a solid foundation for his further education, considering his youthful age. As he is obedient and pious, he will undoubtedly be of use to the church. He therefore deserves to be further promoted. Wolfgang actually intended to urge the schoolmaster [Johann Jakob Ammann] to promote Leemann.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In Kappel, Wolfgang can only teach the basics of language, as the more advanced students leave and beginners come. With Leemann, there are still three learning Greek. In addition, there are four newcomers to whom Wolfgang has just taught the Greek alphabet: Wolfgang Deck, Hans Koller, Hans Thomann Wirz, and [Hans] Victor von Schönau.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The diligent and pious Leemann, from good Zurich parents, is therefore worthy of praise, even if he has adopted quite rustic habits from contact with the cattle breeders of the region. However, this can be easily remedied.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The remaining more advanced students are: Hans Steinbrüchel (headstrong, yet highly gifted), Felix Bluntschli (less gifted, but diligent), Wolfgang Deck, Hans Thomann Wirz, and Hans Koller. All of these have also acquired quite good knowledge in Latin. So much for Bullinger's letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Wolfgang regrets the fate of the persecuted Christians. But the Lord will avenge His own! The neighboring [Catholic Innerswiss] remain the same! Outwardly they are friendly, but as soon as one turns away, they are the worst enemies. Their sexuality, love of pomp, greed, and arrogance, as well as their zeal for idolatry, which they showed just a few months ago, do not recommend them to the [Protestants]. However, Wolfgang fears that they are [nevertheless] given too much trust!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] He has sent back to Bullinger the sermon notes on the two books of Samuel, which were made available to him, with Koller, who was called home by his parents. He would now like to give the boy the sermon notes [on the Book of Judges], or, if this is not possible, at least the notes on Genesis. Wolfgang will faithfully return them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Many greetings, also to the family, and also from Wolfgang's wife [Elsbeth Göldli].</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. You ask to hear my judgment about the character, piety, diligence, and learning of Burkhard Leemann (lord and father, always most revered by me for many reasons), which I will provide truthfully, sincerely, in few words and briefly, without any particular affection of mind, in accordance with my duty towards him and my due obedience to the esteemed overseers of studies, my most revered lords.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Burkhard Leemann, who was moderately instructed in Latin before, has, since I took over the administration of the school in Kappel, advanced not only in years but in study, piety, and diligence, to such an extent that I have always wished for similar progress from all my other students. For he has also been moderately instructed in Greek, although he has not yet spent a whole year on it. His talent is fortunate, his diligence proven, his study constant. He is young, but for his youth, he has laid the foundations of solid learning quite well and happily, especially in piety and the fear of God. His obedience has always been observed, combined with piety and knowledge; hence, I have no doubt that if he continues as he has begun, he will one day be of no small use to the Church of Christ. His love for studies is always the greatest, his inclination towards the study of piety frequent, always spurred on to greater things by the praise of diligence. He is therefore worthy of promotion. I also intended to approach the schoolmaster about this matter, to see if he could be promoted in any way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>For we cannot teach more advanced subjects in our school, except only grammar, because of those who leave a little more skilled and others who return less skilled. With Leemann, I have only three who are engaged in Greek. I will now add four other novices, whom I have so far taught the method of reading: Wolfgang Deck, Hans Koller, Hans Thomann Wirz, and Victor von Schönau.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Leemann, therefore, being from Zurich, born of excellent parents, diligent himself, a student of good letters and piety, has deservedly found praise among us, although in the meantime he has somewhat rustic manners, as happens among us among cowherds, swineherds, shepherds, and horsemen; which, however, can easily be changed for the better in him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The remaining more advanced students are: Hans Steinbrüchel (headstrong, but endowed with a most fortunate talent), Felix Bluntschli (who compensates with diligence for what is lacking in natural talent), Wolfgang Deck, Hans Thomann Wirz, and Hans Koller. And they are fortunate and well instructed in Latin. These are, most revered lord, the things I have been pleased to respond to your writings.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I am very sorry for the plight of all the faithful of Christ oppressed by this persecution. Come, the Lord has sharpened His sword and bent His bow, to strike near and far and to quickly avenge His elect. Our neighbors hold to their old ways: friendly in appearance, but otherwise most hostile. For their lust, pride, greed, arrogance, and much more diligent zeal for idolatry than they had even a few months ago, do not bind their minds to us at all. I fear that we trust them too much.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I have sent back to you through Koller, otherwise called by his parents, the sermon notes on both books of Samuel, and I pray that if you have not sent what I desired through him, you may send at least those on Genesis. I will use them briefly and return them faithfully.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell, most revered lord and father, and always love me and keep me recommended to you. I wish all your family well, and my wife also, who orders that many greetings be written to you and them in her name. Farewell again. December 18, 1546, in Kappel of the Zurichers. Wolfgang Haller, your most revered.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his always most revered lord and father. In Zurich.</p>
