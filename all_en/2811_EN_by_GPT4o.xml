      <p> Greetings. By chance, I found this Zurich man here among the people of Saanen. Therefore, I could not refrain from writing at least a word to you through him, especially to make you a participant in my joy; for you should know that everything is going well here by the grace of the Lord. All idols have been removed, and the priests have departed, and the people seem to be willing to beautifully adapt to the evangelical discipline. Indeed, everything is still in its rudimentary stages; but I am hopeful. When I will return to Bern, I still do not know; I am waiting for a certain pastor to be sent, who will preside over this church. Due to many affairs, I cannot write more. Please consider these few words kindly and write to me as well if you have any news. Greet your entire family, also my brother, to whom I do not have the time to write now, and finally all the brothers and fellow ministers. Our prefect, Mr. Johannes Rodolphus von Gravenried, sends his greetings to you. </p>
      <p> Saanen, January 15, 1556. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his most dear and esteemed lord and compatriot. Zurich. </p>
