      <p>Greetings. I am brief, my most esteemed Calvin, dearest brother in the Lord, because this excellent brother and fellow minister of ours can narrate everything more accurately than I can write. Out of my love, respect, and dedication to you, I have done what I could. I believe the most honorable Lord Consul, together with the senate, will not unwisely undertake the matter. Concerning this, a letter is being written to the most distinguished senate of your republic.</p>
      <p>The citizenship will not be granted to the Italian you wrote about. For there is such an abundance of people in this city that the citizens have requested that no more be admitted for some time: this has also been confirmed by public decree. Absentees are less likely to be admitted. The Lord Consul indicated to me in one word that we would attempt this matter in vain. But your letters on this matter, written some time ago, were delivered to me only a few hours before Macharius arrived. I do not know where they hid or wandered on the way. D. Macharius will report to me about the new matters written from Leipzig. There is a rumor that Maximilian will soon be elected Roman.</p>
      <p>King, etc.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell. May the Lord Jesus make this year happy and prosperous for you and yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, the last day of the year 1556.</p>
      <p>All the brothers greet you. Greet the brothers, etc.</p>
      <p>In great haste.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
