      <p>Greetings. I arrived here six days ago in the Valtellina and other places subject to the Rhaetian lords, together with the commissioners, to proceed with receiving accounts from our officials and to audit those who have served in these places for two years, as is customary... So far, we have done nothing else worth mentioning, except that we have begun to execute the decree previously promulgated at the last diet held in Davos, namely, to give 40 shields annually to each preacher of the gospel.</p>
      <p>For we have decided and indeed firmly established here in Chiavenna, from where such revenues should be taken and at what times of the year they should be paid, and we intend to do the same in all other places subject to us. We hope that in this way the gospel will be greatly promoted, although it has come to our attention that the Milanese senate, wishing to consult for the benefit of certain ecclesiastics, and also the Bishop of Como, when we come to the valley, will send their envoys to us, who will try to persuade us to desist from our undertakings; for this has been reported to us... We are entirely focused on this, to compile an inventory of ecclesiastical revenues, which are collected annually by the Bishop of Como and other prelates in our domains.</p>
      <p>To what end, you yourself judge with your wisdom; I will not hide from you upon my return how we have succeeded.</p>
      <p>In Chiavenna, on the first of March, 1559.</p>
      <p>Today we enter the Valtellina, God willing.</p>
