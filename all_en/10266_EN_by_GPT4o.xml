      <p>Greetings. Here you have another, no less faithful messenger, my neighbor, dearest Heinrich, to whom you can most safely entrust your Gospel commentary. If you have not entrusted it to Megander, make sure he does not return empty-handed. In the meantime, I will also await you, and I hope life will not be cut short.</p>
      <p>In recent days, Sebastian Hofmeister, the steward and minister of the church in Zofingen, died of apoplexy. In my judgment, Bern did not have a more learned man, although he occasionally suffered from his own shortcomings and passions. He left behind four children, a wife, and, as they say, many debts, which will certainly displease our council. It is a special plague that so many of our people manage their households so poorly and willingly.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write. Now I await yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>June 12, 1533.</p>
      <p>Always yours, Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
