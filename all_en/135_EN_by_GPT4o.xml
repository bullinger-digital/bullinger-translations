      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most learned Calvin and my dear brother, written on the first of March and sent through our envoy returning from France, and I understood your opinion on my response. Therefore, I refrain from repeating what has been once stated; meanwhile, with God as my witness, who alone inspects the hearts, I cannot think otherwise nor speak otherwise than I have spoken and feel. I acknowledge that Christ, through His Spirit, communicates Himself entirely to us by faith, as much as is necessary for us to achieve salvation and to live piously, which is signified and sealed to us by the sacraments in their proper manner, just as it is announced and inculcated by the word through testimony.</p>
      <p>Regarding the complaint of that friend of yours, which was heard recently when you were in Basel, I have nothing to respond; for I do not fully understand what it was. Certainly, when you were with us in Zurich, you recited to all of us what others either criticized or desired in our response given to Luther; meanwhile, you professed that our writings, which were evidently published concerning the cause of the Lord's Supper, did not displease you; you promised that you would always be ours, and I believe you have not yet regretted that promise.</p>
      <p>The one who delivers this to you is the son of the late D. Diethelm Röist, our consul; he pursues the craft of furrier. He seeks a master among you, with whom he may both practice the craft or art and learn the language. His brother, D. Jacob Röist, a man of senatorial rank and a lover of truth, requested me to diligently commend him to my friends, by whose help he may find some good and honest master. I wrote about the same matter to D. Claude Roset. If you provide faithful assistance in this, I will be most grateful and will bind myself to you in a similar matter.</p>
      <p>I fear that true religion has been dealt with in Germany; for the Emperor, with the help and consent of the princes and orders of the empire, except for a few, have composed the Interim. For thus they call the form of religion that all churches in Germany should follow in the meantime, until the Pope convenes and celebrates a general council. However, that Interim is nothing other than papism itself. I have seen the articles, and I have seen the responses of the princes, those who call themselves Catholics. They accept the composition. Consider what kind of composition it is that these impious and antichristian vassals accept. They caw something about the articles concerning both species, the marriage of priests, etc. I have also seen Melanchthon's counsel, good God, how timid and dislocated! Thus God teaches us to trust neither in princes nor learned men, indeed in no flesh. It is good to hope in the Lord; I know we must pray to Him unceasingly, that He may sustain His cause.</p>
      <p>I recently sent many things about the affairs of Germany along with my response while our envoy was going to France. You mentioned this in your letters, but you did not mention those; I wonder if you received them. Now indeed there was no leisure to write everything so copiously.</p>
      <p>The people of Constance, moved by the ample promises of those who interposed themselves as mediators, sent an honorable delegation to the Emperor in Augsburg, D. Thomas Blaurer, the consul, D. Peter Laibard, and D. Hieronymus Hyrus. They are still stuck in Augsburg and are experiencing things far different from what the mediators promised. The Bishop of Arles or Arras is dealing with them; they have not yet been able to come into the presence of the Emperor. The Bishop demands a great sum of money from them; he urges the restitution of the Bishop of Constance, etc.</p>
      <p>What they will do is still unknown. I see everything tending and leaning towards this, that those who wish to be sincere in religion must be tested by fire and sword; but I know that truth and piety will prevail; the Lord will not forsake His own. The article on the sacraments, especially on the Eucharist in the Interim, is entirely papistic; I think this was not done without providence, so that in this way the truth itself may finally be extorted. May the Lord be present with His church and keep us in His holy name.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet your household and your colleagues. Zurich, May 26, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man D. Johannes Calvin, doctor of the church of Geneva, his dear brother. Geneva.</p>
