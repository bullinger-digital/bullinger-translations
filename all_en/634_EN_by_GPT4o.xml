      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Most distinguished man, if I write to you less frequently, I ask you to think that nothing else is the cause than the times themselves, in which that divine reason, wisely moderating all things, dispenses the turns of silence and speech. However, the reason I break the silence and write to you now is our Lelius, a truly worthy young man, about whom all good men should deserve well. Since I did not consider it right for him to return to you without my little letter, I wanted to write this, in which I both commend Lelius to you and revive some memory of myself to you. For how much I attribute to your piety combined with outstanding humanity, I can neither confess before you nor entirely conceal; the former would be flattery, the latter inhumanity. However, I strongly ask that you do not consider your Borrhaus absent from the duty of letters, but count him among your silent and speaking ones, and carefully guard yourself and yours from deceitful friends and pretenders.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most humane man, with your wife and children, and lovingly greet the brothers who are with you in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 17.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother and friend in the Lord.</p>
