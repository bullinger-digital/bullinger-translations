    <p xml:id="regest1">The situation in Hungary is said to be far worse than commonly assumed; Ferdinand [I.] has traveled to Regensburg to ask his brother, Emperor [Charles V], and the estates for support. Many rumors are circulating about the defeat [before Buda]; the situation could worsen; the information about the Prague fire has been confirmed; the destruction of the [Bohemian] land register caused by the fire is to be considered a prodigy. Recently, the silver mine at Kutn√° Hora near Prague collapsed, claiming many victims. Greetings.</p>

      <p> Greetings. Although I found a suitable messenger and had almost nothing to write, I could not refrain from writing to you, with whom I seem to converse and almost commentate by writing. This was also to elicit your letters, which you promised us in your recent correspondence. We hear here with quite firm rumor that Hungary is ablaze with a war far worse than the common people perceive; that Ferdinand has come to Regensburg by public course and has implored both his brother, the Emperor, and the remaining estates for help. His hasty plans have so far been little auspicious for him. There is much talk about the defeat he suffered and his disordered army, and because a huge Turkish force threatens our not sufficiently cautious nor brave men, we fear that the worst is yet to come. What you write about Prague, I also reminded you, is certain, and all the Bohemians consider it a prodigy. For the entire table of laws and constitutions of the whole kingdom, which they commonly call the Landtafell, a book, I say, held sacred by them and therefore kept in the archive of the royal castle, was itself consumed by fire. And very recently, the silver mine they call Kuttenberg, 8 miles from Prague, completely collapsed and subsided, with the loss of many lives. Farewell and greet the college in my name. If the local courier brings anything, you will know immediately. St. Gallen, 13th of July, 1541. Yours, Vadianus. </p>
      <p> To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious church of Zurich, his esteemed lord. </p>
