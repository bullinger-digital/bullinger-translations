      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>It cannot be expressed how much joy the public edict, along with your attached letters, has brought us. I see that heavenly favor is close at hand for our afflicted affairs. I foresaw what is now before our eyes, that the Five Cantons would pursue victory most bitterly, as is the nature of insolent soldiers. I have warned for concord with words in person and letters in absence. I have most earnestly urged both the brotherly colleagues and the magistrate, whom I saw most disordered in those three republics. They will suffer harm if our people do not take care, their republics, let alone the public administration of the divine word. There is no other way to avoid this except by restoring concord with the pious magistrates, so that a brother may be present to a brother exposed to dangers, and a magistrate of the neighborhood to an oppressed magistrate. Therefore, you will show yourself to be a man, and indeed a man of God, whose role it is to reconcile peace between the most conflicting minds. May Christ favor your good efforts.</p>
      <p>What you wrote against Fabri, we have read and approve, but above all, you have pleased all the wise by not attacking Luther as he deserves. But I fear that Leo's attempt will hardly fall equally successfully. For shortly we will strive to make it clear to the world that we both run outside the bounds and neither considers the other with Christian modesty, but that we meet with hostile spirits. Such indignity is most ungrateful to God. I pity the most upright men, whom this our dissension drives to ruin, certainly strips of their resources, ejects from their possessions, exposes to plunder. The profane agree with us. The clergy are vexed with odious suspicions against us, as if we were about to take away the authority of the word. They fear for themselves from us, as if we were trying to elevate the authority of the word. Therefore, I would wish that what is written to Leo be as moderate as possible. It should be considered by the writer that the evangelical princes and cities do not want the Zwinglians to be considered enemies. And we so rashly rush into battle headlong. Luther provokes first, but he is despised by his own if we do not give him his place by responding to his madness. The cause will not be endangered if we abstain from retaliation, the cause being faithfully explained. And yet I hope, as you are of a gentle nature, that you will moderate Leo's vehemence if he has carried anything immoderately. The rest on this matter to Karlstadt, which I wish to be read, known, meditated upon, and weighed by all the pious, since I detest nothing equally as the most disastrous conflict among the pious. Friendly contention of mutual love befits us more. For there are among the Lutherans those whom I do not doubt to be of Christ. And yet I do not want to subscribe to the errors of the leaders for that reason, to willingly embrace what is fitting, that is, I will consider it abundantly happily done that it is established for both that Christ and the justification of faith are without the works of miserable superstition, by which the world has been shaken for several centuries. Nor do I retaliate with the insult that impatience has extorted from them, provided that the conscience of right prevails. In the end, they will fall by their own fierce strength.</p>
      <p>The emperor most persistently demands military aid against the Turk, whom he asserts is now attacking with an infinite army. The papist princes have long agreed. Ours will hardly resist, even if the emperor has not yet accepted the conditions of peace. However, he has granted that, according to our confessions presented at Augsburg, we may continue our doctrine and life. Then he permitted the goods of the ecclesiastics, as they have been changed at this time, for private use, soon so that the ecclesiastics do not transfer their revenues from our magistrates to any other, papal jurisdiction. Finally, the prince's arbitrators have given hope that they will obtain from both the emperor and the states of the empire that the name of Zwingli will not be more odiously mentioned in the articles of concord. For they previously wanted our people to promise to oppose the errors of the Zwinglians and Anabaptists. Our people profess this, that they will avoid and oppose all who act against their confessions. Such is the faith of the profane in your nation, that they do not want to show any enmity against you, but it seems to them that there is such agreement between us that they refuse to admit that there was an error by Zwingli. Would that we would bear with the same moderation what the furious rage against. For they will cause no harm unless aided by our impatience.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet all the brothers very much, likewise Lord Resch, the treasurers, but especially those renowned for the name of piety.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, June 24, 1532.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, to be revered as a brother in the Lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
