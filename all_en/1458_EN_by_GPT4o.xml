      <p>Most illustrious man, I have long awaited a messenger to bring this packet to you; finally, one has come very opportunely. I received your letter dated October 23rd. Regarding the council, I still have nothing noteworthy; they are currently dealing with transubstantiation. But soon I will have something and will write immediately. When you have read the copy of my letter to the masked fathers, give it to my nephews, who will transcribe it.</p>
      <p>If the translation of Mr. Francesco Negro is pleasing, send it to Oporinus. Farewell and greetings to your entire family, school, and church.</p>
      <p>Pray for me.</p>
      <p>In Chur, on the Nones of November 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To you, Bullinger.</p>
