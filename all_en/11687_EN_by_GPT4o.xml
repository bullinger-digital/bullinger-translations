    <p xml:id="regest1">Suffers from the hindrance of correspondence due to a lack of messengers: The roads are unsafe, especially for the Swiss, as they have made the Imperialists their enemies; particularly misses the comfort he could draw from Bullinger's letters in the face of hostilities, but Bullinger should not think poorly of him because of his silence; Felix Müller did not return directly to Zurich, and Heinrich "Liechtenstagius" did not seem trustworthy enough as a messenger. Thanks for Bullinger's letter, which testifies to the firm stance of the Zurichers; [Ludwig] von Reischach also read it with joy. The Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] will probably limit himself to the defense of Hungary this year; the young nobleman [...] von Schönau, who served with Cardinal [Jean] de Lorraine, reported on the arrival of Turkish envoys in France, who were shown much honor. Metz has accepted the Gospel and refused submission to French troops; the council has prohibited the conspiratorial gatherings of priests; when some did not comply, craftsmen took physical action against them. John [Burcher?], who is supposed to be in Zurich, will report various news from England. Bucer writes that a Turkish embassy is seeking a truce in Vienna, which will probably be granted, as the French [King Francis I] threatens the Emperor [Charles V] in the Netherlands, in Navarre, and in Piedmont. Will soon report in detail about the arsonist [Duke Heinrich of Brunswick]; must be brief, as he is under pressure due to [the printing of Bibliander's edition] of the Quran, a dispute over the epitaphs for Mayor [Jakob Meyer], Oecolampadius, and Grynaeus, as well as a conflict over the synod. The Zurichers, Bernese, Baslers, and Schaffhausers will be able to benefit from their pro-imperial policy. Rumors about Turkish prisoners, the expected arrival of Turkish troops in Marseille, and a French retaliatory action in the Metz area after the bloody defeat of German or Geldrian troops against Maria [of Hungary, Regent of the Netherlands]. Asks to be helped with the missing parts of an Appian edition through Froschauer's [factor] Michael [Schwyzer]. Sends greetings to Theodor [Bibliander] and intends to write to him.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am sorry that I cannot write to you more frequently. There are no messengers; I believe the disturbances in affairs are the cause. Nowhere is that evil not raging, and it is clear that the roads are less safe than before, especially for the Swiss. The hatred of the Imperialists is once again growing against us, after the people of the Five Cantons with their allies made an incursion against the Empire to the French. The harm I feel from this strikes me not in an ordinary way. I am deprived of the knowledge of many things, which I would have abundantly from your responses. I am deprived of the greatest joy I enjoy in life, which I have so far received from your most delightful letters. I must also do without the consolations, which I need more than ever, as we are so unhappily treated, not for any other reason, but because we are too faithful (as we are forced to interpret it) in teaching the truth and perhaps too free in rebuking vices.</p>
      <p>But what should I do? I must bear these inconveniences; only take care that you do not think anything negative about me while I am silent. I always think of you, and I also seek to reveal my thoughts to you through letters, but in vain. A few days ago, Felix Müller, once a carpenter, was here. I was glad, but when I inquired about his return, he replied that he would first go to Solothurn, Bern, and Fribourg. Therefore, I was completely deprived of the joy I had conceived. Also, on the day I wrote this, Master Heinrich Liechtenstagius dined with me; but since I could not know for certain whether he was trustworthy or not, I did not dare to entrust either my letters or yours to him. This is for your ears only. Indeed, I do not doubt that, having heard my excuse, you will consider everything with fairness and goodwill.</p>
      <p>First, I now give you immortal thanks; for you do on my behalf what I would not dare to ask, of your own accord, and you gratify me in such a way that I cannot express it. There is a nobleman here from Rischach, to whom I usually entrust all my affairs, and others as much as it seems to benefit. I gave him your letters to read. How he rejoiced, how he praised the people of Zurich, how well he wished them! If you had heard, I know you would have received a stimulus to write about common matters of some importance. And indeed, the spirit of your letters is perfect. Everyone should pray to the Lord that he may remain and strengthen them to the end.</p>
      <p>We hear little about the Turk. However, the rumor is that there is nothing to fear this year, that he will only defend the cities occupied and fortified through Hungary. It is certain that a Turkish embassy was in France a few days ago with horses such as the eyes of our people have never seen. The honor to be shown to the envoys was almost prescribed, and those who did not obey were subject to punishment.</p>
      <p>The author is a young nobleman from Schönau, who, while he was with the cardinal, the brother of the Duke of Lorraine, saw and heard things that seemed to be against his country, and having obtained the freedom to leave, returned to his own people.</p>
      <p>You know that the people of Metz have accepted the Gospel. An army gathered from French soldiers, about ten thousand strong, stationed a few miles from the city, sent to ask if they would surrender. They scorned it. Meanwhile, a multitude of priests, up to nine hundred, frequently convening in their area, which they call very large, consult in such a manner that it finally seemed intolerable to the magistrate. It was therefore decreed that they should no longer meet as before; for if anything happens to them from the citizens, the authors will be free from punishment. Some, having disregarded the order, gathered again and were so punished by certain tinsmiths (armorers) that they barely escaped alive. Thus, the area was cleared of the wicked priests. You will hear everything about the English marriages, about a certain jester of the king, about the Gospel, and other matters of that kingdom from John [Burcher?], whom Oporinus said is with you.</p>
      <p>Bucer wrote today that a Turkish embassy has been sent to Vienna, seeking a truce for three years. He thinks it will be granted because of the great importunity of the French, as much as can be believed; for they are moving against the Emperor in three places, in Lower Germany, in the kingdom of Navarre, and in Piedmont. I will write about the incendiary of Brunswick in the next message.</p>
      <p>The Geldrian, having become an ally of the French, is said to assist them with all his might. I would write rumors, but time and leisure prevent me, as we are so vexed because of the Quran and because of the epitaphs written for the consul, Oecolampadius, and Grynaeus, and because of the synod we recently held, which seems to find no end.</p>
      <p>The Zurichers, Bernese, Baslers, and Schaffhausers are praised so highly among foreigners for what they have done so far according to the Emperor's wish, that no one doubts that in the future they will not be without benefit through opportunity. The latest rumor about the Turk reports that four distinguished men have been taken captive to Vienna and that thirty thousand Turks are expected in Marseille, about the French, that they have devastated a town in the Mediomatrici and killed whatever they found, because some German soldiers (others say Geldrians) surrounded by Maria's army on their way to him were killed to the last man.</p>
      <p>To conclude, because I am compelled: I wish that, when you happen to visit Michael Froschauer, you would ask him in my name for two quires in the Appian bought from him while I was there, and never since, although I have asked more than once, have they been completed. The first is M of the first alphabet, keeper: "devinxisset", the latter Ppp of the third alphabet, whose keeper: "spitione". If you obtain these, it will be no small benefit to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord Jesus with your family and yours. Greet Theodor, to whom I will write (if God wills) soon.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 25, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of Zurich, brother in his Lord.</p>
