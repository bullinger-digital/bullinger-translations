      <p>Pious, honorable, esteemed, prudent, and wise Mr. Mayor and gracious dear gentlemen.</p>
      <p>I beseech your wisdom to willingly hear this my writing, graciously accept and consider it well, for I have written it with a very good Christian intention to the end.</p>
      <p>[1.] And first of all, I thank you, my gracious lords, for all the good that you have ever shown to me and mine. May Almighty God reward you for all this and grant His blessing to you, your city, and your land.</p>
      <p>[2.] Since I have served as pastor and minister at the Grossmünster for now more than 43 years (for I was elected by you, my gracious lords, the councilors and citizens, on December 9, 1531), I have served Christ, our Lord, above all, and then you, my gracious lords, and also the entire Christian community with all faithfulness, as much as God has granted me grace. If I could have done otherwise and better, I would have gladly and willingly done so. I humbly ask that my service be considered good. And I hereby testify before God and you, His servants and ordained authority, that the doctrine I have presented to the church throughout my service is the true, right Christian doctrine, taken from the New and Old Testament, in which I wholeheartedly believe, and I confidently hope that I and all who believe in it will attain eternal salvation.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, I confess clearly and openly that the Pope's doctrine, which is contrary to ours, is false, misleading doctrine, rejected by the holy apostles and condemned under the name of the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>All this has been thoroughly explained and proven in our confession, as well as in my preaching and written, published books.</p>
      <p>And in this true Christian faith, I depart to our Lord Christ, whom I recognize as my only Savior, life, redeemer, and comfort; whom I praise and glorify for eternity.</p>
      <p>[3.] Thirdly, your wisdom should know, and not let yourselves be misled otherwise, that the Council of Trent and all other papal councils that have ever been convened, and may yet be convened in the future, serve only to obscure and suppress the true faith, and to bring you all back into papal servitude. Therefore, I willingly accept none of them. I remain by the recognized truth and rely always and solely on the biblical scripture.</p>
      <p>If you must suffer for this, then consider what you must suffer in soul, honor, body, and goods if you become the footstools of the willful, proud priests and greedy, unclean monks, and lose true salvation.</p>
      <p>[4.] Fourthly, I sincerely ask that you, my gracious lords, promptly elect and appoint another pastor and minister in my place, and do so uprightly and honestly, with fear of God, and without any manipulation. For with manipulation, there is and was never grace nor fortune. Let it proceed according to the prescribed divine order, that when several righteous persons are proposed to you, you choose one from that number who is God-fearing, pious, faithful, learned, humble, brave, and peaceful, not unlearned, proud, arrogant, impudent, quarrelsome, stubborn, and contentious. The pastor must be reasonable, diligent, and patient, kind, yet honest, serious, loyal, and devoted to the city and the land, friendly to both rich and poor; especially, he should not only tolerate but also love his fellow ministers, not elevate himself tyrannically, pursue pomp, or attach and create factions. For when the preachers do not pull together well and harbor secret, envious intentions against others, it breaks out into discord, which extends into the councils and the entire citizenry, resulting in a terrible unchristian state.</p>
      <p>And I have often experienced during my time of service what peace and unrest have been at this office and position for you, my gracious lords. God has kept us in unity. I now earnestly pray and have intercessions held in the church that He may give you a pastor, guide him with His grace, and preserve you in truth and right unity in peace and true prosperity. Amen.</p>
      <p>And here I give in the name of God my vote to Mr. Rudolf Walther, whom I trust will conduct himself as written to you. May God grant it.</p>
      <p>[5.] Fifthly, it is known to everyone through experience that Almighty God has broken the neck of the papacy through the press and has helped the truth to come forth again. Therefore, many wicked people are very opposed to the press and are enemies of it, wanting to entangle and abolish it. Yet much good is accomplished with the press, as with oral preaching, which cannot reach all places as the press can. Therefore, let your wisdom never again be led to hinder and destroy such a glorious jewel of God. For by doing so, the restless sinful world, for whose sake it would be done, would neither be appeased nor improved, and great displeasure of God would be incurred. On the other hand, ensure that nothing harmful, dishonest, or seditious is printed.</p>
      <p>[6.] Sixthly, I ask you, my gracious lords, for God's sake and for your salvation, that you henceforth diligently attend to the word of God and to common prayer in the church, as has been done by the majority of you so far. Earnestly call upon God to grant you grace and strength to govern well and according to His will. Let a pious community, as fathers of the people, be faithfully entrusted to you. Uphold good judgment and justice for everyone.</p>
      <p>Help the poor, the stranger, the widows, and the orphans. Punish the wrongdoers as is proper. Protect the good and pious, upright people. Show no partiality. Accept no gifts to pervert justice. Do nothing out of favor or disfavor, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, graciously entrust all faithful preachers to you. For if you treat them shamefully and unfaithfully, you would provoke God's wrath against you. On the other hand, punish those, without any leniency, who are unfaithful, greedy, drunken, wanton, disgraceful, and godless. For they defile and offend many in the community. Let the truly poor also be entrusted to you. And whatever good regulations have been made with the poor and the alms, do not let them go to waste. Especially prevent and prohibit begging from becoming a trade. Faithfully provide for the hospital and the infirmaries and do not neglect them. For whoever has mercy on the poor, God will have mercy on him. And whoever turns his face from the truly poor, God will not hear him either. You, my gracious lords, have a considerable good, which is rightly called church property, not city property. If you do not use it rightly, you will bring God's wrath upon you and all the people. Therefore, such good is established or founded by upright people so that God is honored with it, and the truly poor are provided for, as well as the teaching, the schools, and whatever serves the service of the church, according to necessity.</p>
      <p>If all this is provided for and there is still something left over, it should not be squandered and wasted, but saved or kept for common unforeseen need.</p>
      <p>And therefore, whatever good regulations are established at the Grossmünster and the Fraumünster, and in both schools there, are admonished for God's sake not to destroy them, but to protect and maintain them. Such serves the common good of the city and the land, especially if one always has God-fearing learned persons who can provide for all the churches, teach upright people, and rightly comfort them.</p>
      <p>If anything were to be taken away, it would serve to the detriment of the city and the land.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it will be very necessary that you always appoint officials and managers who do not work for their own benefit, but for the benefit of the churches and offices.</p>
      <p>Not those who have previously been wasteful and unseemly, but now want to become rich in 6 years through greed and unfaithfulness, but those who are decent and faithful, who manage well for you, our lords, and treat everyone according to their due, giving everyone what they owe, not snapping and quarreling with people. For such things cause great displeasure in the city, both among strangers and locals. [7.] Seventhly, I ask you, my gracious lords, that you all be of one mind with each other, and consider each other good, love one another, and wish each other honor and good, and not be envious, biased, and contentious with each other for the sake of honor and offices.</p>
      <p>You, my lords, the councilors and guild masters of the Constaffel and the guilds, along with the citizens, are one united head of the single body of the community. Therefore, you should all pull together and be of one mind, have love and respect for one another.</p>
      <p>Uphold all your commendable statutes against vices, especially against the bloody pensions and against the ruinous wars, in these dangerous times. Guard yourselves against foreign princes' and lords' alliances, and do not sell the blood of your upright people.</p>
      <p>Establish peace and tranquility at home and abroad, wherever you are among the Confederates and other potentates. For if you avoid unnecessary and willful wars, and seek peace and tranquility with all your heart, God will grant you peace and tranquility. If not, God will give you so much war that you will not know where the end is.</p>
      <p>[8.] And finally, as I leave behind me some of my dear children and grandchildren, I commend them first to God, then to your, my gracious lords' and faithful, dear fathers' protection and care.</p>
      <p>I ask you most sincerely to be their faithful fathers in all that they need your counsel, help, and comfort.</p>
      <p>And in this regard, consider my faithful and long service, for I have now served you, my gracious lords, for 52 years. For I began in the year 1523, on Anthony's Day, as a schoolmaster at Kappel and soon after [1528] also as a preacher at Hausen. And there I served for 7 years, during which I never received a fixed salary or pay, as later other servants who followed me did; only I was promised for my work that I would be accepted as one of the convent and would receive in clothing or other benefits what was spoken and given to another member of the Kappel convent. But I have never asked or demanded anything for this claim, nor have I ever received anything worth a heller.</p>
      <p>In the year 1529, in May, you, my lords, sent me from Kappel to my homeland, to Bremgarten, as a preacher in almost great danger, toil, and labor. From there I was driven out in the war on November 20, 1531, with considerable damage to me. After that, you, my gracious lords, took me in at the place of the late Mr. Ulrich Zwingli, as also mentioned above, so that I have served you here at the parish for 43 years, having previously served you for 9 years, altogether for 52 years.</p>
      <p>In between, I could have taken other and richer positions, but I have had a special heart for you, my gracious lords, and the city of Zurich from my ancestors, the Bullingers, and have served you with good will and gladly, also well content with what has been given to me for my salary, before all the world, and as faithfully as I have ever been able.</p>
      <p>God willing, I could have served even better. Although. Although I have left my descendants in my testament, I have given an account that I have not always been able to support myself with the salary and benefice, for I have sometimes had to dip into my own property. But I ask, as from the beginning, that you, my gracious lords, consider my willing service as good.</p>
      <p>And if I have ever offended anyone among you, my gracious lords, I ask for God's sake that he forgive me, as I have also completely forgiven everyone. And I depart in peace and true joy.</p>
      <p>I hope in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that we will see each other again with the greatest joy, certainly, in heaven, and praise and glorify God for eternity.</p>
      <p>And with this, may God Almighty grant you grace. The grace of God the Father, and the blessing of Jesus Christ, along with the comfort and strengthening of the Holy Spirit, be upon you. May the one God graciously protect and guard you, your city, and your land, your honor, life, and goods, in His divine protection and shield you faithfully from all evil. Amen. Amen.</p>
      <p>On August 2, 1575.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the elder [signed].</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, esteemed, and wise gentlemen Mayors, councilors, and citizens of the city of Zurich, my gracious, dear lords</p>
      <p>The farewell of Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster, of blessed memory, which he ordered to be delivered to my lords immediately upon his death; which was read before the council and citizens, when Mr. Rudolf Walther was elected in his place, on Saturday, October 1, 1575.</p>
