      <p>Greetings. I will do everything possible to show myself grateful to you all, to whom I now give the greatest thanks I can. Letters from England were written in December.</p>
      <p>The matter of religion is in excellent condition.</p>
      <p>May God confirm His word forever.</p>
      <p>There is no mention of an agreement between the English and the Scots, nor do I think it is true that they conspired against the French. However, it is written about the Scots: they are progressing fearlessly in religion, the French fleet, which wanted to bring aid to the queen, was scattered by a storm and several ships were sunk.</p>
      <p>No marriage yet for the Queen of England.</p>
      <p>The envoy of the Emperor, who negotiated in the name of Charles, has departed.</p>
      <p>The second son of the King of Sweden is still in England, who negotiated for his younger brother Eric; but it is believed he will achieve nothing. I will provide more shortly.</p>
      <p>You will share this information with friends, especially with the most honorable gentleman, the envoy, to whom you will commend me.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>The letters, which you write you have not yet received, I handed over to SÃ¼ler, who says he served your bishop. I included the letters of the envoy to you, as you yourself ordered.</p>
      <p>They are also included for my Christoph. He says that Mr. Caspar von Salis has promised to sell the horse. I also kindly ask him, as my gracious young lord, to help ensure it is sold. For if you send it down to me, I know even less how to sell it.</p>
      <p>You might think, if you sell it, that I might think I wanted to get more out of it here, etc. No, I have written before and say it again: sell it as you can and as if it were yours.</p>
      <p>Whatever you get for it, I will be satisfied. But if it cannot be otherwise, you must send it to me; but it will not be worth it to me, because I know even less how to sell it and must also entrust it to other people; for I am not at all capable of the negotiations. Therefore, act as a good friend.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever with all of ours.</p>
      <p>Most hastily, January 26, 1560.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Johannes Fabricius, most faithful minister of the Church of Chur, godfather and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
