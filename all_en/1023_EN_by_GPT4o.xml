      <p>There was no need for a diligent recommendation of Philipp, the most humane of all men, because I place more trust in a single word of yours than in the many words of many rhetoricians; so well known and certainly proven to me are your faith and candor, gravity and constancy, and Philipp himself has so far proven and shown himself by his character and talent to be as you have asserted in your most pleasant letters.</p>
      <p>As for what your kindness asks of me, that I should be willing to assist him in deed and action, I am ready to do so with the utmost willingness and have done so up to now, as much as was necessary, as he himself, unless I am mistaken, will freely admit. May the Lord grant that such an opportunity to gratify your sons and Master Bibliander may someday be given to me; if it happens, as I hope, I promise you that I will do what a faithful and constant friend of yours would do.</p>
      <p>Regarding the rumors spread by adversaries among you about our (affairs?), as you write, I am uncertain what to respond, whether they were betrayed by their own, or deceived by enemies thus deluded by the vain hope of wearing out and driving away the enemy through delay, or whether one refused to obey the other when it was opportune and necessary, and others present other such reasons.</p>
      <p>I am convinced that neither is free from blame and that they did what they thought they would do; therefore, the Lord blinded them so that they fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>
      <p>It is commonly said: Wo kein Rat ist, da ist auch kein Hilfe (Where there is no counsel, there is also no help), and it is truly proclaimed; for our people, if they had been willing to follow the sound and honest advice of great and good men rather than their own flatterers, and by whom they were betrayed, they would never have come to such calamity. As long as religion and the ministry of the word of God remain safe for us, it would not matter so much that we have paid the penalty for our own insolence, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Given at Marburg, September 9, in the year 50. Most devoted to your highness, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Master Ulrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his reverend master.</p>
