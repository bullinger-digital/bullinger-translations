    <p xml:id="regest1">He continues to maintain that the body of Christ sits at the right hand of God and is enjoyed solely spiritually as nourishment for the soul, through faith, which allows the power of Christ's suffering to become effective in believers, whereby they themselves are united into one body with Christ as the head during the memorial meal; indeed, in the sacraments, attention must be paid not only to the sign but also to what is signified, yet they are connected in such a way that Judas, in contrast to the believing Peter, only received the sign. When speaking of the true eating of the body and blood of Christ, it must be interpreted in such a way that the people do not revert to the old opinion; obscure expressions are detested by Bullinger. He requests that this letter also be shown to Schultheiß [Hans Jakob] von Wattenwyl and other councilors to dispel the rumor that he has changed his opinion and considers the doctrine of the Lord's Supper from the Bern Disputation and Zwingli to be insufficient; if Luther should respond differently than expected, further action must be considered, but God will protect the simple truth.</p>

      <p>Further, if it has been said by me, in your presence or in front of other honorable people, that I have changed my opinion about the Lord's Supper, you should know that this is not the case at all. I believe and hold regarding the Holy Supper as it is comprehended in the confession and the writing to Luther, set forth in Basel, as has been taught in our churches until now. Namely, that the true, substantial, natural body of Christ sits at the right hand of God and does not come down until the last day. And that the bread and wine are and remain and are not transformed into flesh and blood, but that the body and blood of Christ are spiritually eaten by the believing person as nourishment for the soul. And this spiritual eating happens as follows: When the believer eats and drinks from the Lord's Supper in the congregation, he looks at the bread and the wine, which the Lord has offered to him. For he holds it no differently than if he were receiving the sacrament from the hand of the Lord. But here he does not remain fixed on the external element alone; he thinks: This is a sacrament and a sign of higher things. What is that? The Lord says: "Take, eat; this is my body" [Mt 26, 26 par]. Therefore, the believer thinks: Just as the bread nourishes the body, so the body and blood of Christ sustain the soul of the believers, indeed the whole person. How can I now eat the body of Christ? Not with the mouth and with the teeth, but with faith. But how with faith? When I wholeheartedly believe that he gave his body and his blood into death for us. Just as eating incorporates the nourishment into the body, enabling it to work in the body, so faith ensures that the power of Christ's suffering is fruitful for us. Thus, the Supper is a spiritual nourishment, also a remembrance of Christ's suffering and a sign of divine goodness towards us, also a bond of all of us, that we should be one body under the head of Christ. All this, however, is worked inwardly in the person by faith and the grace of God and not by the external sign. Although one should not only look at the external sign in the sacraments, but both, the sign and what is signified; yet they are not otherwise together than that sometimes the sign is received and not what is signified, as Judas received the bread but not the body of Christ and ate. In contrast, Peter, while he was a believer, received and ate the bread and the body of Christ truly, that is, he was truly satisfied by the Lord, while he recognized in him the true Savior. Nevertheless, the Lord remained sitting at the table bodily and was not eaten physically. Therefore, the eating happens spiritually.</p>
      <p>So much I wanted to reveal and clarify to you, so that you would have a clear understanding of my opinion about the Lord's Supper, so that if there are those who would say that I have fallen into this or that way of speaking, you would know that these are words and not true. I can well endure that, after it has been clearly confessed, the body of Christ sits at the right hand of God and is no longer bodily in this world, and the body and blood of Christ are eaten spiritually and through faith, that one then uses this expression: "The Lord does not leave his church; the Lord himself is in the congregation of the saints. In the Supper, one truly eats and drinks the body and blood of Christ. The bread of the Lord is the body and the drink is the blood of Christ." Yet such should be immediately explained and rightly understood with previous articles, so that the poor people do not fall back into the old opinion that in the bread and wine the body and blood are essentially present. For I briefly hate obscure expressions and would much rather have the people told clearly what the matter is about.</p>
      <p>With this, I ask you to also show this my writing about the Lord's Supper to my other dear lords and brothers and to do so for God's sake and out of brotherly love and old friendship. And especially you should show it to my lord Schultheiß von Wattenwyl, my lord Wagner, Tremp, Fischer, and Sulpitius Hauer, my particularly beloved. For I hear rumors that I am suspected by many among you, as if I were of a different opinion than once, now, or as if I held that the matter of the Lord's Supper is not sufficiently expressed and given by your disputation and my beloved lord and master Huldrych Zwingli, which is not my opinion, and I hold that the matter of the Lord's Supper has been faithfully, truly, and sufficiently presented in the churches of the Confederation until now. If Martin Luther should show otherwise (which I do not expect), we must hear and consider. God will always preserve the simple truth.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, and wise Peter Im Haag, councilor and of the council in Bern, his dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>5th of December, 1537.</p>
