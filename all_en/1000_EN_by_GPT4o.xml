      <p>If you are well, it is good; we are doing well here. Since there is someone to whom I can give letters to send to you, I will not omit to do so, even though I have nothing to write. For in my affairs and studies, there is truly nothing new, and I consistently maintain the same way of living as I have for a long time now. I am now daily expecting letters from you, and with them also the fulfillment of your promise; I pray and beseech the immortal God that this matter does not disappoint us. I showed your letters to our prince, in which you wished to convey your zeal and goodwill to him through me. Believe me, nothing could have been more pleasing, more splendid, or more entirely in his wishes than this report. Therefore, you can easily consider how much it concerns both my interest and yours, as we have clearly pledged our loyalty to him. I have now sent you the form of the address more frequently, that is, plain and appropriate to the matter. I do not doubt that you have received it once and again; therefore, I do not wish to remember it further. Your speeches, recently transcribed for the king, are now being translated into English by Thomas Caius, a man most excellent in the study and learning of sacred literature. He is the chief secretary of this city and a man very devoted and loving towards you; in this entire island, he has long been highly commended by many illustrious monuments to all memory, and he wishes me to be very closely connected with him in familiarity and use for your sake. The Duke of Somerset is now a few miles away from our city.</p>
      <p>He has taken care to have our Otto's booklet translated into English at his own expense: it is indeed considered golden and is read by all the best and most learned. In my judgment, it would be worthwhile if he rendered it into Latin; for I do not doubt that the uncorrupted integrity of the Latin language will bring more light than the English language. Cox, a man very fond of you, was here a few days ago: I approached him and asked if he wished to send anything to you. He replied that he would write to you together with the king. I now think that both have written. The king himself, as you have long known from Huper's letters, wishes well to your church above all. Last week, when he confirmed Huper in the bishopric and asked for an oath from him, he happened to see in the booklet of the saints a mention made by the bishops, by which they ought to swear and be confirmed. The king was gravely moved: "What is this evil, Huper?" he said.</p>
      <p>Are these offices instituted in the name of the saints or of God? As soon as Huper expressed his opinion, the king immediately obliterated the error of the bishops with his own hand. I received this as most certain from Peter Martyr. Huper's contention with Treherne (praise be to God) is quiet and almost extinguished, although the other, namely Huper, has fallen into far greater and more dangerous matters with certain people. It is said that he recently stated in a sermon before the king that a marriage once broken and adulterated cannot be restored and renewed by the intervention of the magistrate or the will of the spouses, so that it may be and be considered a holy marriage: these words indeed greatly disturbed many good people. He has very few followers of his opinion, nor do I think Peter will ever agree with him in this matter: for his opinion seems too harsh and vehement to everyone. But I will write more about this elsewhere when I have learned more certain things; in the meantime, I want these things to be said and written to you alone.</p>
      <p>Bucer is well and alive: he has preached here twice. You will fully learn the sum of what he said from Stumphius's letters. We dined with him. He showed himself very courteous towards us. While he was here, he happened to receive letters from France, in which it was indicated to him that the Sorbonnists, along with some others, are contending before their king about the Hebrew language. The Sorbonnists wish to completely abolish the profession of that language; the others are striving for the opposite. It is easy to see what these most impure rascals and sacrilegious thieves are seeking: for the bird is known by its song.</p>
      <p>On that very day, Arnold Byrkmann came here, who reports to us that a certain inquisition of heretical depravity (for this is what they commonly call the doctrine of Christ) has been issued by Antiochus, or, if you prefer, our Julian, by which all who think well of Christ in Lower Germany have been handed over to their priests to be sacrificed and slaughtered, so that they may henceforth have the free power to examine and tear apart anyone, whether citizen or foreigner. He says the inquisition was printed in the slaughterhouse of the priests in Leuven and was brought to the magistrate in Antwerp 20 days ago; as soon as the citizens inspected it, their protest and execration followed from the highest to the lowest in all of Belgium. He affirms that the messenger was thrown into prison by them. What will happen next, God himself will see. It is most certain that the mandate has not yet been received. But it is greatly to be feared that the pope's executioner will eventually obtain it: if this happens, without a doubt, this calamity will spread and progress further.</p>
      <p>It remains, my dearest and most longed-for teacher, that you may be well, and that you may consider these letters, written in a familiar manner, as good. I neglect and despise that disjointed style of writing, with you as the author. Peter Martyr greets you all and conveys and promises his eternal zeal and labor to you through me. In my name, you should bid much health to Mr. Otto and Zwingli, your son-in-law; especially to Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer, an excellent and most learned man. I would have written to him now if I were not excluded by time. August 22, in Oxford, from the King's College.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your authority, Johannes von Ulm. To the man singularly endowed with learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
