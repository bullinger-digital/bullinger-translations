      <p>Greetings. There is nothing new to write, except that on the 12th day of this month, a certain citizen was cut down with nine horrendous wounds in the middle of the city, at the ninth hour of the night, in deep darkness, killed by two citizens, father and son; the son escaped, the father was captured and denies being involved. The case began to be legally addressed today; tomorrow, we believe, it will be concluded. It is unfortunate also that in our Confederation there are certain disturbances, subject to great judgments. Our council requests from Comander and me, whether we know of any honest man skilled in writing, who could act as a master of our German school in our town; we responded that we would not seek one. Therefore, we ask your kindness, that if there is anyone among you suitable for this task and who would like to come to us, you would inform us as soon as possible. A worthy and sufficient salary will be established, and a very large and beautiful house, provided he is skilled and suitable for teaching German letters and those things that pertain to such a school. You understand what we desire and what is required here. For your kindness, look around, inquire, and when you have spoken to such a person, immediately inform us, and we will refer the matter to our lords, who will then send for him. I have seen in these days the epitome of the library of your relative Josias and found myself a crow among swans; I will write to him about this. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most esteemed man, and do not cease to love your Philipp.</p>
      <p>From Chur, the twentieth day of January in the year 1556. Your kind Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>Father Comander, Pontasella, and especially our consul Tschernerus send their greetings to your kindness; for today, in the midst of the judicial turmoil, he instructed me to do this very thing. Therefore, greetings in his name as much as possible.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy prelate of the city of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed by all good people.</p>
