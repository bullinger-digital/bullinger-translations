      <p>Greetings. It was very serious for me that I could not speak to and gratify the very distinguished envoy of your city, who brought your letters, due to my occupations and especially because I had to return to this province of the Allobroges on long journeys for certain matters of no small importance entrusted to me. However, I believe you have received my letters, which I wrote to you upon leaving the king's court. Furthermore, I earnestly ask you to remember me in my absence and to make use of me if I can be of any help, and to inform me about your health.</p>
      <p>We are doing quite well here, but we miss some things that would delight us greatly, which we nevertheless hope will not be lacking to us at some point through the wisdom and goodness of Almighty God, through that true peace which surpasses all understanding. There was a great terror here, and now everything is very peaceful.</p>
      <p>However, not every day's sun sets, and the Lord knows what is more useful for His own and by what means He should promote the salvation of His own. Moreover, unless I were convinced that Master Ciconia would ensure that my letters are given to a faithful carrier who will carry them to Geneva and Lausanne, I would ask you to remind him and obtain this, and what he has promised will be paid for the transport. I understood that their shadow offends some among the Rhaetians, although there is nothing in them that is written about the shadow of Tantalus and tragedy. Please greet on my behalf and my wife's Mr. Lelio and friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chambéry, December 7.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Matthieu Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich. Zurich.</p>
