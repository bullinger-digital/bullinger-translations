    <p xml:id="regest1">The long wait for letters makes him fear for Bullinger's friendship. He informs him about the articles for the renewal of the university, which the rector [Hieronymus Artulf] has drawn up together with some deputies; with his resistance against the subordination of the servants of the word under the university, Myconius has so far only achieved that the deputies postponed the matter, while Grynäus is mainly fighting against having to acquire the bachelor's degree as a teacher of theology. He asks again about the wording of the doctoral oath, which the vice-chancellor [Karlstadt] is withholding from him. He thanks for news about terrifying signs and, in turn, reports about victims of the plague in the house of Grynäus. He asks for a statement on the communicated article.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Due to the delay in letters, I was again afraid that you might have forgotten me. Therefore, you rightly add at the end that I should take it well that you write later. I am unwilling to lose sincere friends, among whom you certainly hold the first place.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, to help you better understand the university's business: For ten years now, they have been attempting a reform without measure, and it is worse off than at the beginning. As we all like to appear wise, this year's president of the academy has taken the matter into his own hands again, set up articles together with some deputies, where the third tries to trouble the ministry; the fourth is about degrees and primarily targets Grynaeus. I will write down the third: "Since in all common and proper policies of the lands, cities, trades, and crafts, it is necessary and their will that one obeys the commands and prohibitions, high and low, so in the same manner and even more as necessity and common peace require, not only all faculty professors and regents or those who stay here for the sake of studying, but also those who deal with the liberal arts or in holy scripture and wish to earn from it, should obey the university's mandates, therefore they should be obliged to show such obedience, so that everyone is bound to give an account of his teaching, as he uses it, as required." From these words, after I gathered that they wanted to subject the ministry of the word to the university and I tried to oppose the article, the deputed senators intervened so that the matter remains silent, but it is not removed. Please explain what that article seems to mean to you. Against the fourth, Dr. Grynaeus fought fiercely; among other things, he argued: All professors should have a degree suitable for their profession. Now, because Grynaeus is a professor of theology, he is compelled by this article to become a bachelor.</p>
      <p>See, my Bullinger, what Satan attempts while fearing the peace of evangelical doctrine. Since you wrote about the oath of bishops to the pope in the book to the King of England, I asked if you could find and give me the oath of the doctors of theology; for the vice-chancellor, who has it, does not allow it to come to me. We are vexed by these trifles with great scandal to the churches. What comforts me here is that we are without blame, whatever some may impute.</p>
      <p>I thank you for those horrendous miracles you sent; although they are indeed very astonishing, it is remarkable how much it delights me to know them.</p>
      <p>But I will also tell you something dreadful: Today, the funerals of two adults, a maidservant and a young nobleman from France, were carried out from the house of Dr. Grynaeus, which I do not know if it has happened anywhere else in our time. Eight days ago, a maid from Zurich also died there. Therefore, you will pray to the Lord for us. Write back in time, if you have any leisure, about the article I am sending; for those who set it up are trying to interpret it differently.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in the Lord and with all the brothers. From Basel, hastily, January 19, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Zurichers, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
