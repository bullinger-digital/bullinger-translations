      <p>Greetings. I have nothing, I owe nothing, as the saying goes, except for this one thing: Mr. Coignet writes to me from Paris on May 27th and informs me that he has happily arrived in France, was most graciously received by the king, queen, and princes, and was soon burdened and honored with I know not what offices; he himself presently receives nothing.</p>
      <p>He adds that the matter is not yet fully settled, especially that the Parisians are resisting; he found the king at Saint-Germain, and then proceeded with him into the city; there is the most abundant hope from God, but not very much from men; God, who began wonderfully, will lead it to the desired end much more wonderfully.</p>
      <p>He prays against the English war; but if the English do not leave the port of Havre de Grace, it will happen that the king will enter Normandy with an army, etc.</p>
      <p>This is all I have; there are various rumors, etc.</p>
      <p>Some Lutheran clamorers, I think Brentius first, have written a refutation of the catechism of the Palatine prince; the prince from the chancellery took care to send the refutation to me through his courier and requested my response.</p>
      <p>I easily understand and gather the judgments of other ministers of the churches.</p>
      <p>I completed our response not without labor; I sent it yesterday.</p>
      <p>I pray to God to preserve the prince, to spread the truth, to drive away error and imprudent dogs from the church of God.</p>
      <p>Let us pray, my brother, to the Lord, that he may preserve the church.</p>
      <p>If Vergerius is with you, greet him and encourage him to serve Christ faithfully.</p>
      <p>From the Baden assembly, scarcely begun, we have nothing yet.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and I thank you for your book on Providence, etc. I wrote in great haste. June 25, 1563.</p>
      <p>Greet the councilors, brothers, fellow ministers, and all friends. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Mine greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Chur church, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
