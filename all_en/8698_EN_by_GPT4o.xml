      <p>S. With great sadness, I learned of your and Mr. Simler's and Mr. Gwalther's fragile health, considering, most reverend father, the times we have fallen into and how much your presence and firmness or well-being are required.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we must pray to the Lord, our strength and arm, that, if ever before, in this troubled time, He may look after His churches and not allow their bright lights to be extinguished. I have long since received all the news you wrote about, but I delayed my response because I have been miserably overwhelmed by a weariness of all things for a long time. I wanted to write through Mr. MÃ¼ller; but even then, my mind was not right, wounded by a thousand injuries, it does not cease to ponder more deeply the dangers in which we are involved. Nevertheless, the gracious Lord intersperses rays of His grace and help, by which I am encouraged, though sick at heart, to diligently undertake my duty. Indeed, I have something to do: for Euripus will sooner cease to flow than Merius and Gantner will cease to be agitated by new furies. Merius, already at Davos and recently on the 14th of this month at Fanas, in public before the whole multitude of peasants, most shamelessly slandered the people of Zurich, Bern, and especially us of Chur, whom he contemptuously calls bishops and robed priests. He openly said that the people of Zurich smear the eyes of the simple with their filth so that they cannot see the truth; indeed, he proclaimed that they seduce the wretched common people with insane doctrine. And when he was rebuked by a certain honest and serious man for attacking those churches with his excessive insults undeservedly, he retorted: yes, he has done it and will pour it even more on those of Zurich, etc.</p>
      <p>These things are true and can be proven by the testimonies of many pious people. As for us and the whole synod, he shamelessly slandered us in the presence of all the peasants, accusing us of violating the public laws of the Rhaetians with our tyranny, depriving the people of their privileges and freedom, which they have diligently observed in choosing and retaining ministers; that this is now being changed, overthrown, driven away, and snatched from the churches by our lust, by which we replace the citizens and natives with new, foreign, itinerant scoundrels and boys, who would only be our supplicants and worship us as pontiffs; the rest, who could restrain us, we shun worse than a dog or a snake; hence he also rejoices greatly, who, weary of this wicked society of ours, finds himself in utmost distraction with us as with liars and not one better than the other. But that Satan perverts and treacherously transfers to us what was rightly castigated in the antichristian bishops when all adhered to the papal mud. For when all communities still followed the papal filth, it was not for religion but for praise that bishops imposed any kind of priests on the communities, whom they were forced to retain as sent and consecrated, even if they were adulterers and murderers; the power to change or depose them rested solely with the bishop. This tyranny was abolished in those Rhaetian churches, which, illuminated by the light of truth, can now elect and depose their ministers by public and common votes. At the same time, to prevent the peasants from acting too freely, the Rhaetian lords took care to establish synods, which they adorned with certain privileges and diplomas, which we have in our hands, so that no one would ascend the pulpit unless examined, approved, and legitimately sent; if any ran voluntarily, not sent, not approved, or contrary to the synod for certain reasons, they would be removed from their station by the same order and authority. Now that man seems to incite the peasants, especially under the pretense that we are plotting against their country's freedom and laws by force, arts, and whatever means we can. The goal set for Mario is also to reinsert himself among his own, from where he was expelled, and to present himself as the leader of the Samaritans against our will, whose nocturnal and clandestine plots hinder the work of the true church. But as that wicked attempt has excellently deceived its author, frustrated and made public, so it will undoubtedly soon be that he will also pay the penalty for his rashness. - Now I come to Gantner's obstinacy. He immediately after the synod ended, professed that he had signed against his conscience: nevertheless, he persists in his opinion as before; that he was overcome by our force, arts, and tricks, not by the rights of truth; he complains repeatedly that we were both accusers and defendants and witnesses, and that he was oppressed by us just as Christ was by the Pharisees. On October 18, he also summoned his fellow minister, Johann Ger, whom he expelled from his priesthood, which Gantner himself attested with his own hand. Now he is suing him, because he spreads these things about him and reported to the peasants that he favors the Anabaptists, as if the synod could not testify about all the things he cunningly accused that dear brother of. But the judges of this place have suspended that case for a month's time. Meanwhile, Gantner will respond elsewhere, as I will soon add. This must be mentioned: when they were litigating in public court at St. Peter's in Schanvicia, Gantner, driven by a frenzy, publicly marked us with a black coal and said that he was indeed condemned, but without any legitimate and necessary reasons, and that no magistrate has the power to prohibit him from the office of preaching. The whole court will testify to these and other enormous things.</p>
      <p>Gantner wanted to oppress Ger with the help of his peasants, so that, aided by some testimony of feigned innocence, he might prepare a way and access for himself to appeal to the citizens' senate, which is frequently held at this time when the magistrate is elected, hoping to obtain everything if he were given the opportunity to clear himself again. But the wretched and insane man not only suffered a rejection but was so thoroughly rebuked by the native senate that, leaving in anger, he threatened that he would no longer request anything from the magistrate. Since both of these men have burdened all good people with such slanders, we have deemed it entirely our duty to complain to the magistrate of the Three Leagues about all these injuries and to lay them before him. Therefore, we recently entered the senate at the assembly and openly revealed what these men are plotting, and we asked the lords of the Three Leagues to summon Mario and Gantner to the upcoming Martinian assembly by their authority, so that they may answer us on all the matters we desire from them. The lords agreed and kindly promised to summon those men. We hope this day will bring some end to our controversy. May the Lord grant that all things be conducted wisely, bravely, and modestly for the eternal glory of His name and the salvation of the church. Amen. - Those minor assemblies, in which we obtained these things, were held because of the president Dietaegius, who wanted to vindicate himself before the lords for the grave injury inflicted on him by the count of Ems and the royal orator. How great that cause is will be explained by me in a private letter. However, I am sending a brief pasquinade explaining the beginning, process, and end. The summary is this: that Ascanius, who in his judgment should have deprived Pompey the Roman of life in previous years, having escaped from the Hannibalic prison, stood here in Chur at the extreme fortune, unless he had been pardoned, he would have been beheaded. This Prosper, a relative who lives in Rogoreti, by evil arts brought him back under the power of the count and sold his relative for 500 crowns, as the pasquinade says. What has now happened to Ascanius is unknown; he has not been seen by anyone since he was lured into the trap by Prosper. There is indeed a rumor that Ascanius has gone to France through Basel; but it happened in some invisible way, if that is the case. Prosper, the sum of the crowns not paid, blurted out something about the count and that he was deceived into betraying his relative, as he complained to the most illustrious lord Dietegius. The disgrace of the committed robbery is revealed to the most illustrious Ferdinand. Prosper, defeated by new gifts, as the pasquinade suspects, denies that he wrote these things; but he falsely testified against the count and against his conscience in favor of the president, who promised him 20,000 gold coins. Hence, Prosper is accused of treason by the president. Ferdinand advises the Rhaetians to investigate the author of this evil by the rule of justice.</p>
      <p>The case of Rogoreti was conducted in the Mesolcina Valley. Prosper was acquitted. The president appealed to the Two Leagues; the third indeed was present, but did not want to act. Therefore, in the senate of the Two Leagues, that most pestilent case was more rightly judged, the source of the evil was revealed, the president was acquitted, and the judgment pronounced in the Upper League was found to have been obtained by gold. This presages a great evil for Rhaetia. Would that I were a false soothsayer! A few days later, Flavius Garganus, the sole delight of the royal orator, was thrown into the most ignominious prison by our senate, namely on the 27th of this month. Today, he is brought out sick and is being guarded. What the cause is, I do not fully know. There is a rumor that he acted as an inquisitor of heretical depravity within our bowels and walls, which I can hardly believe. But it is not safe to add more about such matters, saela, saela, saela. I write to you, not to the Rhaetians. Now you cannot bear all things; but when I come, I will lead you into all truth. May the Lord Jesus keep us, who are in the most manifest danger of life. Please inquire from Mr. MÃ¼ller what this matter is, about which he recently warned me to be cautious; for traps are said to be laid for my life by the president; what if also by others? However, I write this to you, not to the Rhaetians, etc. On October 19, a message was brought from Mr. Ombe Justinian in Venice about a most bitter battle between the Venetian and Turkish fleets, which, however, was not so mournful on the part of the Christians, namely on October 7. 50 Turkish galleys were defeated towards the east; Mr. Jovenium, the governor, the supreme leader of the Turks, perished with 50 galleys. The Pasha was killed, his head affixed to a lance; the night interrupted the battle...</p>
      <p>One hundred and fifty Turkish ships were captured; Occalium escaped with a few galleys; Pertau Pasha can no longer be found; 20,000 Turks were slaughtered; five thousand were captured, twenty thousand Christian captives were freed. Of the six large Christian galleys, only three men were lost; the Venetian fleet suffered very little damage.</p>
      <p>The supreme leader of the Venetians, Barbangus, met his death, killed by a blow to the eye. Famagusta is still safe and strong, reported to have been brought to Venice on October 6. These things have been reported to us as certain in an Italian letter from Plurio; whether they are to be believed, I do not know. Many rejoice; I fear it may be without cause.</p>
      <p>With these things, I wanted to overwhelm and burden you, most reverend father; I ask that you interpret everything, as they are quickly written, rightly, as you are accustomed to do with all my things, and do not cease to help with mutual prayers before God. I have long since decided to fly to you for the sake of the grain matter, which has failed me; but I am so overwhelmed by various businesses that I fear I may not be able to come before the feast of Martin.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed father; may God raise and strengthen you and the others. All those whom you ordered to be greeted greet you most diligently, especially Mr. Campellus. October 29, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Th[obias] Ic[onius].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most illustrious and faithful leader of the church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
      <p>To you alone, my Josia; read this and return it after reading; you will understand from these why I write to you alone. Greetings and farewell.</p>
