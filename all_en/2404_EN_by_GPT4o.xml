      <p> Greetings. Until now, due to my affairs, I have not been able, most distinguished Bullinger, to respond to your letters which you sent to me some time ago. Now, however, I will do so, albeit briefly. Regarding my treatise, I will say nothing else at present, except that I am hesitant and, as if at a crossroads, uncertain whether I should publish it or not. There are those here who dissuade me, and this is because (as I also wrote to you before) they fear that it may hasten the death or bring some other harm to many pious brothers who live among the papists. However, your authority, which holds great weight with me, advises me to publish it, and almost persuades me. Indeed, my mind leans towards your opinion: provided that the speech is so tempered that the papists understand how unjust they are as judges, who judge not from the word of God, but from human traditions against the word of God, and with a perverse judgment consider heretics as Catholics and Catholics as heretics. Now, for the first time, a booklet by our pious, learned, and dearest brother Beza has come into my hands. It cannot but be greatly approved by all the pious. He sufficiently and more responds to those new academics, so much so that my treatise seems entirely superfluous, in which I bring nothing new: nevertheless, for the greater confirmation of the churches in true doctrine (as you most holy one admonish), I will endeavor that my little treatise, such as it is, may come to light as soon as possible, certainly more induced by your persuasion than by any other reason. </p>
      <p> What you wrote about the Emperor, about the Frenchman, and about others [...]. </p>
      <p> Strasbourg, September 24, 1554. </p>
      <p> Your most devoted, Hieronymus Zanchus. </p>
      <p> [...] What you wrote to the enemies of Jesus Christ displeases me and indeed all the pious, but not everything that the new rumor has spread for some time is true. Moreover, the Lord will not forsake His church; let the princes rise, let the papists rage, let them all gather against the Lord and against His Christ, as they will, yet the Lord will laugh at them and with His scepter will shatter them. Meanwhile, we will not cease to pray to the Lord, that He may avert from us and scatter, destroy, and promote His gospel, expand His kingdom, and, with sins condemned, mortify and quicken His faithful more and more each day through the Holy Spirit, so that they may no longer sin, but always live to God. </p>
      <p> Those to whom I conveyed your greetings, all in turn wish you enduring bodily health and eternal peace of soul, Martyr, Sturmius, Dasypodius, Marpachius, Sleidanus. I also wish the same for you and all your colleagues, and indeed for your entire church. Therefore, farewell and love us. </p>
      <p> Strasbourg, September 24, 1554. </p>
      <p> Your most devoted, Hieronymus Zanchus. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished and worthy pastor of the Zürich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered and esteemed father. </p>
      <p> Zürich. </p>
