      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>I have received two letters from your lordship since I returned to England, and I have written to you once about religion and certain things about myself, which I understand from your previous letters have reached your hands. In your later letters of March 20 from Zürich, which were not delivered to me in England until June 22, you write that various uncertain rumors about our affairs are being spread among you, but you expect more certain information from us ourselves. Behold, therefore, what I now write is true and certain, as are the other things I wrote to you and the people of Bern last year, namely to Mr. Johannes Haller and Mr. Musculus.</p>
      <p>The true and sincere doctrine is freely preached throughout England by those who are known to be able and willing to perform this task, being admitted in churches as preachers through letters of recommendation from the queen or some bishop among strangers: for all others, the office of preaching in churches is forbidden. No discipline has yet been established here by any public authority.</p>
      <p>But the liturgy for public prayers and other rites in the church, which was under Edward VI, is now restored among us by the authority of the queen and parliament (for thus the highest council is called). However, in the injunctions issued by the queen after parliament, certain ornaments are prescribed for ecclesiastical ministers, similar to those which priests once had and still have. Many ministers, who had previously laid aside all such garments, now resume and wear similar ones again for the sake of obedience, as they say. We are indeed few who abhor such vestments as much as that Christian soldier abhorred the crown, about which Tertullian wrote.</p>
      <p>For we are not ignorant of the occasion that the papists seize from this to offend the weak. For in the cathedral churches, the prebendaries, and in the other churches, the rural priests, retaining external vestments and internal minds from papism, so enchant the ears and eyes of many that they cannot but believe that the papistic doctrine is still retained, or at least will soon be restored. Many parishes among us have no ecclesiastical minister, and some dioceses are without bishops.</p>
      <p>And of those very few who administer the sacraments throughout this great region, not one in a hundred can and wants to preach the word of God; but all are compelled only to read what is prescribed in the books. Thus indeed among us now the harvest of the Lord is most abundant, and the laborers are very few.</p>
      <p>Those who were once bishops and other arch-papists among us, preferring the primacy of the pope to the authority of the queen, are deprived of all honors and stipends in England.</p>
      <p>Some of them are also recently committed to custody and prisons; and what will finally become of them is still unknown. In Scotland, not by public consent from all, but yet with great zeal and sincerity by very many, the gospel is received. And the Scots have long been trying to expel all the French from Scotland; hence among us, great preparations for war are seen, and many soldiers are sent to aid the Scots against the French. There is a port in Scotland, which in our language is called Leith: the French hold it fortified with ditches, ramparts, artillery, and arms, the English attack it. Many indeed are killed on both sides, and, as they say, no captives are kept alive.</p>
      <p>I have heard, which I suspect to be true, that nowadays such are the treaties of worldly peace, that they are completely dissolved if even one captive is detained alive on either side; yet they can remain very firm if many are killed on both sides. And I infer this because no war has yet been publicly declared between the French and the English, but rather such peace that merchants freely trade, the English in France and the French in England, while in the meantime soldiers of both sides miserably and hostily perish in Scotland.</p>
      <p>About myself, if you would like to hear, I would like you to understand that immediately after my return to England, I traveled through a great part of it for the purpose of announcing the gospel. There is a city in the middle of England, which is called Coventry.</p>
      <p>In it, ever since the gospel first emerged, there have been many zealous for evangelical truth; so much so that in the last persecution under Mary, some were burned, others were exiled with us, and the rest, having been tossed about in great miseries and difficulties for a long time, finally, with the restoration of sincere religion, solicited other preachers and especially me to announce the gospel among them in Coventry. After I had experienced for several weeks that a very large multitude was accustomed to frequent the public evangelical sermons here, I agreed with those who asked me to place my wife and family with them in Coventry; and thus now for almost a whole year I have freely given sermons, and they have liberally supported me and mine in this city. For neither I am bound to them, nor they to me, by any law or agreement, but only by free benevolence and charity.</p>
      <p>My wife recently gave birth to a daughter, who lives and is well with three other small children, whom she brought to me from her former deceased husband. Therefore, we greet you and yours, and we wish you all happiness and prosperity in Christ. For when I understood from your letters that your wife, your children, and your sons-in-law with their children were well, it was as pleasing to me as if I were by nature, as I am in spirit, one of those of yours, whom I pray God to bless and prosper in Christ perpetually.</p>
      <p>I am glad to hear that you have written books against the sects of the Anabaptists: and I am not surprised, but I am sorry, that the pains in your head are greater and more frequent with your advancing age, thinking of your years and labors, and I pray to God that He may keep you safe and healthy for a long time for us and His church. We who once lived together in one house in Zürich, many Englishmen, are now, by necessity, scattered far from each other throughout England. But it cannot be otherwise than that we all persevere in remembering the excellent hospitality and kindness which Zürich, under your patronage, provided for us, very conveniently, and to give thanks in the names of all of us to the magistrates of the republic and the ministers of the church, and to the other good men of Zürich, for such timely, pleasant, and necessary hospitality shown to us exiles there for Christ's sake; and please convey our greetings in the Lord to that matron Elizabeth, who served us. I also beseech you to deign to greet in my name the most pious and learned gentlemen, Peter Martyr, Bernard Ochino, R. Gualther, Theodor Bibliander, your most dear sons-in-law, Lavater, Zwingli, and Simler, furthermore Johannes ab Ulmis, who once lived in England, and John Burcher the Englishman, with the other pious ones known to me among you in the Lord. It would also be pleasing if you would sometimes mention us with thanksgiving in your letters to the people of Bern or Aargau. I, for my part, have written to the ministers and chief scribes of both churches, and I will write again, God willing, shortly. May God grant that we may always be mindful and ready at every opportunity to return due thanks to you in Christ. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Coventry, July 10, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours faithfully in Christ, Th. Lever.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most pious and vigilant father and pastor in the church.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
