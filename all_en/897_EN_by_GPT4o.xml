      <p>Through Jesus Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I have never doubted, dearest Bullinger, your benevolence, zeal, and piety towards me. I wrote in such a way as to elicit letters from you, so that I might be delighted by the sweetness of your letters; indeed, I earnestly and repeatedly ask you to write to me more often, even if you have nothing to write about; for you may even write that you had nothing to write, as long as it is not in these words. Concerning our Balthasar, you acted prudently, lovingly, and piously; I praise and thank you at the same time. He is easily affected; therefore, you did well to relieve him of this trouble and to console him. What you entrusted to me, I have diligently executed; for I have recommended this young man to those to whom he wished to be recommended; indeed, they all gladly heard that it was done in your name and promptly and eagerly promised their help, zeal, and industry, first for your sake, then for mine, and for the sake of this young man, who indeed seemed to me to have not the least talent, and if only he fulfills what he promises (for I have, as usual, fatherly encouraged him), I expect great and generous things from him.</p>
      <p>Now two of your young men, by your order, as they affirm, are returning to their homeland, Johannes Hyler and Johannes Bumann, whom, since you recommended them to me when they were sent here, I did not want to let go without my letters when they informed me of their departure. While they were here, they seemed to me to be quite modest and diligent young men; therefore, if my recommendation has any weight with you (which I say, since, being yours, they cannot be anything but recommended by themselves), but if my recommendation has any weight, I would like them to be recommended to you, my dearest brother, especially so that you do not let them lie in idleness, but rather take care to cultivate them more and more with serious studies and morals. Farewell and greet the whole family in my name and in the name of my whole family, along with Mr. Gwalter and your most delightful son-in-law Zwingli, my dearest. Basel, the sixth day before the Nones of May, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Celio Secondo Curione.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, a singular friend and brother in the Lord. In Zürich.</p>
