    <p xml:id="regest1">The written commitments in such a significant matter [namely the question of the Lord's Supper], especially the agreement to Bucer's writing "Ad Monasterienses", cannot be subsequently dismissed as non-binding statements among friends. If [the Zurichers] refuse a meeting, they break their promise, treat [the people of Strasbourg] with undeserved suspicion, and risk the separation of the Swiss churches from those of Germany and England at the upcoming synod. Therefore, urgently request brotherly hearing once again.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, my Bullinger, that we do not allow anything human to interfere in such a great cause of His and with such peril to the churches. We know, excellent man, that no promises hold against the Lord, and we are not ignorant of the freedom friends have in private letters. But for so many years now, we have been dealing with this cause of church unity with you, so many times it has been written about back and forth, and we have also explained our entire opinion in person, and we believed that neither the cause nor we were regarded by you in such a way that you would say or write anything to us in this cause that was not well-considered and most religiously weighed. Therefore, since you have already approved our opinion and the treatment of the mystery of the Eucharist, which we published in the booklet to the Monasterians, and in your previous letters to me, you testified, unprovoked, that I bore witness to your spirit, expressed your mind - you recognize your words - I thought you were writing to us in this great matter of the Lord, so long treated, about which you were most certainly convinced to be the Lord's opinion. And for that reason, I sent your words, written to many churches and princes, wishing to confirm their hope of future unity among us, which they so anxiously desire. Now, if it pains you and I complain more vehemently to you that this hope does not hold for so many truly holy people and for me, I think there is a reason you should not blame me too much for it. Who would count the testimony of a public writing in a matter examined with such great contention for so many years among trivial matters, about which a friend writes to a friend whatever comes to mind in any mood? Be, my Bullinger, a fair judge between us! But whatever may be about these letters and your testimony, the opinion of Christ should always prevail with us, from which if anyone has deviated anywhere, let him be anathema, who would blame us for returning to it.</p>
      <p>But I beseech and implore you again and again by the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, consider how it befits you to deny us your presence and to prevent us from meeting in the Lord, when you voluntarily bound yourself to sacrilege if you did not come to the assembly of brothers either in Basel or Constance, provided you were called together with the Bernese and Baselers. You write that for many reasons you fear more discord and contention will arise from this? What, I ask, are those reasons? Christ promised us that He would be present in our midst if we meet in His name. Now, if you do not believe us when we promise to meet in the Lord, certainly you do not feel about us as brothers should feel about brothers and as true love necessarily feels. We judge more amicably about you, whom we promise will meet us in the name of the Lord and do everything. You add that you know what I am aiming for in this meeting we are requesting, namely that you change your ways of speaking about the Eucharist. But we have testified to you that we require nothing beyond what you have given in your published books; rather, we would act to explain to you our opinion and that of other churches about the entire administration of the Gospel, to learn what you can bear in it, what less, and to seek a way with you so that the Swiss churches, with the discord confirmed, would not be separated from the other churches of Germany, now even of all England. For it is pressing that they, having shared their faith and doctrine, join themselves more closely and prepare more diligently for the common defense of our faith against the efforts of the enemies, whether they seek us through a council or another way. For from your public writings, we have had a certain hope that we would easily find this way if we had endured to hear each other, so that such a certainly ruinous schism would not prevail. Hence, we have proclaimed your promise of a meeting with great confidence to the princes and principal churches and for that reason, we have prayed that the general synod of our churches be postponed until Easter, so that in the meantime we might settle things most conveniently. If now the decision stands not to admit this meeting of ours, with what sorrow of piety will we confess this to those princes and churches, to whom we have made certain the expectation of our meeting from your sworn promise? And what, I ask, will the saints everywhere judge about this change of your promise? For they will not be able to see what reason there could be that the ministers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ cannot meet and confer with fruit in the cause of the Lord. We know with what caution you must act, lest your authority in your churches be undermined. But we wanted to temper everything in such a way that we, who strive to render an account of the faith and doctrine of the churches throughout Germany and to accommodate ours to yours, would first communicate everything separately with you before we spoke a word in the presence of those who might be offended by it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, see, see, most esteemed brothers, that you do not despise Christ and all His churches throughout the world in us. We, lest we omit anything that we know pertains to your salvation and that of your churches and all, again beseech you by our Lord Jesus Christ, make yourselves available to us, that we may meet in the Lord and confer among ourselves about His doctrine. We promise by the same Lord Jesus Christ to do nothing with you except what you yourselves will judge to pertain to the glory of Christ and to be our duty, and however you may agree with us or disagree, always, whatever is of charity, we will lavishly bestow upon you. Do not allow, brothers, we beseech you again and again by our Lord Jesus Christ, that the churches of Christ may ever complain about you that your brothers, certainly zealous for you, could not obtain from you that you would hear them in the cause of Christ. You know what we complain about the papists; what Paul himself did in this matter is clear; what promise of Christ concerning the assembly of the saints we all proclaim.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Bullinger, and do not interpret a more serious admonition in such a great matter from your truly most loving brother as an injury.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, January 17, 1536. Your M. Bucer, whom, I beseech, do not make either a tavern-keeper or a traitor of the word of God, unless you have heard him first. It would have been unheard of in the church to do this so much verbally by itself.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man M. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, to be honored in the Lord.</p>
