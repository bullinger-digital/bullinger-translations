      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your very lengthy letter, which responds to three of mine.</p>
      <p>The hypocrisy of the people of Constance being exposed will perhaps serve as a lesson to the pious, so that they may be more secure and invoke God more, as they must dwell among lions. They wish to escape one harm and will incur many more, and that soon. I do not doubt that the Lord will eventually show His glory to all in the whole world, so that they may recognize Him as the only God and avenger of evils. You might know better than I about the sedition in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has moved away from Speyer, the Landgrave in great disgrace; his wife came to Speyer before the Emperor descended into the Netherlands, fell at his feet, and begged for mercy for her husband, reminding him of the vows made, promised, and sealed; she behaved poorly, as it is permissible to believe she was more affected towards her husband; she asked the Emperor for the release of the prince. The Emperor was not moved, she was told to go to the Landgrave; she stayed with him overnight. In the morning, the Emperor departed, the Landgrave told her to bring the children closer to God, to entrust the matter to God; He will surely act according to His grace. The woman behaved poorly, weeping, tearing her hair; but there was no mercy. The Landgrave was set on a horse, at his side a sword, the hilt and pommel iron, the other wooden. Either he wants to disgrace the Cat or fears his cruelty, lest he destroy himself or kill others who guard him. In front of him are riflemen, behind him go spearmen and other weapons. The Saxon rides on a borrowed horse, behind him goes a miserable man carrying the banner he lost, poorly dressed. Thus they must be a mockery to all people.</p>
      <p>Master Bastion Schertlin's scribe sits on a pack saddle, bound with iron, as they carry roosters on horses. Four preachers from Ulm are sent to Leuven on a cart, they must give an account of their faith there. Thus the pious, who wanted to plant the kingdom of Christ, must be a spectacle to the world.</p>
      <p>In Cologne, there was supposed to be an uprising because of the bishop, who did not want to swear to the city in the old manner, which movement the Emperor suppressed. He also wants to reshape that republic into another form. In Strasbourg, a mandate was supposed to be posted, where someone wrote on it: "Oh you lords of Strasbourg, you are thieves and murderers against God." It is said to have been carved into the wood and smeared with mud. I believe if one knew who he was, he would not do it again.</p>
      <p>There is still a persistent rumor about Ghent and the murdered Maria, although some who were in Frankfurt have heard nothing about this matter.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand is doing something in Count George's land; it will be hard for the people, what they have for goods outside Württemberg, he takes all the fruits. Thus perhaps he seeks a pretext for rebellion and invading foreign dominion; he has bad advisors who offer harsh remedies throughout Germany to the miserable Germans, who have sold all their freedom for cheap money.</p>
      <p>We hear that the governor of Milan has been killed by the papal forces, which will stir up new troubles.</p>
      <p>What do you think will come of these diets? I fear that the Interim will be imposed on us, against which many good men have written and will still write, if the Lord grants them life.</p>
      <p>The wedding with Prince August and those from Holstein will proceed. It is also said that Margrave Joachim of Brandenburg has been captured by Count Mansfeld, where, I do not know yet.</p>
      <p>But with the return of our printers, I might have letters from Saxony and Hamburg and other places. If I receive any news, I will not hide it from you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet D. Bibliander, Pellican, and the others in my name. 24th September 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius</p>
      <p>This letter belongs to Master Heinrich Bullinger, priest in Zürich, my dear friend. Zürich.</p>
