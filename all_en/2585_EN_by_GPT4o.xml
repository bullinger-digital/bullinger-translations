      <p>S. D. Your master was with me, beloved son, whom I would have gladly treated as honorably as possible for his merits towards you; but he was in such a hurry that it was only possible to confer a few things with him. Nevertheless, he saw my goodwill and that of my people towards him. He kindly took upon himself the care of you again, and when I send you elsewhere, he will also take in Johann Rudolf. Therefore, diligently inquire from the learned which place is now the safest and where good letters and piety flourish. Perhaps you will leave Strasbourg by the beginning of September, provided I understand that you are not becoming worse, but better. Your master now gave you a good testimony and made a calculation with me; after the eight crowns given previously when you came there, I still owe him four florins and a batz, in total 17 guilders 2 batz, besides what you consumed at the table. I praise your diligence, which your master commended, and your frugality. I gladly make these expenses for you, as I see you are both diligent and not wasteful. Continue in this way, my dearest son; you please your mother as well; I speak well of you to your brothers and sisters. See to it, and pray diligently to God, that you proceed in good; for I would hardly bear greater expenses, as they are too many, and I have otherwise great costs and not an income accordingly, as you know. However, see to it, my son, that you do not err in accounting, so that no injustice is done to your master; for when I compared the notes given by you to your master with those you sent to me, they did not seem to agree everywhere. But when I saw that the principal sum came to the same, I became more at ease. I did not find in his papers the 10th of December, yet nothing was missing in the total. Therefore, see to it that you are diligent, so that no wrong occurs even for a haller; for he does us great good, and serve him and his, as far as you can for the sake of your studies. See to it that you study diligently, so that if I recall you within or after two years, you return without disgrace and with the greatest glory by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>We are all well by the grace of God. Everyone greets you and all yours. D. Marpachius and D. Valentinus Erythreus were with us; you will greet them most amicably from me. You will also greet D. Garnerius and all good men. March 12, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I wanted to write to D. Hatto, but I could not; you will greet him.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Heinrich Bullinger, in Strasbourg, at the house of Lord Burcher the Englishman.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg.</p>
