      <p>To his Leo, grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>So with zeal for God, my brother, I am incensed against the bloodthirsty Johannes Fabri and his similar Jugurthas, that I could not restrain myself from advising these few things, namely that you read Ambrose's Book 2 of "On Duties" chapter 28 and Lactantius in Book 6, "On the True Worship" chapter 25; so that from these fathers the impiety of Thraso is overthrown, by which he, driven, detracts from the poor, but conveys to the papistic harpies and accuses the innocent of sacrilege, namely that they have despoiled the church of God, that is, the phantoms, figments, witches, ghosts, and household gods. Although I am not unaware that the authority of Scripture, which stands on our side, is stronger, yet some unknown ardor compelled me to advise Minerva to the sow.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet Zwingli for me.</p>
      <p>At Kappel, 11th of May in 1526.</p>
