      <p>Fridolin Brunner sends many greetings to his old friend Bullinger, the most excellent man. We owe you immense thanks, most honorable man, for responding to our requests so quickly and fulfilling them. This action has shown clear evidence that you love us and that the churches of Christ are of concern to you. As is your custom, you make your innate candor and integrity shine perpetually through your writings and deeds, and you always present yourself as the sincere Bullinger. May the Lord ensure that you remain steadfast in this holy purpose until the end of your life. Furthermore, as you are not unaware, the church of Rüti was encouraged by the arrival of Matthias Bodmer, and it should be known that it has conceived much joy from his arrival, especially since he was recommended and sent by you; for your recommendation holds so much authority and trust with us that we did not anxiously investigate Matthias's doctrine and piety, but accepted him without examination as a legitimately elected minister of God. I presented him to the church of Rüti, which I not long ago presided over, and to our magistrate with his letters of recommendation, after which they have high hopes for the man and promise much to themselves. The church received him with open arms, which is an omen indicating that the election and arrival will be successful. To this end, they have promised him such annual stipends, from which he, along with his family, will be able to sustain himself honorably and sufficiently. Meanwhile, you congratulate me on my sacred office. May the Lord repay you with much happiness; I also hope your prayers will be fruitful, as I myself am accustomed to praying to the Lord that you will not be disappointed in the hope you have conceived of me. In good faith, I will handle all matters of Christ to the best of my ability, with God's help and effect. At the end, you mention your illness, which has greatly troubled and disturbed me. The reason is that I see the republic will suffer much loss both from your illness and your absence.</p>
      <p>May God grant better and avert such evil. Farewell in the Lord, who grants you long-lasting and firm health and the years of Nestor, amen. I wish to ask you to share with me, if you have any notes or commentaries on the Old Testament, such as on the books of Kings or the Pentateuch, etc., for a time.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Dated January 12 from Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious doctor of theology, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most excellent minister of the Zürich church, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
