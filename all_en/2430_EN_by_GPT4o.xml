      <p>Caelius S[ecundus] Curio through Christ Jesus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>To maintain my perpetual custom and my goodwill towards you, dearest brother, I am sending you my dialogues "On the Magnitude of the Blessed Kingdom of God" and I beseech you by our old friendship, that if I assert nothing impious or against the apostolic faith, but with a sincere mind bring forth my prophecy or interpretation for the glory of God, you interpret everything with Christian charity in the best light and endure them with an even mind. However, I do not write this because I think you would do otherwise, as I understand your gentleness of spirit in all matters and your constant love for me, but because it is fitting for me to write to you in this way, whom I piously revere and love. For I am not unaware that there is no writer so wise, so cautious, and so pious (I always except the apostles of the Lord), in whose writings, if someone were to inquire more scrupulously, they would not find something that seems worthy of some criticism. Therefore, it is fitting for us to be more lenient towards those who write or publish something for the glory of God. Farewell, my dearest and most esteemed brother, and pray to God for us.</p>
      <p>My wife and children sincerely greet you, your wife, and your children; I do the same sincerely and ask that you bid your sons-in-law farewell in my name. From England, I have received this as certain, that a new and great disturbance has been stirred up there, so much so that the king and queen were contemplating flight with their Spaniards.</p>
      <p>They say the cause of the disturbance was that they wanted to appoint Spanish men to fortresses and magistracies. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, 15th October 1554.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most wise Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most beloved and esteemed brother and lord. In Zürich.</p>
