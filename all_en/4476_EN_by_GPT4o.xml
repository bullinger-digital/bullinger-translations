      <p>Greetings. The letters you wrote to our Beza, esteemed brother, I have already informed you were delivered to me. I also received yours from the Belgian, our neighbor, five days after he had arrived here. When I was informed by the excellent young man, to whom you had given the message for me (he is the one who fled from his father and leader, born in the Val d'Aosta), that you had written two days before his departure, I received the message less graciously. There was no excuse, as I preached every morning and lectured in the public school in the afternoon. However, I have become hardened to the barbarism of that nation, and because they are our neighbors, I do not dare to speak too harshly. For I am also a Belgian, although a great difference is evident from the dissension. This in jest, because we are too similar.</p>
      <p>I come to the letters.</p>
      <p>What the French envoy would do in Germany during his passage was suspected by wise men, who saw that the pretexts of the embassy were frivolous. The Guise family has one goal: to cause as much confusion as possible, to involve as many as they can with them. Therefore, whatever you write that they have attempted so far, I do not doubt to be true.</p>
      <p>But God has his own tricks to hinder them. For the Emperor wants to acquire the Duchy of Milan for his son, the King of Bohemia, so that he does not lack an inheritance. As you know, he has married off his two youngest daughters in Italy, one to the son of the Duke of Florence, the other to a Mantuan.</p>
      <p>The latter is a senator without a vote.</p>
      <p>However, the one who governs the Pope at his own discretion and possesses the kingdom of Tuscany so that all neighbors, terrified by his power, are silent, aspires to greater things. The Venetians, the Duke of Ferrara, and others join him.</p>
      <p>Each one looks to his own interests. The beginning of the story is that the Duchy of Camerino was taken away from the legitimate prince without right. The Pope restored it.</p>
      <p>But because the Apostolic See was defrauded in the exchange, Piacenza and Parma are demanded back, not seeing that these games will lead to a serious conflict.</p>
      <p>And yet these are to be the preludes to a general council. I easily endure it, nor do you intervene.</p>
      <p>Therefore, what you wrote, that we must wait until the heavenly Father dissipates their bloody plans, now the sparks of this light begin to shine. Although it is fitting for us to look higher.</p>
      <p>This especially, if we have been sluggish before, God awakens our sloth. Before I tell you what is more hidden, you will understand how miserable and mournful the condition of France is from the complaint, a copy of which I send to you here. You will laugh that a booklet in our language is being thrust upon you: but you will have interpreters at hand who will explain the main points. You will hear of the marvelous stratagems of the House of Guise.</p>
      <p>In the rest, you will forgive my brevity, as no end is shown if I were to enter the vast forest completely. Recently, at Fontainebleau, which is a two-day journey from Paris, all the nobles were summoned. No one of royal blood was present except Cardinal Bourbon, the brother of the King of Navarre, who is either a cask or a bottle, not even bearing the figure of a man. The Guises thought the splendor of the assembly would be great if they summoned as many knights of the Order of Saint Michael as possible from everywhere. Thirty appeared, whereas before there were twelve.</p>
      <p>There the Chancellor boasted of the illustrious senate, in which the entire authority of the kingdom resided.</p>
      <p>A preface of rotten flattery.</p>
      <p>He then discussed the state of the kingdom, and since remedies were needed to heal the diseases, the cause of the evils had to be investigated. Here he ended his report, as if he had implored doctors for advice, being at a loss.</p>
      <p>The King, as planned, asked for the opinion of the Bishop of Valence, who was among the last of the counselors. The Guises wanted to probe everyone's secret feelings and suddenly attack individuals as it seemed fit. The Admiral rose unexpectedly and presented a petition to the King, in which those who wish to worship God purely in Normandy asked to be allowed to meet during the day, so they would not be subject to various calumnies for clandestine or nocturnal meetings. Asked where he got it, he replied that he was curious for the public good, to know more closely what the Lutherans were seeking. There were about fifty thousand people, whose subscription he would bring if it pleased the King. Two in the whole assembly spoke wisely, he and the Archbishop of Vienne.</p>
      <p>After hearing everyone, the better part of whom consisted of senators without a vote, the Duke of Guise licentiously spewed out what would be intolerable elsewhere. Take an example of stupidity in one word.</p>
      <p>When the Admiral said that it was a barbaric custom not to please, that the King should not only have bodyguards but be surrounded by an army: nor was this education worthy of France, nor should the young King be so trained that he should fear his own, whom he should rather retain and cherish with goodwill, that madman replied that the King did not need nurses or educators, as he was brought up in the fullness of virtue: (I report the words and syllables) that if he were to be educated, his mother would suffice for these parts. He even dared to say that whatever a thousand councils might decide, he was determined to follow the institutions of his ancestors. His brother, the Cardinal, spoke more gravely and sharply: it was in vain to seek any change in doctrine from councils. For it was not right to call into question what had previously proceeded from the Holy Spirit. If there were any vices in morals, it should be allowed for the bishops to correct them voluntarily.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Vienne had pricked him, who had said that it was a disgraceful and shameful sign of confusion that bishops, having left their churches, followed the courts of princes: and he had earnestly entreated the King not to deprive the churches of pastors under the vain pretext of the public good. Hence that no one should be bound by law or necessity: but each should do what he pleases of his own accord. You ask what the outcome is? The Archbishop of Vienne returned home.</p>
      <p>After four or five days were spent in vain consultations, a meeting of the estates was called for the month of December.</p>
      <p>The bishops were summoned for the twentieth of January, not to decide anything, but to discuss what should be proposed in the council. They had hitherto stubbornly fought against the holding of a meeting of the estates.</p>
      <p>Now, having gathered their spirits, they devised reasons to cleverly evade those who hoped for some relief. For an exception was added, that each province should consider before its own governors what matters it is expedient to deal with. Here indeed there is no freedom: then to choose their own delegates with the same governors as arbiters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, bought flatterers will come, whom it will please the Guises to name. But how frivolous and trifling the display of the council is, you will understand from the form of the edict, which one of your friends will interpret for you. Meanwhile, the truth of the gospel breaks forth.</p>
      <p>In Normandy, our brothers now preach openly: because private houses do not hold three or four thousand people. In Poitou and Saintonge, in all of Aquitaine, there is greater freedom.</p>
      <p>The region of the Occitan language, Provence, Dauphin√© has many fearless disciples of Christ.</p>
      <p>Why the Cardinal is silent, he has not obscurely professed: that the impudence of the madmen must be exposed in a short time. But the Lord, as I hope, will not only bring his wicked thoughts to light but also dissipate his impious attempts. The King of Navarre is still at rest.</p>
      <p>However, he is suspected as if he were planning something great. Thus, when garrisons were recently arranged in ten parts of the kingdom, the Guises placed the main strength of the French army on the borders of Aquitaine, to prevent passage if he should move. Nothing from Beza for a long time, because the way is closed.</p>
      <p>For a large quantity of arms was discovered in Lyon. Therefore, there is great trepidation there, and although no one opposes, they still seem to be in great danger. Thus, terror incites them to cruelty.</p>
      <p>Some have already been hanged, and whoever comes from here is soon seized and tortured almost indiscriminately. Concerning our Beza, know this: he did not go there of his own accord, but was summoned by the King's letters, in which he kindly and with great insistence asked me to grant him this favor. I did not think it should be denied, partly to correct his sluggishness, partly to counter the turbulent plans of many. For I never liked the idea of deciding the cause by force and arms.</p>
      <p>Since the forest of matters is denser than can be gathered into letters, I will end here. That you have not been burdened with the care of the boys who are sent there to be educated, to find suitable teachers, and to live in well-mannered families: the Senate, for this already inclined favor, gives you the greatest thanks it can, gladly ready to repay the favor if the opportunity ever arises. Besides the four who are supported publicly, some others are also sent privately, whom I wish to be no less commended to you. I have been asked on behalf of three.</p>
      <p>But since I hear that lodging is already certain for two, I greatly desire that provision be made for the third: because the mother is endowed with singular piety, and the father was familiar and dear to me. (The name is Michael Planchon.) Forgive me if, overcome by prayers, I impose more trouble on you than I would like. Farewell, most illustrious man and my especially honored brother.</p>
      <p>Give my warmest greetings to your brothers and colleagues, and to the rest of your friends. May the Lord always keep you all safe, guide you with His spirit, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, the first of October 1560.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>I do not know if I should thank Mr. Wolff, when he sent the booklet translated into Latin by Tilmann. Although that rabble-rouser deserved a censorious style, I thought it should be scorned.</p>
