      <p>Revered father in Christ. When the most pious man, Mr. Benedikt Aretius, came to visit your most pure church, it seemed appropriate to greet you with this letter, so that you may be more certain that I always cherish the memory of your integrity and kindness towards me, and also, that if there is any matter in which you wish to use my services, I offer you all my dedication. Moreover, out of my respect for you, I wanted to inform you of the singular benefit of the most good and great God towards me, who deemed me worthy to suffer persecution from the common enemy, the Antichrist, for His name's sake. For when he told me to appear before his tribunal of inquisition and to make a public confession of my faith, I, although I neither recognize nor should recognize him as my lord or judge, but rather as an enemy of Christ and a most bitter tyrant of His members, nevertheless wished to make known to all the essence of the doctrine I profess, both because the word of God so admonishes us, and also so that, if he wishes to proceed further and condemn me, as I do not doubt he will do in his immense rage, it may be evident how unjustly he acts, and thus he may reveal himself more and more to all as the son of perdition, who resists the gospel of Christ. Therefore, I published this profession written in our vernacular language, because I thought it would be more useful to our brothers who live in Italy.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I decided to send it to you, so that you may know that I have always pursued you with due reverence. I commend myself to your prayers to our God; for as far as I am concerned, I both wish and constantly pray to God for the greatest increase of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which have been generously communicated to you for the edification of the church. I would like you to convey my many greetings in my name to your most learned and pious fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Given in Heidelberg on the fourth day before the Nones of August. Your son in Christ, Eduard Thyenäus, Count of Ziegenhain.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious theologian and minister of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable father in Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
