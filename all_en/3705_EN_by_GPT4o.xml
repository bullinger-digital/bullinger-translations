      <p>On the tenth day of this month, when I came to your bookseller Froschauer's shop for the purpose of purchasing some of your books and mentioned you, most reverend man, and inquired about the portrait of Melanchthon, whether it had been delivered to you, he affirmed that he had seen it with you in your museum. Induced by this hope and joy, after purchasing some books, I gave him my name, so that if by chance I were to send any letters or any other matters to you through him, he might remember me more firmly. Upon seeing your name, he immediately offered me your letters along with a most welcome gift, which I have not yet deserved.</p>
      <p>However, I do not currently have any means to repay the kindness you have shown me, except to express my most favorable disposition towards you through these letters. Now, however, as I am almost done with my business and am heading straight home, I commend myself to your prayers and those of your colleagues and thank you greatly for the gift you have given, which should be a sign and testimony of our friendship. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Frankfurt on the 13th of September in the year 1558. Yours, Johannes Jaske.</p>
      <p>Greet all your colleagues, the most distinguished men. At the next fair, God willing, I will write from my homeland.</p>
      <p>To the most reverend man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord, to be delivered. Zürich at the Grossmünster.</p>
