      <p>You have indeed more easily obtained from me, most kind man, that I should offer my services to you, than it has been permitted by my lords. Nevertheless, since they could achieve nothing from me by prayers and it was not lawful to retain me by right or any agreement by force, they finally granted it with good grace. Therefore, I promise you my service and ask that you may always and everywhere have me recommended to you. You will hear all other things partly from the messenger, partly from me soon.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your most honorable wife and the whole family, whom both I and my wife wish to be well. In my name, you will greet in return Pellicanus, Bibliander, Megander, Gwalther, Binder, Frisius, Ammann, Collin, and all the learned men.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Kempten, December 29, 1542.</p>
      <p>Benedikt Euander, most devoted to your name.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, most pious and learned man, chief preacher of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
