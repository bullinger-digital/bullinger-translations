      <p>Grace be with you, esteemed brother in Christ, etc. When Montius, who was about to go to Zürich, happened to pass by me here, I would have committed a great sin against you, if I had not informed you about my affairs, etc. After suffering severely for seven months from quartan fever, with all my strength exhausted, I finally reached the harbor of salvation, and while giving thanks to the gracious God, congratulating myself, behold, it had left behind a harsher tyranny, a swelling of the whole body and all limbs, so much so that for three months I could not move even a finger's breadth without the help of others. But now the contracted limbs are returning to their usual state, as you see in this writing, duty. Pray for me, that the gracious will of the Lord may be fulfilled in me; for I desire to depart and be with Christ; I have finished the course. I would write more; but my weary limbs do not allow it; more at another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell then with all your fellow ministers, who, as I hear, have also diligently prayed to the Lord for me. May the Lord deliver you from all evil, etc. From my bed in Riquewihr, to which I have been confined during the winter and summer months. Greet the brothers by name, etc. July 27, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours truly, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most distinguished in piety and learning, etc., the most renowned Antistes of the Church of Zürich, etc., esteemed brother.</p>
