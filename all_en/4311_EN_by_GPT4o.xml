      <p>My friendly willing service to you beforehand.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, gracious, dear sir, your letter from the 7th of June has reached me, in which I learned that you have received the gift, which does not require much merit, as you mention, it is indeed a rare thing this time of year, we have made it good. As for the other matter, know that since I came from Chur, my stepson from Constance was with me; he informed me how the priests in Constance said that the imperial majesty had won Tripoli by force and that the landsknechts had behaved so bravely; otherwise, it would have been of no use, as the Spaniards and Italians were completely defeated. It is believed that what I wrote to you was not about him himself; yet I fear it is true. God knows what is best.</p>
      <p>Since I wrote to you about the new news of the angel in Pünten, I assume you have long been informed; if not, I am sending you the account herewith. Whatever you take and judge from it, I ask you to inform me.</p>
      <p>My lords in Chur hope the angel will soon come to light.</p>
      <p>Whatever comes to me about this, I will inform you. It is believed that a strange bird lies hidden in this nest.</p>
      <p>For as he reports, we should earnestly pray to God for us from Glarus, as there is a great bloodshed to be feared, knowing that we are constantly being threatened and especially these days it has come to us that in Uri it is said that they were supposed to march out yesterday, but something intervened; yet it is said that it will not be able to be contained, as they will attack us.</p>
      <p>God turns it according to His divine will; for we assure ourselves of nothing else than that we will be attacked. Besides, it is also said that it will go over the Valaisians as it will over us; but whatever happens, time will bring; I fear only that the Confederation's time is running out and must suffer a heavy fall. May God come to our aid and not look at our ingratitude, that we are so well settled, yes, now that we have recognized it.</p>
      <p>But pride has overthrown all kingdoms; it might happen to us too. May God prevent it. Amen.</p>
      <p>No more, then are entrusted to God in faithfulness; may He keep you in long-lasting health for the service of His church. Dated Glarus, the 11th day of June in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant Joachim Bäldi. The next messenger could not speak well, but he faithfully delivers all matters.</p>
      <p>Mr. Fridolin has let me read your letter, sent by Mr. Augustin Talpen. To the well-learned spiritual lord Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher in Zurich, my gracious, dear lord.</p>
