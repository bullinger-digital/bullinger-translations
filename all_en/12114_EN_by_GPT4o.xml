    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks for Blarer's letter [No. 2065]. It is unjust for [Andreas] Osiander [to disparage the people of Zurich in his "Apologia"], as the "Speculum" was published without their knowledge. - May God grant [Wolfgang] Musculus, who is active in Donauwörth, grace and the gift of pure teaching and action! - If only Pope [Paul III] would not bestow cardinal hats, so that he does not create enemies of the fatherland! - Not only [Duke Ulrich of] Württemberg, but also other princes and city magistrates are upset about Luther's "Short Confession." - As for Bucer, Blarer can be reassured. The [people of Zurich] do not want a war against Bucer unless he seeks it himself. In the [“True Confession”], Bucer is not attacked. In a historical account, in which [Wolfgang] Capito is also mentioned, it is described how Bucer urged the [Reformed] churches to unity, how the [Reformed Confederates] handed him the [First Helvetic] Confession for forwarding to Luther, and how he delivered the [Wittenberg Concord] to the [Swiss]. Even if [Bucer] is not a friend, the [people of Zurich] do not want to make him an enemy. Recently, he sent an overly long letter [HBBW XIV, No. 2049], which not all [people of Zurich] liked. In it, he already threatens with a refutation, and this before he has seen the [Zurich writing]! Moreover, Bullinger is not its sole author. Blarer will soon receive a copy. Bucer would deserve a "hair-pulling." - Blarer can be reassured regarding [the negotiations between the Confederates and Constance], no one will mention anything. However, he should urge his brother [Thomas] to respond. - Today, [Anna, née Röichli,] the wife of [Hans Rudolf] Lavater, died. - Jakob Knecht is in a hurry, so Bullinger writes hastily.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Your letters were most welcome to me, as always; may the Lord keep you safe with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>If Osiander has written anything more odious against us, he has done so most unjustly; for you know that the unfortunate "Speculum" was published without our knowledge.</p>
      <p>May our Lord and King Christ grant our Musculus the grace and ability to teach and act sincerely, which we must ask from the Lord with humble prayers.</p>
      <p>Would that the Pope would not offer cardinal hats, so as not to make enemies of the fatherland! But this is the power, these are the plans of darkness.</p>
      <p>We hear indeed that not only the Duke of Württemberg but also other princes and the best in the cities are very upset about Luther's writing. But these things happen by divine providence, so that the truth is not endangered.</p>
      <p>Do not doubt our modesty. However, pray for us to the Lord. As for Bucer, I assure you to be at ease; we do not involve him in the battle unless he wishes it of his own accord. We have made no odious mention of him, but in the historical account, where we narrate how amicably we conducted ourselves in the matter of concord, we mention Capito and Bucer once and again, namely that he urged our churches to concord, that our republic handed him our confession to be delivered to Luther, that he brought back the articles from Wittenberg. But what he perhaps fears, we will not write; we prefer to use him as a brother rather than an enemy, unless he absolutely does not want to be a friend.</p>
      <p>These days we received from him a lengthy letter, indeed a booklet, which did not please all of us very much. Would that he would keep such letters to himself!</p>
      <p>He is anxious and fearful. He threatens to contradict me before he has seen our writings. Nor do I write and act alone; we all write. We act, with God's help, to lay down our souls for what we publish. You will soon have a response.</p>
      <p>Bucer would indeed deserve a "hair-pulling"; but we always want to be the better ones, etc., unless he wants otherwise, then he will have less good than Luther; you know well how and why, etc.</p>
      <p>Be assured about the rest, my brother; everything will be well taken care of; none of yours will hear anything from ours. But you will conveniently urge and advise your brother not to leave it unanswered.</p>
      <p>Today, the wife of Mr. Lavater, a most Christian matron, passed away. May the Lord keep us all.</p>
      <p>The peasant (Jakob Knecht) hurried in a remarkable way; I barely wrote this. Zurich, January 16, 1545.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, always to be honored as a brother.</p>
