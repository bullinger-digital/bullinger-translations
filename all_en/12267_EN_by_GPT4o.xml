    <p xml:id="regest1">The German translation of Bullinger's Latin treatise "De vera hominis Christiani iustificatione" by the schoolmaster from Biel [Johann Leopold Frey], taken from the commentary on John, is being printed in [Bern]. Bullinger will receive it shortly. As a censor, R端mlang has approved the printing by the printer [Matthias Apiarius], with which the currently absent Venner and co-censor [Hans Rudolf] von Graffenried will certainly agree. - R端mlang hopes to meet Bullinger at the next Zurzach fair [1st September] and to be able to discuss the [Bernese] circumstances with him. Bullinger should not entrust anything to [Sulpitius] Haller, who has meanwhile been influenced by the Bucerans. The Bucerans are very cunning, seduce with rhetorical art, claim that one also needs human explanations to understand the words of the Lord, and then teach the truth again to calm the agitated spirits. - R端mlang mourns the deceased Georg Binder. - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The booklet you published in Latin on John concerning justification, translated into German by the schoolmaster from Biel, is being printed here. I will send you a copy shortly. It extends to five pages. When this booklet was shown to me to be handed over to the printer, I approved it; this will not be displeasing to the standard-bearer von Graffenried, my colleague, who oversees the press with me, although he is not currently at home.</p>
      <p>God willing, I will meet you in person at the next Zurzach fair and will discuss our entire situation with you, etc. I pray, do not trust anything to the treasurer Haller, for he is entirely dependent on the Bucerans. They have taken advantage of his simplicity, which they have lured into their trap. They are very skilled at hiding their poison and seduce the less cautious with much rhetorical artifice, pretending as if deceit is unjustly attributed to them, while they depend only on the simplicity of the Lord's words and reject human interpretations. They are shameless, indifferent to lying and using contradictions. However, few notice. They mix heaven with sea and earth, and teach confused things from which they cannot extricate themselves. They are not consistent with themselves, and to calm troubled minds, they sometimes teach the truth, then, betraying the truth, they spit out Bucer's saliva, etc.</p>
      <p>The death of my dearest companion Georg Binder has inflicted a very serious wound, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Keep me in your thoughts. Greet all the learned men with you in my name.</p>
      <p>Written hastily in Bern, 19th of August, year 45. Yours, Eberhard von R端mlang.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and faithful man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of Zurich, my ever-honored patron.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
