      <p>Greetings. Since I wrote recently, we have received no new news, except that in the meantime a meeting was held here of the four cities, namely ours (Bern), Freiburg, Solothurn, and Geneva, attended by the royal envoy, who is working hard to have the remaining two cities, including Geneva, join the common alliance. They have agreed to this, and there is consensus on all points of the alliance except one, which concerns religion. Here, they want to be free to practice their religion during times of war or when a garrison is to be sent there, while the Genevans argue that they cannot allow this in their city. There was a long debate; many forms of this article were drafted. Finally, they agreed on a somewhat obscure form, which both parties believe satisfies them, but each party must first present this form to their magistrate for approval or disapproval. Thus, they parted ways. Meanwhile, the ministers of Geneva wrote the present letter through their envoys and, as you see, seek our advice, not indeed, as we think, because they value our advice so highly, but to find supporters and eventually, wherever the matter may fall, to heap the blame for the whole affair or at least part of it upon us at some point.</p>
      <p>We responded that the first question was unnecessary, as for many years they have not only desired to enter into an alliance with these cities but also with all the Cantons of Switzerland and have solicited each of them for this purpose. As for the second, we cannot advise them to do or admit anything against their conscience; however, if the matter can be settled in some convenient way, they should not be the authors of any dissolution.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I also wanted to share this with you, most esteemed lord and godfather, privately, not to add more to your affairs, but at least asking that you write to me privately and familiarly in return, what you think about this matter. I will not divulge anything here rashly or without consultation, but only to be more confirmed, should someone ask me for further advice on this matter. Meanwhile, I commend you to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I also pray for the well-being of your entire household. My wife also sends her greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 21, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, chief pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Alliance of Geneva, Bern, Freiburg, Solothurn 1573.</p>
