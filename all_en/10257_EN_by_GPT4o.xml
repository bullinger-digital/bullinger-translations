      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Your printer delivered your letter to us, most illustrious Bullinger, and you cannot believe how much joy it brought us, as we had not been able to find out until now whether our Bucer, a sincere and God-loving heart, had made any progress with you. We had already learned of his efforts from him. Therefore, we give thanks through our common Savior to the heavenly Father, who was present with you, so that the somewhat growing discord ended in such a worthy concord for good and Christian men, and that too in a timely manner, and we earnestly pray that this great good may be fostered and remain perpetual. As for the forms of speech, it does not matter much which ones you use, as long as there is agreement on the matter itself and the main issue. Each church should be easily allowed its own freedom in such matters, as some things are more suitable for some than others. As far as Luther's agreement with this opinion is concerned, I myself do not yet fully understand, except that what he has already stated in the Confession of Faith of the Bohemian Brethren seems entirely modest and very close to us, especially since this booklet, as you know, was published a year and a half ago, I think, and is very pleasing to us in many respects, especially in the explanation of the Lord's Supper. I would indeed wonder what plan he had in mind to have this booklet published now for the first time, which he could not have been unaware had been published long ago, except that he believes, as is the case, that he can retreat with less offense to his churches if he approves the opinion of the Bohemians than if he openly reconciles with us, whom he has so unchristianly maligned and slandered almost everywhere beyond what is right and proper, and we will grant this to a man otherwise so well-deserving of Christ's churches. In return, tell me what you think of this preface there.</p>
      <p>The agreements between you and the Five Cantons seem obscure to me, and I greatly fear that they may be prejudicial to you somewhere. May the Lord make this peace, however it may be, firm.</p>
      <p>What our people have negotiated with the bishop and his accomplices these days through appointed arbitrators on both sides, your Froschauer will have truly reported to you. We recognize and embrace the will of the Lord here as in other matters. May He keep you with us, my dearest and best brother, for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Carlstadt, and the others. Zuiccius, along with his and my own brothers and others, sends greetings to you and them. Commend us to Christ, in whom fare well.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, May 23, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, a brother to be respected in Christ.</p>
