      <p>S. D. I finally arrived here in Straßburg on October 29, most illustrious man. The dangers I faced both in England and on the journey would take too long to recount; nor can I write them to you now, as I am still weary from the road. I only wish you not to be ignorant of this: the most reverend Archbishop of Canterbury is in chains, along with Bishop Hooper of Worcester, Michael Coverdale of Exeter, the Archbishop of London, the Archbishop of York, Latimer, and several pious and learned preachers, for whom I ask that your church prays greatly, as they are in extreme danger. I thought I too would perish in such destruction, but by His secret counsel and marvelous providence, the most good and great God preserved me. I did not flee from there secretly, lest the adversaries proclaim that I withdrew because I was unwilling to defend the doctrines I had taught. Indeed, when they boasted that there should be public disputations on religion, the Archbishop of Canterbury, by posting notices throughout the entire city of London, declared that he, along with me and some others, wished to defend in public disputations all that we taught and established in religion. This so disturbed them that they now preach that it is not safe to dispute these matters; and that it should not be allowed to call into question what has been accepted by the universal church. They therefore threw the Archbishop of Canterbury into prison; but they released me, giving me letters of dismissal, signed by the hand of the queen herself. Therefore, I am here; but I still do not know whether I will be received again in this church and school: for as I sense, the matter of the sacrament will somewhat hinder this; however, I am not very anxious about this. Indeed, I derive no small benefit here, as I clearly observe that the better and more learned are very eager to retain me. May God decide what most conduces to His glory and the edification of the church.</p>
      <p>I beg you not to take it badly that I have not replied to your letters which I received in the month of June: for I was ill; then the death of the king followed, and such grave events harassed us that I was hardly ever able to attend to my private affairs.</p>
      <p>Then know that after my departure from England, some of your letters, as I received in Antwerp, were delivered to Oxford, which you had written to me; but I have not yet received them: when they are brought here, I will read them with the greatest pleasure; and as I hope, I will console myself with them as I am accustomed.</p>
      <p>But since I remember that in previous letters you wrote to me about predestination; I will now be content to have replied that in teaching I am most careful that men do not cast their faults and sins upon God, nor derive excuses for their crimes from God's will: as for the rest, I handle it in such a way as to follow the divine scriptures as closely as possible. But now is not the place, nor is there time to say everything. You will understand what I have taught when I publish my commentary on Romans, which will happen this year. However, I cannot, to confess frankly, not grieve that our churches are continually shaken by new controversies; I think there are enough dissensions. May God, in His goodness, grant that we all think about predestination in such a way that what should be the greatest consolation for the faithful is not a sad matter of pernicious contention. As for me, I am not so obstinate in these matters that if a different opinion from mine is shown to me from the divine scriptures, I would not yield to the truth. I hope, however, that by God's goodness and mercy, we will all eventually think and speak the same. I beseech you to pray to God for me and to greet all your colleagues in my name. I pray to the immortal God that He may keep you safe for us for a long time. If there is anything you wish from me here, just let me know, and I will do my best to fulfill your wishes.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Straßburg, November 3. Yours sincerely, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
