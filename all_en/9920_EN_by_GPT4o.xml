      <p>Greetings. I, your very own, earnestly ask you, as much as I can, to join Mr. Tr√ºb to you as a collaborator and reader in the action of the supper: for in this way, this holy action is completed in other sacred gatherings in the city, so that there may not appear to be diversity in that first action of yours, nor that the otherwise irritable and suspicious people may seem to be despised or held in less honor than other gatherings. As it is most fair in many ways, what I demand from you, so you will greatly gratify me in this matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, beloved brother and fellow minister.</p>
      <p>I am sending you a catalog from which you may choose those whose services you wish to use in administering or distributing the supper.</p>
      <p>Mark those you have chosen with an asterisk, so that I may use the services of others at another time. However, return the catalog, so that I may understand who are not yours or chosen by you. Farewell again. March 25, 1575.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
