      <p>Greetings. The news I have, I have recorded on the following page. I am surprised that you write nothing, especially about what is happening in Germany; for we have nothing from there. Meanwhile, there is something I would like to say to your heart; you will not share it with anyone except those you trust, and where you think it necessary.</p>
      <p>My lords would like to come together in these matters and inform each other; for it is seen that it will be a universal matter, which is entirely aimed at and directed towards the execution of the council, and therefore it is necessary to act wisely and also to consider what one has to accomplish. I hear that my lords from Zurich are often approached about this, but they always think that coming together is not good, which brings great displeasure among the cantons, etc. But we must endure that they are always together.</p>
      <p>Therefore, consider that it might be written now that people should come together, as I am particularly encouraged by good-hearted people to write to you about it, so that you are involved and your lords can help to ensure that advice is given on how to deal with matters in the future. And since I consider the matter itself to be fair and necessary, I could not refrain from writing to you about it.</p>
      <p>It is thus held: Basel and Schaffhausen are not disinclined; only in Zurich can it always be raised.</p>
      <p>I also hear that my lords have recently written to Zurich and informed them of the new events that were present at the time, also requesting that they diligently report to my lords if anything new comes to them; to which a brief answer was given, that if anything new comes to them that concerns my lords, they will report it to them. Which my lords have somewhat resented; for they not only desire to be informed of what concerns them, but also what might concern the common cause in general and in particular. I write this as I hear it, and I hear it from people who are somewhat involved; they want to understand it in the best way. I mean well with the city of Zurich, and rightly so; for they have deserved it from me; and I know that you mean well with your city of Bern as well.</p>
      <p>Therefore, let us act on both sides so that unity and goodwill are maintained; for this is especially necessary at this time. I also excuse Zurich where I can; I think well that they did not want much coming together in the Glarus matter; but since it is now different, I hope they will not oppose it. You have my thoughts. I have nothing else, except that I pray for health for you and yours and all of you from the Lord. I have received nothing from Geneva in the meantime. All of ours greet you. Bern, October 20, 1567.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours, whom you know. The news, as we had it yesterday, I have briefly recorded in the letter attached here yesterday; for I hoped to have the same message. Last night, someone came from the camp of Condé, whom my lords secretly sent out to inquire about the matters. He has come as far as the camp before Paris and before Condé and the admiral themselves, to whom he could give so much information that they trusted him and sent him back with letters to the lords of Mülinen. He brings certain information, and the opinion is:</p>
      <p>Firstly, that the king has entered Paris from Meaux; the Huguenots have also moved towards Paris without attacking, and no encounter has occurred, as was said. The king's jewels, silverware, and what he had with him have fallen into their hands; but they have not touched them, instead letting the king follow. With this, they have also moved before Paris, now having almost 10,000 horsemen; with them, they are patrolling around Paris, having blocked all passages, so that the city can neither receive water nor land, and therefore there is great shortage in the city. There are also so few troops in Paris that they have taken about 300 monks from the monasteries and armed them; they must help defend the city. The lords, such as Condé, the admiral, and others, are camped at Saint-Denis, a small German mile from Paris. The lords themselves write on this opinion: 1. that they are of good hope to bring their cause to a good conclusion soon; 2. that they have sent a supplication to the king, of which they have also sent a copy here, and its summary is: a. that the king should hold and organize the cities in France according to the old imperial custom, b. that the useless people, especially the Italians, who govern almost everything, should be removed from the court, c. likewise the Guise, as they secretly aspire to the crown and are not of the blood and arrange all these practices for the downfall of the empire; d. that he should leave the religion free and completely unoppressed in the whole empire. They are now waiting for an answer to this. In the city, there are still many good-hearted prominent people, such as the lord of Montmorency, the constable's son, who are working hard for peace. Besides, they have (the messenger shows) the best cities in, also Boulogne; they have conquered Orléans, the city, but not yet the castle; they have lost up to 400. 3. They write especially and admonish my lords to recall their people who are with the Huguenots, so that they do not stand against God, the truth, and justice, as has already happened once; also, as much as possible, to prevent the new uprising among the Huguenots. This is thus the summary of their writing and what the messenger brings. My lords are inclined to send a messenger there and to recall their people, so that they may also bring them back with grace.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, since they well remember that a large number have also gone from Zurich, they would like Zurich to do the same and also send a messenger along with ours to recall their people. However, this will first be discussed in the coming days, and then one thing and another will be written and sent to your lords. I also think that Schaffhausen will be written to, regardless of the fact that they are in the union. There, help to do the best; it would bring much goodwill if one agreed on this, especially since fairness and necessity require it. It is also much debated whether to block the passage for the Huguenots, only for the sake of delay, so that it may be delayed longer and they may accomplish more in the meantime. However, I think that if people came together, this and other things would come into discussion. I wanted to add this to my previous letters. Consider everything well. Communicate with my brother what seems appropriate; for I do not have the time to write everything to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. All of ours greet you. Bern, October 21, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know. 3000 black horsemen are already in France and another 3000 are to come.</p>
      <p>In Lorraine, the duke is said to have openly allowed the gospel to be preached and proclaimed it. Movan is said to have captured the wife and child of Mogeron. This causes Mogeron not to rage in Lyon, but to let everyone go, though bare; for he cares for his own.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, to be delivered as soon as possible.</p>
