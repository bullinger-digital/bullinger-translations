      <p>At the same time, he informed me that he was about to leave, and if I wished to write anything to Geneva, I should let him know here. Therefore, I could barely write these things.</p>
      <p>I received your letters, dearest brother. I heard from our Gwalter, who made me anxious and worried. Do not leave, I beg you, from that church which has so many excellent men. Remember that from the Acts of the Apostles: Do not be afraid, for I have many people in this city. For although there are more pigs and dogs than we would like, many things must be endured for the sake of the elect. Moreover, you are not unaware of how much rejoicing all those who hate Christ in France will have: and how much danger you would expose the French exiles to if you were to leave.</p>
      <p>Therefore, stay, stay and endure whatever insults, contempt, dangers, and evils the Lord may send. The Lord will not forsake you. Through many tribulations, we must enter the kingdom of God. Indeed, the Lord has offered the most ample opportunity to the Senate of Geneva to cleanse itself and the church from the stain or filth of heresy, by delivering that Spaniard Servetus into their hands. A good part of the Christian world knows him either from the blasphemous books published about the errors of the Trinity, and those which he published purely Jewish for the justification of works. You hear that he has now surpassed himself in impiety with another published book. If, therefore, the most ample Senate were to repay this blasphemous scoundrel what is due, the whole world would see that the Genevans hate blasphemous heretics, who are truly obstinate heretics, pursue them with the sword of justice, and vindicate the glory of divine majesty. But if they do not do this, it would not be your duty to desert that church and give occasion for other evils. Fight fearlessly, trust in God through Christ, implore His counsel and help, that He may deliver you. We eagerly support you with our prayers. Live and farewell. 14th September 1553. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
