      <p>S. P. Your letter dated December 28, most illustrious doctor, venerable with paternal affection, was handed to me by the most pious Lord Peter Paul Vergerius soon after my return from Augsburg. In both Latin and French languages and with good civil manners, Johannes Jacobus Rordorff will be educated at Tübingen, at the primary college of Narbonne, with no idolatry, no masses, just as there is no public exercise in that college. The principal loves piety, as I wrote, and will not tolerate any superstition as much as he can. If the boy is completely ignorant of the Latin language, he can learn the basics at home, and once he has grasped them, the principal will arrange for him to be taken to public lectures that are closer and more suitable for the boy, whom he will also question and instruct daily, but he himself would not take on the ordinary and solid teaching duty. However, I would not dare to affirm that he might not be compelled to dissimulate and pretend to send the boys to the temples once a month due to fear of slander. In this matter, Germans and Swiss, especially from the primary cities of Zürich, Bern, and Basel, are more easily indulged and allowed to follow their customs. I have included letters to Tübingen for you; the proper name seems to be Johannes, but I do not affirm it. I have his name and letters; however, my books are not yet organized, as I do not yet have a certain residence, nor is it allowed to go through such a heap. I think you have received my letters from Augsburg, in which two small ones are included, one to Lord Wilhelm Varello in Neuchâtel, the other to Jacob Park in Basel, to take care of a chest full of books that arrived in Geneva at the beginning of July, and to ensure it is safe at the port of Yverdon at the beginning of September. There are three of my old registers in it; it is of great interest to me. Before leaving Neuchâtel, I had paid almost three crowns for this matter; I gladly and abundantly pay.</p>
      <p>But the friends in Geneva and Neuchâtel have admitted great negligence and do not understand how much damage it is to me, but according to the genius of the place and their bad manners, they despise books.</p>
      <p>Every day here, I profess with great attendance; I am about to introduce the code from the first title on the supreme trinity, etc. Therefore, because of some here of the old form, I want to have a public speech first about the trinity, the excellence and analogy of theology and jurisprudence, about the duty and distinction of the prince, magistrate, and ministers of the word of God, about the power and use of imperial laws, about faith, ecclesiastical matters and persons, and to sharply criticize the errors of canonists and papists, and since, on the day the solemn speech is held, all other lectures cease for the whole day as usual, I informed the rector and some professors that I wanted to have the speech at the beginning of the ordinary, on a day when the school would be less disturbed. I would have had it today, if the professors had not been gathered for business, and the rector himself asked me to postpone it to a suitable day and to continue in the meantime, which I promised. Today, Lord Laurentius, a man loving piety, was appointed in place of the deceased papist Caspar Voland, who was struck by apoplexy on December 6 in the chair, which had to be cut with axes to carry him home, where he died in two days. Farewell, dearest father and teacher. May the Lord Jesus keep you and bless you. I wish to be commended to Lord Father Pellican, Lord Bibliander, Lord Laffater, Lord Zwingli, your son-in-law, and others. Tübingen, January 11, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Charles du Moulin, jurist of France and Germany and ordinary of Tübingen.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious doctor of the church, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
