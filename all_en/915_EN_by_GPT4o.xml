      <p>[Greetings] P. Although I have sent you letters before, most excellent man, written on the 20th of May, I do not wish to repeat myself again, lest I be a burden to you, who is already abundantly distracted by serious public and private affairs.</p>
      <p>The cause of Christ remains in the same place by the good grace of God; meanwhile, the ancient serpent does not cease to lie in wait for the heel of Christ, although its head is often crushed by the power of the word of God and His present help. We greatly fear that Flemish-Spanish birth; it has a very well-equipped fleet, as I hear, but what it is planning, the Lord knows. Four days ago, the most illustrious man, Lord a Lasco, reported for certain that he had learned the Spanish fleet was scattered and lost due to a storm, which has detained the Almighty in Lower Germany. A firm peace is hoped for between England and France. A noble Frenchman named Lord de Satilion arrived on the 23rd of May; he publicly confirmed the peace by oath on the 25th of the same month. May God grant that it be holy and perpetual!</p>
      <p>Lord Hooper is so overwhelmed with many affairs due to the new bishopric that he does not have time to teach publicly, much less to write letters; therefore, he is worthy of all excuse if he gives none or only rare ones. In these days, the councilors proposed some articles to him, which he should subscribe to; but he excepted three. One is that the sacraments confer grace; - here he wishes to change the word 'confer' to 'seal' or 'testify'; another is that the book proposed by the bishops should be diligently observed in all ways, so that nothing is changed; the last is that he should approve the booklet on the ordination of ministers of the church. What will happen here, I do not know. He himself is about to ride to his homeland within three or four days; his most illustrious wife and little daughter, along with Joanna, are in excellent health and send you many greetings along with the whole family.</p>
      <p>I wrote before about a certain prisoner from Z端rich who was condemned but liberated by the king's beneficence, whose name is Valentin Wertm端ller. We are surprised that we receive no response about him; for we fear fraud. Meanwhile, we are gathering as much alms as we can to redeem him. But the sum is greater than we foreigners from Flanders can conveniently collect, since, beyond my expectation, we had to count about six pounds, that is, 19 crowns, and we are few in number and almost poor. If his parents are well, we pray that they send some sum of money, so that he may be quickly freed, as he says he is their relative.</p>
      <p>Lord Johannes Utenhovius, currently living with Lord Hooper, sends his regards to your kindness.</p>
      <p>While I turn this page, a good man approaches, who reports that the king today ordered six large ships to be equipped with all warlike apparatus. However, what this aims at, no one can yet know. Pray to the Lord for His church, vexed by the Spanish-Flemish antichrist. Please greet in my name my most esteemed teachers, Lord Theodor Bibliander, Lord Conrad Pellican, Lord Gesner, and the other good men.</p>
      <p>London, 28th of May, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent and worthy Antistes of the church of Z端rich.</p>
      <p>In Z端rich.</p>
