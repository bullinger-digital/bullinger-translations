    <p xml:id="regest1">Gwalther and his colleagues are not only constantly demanding money, but they also want to make themselves important with titles that are irrelevant to their future tasks - more about the desired promotions is written by [Johann Jakob] Ammann -; the mother of [Johannes] Wolf has already made enough sacrifices for her son, and it is good for them to have to limit themselves. If the letter sent to the court of the [Landgrave] has not reached them, they should inquire about it. The [councilor who came from Marburg to Konstanz] has been instructed to lend him and [Johann Jakob] Wick a maximum of five guilders, which they should repay in the spring. An increase in his scholarship is out of the question, and the example of Werdmüller and Fries should warn him against incurring debt; perhaps he and his colleagues will soon be recalled. Does not understand what he wrote about Eoban's Epicedium, and does not want him to provoke the Five Places with a poem about Zwingli; will arrange for the desired Zwingli portraits and sends greetings to Gwalther's teacher. Suggests dedicatees for his "Monomachia" and "Epistolae heroinae". Further greetings. The rumors about a battle between the people of Zürich and the Five Places are false; on the contrary, the joint campaign to support Rottweil has raised hopes for the imminent overcoming of the religious divide in the Confederation, and they too should pray to God for this.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>All your letters demand nothing but money. But you were not dismissed by us on this condition. It was agreed what we would give, and once that was paid, you should not ask for anything more. Now, however, there is no end to the demands. Furthermore, you invent new ways every day to make yourselves more burdensome. For what purpose is it to receive the degree of master at great expense? When you return home and the duties of the church are to be fulfilled, no one will ask whether you are masters or servants, but how learned and good you are. The school of Marburg will not deny you testimonial letters about your study and virtue. Indeed, you yourself will be the most reliable witness for yourself if you perform the work that is required or expected from a learned and good person. But more about receiving titles will be written by the schoolmaster Amianus.</p>
      <p>If you want to be so shameless and do everything according to your own pleasure that comes into your heads, then we know that our lords have not made you and your guardians into masters. The mother of my Wolff, a widow and indeed a poor widow, also complains about the excessive expenses of her son. She counted six gold coins to Froschauer when he returned from the fair in September, which she would have preferred to spend on other more necessary uses. He knows the poverty of his mother and continues to demand from the poor woman. Sometimes suffering poverty and enduring hardship also has its praise and fruit.</p>
      <p>Letters have been written to you, especially to your three companions about the confident departure from Tübingen, as well as about some other matters, and they have been sent to the court of the prince in Frankfurt to the steward. If you have not yet received them, I beg you to inquire and ensure through acquaintances that they are delivered.</p>
      <p>I ordered that the senator, whose name you imprudently kept silent, should count 4 or 5 gold coins at most for you and the same for Wickius; his father had ordered him so. You will ensure that they are returned at the spring fair, where your stipend will be sent through Froschauer.</p>
      <p>However, I cannot promise you, Gwalther, a higher stipend than the recently defined 34 guilders. It is also to be given to many other students and the poor.</p>
      <p>See that you do not burden yourself with foreign debt; let Werdmüller and Phrysius be an example, both of whom today deeply lament being so deeply immersed, wishing they had been more frugal at some time. In the meantime, however, I will diligently recommend you to Froschauer.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you will be recalled shortly.</p>
      <p>I do not understand what you write about the epicedium of Eoban, the most distinguished man. If you think the epicedium was written in memory of Zwingli, I do not want you to publish it, for you would ruin yourself, nor would I want the best and most learned man, Mr. Eoban, to write anything more bitterly against the Five Places. You know how difficult these people are to stomach. They would hardly digest anything said more freely against them, indeed they would accuse him of treason against the majesty before the prince, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, be careful that nothing is written either by a Swiss or to a Swiss about this matter. I will arrange for the preparation of Zwingli's portraits. Greet most diligently the distinguished men Eoban, Lonicer, Gaspar Rudolph, Noviomagus, and the remaining friends and brothers.</p>
      <p>I would inscribe the "Monomachia" to Mr. Felix Fry, the provost of the college, Leo Jud, Gaspar Megander, Erasmus Fabricius, Heinrich Bullinger, pastors and preachers, the "Epistolae heroinae" to Pellican, Bibliander, Amianus, Collinus, Binder - the Hebrew, Greek, Latin reader, the schoolmaster. If you wish, prepare another poem for Johann Rhellicanus, the pedagogue of the abbey college, Johann Phrysius, the schoolmaster, Otto Werdmüller, the professor of philosophy, Sebastian Fabricius, and Diethelm Cellarius, the assistant teachers, etc., so you have honored all and angered none.</p>
      <p>Greet all your companions, especially Wolff, my most beloved son, to whom I wish well from the heart as to the others.</p>
      <p>It is a lie that the rumor spread about a conflict between our people and the Five Places. All Confederates are united and have wanted to lay 1000 men in Rottweil as support; they have already been stationed in Schaffhausen, and on November 24th, they marched from Zurich with and among others from the city of Zurich, Uri, Schwyz, and Zug; they prayed to be forgiven for marching through the lower village from the fish market, they wanted to do us all good. Furthermore, 15000 men have been taken to the borders, and it was intended to make a common campaign from all places and allies of the entire Confederation; so it is directed by God's grace. The Confederates want to hold together in the future, and whatever comes to them, they do not want to take faith as a cause of separation. Now they are negotiating that the Five Places, Freiburg, Solothurn, and Valais, which were attacked because of faith, should join us and it should be a matter for all of us. Many people want to believe that they will not throw away our faith far. Otherwise, they are more friendly than ever. God knows what will happen; we sincerely ask him to grant us unity in true faith. Many people think if it does not happen now, it will not happen soon. God knows; we sincerely ask him. Oh, how well it would be if we could become one in the faith of Jesus Christ, our dear Lord; how we would do so many good services to poor, oppressed, righteous people and so faithfully help those who are tormented by the Antichrist. Therefore, sincerely ask God, dear sons.</p>
