      <p>Your letters, full of charity and most welcome, though delivered late, and your golden gift, that book worthy of you and very necessary, and if there is any boldness in the adversaries, it blunts their impudence and calls them back to a better mind, have so refreshed me and filled me with holy joy that the deep-seated pain from the work of Ochino, whom I love for Christ and the gospel, has been alleviated. But another event has greatly troubled me, namely the passing of the holy old man, who, migrating to the Lord, completed such a distinguished course, so devoted to peace and edification, that he seemed to have been born and made for this one purpose.</p>
      <p>Would that all who are endowed with great gifts were of the same mind and spirit as this pious man was and always continued to be. I have always had him as a friend from our first meeting, and I do not doubt, until his last breath. His death has reopened the passage of Oecolampadius, Bucer, Capito, not to mention Zwingli: but why should I recall Grynaeus and others whom I had as friends, who have reached the goal, leaving us in a difficult course. As much as piety pleases me, I am uniquely delighted by minds eager for peace and who strive for concord. I bear other things as I can, but my spirit recoils as if rejecting something hostile and inimical, when I see a dissension, which was almost asleep, imprudently stirred up in Denmark. For we must see with whom we are dealing, and in what manner we should act so that we may all edify. To provoke the irritable, to laugh at those who can barely bear healthy speech and love, and to incite those who are already running, what else is it but to stir up trouble? This movement has brought us an attack on the pious consensus, which, having been published amicably, provoked no one to war, and thus proceeded peacefully.</p>
      <p>But the fury seizing Westphal, whom may the Lord restrain and correct, and as he disturbs the churches, so may he be disturbed in body here so that he may return to himself. A response has been made to the troublemaker, and no one has come forth from the response into the arena, except him who began to cause trouble, since the response was well-armed so that it would not be rashly attacked by anyone, unless by a completely insane person, as they say Westphal is, if he does not sufficiently testify to this in his writings. But there is reason for him to be ashamed of having descended into the arena, since he was received as was fitting, and everyone sees that he is so thoroughly pierced that nothing remains, although he seems to move himself. Here Ochino, whom I love as much as I truly hate the manner in which he proceeds in his book, is entirely exposed to the enemy: he allows the weapons with which he should defend himself to fall and has handed them over to the enemy, and opens the way for the defeated and fallen to rise and triumph over such an antagonist, he plays in a serious matter and betrays the cause to the adversary. Would that you had remained silent about that book, and that its publication had never appeared, especially there. Your book, which purely defends the cause, has captivated me: it does not seek to defeat the enemy to destroy him, but most amicably wishes him to be safe and sound, and strives to have him as a friend, and when the more importunate enemy falsely accuses the right-thinking of heresy, and that rashly, and proves nothing, how aptly you, without envy, with utmost modesty and gentleness, indicate into how many heresies the gross, profane, and most alien opinion of the adversary leads, how contrary it is to the faith, you deal with solid scriptures, and indicate that the church from the beginning thought otherwise, and the orthodox writers, and the more intemperately the adversary is carried, the more sober you are in the true marks which you can brand him with for those fabricated by him. And to speak frankly what I feel, I think this is the only way to deal with those who are domestic adversaries, with whom hands are to be joined far differently than with those who are outside, with whom I would not want any pious person to deal, as Ochino's book has it. But I do not want my so humble judgment to be valued so highly as to be preferred to all others, but in my manner, as I used to do with Bucer, so I do with you, hoping that whatever I write to you will not be to my detriment, so that some disturbance may be stirred up. For we have more than enough. For I am not of those who, by giving clandestine letters, arm and strengthen the wicked in their insane opinions against the pious.</p>
      <p>I gladly read what you bring about not seeking a colloquy, nor is there any reason for our side to refuse, since it is clear enough that where all who evangelize would seek it, those in charge would hardly allow it, since, as far as I conjecture, in matters of Christ and the church, they fear more to confer with others than to transfer the supreme power they have over others, and would rather confer with others in matters of power than in those that pertain to the kingdom of Christ. They so hold, know, and love the communion of saints, and so recognize themselves under one head, Christ, with others, and members of the same body, that they do not have as much in common with them as they have with unbelievers over earthly matters. But where all would agree, I do not know whether the other side would descend, which wants us to be oppressed by human authority alone, and to follow the darkness of human opinion and not the clear light of divine truth, which he who does evil flees. Yet whatever you bring, although I hold you in high regard in the Lord and do not condemn your holy counsels, yet I persist that it is far better to act in person with words than from afar with writings, and as I prefer preaching to reading, and believe that the hearer profits more than the reader, so I value an amicable treatment made by the pious in person more than what is done by writings. For is it not pursued with a different force when you deal with him whom you strive to call back in person with words, which only those present with whom you deal hear, than with writings, which not only he but anyone will read, where you have regard not only for him to whom you write but also for others? If it were only dealt with by private letters, there would seem to be more reason there: but who does not see that the matter is rather done by the author himself and the principal than by a deputy? Letters are nothing else than deputies to the absent voice that speaks to those present, and as experience teaches, so the matter itself speaks: although it is possible to find those who are infants and almost mute in language, who express themselves excellently in writing and whatever they wish. But that is rare, rarer still. Where with the crafty and those who seek nothing but to ensnare men with words, and the matter is full of danger, there it is safer to deal with writings, all things considered, but in such clear light, where matters of piety are concerned, who doubts that God will teach us, who has promised to give us a mouth and wisdom, which all adversaries will not be able to contradict? Surely he will be present and will conquer if he grants this.</p>
      <p>Would that we were so close to a colloquy, and all things were as expedited, as we are far and all things are impeded so that it may not be held.</p>
      <p>But all things are in the hand of the Lord, whom I pray to grant it, not to oppose you, but so that we may achieve what I desire with you more ardently, peace and true concord of the churches.</p>
      <p>In which would that all had labored as you have in your holy book, for which I give you immense thanks, always to have the greatest, though I cannot repay: and in the name of the church, I congratulate you, and I beg you to continue in this way and wish that you do not so indulge in the love and commendation of those who are with you, that what the Lord does through you is diminished. For unless I am completely mistaken, as I would sincerely wish, this commendation of your book will detract from the grace of your book and will harm the fruit we hope to be great. May Christ make it as great as possible. Forgive me if I address you more freely: for as I honor you in the Lord, I most earnestly wish that you may serve the edification of the churches without any offense.</p>
      <p>You rightly complain about Germany. The princes fear the Emperor and attribute more to the vanishing smoke than to the omnipotent and eternal deity. But what about the pastors so weak and with no courage, spirit, and virtue, who only observe the winds, as many are? What about the people not only drunk with wine, as the greatest part is perpetually, but with other and many vices? We see that what still stands and what remains in the word stands and remains only by the grace and favor of the Lord: which if it is preserved, it will be by the same favor, nor do I doubt that the Lord will save many.</p>
      <p>The Antichrist and his followers conceive great and joyful hopes from the English ruin, and promise themselves even greater things from others. But in vain.</p>
      <p>For the Lord will not endure such arrogance and insults of theirs to reach and grow to the point where the thrice miserable strive.</p>
      <p>May God, zealous for his glory, strike down that cruel Athaliah: may Christ restore what she so wickedly overturned and demolished. France burns and grows in the word beyond hope. Unless the Lord changes the king's heart, and those in charge proceed in a different manner than hitherto, there will be such a persecution as has never been heard of. The pious proceed in order and more purely in the word than ever, and more carefully avoid and flee all abominations, so that whatever can move Satan and those who adhere to the Antichrist is done. Only it is lacking that it is not done as openly as we wish and it should be. Let us pray with the most ardent prayers to the Lord to protect his own graciously and powerfully, but especially those who most openly profess Christ, both by preaching and by hearing, as there are some of whom I think you have heard: among whom are two of those whom the unworthy wretch drove out, who is not even worthy to look at them. May the Lord open his eyes. Those two servants of Christ, I say, who have churches so numerous that besides Calvin, no one surpasses them, indeed approaches. How much we must commend them to the Lord, and others who labor with them and the people. For everything that is done there is full of admirable wonder. Let us give thanks to the Lord for such a remarkable and unheard-of grace, which may Christ confirm, increase, and perfect.</p>
      <p>But where am I going, my dearest Bullinger? Too forgetful of myself, I abuse your kindness. I beg you to take it well. I was very late, because no one came to respond to your letters, and now I trouble you beyond measure. But hand these over to someone of yours, who has enough leisure to read them. And since I have had you and Pellican as friends, love me as much as you loved me and add the affection of the deceased to me, and I will strive to respond to your charity towards me.</p>
      <p>Farewell most excellently. May the Lord keep you and enrich your ministry with heavenly blessing, and be with you and your colleagues, whom I wish to be no less holyly united to you than that pious old man was.</p>
      <p>Your colleague greets you. Our prefect has heartily received the greeting in your name, and wishes you all good things. I have heard about the truly pious consul Habius, how he labors, not only that Christ may truly reign there, but everywhere. May the Lord grant many like him, whom I wish to be safe.</p>
      <p>Neuchâtel, May 27, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Farel.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and truly distinguished servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, most devoted to the peace and edification of the churches, brother and fellow minister to be revered.</p>
