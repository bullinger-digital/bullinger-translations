      <p> Greetings. If ever there was a time, it is now, to most fervently and ardently implore divine help, so that He may put His hand to the abundant harvest, send out as many workers as possible, and protect those He has already sent from those who prevent the pious servants of Christ from speaking, unless they are at home, whom they strive to expel and do expel. We have truly heard of a miraculous event that happened to a pious brother, who endured many labors and imminent dangers under those who arrogate everything to themselves under him, who alone seems to them to be wise; not only was he most unjustly deprived of his ministry, but he was also ordered to change his place. He, I say, under those who, good God, have done everything against the gospel, openly proclaimed Christ; when ordered to be silent, he responded as Peter did, and if there is no less constancy in the man than in the people, who could not be driven away by any orders, threats, or commands, so that not even one would bend the knee to Baal. If anyone was ever in present danger, it was he and the holy people, and although the most merciful Father has declared himself most favorable, yet according to what seems, he has not yet placed them out of danger, so that the Lord may be invoked more ardently and they may learn to depend solely on the Father, as true sons should; for all that happens is full of miracles and beyond human expectation. He has some who are held in no less danger, all of whom I wish to commend to you and your prayers; you will feel that you have not prayed in vain. There is a great desire among countless people who seek the word and abhor the pope and all that is his; but open confession does not appear in all through those things which the churches openly profess Christ, where there is freedom. Here the Lord must be besought with great prayers, so that preserving the open confessors of the gospel, He may also preserve those who utterly avoid the abominations of the papacy and grant that what is done among a few may become a full confession before all, and touch the hearts of those who long ago bade farewell to the pope and accepted the gospel, so that they may learn from the last and hear the word more attentively, more frequently, and with greater fruit than hitherto, and live a more Christian life; for, as I hear, the last far surpass the first, and especially let us pray for the peace and concord of all churches, which I commend to you from the heart, as I know how commendable it is, and I wish you to try everything according to the Lord, which can make for peace; in whatever way it seems best, Christ will give peace. I cannot but love you greatly in the Lord for your so pious and holy work, which can most of all tame even the fiercest enemies. Such clear and pure water can and should extinguish such a black fire smoking so impudently, not with thicker and less pleasant oil. Would that we could prevent anyone from adding more than enough to the kindled fire. </p>
      <p> I am astonished when I see that Satan can do so much as to prevent a true union from being made between cities, which ought to be united above all measure. May the Lord destroy the wicked Satan. How mortals forget themselves, so that they cannot see and beware of those things which are to their ruin, but seem rather to desire them. May Christ avert what happened calamitously to Konstanz, and may He ensure that no one denies Geneva what they say was denied to Konstanz by those from whom the city implored help as a suppliant. Here too there is need for prayers, and I beg you not to cease to urge those who can do something there with the Bernese to strive to bring about a true alliance, which would be as honorable to the city as it would be useful and much edifying. Matters are conducted everywhere with such cunning that good and prudent men are often deceived, and if there are any who are wise and see better things, they are few, and the greater number overcomes the lesser. Oh, if only they were as zealous for the glory of God as they are most greedy for their own, what would not be done? But it is usual for him who was beloved, when he has grown fat and sleek, to kick against the gifts of God and rise up against the Lord, so that from the gold and silver of the Lord they fashion idols for themselves. It is truly astonishing that Satan has so occupied the hearts of many that they obstinately defend the worst in the gospel, whom they would not have feared in the tyranny of the pope, and do not hesitate to slander the pious with fabricated accusations. The pious should indeed rejoice that they bear these things for the name of God, and it is to be lamented that the wretched bring upon themselves such a dreadful judgment. Samuel had one Saul to mourn; how many, I fear, do we have today to lament? </p>
      <p> May Christ grant better things and ensure that His kingdom is not taken away from us and given to those who will bear fruit, as the vineyard is so bitter, which produces nothing but gall. England should shake us with horror. </p>
      <p> Since blindness prevents seeing the desolation of Konstanz, open our eyes, Lord, I pray, so that what seem to appear as signs of Your grace may be perfected in seeking Your righteousness in so many and everywhere. If indeed the things reported are true, not only from Germany but also from elsewhere, may the Lord grant that we may see more and greater things. Farewell, my excellent Bullinger; may the Lord Jesus keep you long for His church, in which may He make you progress more and more and bring forth further fruit, and with you those who sincerely strive for the glory of Christ, and remove all obstacles! I wish your colleagues well. Mine wishes you all happiness. Our prefect, to whom I conveyed your greetings in your name, received them most lovingly, and now he has been ill for a few days; I wish him commended to your prayers, as we commend the pious who preside there, not passing over Habio, to the Lord. </p>
      <p> Neuchâtel, June 23, 1556. </p>
      <p> Yours, Farel. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, most zealous for true peace and edification, much to be respected brother and fellow minister. In Zürich. </p>
