    <p xml:id="regest1">An imperial messenger wanted to deliver a letter with money to the imperial captain Jörg Knöringer, who lived in Thurgau not far from Konstanz and was absent at the time, but was apprehended, taken to Frauenfeld, and released after the letter and money were taken. Now there is fear that Emperor [Charles V] might use this as a pretext for a war against the Confederates; perhaps it was even staged for this purpose; therefore, the bailiff [Melchior Heinrich] should be persuaded to return the money and clarify the matter. It would be legitimate to expel Knöringer due to his belligerent disposition. Clarification of the messenger issue. Awaiting news from Bullinger. [Enclosure:] Fears that Knöringer, who hurried from Speyer, might report the matter there and thus let the disaster take its course; also, the possibly planned attack on a vineyard in Tägerwilen, which belongs to another imperial, Sigmund von Landenberg, could cause unrest. The imperial cities do nothing against the Confederates; it should be checked whether the imperial cities are listed among the senders in the writing of the imperial estates. Furthermore, it is reported that troops are being mustered in Zabern for a campaign against France; the Duke [Antoine II] of Lorraine allows the passage. The estates at the Imperial Diet [in Speyer] cannot agree on whether they themselves or the citizens should bear the cost for the aid against France.</p>

      <p>Dearly beloved lord and trusted brother.</p>
      <p>Currently, a nobleman, an illegitimate Knöringer named Jörg Knöringer, is residing in Thurgau, not far from our city on the Blaicke; he has always been a French captain and became wealthy with the French. However, now he is imperial and recently rode back to the emperor for the war. Yesterday, an imperial messenger came to his house; the lady was not at home. The messenger had a letter with money for him, and someone from Altnau in Thurgau approached, asked the messenger what he was doing there; he told him the reason for his presence. The farmer from Altnau took this to heart, went to Kreuzlingen, told several people there, among them a bailiff's servant. When the messenger, after waiting at the house for a while and no one came, went back towards the city and reached Kreuzlingen, he was apprehended and taken to Frauenfeld, where the letter and money were taken from him, and he was released, etc. Now there is much talk and speculation, some fearing this might be the beginning of a whole Swiss war and the emperor might interpret it as the Confederates making the first move and provoking him to war; indeed, they think, if the money is not particularly much (as we cannot yet know), it might well be a planned affair, that perhaps a pretext was intended to be given. And since I have heard and learned that this matter is also being considered by sensible people, I wanted to inform you of it without delay, for it might be good to negotiate quickly with the bailiff so that he returns the letter and money to Knöringer's wife, while explaining that since the messenger appeared somewhat suspicious, I wanted to question him officially in these developments, etc., as is indeed true, etc. This way, one could get out of the matter gracefully; for if the emperor or other people were to write to the Confederates about it and only then arrange for the return of the money and letter, it would be somewhat disgraceful and cause all sorts of talk, so that the other way would be much more skillful and cautious. Some sensible people also fear that this action might well give cause for the marauding horsemen in Hegau to move back and forth against yours, then visiting the markets, also undertaking and dealing with such things, and thus soon from a small beginning great unrest would arise.</p>
      <p>Besides, one would have good reason and right to let Knöringer know: Since he is so inclined to war, he should then move away and have his household affairs elsewhere, and the lady should be instructed to leave.</p>
      <p>Please take this letter of mine in good part. You have instructed me to be vigilant and spare no effort in the messenger's reward. Since I have also considered this matter important, I wanted to inform you of it without delay, for I am sincerely inclined to warn and avert your harm. But if you revoke the instruction or clarify it in another way, so that I know how and in what matters I should always send you my own messenger, I will certainly comply.</p>
      <p>Given in great haste, Konstanz, May 5, at three o'clock in the afternoon, 1544.</p>
      <p>B. A.</p>
      <p>I expect a reply from you regarding the other messenger by tomorrow.</p>
      <p>This Knöringer was recently posted up here from Speyer and rode a horse to death, and it is to be feared that when this news reaches him, he will immediately post back to Speyer, deliver letters or perhaps orders, that he might even attack the Confederates; with that, all misfortune would then begin. Besides, it is said that Sigmund von Landenberg, who has now also moved away from here to the emperor against my lords' decree and prohibition, is to have a vineyard in Tägerwilen in Thurgau seized, and since this Sigmund is not related to the Confederates, and this vineyard is not his, but his wife's, it is to be feared that unrest might also arise from this. It would be good to act with caution and vigilance in such matters.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, a prominent man has now written to me that the imperial cities will do nothing against the Confederates, nor do they want to co-sign. From these words, you can infer for yourself what to think of the other half. It would also be worth noting whether the cities are expressly mentioned in the writing to the Confederates, in the subscription, or not, etc.</p>
      <p>He further writes that troops are being mustered in Zabern and from there the campaign to France will be taken; the Duke of Lorraine will provide the passage. May God arrange everything for the best, etc.</p>
      <p>The matter at the Imperial Diet is now at the point where the estates cannot agree on whether the approved aid against France should be paid from their own purse or imposed on the common man.</p>
      <p>Brandenburg, Mainz, and Trier want to impose it on the common man, the other three electors from their own purse, but the majority of the cities also on the common man; the other princes are still deliberating.</p>
      <p>Our dear Lord is not thought of at the Diet; but he will surely show them with deeds one day, that they will realize he was there without their invitation.</p>
      <p>To the man of outstanding piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and most beloved brother.</p>
