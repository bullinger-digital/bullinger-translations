    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] There was nothing to respond to in Erb's three letters [not received and No. 2623]. Nevertheless, Bullinger writes today to confirm their receipt.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The bearer [...] of the first letters dined with [Rudolf] Gwalther and then traveled to Baden. Bullinger did not meet him, otherwise he would have taken care of him. The young bearer [Johannes Jud] of the last letter [No. 2623] receives a scholarship from the Zurich church and shows good performance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] From Zurich, still a safe place, there is hardly anything to report. But the war in Germany is troubling Bullinger greatly. The purpose of the day [of the Four Protestant Places] now held in Zurich was to respond to the [Schmalkaldic League] and the Emperor [Charles V]. Since the meeting is not yet over, Bullinger cannot report anything more specific. However, they stand on the side of the Evangelicals. Whether the [Four Places] will enter the war, now that it has become winter, remains open. May the Lord grant everyone good decisions!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The [foreign troops] have caused much damage through arson in the [Nördlinger] Ries. Now this also affects the area around Ulm, after the Imperial forces have taken Donauwörth, Höchstädt, Dillingen, Lauingen, Gundelfingen, and other places. The [Schmalkaldic] forces are all with the main army. The Emperor's troops are plundering the land, and the people of Ulm, fearing a siege, have burned down their own [properties] outside the city worth 100,000 guilders.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] May the Lord deliver us from evil!</p>

      <p>S. D. I received three letters from you, Matthias, venerable and much beloved brother, to which I have not yet responded. And although there is nothing in them that requires a response, I am writing this to let you know that I have received them.</p>

      <p>The bearer of the previous letters dined with Rudolf Gwalther and then traveled to Baden. I did not see the man. Otherwise, I would not have denied him anything due to your recommendation, as far as my rather limited resources could have allowed. The boy who brought your last letter is otherwise highly recommended to me. He is supported by a scholarship from our church and shows signs of quite promising talent.</p>

      <p>There is nothing to report about our affairs. We are living and conducting ourselves as safely as before. The German war is now tormenting me. These days, a meeting was held here about giving responses to the Empire and the Emperor regarding their demands. And because, while I am writing this, nothing has yet been concluded, I cannot report anything certain. Our people favor those who profess the gospel, but whether they will take up arms now, while the winter's onslaught is threatening and drives all troops from the field under cover, I do not know. May the Lord grant us all right judgments. As far as I understand from our people, they will never abandon the cause of truth.</p>

      <p>In the Nördlinger Ries, foreign troops have caused unheard-of damage through arson. The poor people have been miserably burned. Thus, the land around Ulm is now being miserably burned and devastated by the Imperial forces, who have taken Donauwörth, Höchstädt, Dillingen, Lauingen, Gundelfingen, and other places. Our forces are lying undivided with the main army for skirmishes. The Emperor's roaming troops are plundering around and causing unspeakable damage to the poor land. The people of Ulm, fearing a siege, have themselves burned down properties worth 100,000 guilders outside their city, etc.</p>

      <p>May the Lord deliver us from evil. Let us pray to Him! Farewell. Zurich, 25th October 1546. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Matthias Erb, venerable preacher of the Rychenwyler church and beloved brother. Rychenwyler.</p>
