    <p xml:id="regest1">Ambrosius Blarer's confession of the Lord's Supper initially shocked Myconius, but further news from Stuttgart regarding Blarer reassured him; Blarer himself also denies the rumors of his change of sides. Myconius describes how the WÃ¼rttemberg Concord was established: Erhard Schnepf was committed by Blarer to a formula of agreement worked out in Marburg in 1529 by Luther, Oecolampadius, and Zwingli. Someone who recently spoke with Blarer and Schnepf in Stuttgart reported to Myconius about the vague formulation that allows for multiple interpretations. Myconius emphasizes the pointlessness of such a "sham concord," even if it refers to Oecolampadius and Zwingli; especially Zwingli always advocated for clear formulations! Bullinger should remain steadfast. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. After returning from the baths at Baden, I received Blaurer's confession regarding the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. When I read it with horror, not long after, letters from Stuttgart were delivered to me, which reassured me concerning Blaurer. They briefly state: When Blaurer and Schnepf confirmed the confession with each other in writing, and the prince from both, Blaurer added: "Christ is not eaten carnally." Schnepf said: "I do not speak about that at all." Therefore, one immediately calls the prince as a witness to these things, who also agreed to remember it. This certainly excuses Blaurer in my eyes. But it also excuses the rumor of Blaurer's recantation, which had already reached everyone, including us, so strongly that he was forced to suppress it from the pulpit. Since he did this, there is nothing for me to complain about. Blaurer requested the confession first, as it was made long before at Marburg by Luther, Oecolampadius, and Zwingli, and Schnepf acknowledged this. I say this because:</p>
      <p>The one who wrote to me behaved in such a way that he was called a Zwinglian by Schnepf in front of Blaurer. He immediately said to this person of mine, to act more cautiously. Then my person said: "How? If I am Zwinglian, then I am Lutheran; if I am Blaurerian, then I am Schnepfian, unless your confession is nothing." These things, my dear Bullinger, I did not want you to be unaware of, so that you may consider the illusions with which people are dealing. For the confession is such that nevertheless, each party maintains its own opinion. This is easily evident from what has been done. If therefore Oecolampadius and Zwingli made this same confession, which I wrote to you about last year, what else do you think was in mind, except that they departed with a simulated concord? In the meantime, Luther retained his opinion and our people theirs. But they say: Something must be conceded to the obstinate, lest Christ be entirely lost. If this is how truth is to be handled, I do not see how it differs in the method of handing over from the worst lies. I could therefore say, as Zwingli of holy memory once did here about the same matter: "White or black or nothing at all."</p>
      <p>It remains for you to diligently care for the republic of Christ with the grace given to you and not allow yourself to be led astray by flatterers. For I seem to see what they are attempting among you. May God grant constancy and the strength to teach for the sanctification of God's name always.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and Utinger and Pellican and Leo. I will write to him soon. For now, there is not much leisure.</p>
      <p>Basel, 17th of September, year 34.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, first herald of the word of the Lord among the people of Zurich, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
