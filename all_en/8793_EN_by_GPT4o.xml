      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, my willing service is always at your disposal, etc. Furthermore, dear sir, recently I sent you, along with Bartholomeo Knüpffel, a package from Mr. Schlüsselberger, which I hope you have received.</p>
      <p>Herewith a letter from Augsburg; it reached me late before this date. By this very messenger, Mr. Kessler writes to you regarding the poor Christians who are being forcibly coerced; I have been urged to implore you, along with the other gentlemen, your collaborators, for the sake of God's honor, to assist to the utmost, as I have no doubt; the more one yields to the tyrants, the more they undertake new innovations. The governor is willing to do his best; only that you gentlemen assist him; he will be coming to Zurich these days, and has offered his good services, etc. I have little news, except from Lyon on the 13th, that Cardinal Alexandrin has arrived at the court, coming from Portugal, and has presented the king with three articles: firstly, he should submit to the council and help execute the same, secondly, that His Majesty should join the Holy League or alliance, thirdly, that His Majesty should marry his sister to the King of Portugal. These three articles have been cleanly rejected. The Queen of Navarre is at Tours, until the cardinal is removed, which will not take long. That is all I have at this time; if anything further occurs, it shall not be withheld from you, my honorable, beloved sir. Our honorable, beloved preachers send you their service and greetings. I hereby commend you and yours to the protection of the Almighty, along with your honorable, beloved Mr. Walther, to whom I especially send my service and greetings, etc. Your willing servant, Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful servant of the church in Zurich, my honorable, beloved sir in Zurich.</p>
