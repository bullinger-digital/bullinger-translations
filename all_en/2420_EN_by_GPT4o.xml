      <p>S. I received your letters with those of Werger and acknowledge your favorable disposition towards all your states, which indeed ought to be greatly aided by good men; for if the actions of all your people aim at the benefit and public peace, as yours do, the future of the country and religion will be better provided for, even if some are so violent that they wish to lead everything rashly without judgment by force and violence. Almost worn out by labors, I asked the king to finally grant me leave or at least allow me rest for a few months, which I barely obtained to the great benefit of my health, but with sorrow, as I see I must leave behind many dear and intimate friends; but one thing among others consoles me, that his majesty sends to my lords and friends a successor who is my kinsman and intimate friend, who is one of those two envoys of ours who greeted you at home when it was about the liberation of Lord... Gadde, he is younger, learned in Greek and Latin almost above all our people and raised for a long time in Italy and later in Germany. He has just dismounted from his horse and greets you very much, hoping to communicate with you in the future about matters that will be for the salvation of the Christian republic. Therefore, my dear Bullinger, I commend him to you; he is indeed pious, learned, and of great hope for the future, which I wish the honorable councilor Hab to have and understand and to be greeted very much in my words, to whom I commend the public peace and our common friendship. He is a good and prudent man in affairs; therefore, I rightly love him and offer myself and mine for the future. However, as for you, one thing grieves me, that before my departure it was not permitted to converse more and more familiarly; meanwhile, however, until the opportunity presents itself, you will know that I will always be yours and have received that opinion of you which all good men have made. Farewell, therefore, most excellent man, and love us in return. Given at Solothurn, October 8th, hastily.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassefontaine. I ask you to greet your secretary in my name and bid farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>The last letter of Bassefontaine, October 8, 1554.</p>
