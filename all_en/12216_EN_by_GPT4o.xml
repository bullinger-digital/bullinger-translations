    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger recommends the bearer Johann Rudolf Stumpf. His father Johannes Stumpf, who authored [“The Description of the Great General Council Held in Constance”], wants his son to study in Constance because he has heard good things about the school there. Since he knows no one in Constance, he has asked Bullinger to recommend his son. Due to lack of time, this letter is addressed to both Blarer and the teacher [Matthias Schenk], asking the latter to find a suitable host for the good boy who still needs supervision. [The people of Zurich] will gladly reciprocate the favor to [the people of Constance] in the same way. If Blarer does not know who [Johannes] Stumpf is, he should remember that he was their host when they met [on May 11, 1544] in Stammheim. Johann Rudolf's maternal grandfather is Heinrich Brennwald, the provost of Embrach. - Greetings, especially to [Schenk].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Johann Rudolf Stumpf, a young man of great promise and the bearer of this letter, is coming to you. He is the son of Johannes Stumpf, who described and published the Council of Constance, and he comes for the sake of learning literature and good morals.</p>
      <p>His father, being a pious man and a great lover of honesty, has understood that the best education and most sacred discipline of young men flourish among you. Therefore, he wished to entrust his son to your education and discipline, desiring him to be most piously instructed. However, since he knows no one in Constance to whom he can commend him, he asked me to write to friends. I willingly undertook this task, especially since I am confident that I can rely on both you and the head of the school. However, I did not have the time to write to each of you separately; therefore, I wanted to commend the young man to both of you with one letter, and I first implore you, through our friendship, not to fail the young man, but to assist him so that he may find a suitable and honorable lodging. But since I know you will make use of the head of the school (for I did not want to burden you, being occupied with much greater matters), I also implore him not to deny us any diligence, kindness, and faithfulness in this matter. The young man is good and manageable, but still, due to his youthful nature, he needs a strong guide and proper discipline. If it is ever possible to return the favor to your people, we will show ourselves diligent. And if you do not know who this Stumpf is, know that he is our host, whose kindness we enjoyed when we met in Stammheim. The maternal grandfather of the young man is Heinrich Brennwald, the provost of Embrach, who has earned a great reputation for piety.</p>
      <p>Farewell and always keep me in your thoughts. Greet the brothers and friends, especially the master of the school.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 2, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Ambrosius Blarer, incomparable brother and friend, always to be honored.</p>
