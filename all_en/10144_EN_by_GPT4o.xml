      <p>Greetings in Christ.</p>
      <p>Do not take offense, my Heinrich, at my persistence. Listen to what has happened. Indeed, because you have dealt with me in my affairs so fraternally, indeed pleasantly, not to mention so Christianly, I cannot help but approach you with even more serious matters without fear. But this is not done without reason. For who would not be made magnanimous by what I first received from the Lord, and then from you? We are now speaking about matrimonial matters. I am therefore seeking a prudent, honest, and sufficiently domestic wife with your help. May God grant that you may write the same to me forever. These matters urge me to trouble you further. But to return to the matter at hand, listen briefly to the words with which I wish you to be concerned, namely, that you may wish to have our mutual friend Ludwig Zehender recommended to a widow who is indeed unknown to me both in name and family, but well known to him, and indeed to act as a patron according to necessity. For he is a young man, not very resistant in word until now, also of good morals and, not to be silent - in this above all, we look to fidelity -, not very lacking in means. He will communicate all these things with you. I therefore ask, as much as is in you, that you may wish to assist him in this matter. Then I know you will be invited and related to his brother's wedding. I ask, urge, indeed implore, that you come, but on the condition that you stay in no house other than mine, in which you will do me a most pleasing favor. Otherwise, I do not know what reproaches, indeed a tragedy, my wife Barbara will raise against you. However, I want to warn you that when you come, our church may hear the word of the Lord proclaimed from your mouth at the wedding. For I hope that by you doing this, our church will receive much benefit.</p>
      <p>Farewell. My wife and I greet you, your wife with children and family, and all who have asked you about me.</p>
      <p>Given on the Sunday before Mary Magdalene in the year 32.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zehnder, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the no less upright than learned man M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher among the Zurichers, most esteemed friend and brother.</p>
