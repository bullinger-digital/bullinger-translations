      <p>Greetings. I am in Jenins with the lord consul and brother Philipp, and therefore, reverend father in Christ, I ask you to forgive me if I am brief in writing; for I wrote at home when your letters had not yet been delivered to me, and now I cannot send them, as I unexpectedly have to stay here today. At least I wanted to inform you that all your letters have been faithfully delivered to me.</p>
      <p>I will transcribe what was written about the council at the first opportunity and send it back with the courier Kn√∂ulli. Meanwhile, it is being reported from Italy that the rumor about the pope's illness and his proximity to death is still persistent.</p>
      <p>The consul told me that the Bishop of Ems hurriedly traveled to Rome from the council to visit his uncle. This is all I have, nothing more.</p>
      <p>Please, inform us about the affairs in France, and whether Philipp, the younger Landgrave, has penetrated there, the state of the church, what the Guise family is planning, and what position they hold with the king. Forgive me for daring to ask so much and so many things from you at once, which I would never do unless I hoped to obtain it through your kindness.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>The lord consul, Gregor Carlin, and lord Philipp have asked me to send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>These were written in Jenins in the house of the Carlin family, hastily on April 13, 1562.</p>
      <p>I ask and request you to kindly inform lord Rudolf Collin, my father-in-law, that his letters have been delivered to me and that I will take care of the matter.</p>
      <p>At almost the same moment your letters were delivered to me, as I was about to present the case of my relative to the consul and had also written to Pesclavium, I had to mount my horse; therefore, I could not reply to him. Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned, pious, and faithful lord Heinrich Bullinger, head of the church of Zurich, his esteemed lord, in response.</p>
