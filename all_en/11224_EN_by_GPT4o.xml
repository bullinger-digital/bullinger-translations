The plague is increasing, and many students are fleeing to their homes or to Strasbourg and Zurich; if Bullinger agrees, he could accompany Martin Peyer to Strasbourg, where [Johannes] Sturm teaches. Georg Grebel also wants to leave Basel. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt, most humane teacher, that you are occupied daily with reading my trifles, which may cause you some annoyance, as I continually interrupt your most serious studies.</p>
      <p>However, I earnestly beg you not to take this badly. The varying state of affairs and the various corruptions of the air drive me here and there, so that I cannot do without your advice at this time. A few days ago, I sent you a letter in which some mention of the plague was made; but since then, its fury has increased so much that the former strength seems to be nothing compared to the present. Previously, it occupied certain areas of the city; now it spreads its strength throughout the entire city, and it has even begun to exercise its power around Mr. Miconius's house. Therefore, many students are contemplating and preparing to leave. There are those who have returned to their homeland, many, and others who are heading to Strasbourg, and some who wish to travel to Zurich. Among them is a certain honorable and wealthy young man from Schaffhausen named Martin Beyer, who wishes to go either to Strasbourg or Zurich and has long since taken me into his company, urging me to be his companion. I wish to hear your advice on this matter, whether I should go to Strasbourg, where the man of singular erudition, Sturm, teaches with great praise from all the most learned men. However, I will not use my own judgment in this matter, but will depend on your word and will do everything as you instruct. Georg Grebel is also contemplating leaving, whose sincere and talented nature I cannot praise enough to you. If the plague continues to rage as it has begun, you will soon see the University of Basel deprived of its students.</p>
      <p>These were the things I thought best to write to you now, asking you to reply as soon as you can. I cannot write more; the messenger said he would leave immediately.</p>
      <p>Please convey my most humane greetings to your entire family, whom I wish to remain with you in good health for a long time.</p>
      <p>In haste, Basel, September 23, 1538.</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed patron and teacher. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
