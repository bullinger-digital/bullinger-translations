      <p>Greetings to you in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Last winter, most humane man, I sent to you a certain writing along with the letters of Mr. Gerhard Kamp, so that you, together with some learned men, might give your opinion on the writing itself, which Gerhard complains he has been waiting for a long time or at least requests your opinion greatly, if you have discussed the matter, to write back to him as soon as possible or to inform me of your opinion, so that I may write back to him as soon as I can. He also has many things at home written by a certain learned man in sacred matters, which he would gladly like to send here and submit to your judgment, if it would not be too troublesome for you to undertake such labors. He would like you to note in the margin those things which do not agree with true religion and, if they are mostly not valid, to condemn them entirely, indeed so that they stand or fall by your judgment. He did not dare to send them, lest you, occupied with more serious matters, leave these for a long time without your note of judgment. He is eager to publish them at the earliest opportunity, provided it is done for the salvation of men.</p>
      <p>I therefore pray, most learned man, if it would not be too troublesome for you to read these writings and give your judgment on them, either write back to him as soon as you can or indicate your will to me. I recently sent you some most absurd opinions of David Joris; shortly, God willing, I will treat the matter a little more clearly. I believe that no more absurd opinion has been handed down by a man most ignorant of all languages and disciplines since the world was founded.</p>
      <p>I often ate and drank with the man; he seemed to me a prudent man, although sometimes he gave some indication of his heresy. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, in the year 1559, on the 12th of July, at the same hour I received Gerhard's letters. Johannes Acronius Frisius, devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and most faithful Antistes of the Zürich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, always to be honored. In Zürich.</p>
