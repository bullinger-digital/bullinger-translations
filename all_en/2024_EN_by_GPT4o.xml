      <p>Greetings. Just as in storms, one squall follows and drives another without ceasing, so too, dearest compater in the Lord, do the disputes of heresies relentlessly attack the doctrine of truth. This indeed greatly serves to confirm the solidity of the truth. Meanwhile, we must pray to the Lord that those who are carried and tossed in this ship of the true church may, by His grace, endure in the truth with a firm and unbroken spirit. We see the church of Geneva being attacked in a remarkable way by the ministers of Satan, and therefore it is fitting that we assist its struggling ministers, faithful men, with constant prayers before the Lord. Michael Servetus, who was in Strasbourg twenty years ago and began to spread his poison there, recently came to Geneva to exploit the envy with which the magnates there pursue Calvin. He hoped to find a base there from which he could trouble other churches as well. He began to sow the seeds of impiety and to utter vehemently impious and harmful words about the heads of our religion, about God, about the deity, about the Holy Trinity, about the persons of the Trinity, about the Word, about the Spirit, about Christ the Son of God, about His soul and flesh, about the communication of substantial deity, about the origin and eternity of our spirits, about angels, and about paedobaptism. I know that you have received letters and writings from the Genevans on this matter. I ask that you share your opinion with us. I strongly abhor these so harmful and impious doctrines. The unfortunate man tries to support himself with the writings of Tertullian and Irenaeus, as if they alone were the pure teachers of the Christian faith, and all others, from the Nicene Council onwards, were false and erroneous. May the Lord restrain this Satan and preserve the churches in the purity of faith. As for my household, my wife was for some time in danger of life, but by the Lord's kindness, she has begun to recover, so that she can walk about and take care of the house. Farewell excellently, dearest compater. Greet all yours. Bern, 28th September 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and compater.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
