    <p xml:id="regest1">Is glad that the Zurichers have delivered the Marburg records to Blarer, so that the misunderstanding that Oecolampadius and Zwingli had contributed to the creation of the Saxon Confession is eliminated. Adheres to what Zwingli has published. The Lutherans are ashamed of their view and therefore use vague formulations. Luther immediately betrayed the friendship sought by Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Schnepf derogatorily calls Peter Kutter an excessive Zwinglian and constantly violates the agreement, as Froschauer will report to Bullinger, not to say that Blarer gave in to him. The people of Basel hope that Melanchthon will come to the Duchy of Württemberg. Sends a booklet by Bucer with a request for a quick assessment. Bucer claims to have strictly adhered to Oecolampadius and Zwingli; he also thought that a unification of the churches in Germany would have a favorable impact on Italy, France, and England. Cardinal Jean de Lorraine, the brother of Antoine II, the Duke of Lorraine, has set off for Rome upon hearing the news of the death of Pope Clement VII to buy the papacy for himself.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You have been kind to me, dearest lords and brothers, for which I give the greatest thanks that I can and have. I wish that an opportunity may arise someday, so that I may repay in kind! Nothing could happen to me that would be more pleasing.</p>
      <p>I am very pleased that you sent the Marburg records to Blarer. The good man seems to be mistaken when he says that the Saxon Confession was also made by Oecolampadius and Zwingli, although, as I once wrote, my deacon Gastius found the same among Oecolampadius's papers. Hence, I am somewhat in doubt, although I lean more towards what has been published by Zwingli. However it may be, I am of the opinion that the Lutherans are ashamed of their opinion and have no escape except the obscurity and perplexity of those words "substantively and essentially, not quantitatively or qualitatively, or locally." If Oecolampadius and Zwingli agreed, I believe it was done so that they might part more amicably. However, when I consider rightly: What sign did Luther give of friendship thereafter? Did he not write most hostilely about Zwingli's opinion to the count, I mean the Margrave of Brandenburg? Schnepf, however, said of Peter Kutter, who is now with us, having been appointed to Canstatt, "They say this man is excessively Zwinglian." If the confession was made by all equally, what do these words mean? Meanwhile, however, the one I have just named, the day before I wrote this, in the presence of the good Froschauer, bid us to be of good cheer. He hopes that God will grant that everything will finally be done according to our wishes. I usually note some pride and perfidy in the minds of the Lutherans, which the example of Luther just mentioned sufficiently proves. Then it is reported about Schnepf, as you heard from Froschauer, that he wrote to his brothers of the same ilk that Blarer had come over to his opinion, although it had been agreed by the prince, while each satisfied this with their signatures, that neither would say the other had yielded to him. Besides this, there is a rumor that Melanchthon will come to Württemberg. When we were discussing this matter these days and someone said, "I wish the rumor were true," Mr. Grynaeus added, "And I wish it too. For I know something about this man above the common people." These things give hope, as mentioned a little earlier, that everything will soon be made peaceful.</p>
      <p>Finally, I am sending Bucer's booklet, which I ask you to read and reveal your judgment to me as soon as possible. There is a reason for this request. In the meantime, I will read it myself. He testifies in letters to me that he has written nothing except what Oecolampadius wrote in his Dialogue and Zwingli in his Second Response to Eck's Calumnies. He adds that if there were concord among the churches of Germany, Italy, France, and England would soon follow.</p>
      <p>Hear this news: The Cardinal, the brother of the Duke of Lorraine, has gone to Italy upon hearing of the Pope's death, with three hundred thousand crowns to buy the papacy.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger and Mr. Heinrich Utinger, his venerable friends. Zurich.</p>
