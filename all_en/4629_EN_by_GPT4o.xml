      <p>We, the men and council and the entire community in Schams, send our friendly greetings to the pious, honorable, and wise men and council, as well as the entire community in Thusis court and all honorable courts and communities, and hereby inform you that we have been made aware of how Jan Florin, just a few days ago, rode with someone from Uri into the Masox Valley and there conspired and advised those from the Masox Valley to expel their preacher and schoolmaster from their land or they would face consequences.</p>
      <p>And therefore, we kindly ask you, for the sake of God and His holy word, to stand with us, and we will stand with you as pious, honest allies with life, honor, and goods. And if it pleases you, our community in Schams has unanimously decided to write to you about this, and that you should write to the communities in the best form you know how, and that you should inform the communities truthfully about what is happening and let them know if they want to stand with us, and each community should appoint a messenger to ride to Masox and investigate how Jan Florin acted there and who sent him to exert such power. For we firmly believe that he did this without the knowledge and will of the communities.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we know how decisions have come in the Masox Valley that they should expel their preacher and schoolmaster from their land under the threat of losing honor and goods. You should know that we believe such decisions have been written and sealed and sent to the Masox Valley behind our communities' backs and without their knowledge and will, which decisions are against the common articles of the Three Leagues. Now you have understood our opinion.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we ask you to open your eyes and stand together; for it concerns soul, life, honor, and goods. But if we do nothing, they will also send such decisions to our land as they have sent to the Masox Valley.</p>
      <p>And when you want to write to the communities, as you have understood, then write that they should appoint their messengers to Schams on the 12th day of January at the inn, and we will send our messengers with them to the Masox Valley; for we have also written a similar letter to the community in Rheinwald; we believe they will also stand with us. This is certified with our community's seal.</p>
      <p>Dated in Schams on the 7th day of January in the year 1561.</p>
