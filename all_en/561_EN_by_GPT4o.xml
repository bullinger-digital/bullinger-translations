      <p>S. D. On the occasion of your daughter's marriage, dearest Bullinger, I and all my family wish you all the best. May the Lord grant that they enjoy a happy, beneficial, and fruitful marriage, and may He allow you to see the children of your sons and daughters in the peace of Christ's church. I easily believe that the spectacle of this wedding was unique and that the joy of all honors was poured out, not only because of the memory of the previous pastor but also because of the prosperity and success of the present one.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord that He may guide the course of your affairs to the end with His grace and not allow it to be disturbed by any offense. There are already enough pains and troubles. May the Lord show in you and yours how He can preserve some of His own unharmed in peace even in sad circumstances!</p>
      <p>Regarding the reconciliation established between you there and Calvin and Farel, I did as you asked. When it was first read in the assembly of brothers, it seemed to me and others that this writing had a beginning that was sought too far, and therefore more obscure than what could be approved by the less learned. Thus, I say, it seemed when it was first read. However, it was read only once and briefly, and it was not in my hands afterward. The sentiment was not disapproved by anyone, and it was especially approved by me. I wrote these things to you simply as they happened.</p>
      <p>Now, since you wished it so, I have taken up these formulas of concord and examined each one carefully. And the more I look at them closely, the more I thank God that in this way He has removed that discord which had arisen through the intervention of sinister suspicion and the zeal of restless men. I knew beforehand that there was no disagreement in this sentiment in your hearts on either side, provided that something certain could be established about the formulas of speaking. I easily thought about what obstacles might delay both parties.</p>
      <p>But by the Lord's benefit, I see that whatever has hindered this hoped-for reconciliation, or rather declaration, has been removed. Therefore, there is nothing in this writing that I would want changed, added, or removed. And you have this testimony of my opinion in my handwriting. As for the publication of this writing, to speak frankly, I think it is not unreasonable that the brothers here are reluctant to consent to it, from whom it is not appropriate for me to separate. They think again and again that care must be taken lest anything be poured upon this church, the novelty of which might stir up new commotion, and that among those whose minds have scarcely settled a little after the previous disturbance. I, as a foreigner and still ignorant of the customs of this people, when I hear such reasons, what else can I do but believe those who say they know the character of their magistrates and people thoroughly? And you yourself, when I was about to move here to Bern, advised me to join these brothers and ministers of this church: which I do diligently and will do as long as it can be done to preserve the truth and the peace of the church. I write these things to you as to a most friendly brother and a prudent minister of God's church. Your common letters, in which you respond to ours, have not yet been read in the assembly, so it is not yet possible to know what effect they will have.</p>
      <p>I would sincerely wish for our Gervasius to be taken care of. But what can I do when you, with your authority and diligence, achieve nothing?</p>
      <p>I can lament the fate of him and other good men, but I cannot help. I see the most trivial men, the very stumbling blocks and detriments of the church, presiding over the churches of Christ, and even when they are gravely accused, they are not moved. And these things happen among those who boast of the gospel of God, if indeed they even boast. I beseech you, what do we think will finally happen? Meanwhile, those whose doctrine and life are proven blameless by the testimony of many years are neglected.</p>
      <p>Thus, the churches are not being cared for, but private and carnal affections are being served. These things, I say, we can lament and very easily and certainly predict the future outcome of all, but not amend.</p>
      <p>May Christ, to whom the churches belong, which He redeemed with His blood, do that. Our ears have already become callous to rumors of adultery, fornication, drunkenness, and other such things that should not even be tolerated among the listeners, which crimes are now designated by the ministers of the church and whose stench, which is even worse, few seem to bear with displeasure. This evil was to be met with utmost vigilance and severity, especially by those who can still do something for the truth of Christ and for the edification of the churches, who must utterly perish unless the drones and stains are removed and faithful pastors are substituted.</p>
      <p>Mr. Christopher Montius, the English secretary, who is now staying in Strasbourg, wrote to me, but not a word about the affairs of Strasbourg, which I greatly wondered at. He writes about England, that the Scottish war is raging fiercely there and that the Frenchman is trying to restore the alliance with the Swiss for this very reason, to use their help against the English. He writes that religion is being vigorously propagated and confirmed in England, and that by public decree of the parliament and the king. He adds about the Emperor, that he is certainly gathering soldiers and seems to be about to attack Germany, although it is not yet clear which part of it he intends to invade. He writes that there is great hope in the King of Poland for the reformation of religion. He also adds about some Spanish cohorts that have headed for Constance; but as I hear, this matter has no truth.</p>
      <p>Forgive the length; I know you are busier than to whom one should write at length. I commend you, all yours, my brothers and lords, and your church to the grace of God. All mine, my wife and children, greet you. Farewell very well, dearest of men.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 21, 1549.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>There is no need for me to recommend to you the one who delivers this, as he is already well known to you. It will not be unfruitful for you to discuss your reconciliation with him.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, lord and dearest brother in Christ. In Zurich.</p>
