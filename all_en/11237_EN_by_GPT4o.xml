      <p>Greetings. I implore you by the Lord, that for the sake of these brothers, you may wish to have their cause commended to you and yours in the name of Christ, and with the zeal of good men, to bring it about with your council that they may achieve their desire. He himself will explain the whole matter to you.</p>
      <p>As for our affairs, I believe you hear more than enough. Indeed, the plague is spreading no longer tolerably. We had hoped, since the Lord had smiled upon us with a few bright days and since the time of year necessarily demands a calmer sky, that it would be dealt with more gently with us, but the plague has intensified. You will pray to the Lord there, that with a merciful and compassionate face through Jesus Christ, He may regard our sins and, freeing us from here, lead us with the rich testimony of His spirit to the journey and entrance of eternity. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, dearest brother. Greet all the good men. Truly pray to the Lord Christ, who will deny us nothing that pertains to the salvation of His own.</p>
      <p>Your Simon Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest friend and brother. In Zurich.</p>
