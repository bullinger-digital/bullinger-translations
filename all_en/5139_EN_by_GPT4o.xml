      <p>Grace and the spirit of counsel and all blessings from God the Father to you and your family through Jesus Christ, I sincerely pray, most humane man. I received two letters from you, which filled me with incredible delight, especially because they clearly revealed your piety and your most ready spirit towards me. And even though I never doubted your piety, especially since it is not only known but also declared among all, yet at the very time when these your most delightful letters reached me, all my doubt, which often arises among unknown friendships, immediately vanished. Therefore, I would have replied to those your letters long ago, if public necessity had not called me elsewhere, because of which I was not only unable to undertake anything else, but also unable to manage my own affairs, in which part you will grant me pardon, most pious man, which I do not doubt you will do for your piety. That you have taken my children into your care is all the more pleasing to me, as the education of the boys demands greater care, diligence, and attentiveness, and I would gladly wish this happiness, which has come to me by divine favor, for my other intimate friends, whose sons would be received into your paternal care as mine have been.</p>
      <p>I understand that the benevolence and care of you and your dearest wife, undertaken for the sake of my children, is exhibited to me myself, for which reason I consider myself to owe you very much and I earnestly request that if you wish anything to be taken care of by me, you command, order, and freely disclose it. I will apply no less care in managing your affairs than you have undertaken in educating and nurturing my boys. And may God, the best and greatest, grant that I may someday be able to repay this benevolence of yours towards me with mutual services, which, however, I will strive to accomplish to the best of my ability. Briefly, you may hope for such an outcome and result of the duties entrusted to me by you, as you do not doubt to apply diligence in educating my children. I flee from the heresy of Stancarus and the babblings and errors of the rest like a dog and a snake, yet your admonition, coming from a pious heart, is most pleasing to me. I briefly disclose the state of our church.</p>
      <p>By God's favor, it is in peace and, against the efforts of Satan and his tyranny, it is increasing more and more every day, yet it is most lamentable that God is taking men of great name from the republic, for which reason He must be asked with continuous prayers to avert the evil that threatens us from us by His ineffable goodness.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, I pray to God that He may strengthen and confirm you in this zeal towards the afflicted church and bless you and all yours and preserve you safe for a long time for the propagation of the Church of Christ and for the education of my children, as well as others, in true religion, virtue, and holy morals. Farewell, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>Given at Krakau on the 19th of January in the year of our Lord 1562.</p>
      <p>Stanislaus Czikowski of Wosławice with my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, most esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>From Stanislaus Czikowski, a Pole.</p>
