      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>You may perhaps wonder, my lord Bullinger, at my audacity in writing, that I, a stranger, dare to address you with these my letters. But I, casting aside shame, have boldly decided to write to you, knowing that in your candor you will consider this act of mine with fairness, for although you are not known to me by face, you are so well known in spirit and doctrine that whenever I read your writings (which I use day and night to cultivate my mind according to the standard of the Christian religion), I seem to speak with you face to face. For you, without flattery, beyond other writers of our age, with your most learned writings, have recalled this our nation of Hungary, pressed by idol worship and also Turkish servitude, cleansed from innumerable superstitions, to the true measure of the Christian religion. For which reason, after Almighty God, Hungary rightly owes you great gratitude; hence it has come to pass that the pious, confirmed by holy doctrine, dare, which was not heard before, not only in parts of Hungary now subject to Turkish rule, but also in Thrace and even in Constantinople, to preach the gospel of Christ and to console the afflicted consciences of scattered Christians. This seems to be a sign of the future judgment foretold by Christ, that in the last time his gospel will be preached in the whole world. Therefore, in the name of the Hungarians, I have great gratitude to you for your benefit bestowed upon them. And if only we were not separated by such a great distance, you would understand in some part our gratitude towards you. Know, therefore, by the grace of God, that throughout Hungary the gospel of Christ is preached everywhere except in those places where papist bishops reign, who are few, and the shaven men (monks), by whom not a few troubles are presented to Christian preachers, such as severe insults, persecution, captivity, and chains. Yet in all these things they stand firm, not departing from their station. But since they need consolation and some of them have asked me to seek your confirmation for them, I beseech you by Christian charity, do not hesitate to console them and also others who have adhered to the word of God and have given their names to Christ, with your writing, so that confirmed in the faith of Jesus Christ they may remain with unbroken spirits. The form and manner of this consolation you will easily prepare according to your great wisdom.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, since in the borders of the kingdom of Hungary countless Christians of both sexes are seized by the Turks, it often happens that now the husband of some woman, meanwhile the wife is seized and leaves children with the husband, whose upbringing is very difficult for the husbands themselves, because of which, forgetting the seized wife, he takes another for himself, from whom he has offspring - what should be done in such a case by the ministers of the word of God, consult; for it sometimes happens that the former wife returns from captivity and the husband is compelled to send away and repudiate the second wife and receive her. There is also this, that throughout Hungary in cities, towns, and villages, Christians are mixed with papist religion worshippers and cannot depart from among them without great loss of property and fortune, what should they do, is it permissible to live with them and despise their ceremonies?</p>
      <p>It remains that papist priests and bishops compel the more ignorant to adore the bread in their masses. Although the pious do not ignore that this is diametrically opposed to the word and institution of Christ, not all know how to elude the sophistical arguments of the papists. Therefore, instruct them with a brief writing, what to do in such cavillation of adversaries, what to answer, and how they can and should refute their arguments? If, as I hope, you do this, we and all the pious will have great gratitude to you. May the Lord God preserve you long in safety for the increase of his word. The brothers who are with me and who agree with me in the word of the Lord greet you. Given in Vienna, Austria, March 26, 1551.</p>
      <p>I await a response through this man who gave you these letters. But if it is not possible to respond to everything immediately through him, send the letters you will later write and send to me at least to Augsburg to the hands of Geryon or Achilles, the physicians of Augsburg; they will easily send them to me.</p>
      <p>Most devoted János Fejérthóy, Hungarian. To the Reverend and most illustrious lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of God of the church of Zürich, etc., most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
