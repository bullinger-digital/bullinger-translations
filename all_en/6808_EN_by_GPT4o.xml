      <p> Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, I recently wrote in great haste because I was not informed of your departure until you were about to mount your horses. Whatever the case: your decision was made; it is not for me to declare in whose favor. I can affirm this: if certain matters had been more clearly stated, we would already be at peace, and the business would be concluded. The decision is that, regarding the costs, Mr. Batt and Mr. Bartholomew should each pay 3 men, who should recognize this; but if they do not agree on the matter, it should be referred to the mayor and council of the city of Zurich. The majority of the House of God is burdened by this; they had expected the matter to be resolved and not to have to tie the hairs together first. However, I think everything will turn out for the best. In other matters, if the same substance had been more clearly stated, it would not have caused any dispute. I certainly assure myself of the wisdom of Mr. Consul from Cham, that if he had been in charge of the business, both parties would have been satisfied. I write no more. I have only learned to look more and more to God in my entire life, bidding farewell to all men... - Through the great contention of good men and especially those who are of the House of God, the matter has finally been brought to the point where it is left to the discretion of the delegates with the reservation of certain articles. They could have done as much as they wanted; what they wanted, you will understand from them and others in due time. After the decision was revealed, the Beatini began to raise their crests and act insolently, and there has never been greater turmoil in our city. There were four riots in one day; everyone ran with spears and halberds, etc. The nephew and brother of Bishop Bartholomew were gravely wounded to death, etc. The delegates from the House of God left Chur full of anger, and therefore I do not promise myself any good. Otherwise, this one is willing to depart; it cannot be otherwise. But Mr. Batt will have poor grace and peace, and as I assess the matter in every way, it is much more difficult than if Mr. Batt had sat without any hindrance, etc. - As for me, I have done everything, even at the risk of my life, to preserve religion and to diminish the power of the priests, and I hope I have achieved something. But what gratitude I have received, you will hear from yours. I have not spoken much with them; but the companions have approached them, pretending to be of either party, wishing me well, etc.; but I bear the greatest blame for this; they warn me that I have a great burden, etc. Thus they insinuated themselves. I, miserable, relying on the goodness of the cause and that I had supported the cause of your city and the evangelical Swiss at great personal risk (for if the priests were lords in the Leagues and the Palestinians, they would not have it any better), I hoped for at least some gratitude from yours rather than envy, etc. But I affirm this to you for certain: even if your senate and you yourself, which I least expect, and the whole world besides were to oppose me in a just and fair cause, I would not be broken in spirit, because I have learned to trust no longer in any man, but in one God, especially since I now expect death to be near to me every hour and moment. But I will die in such a way that, if yours do not want to believe me, there will still be many good people here who can testify even after my death what God has accomplished in this one cause through me, when that faction would dare anything if things had turned out according to their wishes, etc. Those men have plotted against my life and fortunes. Now, after no small victory, this is the gratitude I receive, etc. - Lord Gallicius was taken by the plague last Friday, which he anxiously feared all his life. His wife and daughter with the youngest son are also ill. I await what the Lord will decide for me. If I had passed away, I should have promised myself that your senate would have taken some consideration for my children; now, since the adversaries have occupied them, I doubt what I can hope for. Therefore, I hope in one God, etc., and I will not cease to be a good man, even if the world collapses, etc. - Henceforth, Reverend Father in Christ, I will write to you less frequently. You will forgive me; for you see yourself from the writing that I need some rest or at least moderate recovery, if it is the Lord's will that I live longer; if I die, this very death will end all these evils and pave the way to more solid peace. I pray to God that He may preserve you in safety for His church for a long time. Greet for me Mr. Lavater, Mr. Simler, Mr. Zwingli, your sons-in-law, and Mr. Heinrich, your son, and the whole family. Chur, June 10, 1566. Yours, Fabricius. </p>
      <p> I had recently written these letters, Reverend Father in Christ; but there was no one to whom I could give them. In the meantime, if you wish to know what is happening with us, here it is in brief: The plague is spreading and almost, if it invades a house, it empties it. The youngest son of Gallicius followed his father; the wife is still gravely ill. In the place of Philipp, a fairly good young man, Johannes Gantner, a citizen of Chur, has succeeded. Huldrych Schlumpff, the minister of the church in Davos, was present here, subscribed to our confession, and, as he claimed, wanted to be one of us, etc. - As for the bishop's business, the matter seems to be in a much worse state since those intermediaries were here. All good men unanimously admit this. I will not write the reason to you, for you would not believe such a thing. You will hear it from others in due time, etc. The day before yesterday, a firebrand was found in the bishop's barn; it greatly frightened my lords. The barn is in the city, with much hay, straw, and cattle in it. Here there are various judgments of men. I would have liked to inform Mr. Cham of the matter for the good; but I kept silent because I observed the man's character in the first meeting. I do not concern myself with the curse, neither little nor much more, etc. </p>
      <p> Chur, this 17th of June. </p>
      <p> Yours, Fabricius. </p>
      <p> "If you ask me how I think the matter will go and end, I will say: as I see the matter, a large part of the Confederates will let the decision stand, though with some clarification, as will the city of Chur; but many communities will not at all. Bartholomew will step down. It will be difficult for Mr. Batt to sit in; for the Pergallers, Oberhalbsteiners, and Tumleschers are riding anew around the communities. And I think thus: Mr. Batt will sit in the castle with a despondent heart, which I no longer inquire much about. Let him sleep as long with worries as I and another honest man have also done. Nothing will happen to him from Chur. As far as I am concerned, I will point everyone to unity, etc.; for I am as tired as anyone else, etc. To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. </p>
