      <p>Greetings. For several days, I have been struggling with some unknown illness, which has greatly hindered me in my duties, and I have not yet recovered. Although I have received two letters from you, I have not been able to respond because I have refrained from writing and reading for several days, and my head and hands are not yet performing their duties. You ask me to write much and explain the French affairs diligently; however, even if I were most fit to write, I have nothing noteworthy and certain to report; you heard about Linerum the other day. It was written here that in Strasbourg, about 10,000 of the Guise's men perished in battle, including about 4,000 horsemen; but since this news is not confirmed from elsewhere, I doubt its truth. But what need is there for more? I have fallen back, worn out by long-lasting trials, so that the sweet lies of our people do not refresh me as much as the sad truths torment me. Rouen, the most flourishing city of France, has been captured, plundered, overturned, and filled with the blood of citizens and soldiers; neither sex nor age was spared; the soldiers' monstrous lust, unspeakable to mention, raged against virgins and matrons.</p>
      <p>These are works worthy of the Roman religion. The most opulent city has been so exhausted that not even the value of a crown was left in it; the soldiers' greed and cruelty were insatiable. But how long, my lord, how long? Before the temple of Rouen, the minister of the word, Mr. Marloratus, an excellent man, was hanged, etc.</p>
      <p>The spirit of the enemies has grown from this victory.</p>
      <p>Our people continually multiply their armies, but achieve nothing; they allow the innocent to be slaughtered in their sight. I hope they do not even attempt peace terms with the robbers! Meanwhile, the Lord has also shown His hand here in such great evils; for the King of Navarre, the torch of this evil, while relieving himself on the embankment, was wounded by a gunshot in the left shoulder and soon died. His death was concealed until they appointed his brother, Cardinal Bourbon, in governance, although it rightfully belongs to Condé; but everything is being conducted wrongly. Let us pray to the Lord to deliver His people from evil and turn His wrath away from us, for whom I do not foresee good things in the meantime. In Frankfurt, on November 24th, Roman King Maximilian was elected with unanimous votes; they say he was crowned on November 29th. I hear he will fulfill his father's measure, which I pray against, and I ask the Lord to grant him His spirit and guide him in the right way. He respects his father so much that he will do nothing remarkable while he lives unless driven by the spirit of God. A Turkish delegation (indeed, instigated) came to Frankfurt, threatening the rebellious French and their allies. All is intrigue; everything is full of evils. Exhausted, I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>It is written from Augsburg that 22 Spanish ships have burned in the port of Seville, etc. Farewell and pray to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>Write back when you have time, and if you have any news from Germany, share it, especially from Württemberg, etc. December 11, 1562.</p>
      <p>May our Matthias and the city magistrates, the vogt of Kyburg, be safe. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer, residing in Winterthur, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Winterthur.</p>
