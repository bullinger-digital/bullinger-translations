    <p xml:id="regest1">Two months ago, he sent an admonition to Duke Ulrich, number 407, which could not be delivered to him, so he is sending it again. The opponents of the truth are pleased that the "Sacramentarians," by which the followers of the Eucharistic view represented by Zwingli and Oecolampadius are meant, are excluded from the Peace of Kadan, as their doctrine is not tolerated in the Empire. Bullinger regrets this, but hopes for better from Ulrich, especially since Ambrosius Blarer was appointed, who teaches the same as the people of Zurich, and justifies their understanding of the Eucharist by summarizing its basic principles. He asks Ulrich to hold fast to the truth and offers his assistance.</p>

      <p>Although I know and am well aware that your princely grace does not necessarily need my admonition, nevertheless, out of good and trusted intention, I wrote an admonition to your princely grace two months ago, which was also sent, although it was not delivered to your princely grace as I had hoped, undoubtedly not out of any unfaithfulness, but perhaps because it could not be arranged due to business and military unrest. I am sending it again and ask your princely grace to willingly receive it. For we, who preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in the cities of the Confederation, with what earnestness we, along with our congregations, have prayed to God for your princely grace's salvation, victory, and welfare, and what joy we have received from your princely grace's victory, is known to Him to whom all hearts are open. Now, as God has richly shared His grace and mercy with your princely grace, we are continually concerned that our hope may not be disappointed, more by the cunning of the envious than by your princely grace's knowledge or will. It is with particular joy that the opponents of the truth boast that the Sacramentarians, that is, we who adhere to the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as taught by the praiseworthy memory of Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius from the Holy Scriptures and ancient teachers, are excluded from the peace, as their doctrine and essence are not to be tolerated in the Holy Empire. This would be of great concern to us if there were any truth to it. However, we hope for better from your princely grace, as well as from the illustrious, entirely Christian prince and lord, Lord Philip, Landgrave of Hesse, especially since the highly learned Master Ambrosius Blarer, our particularly beloved brother and fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, has been appointed by your princely grace to teach, who has so far taught simply, faithfully, and unanimously with us in this and other matters, from whom your princely grace also well understands what our opinion is, and that we do not deny the true presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, nor have we ever denied it, yet with the distinction that all carnal thoughts are set aside and everything is understood spiritually, heavenly, in the contemplation and consideration of faith according to the nature of the sacraments, as Augustine and other holy teachers also understood, who confessed and taught that the assumed, natural, mortal body of Christ is in heaven in one place, but here below also in the contemplation of faith with His grace spiritually and powerfully with us, so that therefore He does not need to be moved from place to place with His body, who is also truly eaten in spirit and not carnally by believers, for the unbelievers eat the sacrament, but not that which is signified and presented by the sacrament.</p>
      <p>Most gracious prince and lord, I ask your princely grace for God's sake to graciously receive this my writing, consider it, and take it to heart, to hold faithfully to the truth, so that the right and true may be promoted, which is never obscured, true worship of God planted, right and useful studies furthered, and all superstition prevented. Where the truth has so far come forth and not been followed up with dignity, courageously with great earnestness, it has again been lost with great harm to those who did not accept it earnestly, completely, and as it should be. May God faithfully preserve your princely grace in His will, to His honor and to the salvation of the Christian community, so that you, like the pious princes David, Hezekiah, Jehoshaphat, and Josiah, may attain eternal salvation and praise. But what I can help with faithful services, likewise with teaching and writing, also with earnest prayer to God, I will (also know that all other ministers of the word with us are of this friendly offer) always be ready. Asking, your princely grace will have us commended for the sake of the truth and the Lord Jesus, of whom we are unworthy, yet called servants.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, the 4th of September 1534.</p>
