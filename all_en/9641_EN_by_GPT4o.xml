      <p>Greetings. I received your letters in the past days, most esteemed lord and godfather, to which were also attached others pertaining to Mr. Steiger, which I delivered to him.</p>
      <p>He is glad that his letters have been returned to you and thanks you for them and sends his regards. He has again, in the past days, according to the custom of our republic, entered the consulship, which I hope will be fortunate and successful for him once more! There have also been some other elections, about which I write privately to my brother.</p>
      <p>Regarding the theological profession, no one has yet been elected in place of Mr. Aretio; however, I believe this will happen shortly. The lords, as far as I understand, will not admit any foreigner. Perhaps from our own, Adrian, the minister from Aarau, who previously also taught theology in Lausanne for several years, will come into the election; but we are somewhat averse to him, not only because of certain other vices he suffers from, namely talkativeness and drunkenness, but also because we have doubts about his integrity in doctrine, as we know him to be more inclined towards the Bishop of Basel.</p>
      <p>Perhaps Turingus Rustius and Christophorus Lüthardus from Aarberg will be joined to him, and from our own, Christian in Port and Valentinus Ampelander. Many look to my Blasius, and perhaps he would not be useless; the senate also leans towards him. However, may the will of the Lord be done. I only fear that someone heterodox might be imposed on us, and if Blasius seems useful to you, I would ask that you immediately write something for him to Steiger and Diesbach; for your authority and intercession could do much here. He was with me during these Easter days and writes to Mr. Simler and sends his regards to you and all those there. Many new things are reported daily; but they are so uncertain and confused that it is tiresome to write about them. It is known that war has been declared in Paris and almost all of France is in arms. They say many towns around Poitiers have been occupied by the Huguenots, who are no longer called Huguenots, but Malcontents, and that both evangelicals and Catholics are flocking to them indiscriminately, and that it is no longer about religion, but about asserting the liberty of the Kingdom of France. Some even dare to affirm that the king's younger brother supports them. The king would gladly hire foreign soldiers; but he has no money. Others say, which is surprising, that they are abundant in money. Our Lavallius and Castillionaei have nothing else now. We await what the merchants from Frankfurt will bring. There is much talk about our Swiss, that they want to lead troops to Belgium for the King of Spain, whose chief captain should be Schorr from Schwyz. However, I am surprised that your letters contain nothing about this. I know much is secretly discussed among our people, which I do not want nor can investigate all. Would that we were more united in spirit; may the Lord grant this!</p>
      <p>Our people have sent a messenger to Heidelberg, whom I hope will return soon and bring us something.</p>
      <p>If you receive anything from Frankfurt, please share it with us, and farewell.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their regards to you in return, including the Zehenders, Frischings, and Wytenbachs with the Küngßfeldians.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 17, 1574.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, all yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Bullinger the elder, my dearest lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
