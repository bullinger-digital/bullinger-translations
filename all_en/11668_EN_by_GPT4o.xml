    <p xml:id="regest1">The news of Gryn√§us' death has caused him concern for the health of the Zurich scholars, as he has personally experienced their neighborly care when he was with Pellikan, and is aware of the associated dangers; the church also suffers when it loses the proclaimers of God's word. At his current place of residence, there is a [spiritual] drought, although less so than in France and in his homeland; also, more can be said here without punishment than there. [Jacopo] Sadoleto has written two books "De aedificatione ecclesiae" and is working on a third; Cardinal Legate [Gasparo Contarini] is supposed to travel to Germany again; what else is being said is too uncertain to be communicated. He is barely satisfied with his living conditions, but has not yet received a letter from home and had no contact with the Scottish mass visitors - why, he conceals out of sorrow. This year he studied medicine, partly because of his weak health, and partly on the advice of the learned Swiss Jakob Lemonius, who has greatly supported him and provided him with a citizen's son as a student. Greetings.</p>

      <p>It has been too long, most distinguished man, since I have heard anything about your status and that of your most beloved fellowship. Love is always fearful; for after I learned that the distinguished man Simon Grynaeus, who was very close to you and all the learned men there, had passed away, good gods, how I feared that other illustrious men might also be taken away by that impure contagion. This concern troubled my mind all the more because I had heard that the pestilent air had penetrated your area due to its proximity.</p>
      <p>I know your charity, I know your friendship, I know that your spirits are not more invested in your own bodies than in those of all your neighbors.</p>
      <p>This fact is not known to me from the whispers of men, but from the most certain knowledge. For never, as long as I live, will I allow the memory of humanity, which the most humane man, Mr. Pellikan, demonstrated when I was with him, to fade, especially towards a neighbor in extreme distress. That inner and true friendship does not see danger. When this happens, it is necessary that diseases also become common. This matter, as I said, made me very anxious, as it should have, not so much because of my love, which should be and is great towards you due to your singular kindness to me, but because of the utility of the Christian republic and church.</p>
      <p>For indeed, the church suffers greatly when it loses the sacred orators who profess and teach the word of God; for the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. The less your nation suffers from this shortage compared to others, the more fortunate it seems and the more it appears to be under the care of the eternal God and Father.</p>
      <p>Here, there is great thirst due to the dryness of the place, I suppose. The more noble and native wines are spoiled by water drawn from wells. But now this vice is less widespread than before and less here than among the French and us. Add to this that what is done and said here with impunity and rightly, if it were done or heard among us, would incur the utmost penalties.</p>
      <p>Sadoleto has completed two books "On the Edification of the Church" and is now working on a third. There is a rumor that Cardinal Legate Tarentinus, who is currently here in Bologna, will return to Germany. Many other things are heard, I wish they were true, but since they are based on conjecture, I did not want to commit them to writing, especially since I think these things could be conveyed to you better and more cautiously by others.</p>
      <p>Forgive, I beg you, my inexperience and love, to which when I yield, I am accustomed to think not so much about what or to whom I write, but what my duty is. As for my affairs, their condition and status are such that I can be content, but in no way can I be with less. Not even a letter from home yet. However, many pass through here from Scotland to the fairs, but none have met with me. Why this is, I am prevented from writing by sorrow.</p>
      <p>I have spent this year in the study of medicine, either because my health, which is often weak, compelled me, or because the learned man in both languages and in this very faculty, with great praise, and especially dear to me, Doctor Jakob Lemonius, a Swiss by nation, advised me. I have made extensive use of his advice, friendship, assistance, diligence, family resources, and wealth in my most difficult times. And to mention nothing else, he has arranged for a young citizen here to be educated in humanity by me. I gladly mention this to you because I understand that his kindness to me will also be pleasing to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my sweetest and most desired Bullinger. Again and again, farewell with your dearest wife and children. I wish the best for the young men, whose company and delightful manners at your home I greatly enjoyed. I want you to bid farewell in my name to Mr. Theodor Bibliander and Mr. Pellikan, men of the highest humanity and learning. Finally, I wish and pray for the well-being of that entire college of learned men, along with your brother, a most humane man.</p>
      <p>In Bologna, on the fifth day before the calends of May 1542.</p>
      <p>Johannes Arlius Spaldinus subscribed.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, his perpetual lord to be revered.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
