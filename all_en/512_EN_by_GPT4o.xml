      <p>Dear lord and brother. My dear brother-in-law Peter Schär has been with us today in Griesenberg, and he brought with him a very good, pious, Christian man of noble birth from the Wetterau, one of the Riedesel family. In his youth, he became a German lord at the house of Schiffenberg near Giessen in Hesse. However, when the Landgrave took the house, this good, dear man came to Count Wilhelm of Nassau at his own request; he served him for six years and always attended to the countess, and was very dear and esteemed by the lord. He also won a noble young lady, one of the Gerstein family, from the ladies' chamber, who is now pregnant with their third child. Now that many things have changed, the Teutonic Master, who is a Milchling, has written him a remarkable, earnest letter and most urgently requested him to return and submit to the order's obedience, etc., with an attached severe threat. He also wrote to the count that he would not keep him, etc.</p>
      <p>Since the Teutonic Master is a very gracious emperor, the count has somewhat withdrawn from his letter, and although he has earnestly embraced the gospel, he has nevertheless asked this good man not to burden him, but to leave the court so that he does not unnecessarily fall into greater danger because of him. He has done this and knows, however, that he has no security from the Teutonic Master throughout the entire empire; for he easily issues mandates against him, etc., to which people now and also in these matters among the evangelicals are obedient. Therefore, he has come up here with the aforementioned man, my dear brother-in-law, and wishes to ask whether he might find refuge in a Confederation.</p>
      <p>They have asked Liebenberg; Hopeler would offer him a very decent position, which he would be quite satisfied with and willing to accept.</p>
      <p>Since this must happen with the knowledge and consent of an authority in Zurich, he has very earnestly asked me to help to the best of my ability so that this may be granted to him; he would gladly do everything and conduct himself as is proper and customary. Since he is such a pious, honest, Christian man and is in danger and misery solely for truly Christian reasons, because he left the order and entered into marriage, and since no one on earth has any claim on him, neither emperor, king, nor other princes and estates, because he has not been in any war, nor is he in any dispute with anyone, except that the Teutonic Master is pressing him hard, I appeal to you for God's and Christian love's sake, on behalf of my dear brother-in-law Peter and my friendly, dear sister, our very friendly, diligent, Christian request, to help further this godly man's cause as much as you can, also to obtain permission for him to enter, to hold on, and then to inform me favorably what he may hope for, so that he is not sent up here in vain by us; also inform us of the conditions under which he would be accepted.</p>
      <p>Hopeler in Liebenberg would let him have the seat for a year with all benefits; if he liked it, he would pay him with a specified sum of money, I do not know how much that is; but if he did not like it, he would provide him with the rent, namely fifty guilders. It would certainly be pleasing to God if such a godly, pious man were sheltered.</p>
      <p>He is of a very modest nature, disciplined and quiet, without a doubt no one could reasonably have any objection to him.</p>
      <p>My aforementioned dear brother-in-law Peter Schär is also writing to his brother-in-law Jacob Rösten on behalf of this man with a friendly brother-in-law's request to further his intentions with an authority. Please make every effort and deliver the letter to him, discuss it with him, and handle everything in such a way that the dear man of God is not excluded. I do not know how soon I can get this letter to you, so I will wait for a favorable opportunity and a suitable messenger.</p>
      <p>Dated May 8, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
