      <p>Praise be to God, Frankfurt, 17th September 1559.</p>
      <p>My friendly greetings and willing service beforehand, gracious, dear lord and friend. I have received your letter along with several letters, which I will ensure are delivered to the right hands. I have spoken with Doctor Mont from Strasbourg regarding your letters that you wish to send to England, etc., and he has replied that he will do his best in this matter; for I have no other friend to write to, only him, and he will take care of all my affairs. Therefore, if you wish to write anything to England, write to him and ask him to take care of your letters and send them away, and I believe he will gladly do it on your behalf. As for news from England, I have nothing special, except that everything is proceeding correctly, and every day they burn all idolatrous images along with mass vestments, mass books, mass candles, etc., in the street, and everything that has served idolatry, which has never happened before.</p>
      <p>God be praised and thanked, and may He grant us the grace to be thankful.</p>
      <p>I have sent you 2 Dutch cheeses via Froschauer; I ask you to consider them good and greet all good friends for me. May the grace of God be with us all together.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant always, Johann Abel, England. To the worthy and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my gracious lord and friend in Zurich.</p>
