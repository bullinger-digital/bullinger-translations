    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's mediation in acquiring [lecture notes]. Reports in detail at his request about the Geneva affairs: The alliance with Geneva is due to the machinations [of Bernese and Fribourgers]; the cause of all evil is the associated partisanship. Bern is not ready for war, as the pay for the last war has only been partially disbursed and Fribourg, Solothurn, and the Five Places are hostile; moreover, neither the envoys of Savoy nor those of Geneva can be trusted. A free company that wanted to come to the aid of the Genevans from Neuchâtel has been betrayed but surprisingly defeated the Savoyards; warned by Bern's envoys, most of the mercenaries returned, a few went to Geneva and participated in a sortie there. Bern is negotiating in Aosta with the Duke of Savoy and has threatened him as well as Geneva with measures in the event of unfriendly actions. While Geneva is supposed to receive help from France, the Five Places allegedly want to support Savoy. Allusion to the arrest of [Antoni Bischoff].</p>

      <p>S. On the 29th of November, I received the books, a truly select treasure, through the messenger from Lenzburg, which were acquired almost for nothing, but thanks to your efforts. For these, however, I had sent my own messenger the same morning to bring them. How much you have gratified me with this gift, do you want me to write, when I can hardly express it? I also received 9 bearers; but what was the need to send them back, when you have spent more paper in my name? I remain silent about so many commentaries and books, with which you most generously burden me, leaving no room for any response. I hear you are now working on Leviticus. If only I could someday grasp the rest of the Pentateuch! But more on this another time. I am glad to have these, and it is thanks to your kindness; for those things are always most welcome, which you pour into my lap.</p>
      <p>As for the Genevans, you want me to write much. I know, you in Zurich know as much as I do in Bern. In short: The alliance is made under the papacy with papists through greedy, self-serving machinations of the true practitioners in the cities of Neuchâtel, against the will of our entire senate. When the treasury is empty, it still leaves its party behind, as does the ruler of the Allobroges. This always lays the saddle on our back, which we would have laid down with better honor than Constance and Strasbourg, yes, if there had been no party. Now it is the cause of all misfortune. My lords do not engage in war, they suffer costs with roses and days, although they have spent 1000 guilders far away in Thun and achieved nothing, but it is mostly the party's fault. Firstly, the country people have not yet been paid for the previous war and the city has not been compensated, the city is still out 9900 crowns on the same pay, they will not undertake the costly long journey. Secondly, we have dear friends: the people of Fribourg, Solothurn, and the Antronians, who would guard us next, as to be concerned, and in short, enemies appear from all ends and few friends; you have the reason why we have not been girded for war for a long time. Thirdly, both parties' envoys, from the Allobroges and Geneva, bring forth so many lies that we do not know whom to believe.</p>
      <p>To investigate this, a delegation was sent to Geneva, especially when it was heard that from Neuchâtel through Burgundy, 414 soldiers had moved to a mountain near Geneva at Coppet and Nyon and there gave a signal with fire to those from Geneva to move towards them, so that they might safely come to Geneva. While the soldiers were moving through Burgundy, not all Bernese, they were betrayed and awaited by 500 riflemen. They were warned and led for three days without food through mountains and woods until they caught 4 peasants on a Sunday morning, who surrendered and led them to a village where they found food. Thus, the soldiers bound the 4 peasants and were led by them, and when they came to a living hedge and thicket on a mountain, the 4 peasants, although bound at the hands, began to run, giving a signal to the enemies who were holding behind them; they were immediately stabbed by our men. Meanwhile, the Savoyards fired about 300 shots at them, all fell, then threw stones so hard at our men that they had to run back and down the hedge as best they could. Then our men stabbed the Savoyards (there were about 1500, some say about 2000) and drove them into flight, killing about 400, some say 500, and thus came to their designated mountain. There were our envoys, the Bernese soldiers alone went home, as our order of the journey demanded. The soldiers did not want to, they had security and provisions until Orbe, towards Fribourg and Bern. The Savoyards agreed and did so. Then the other soldiers also did not want to stay, everyone went home. They could have reached Geneva in half a day. Now the Genevans do not want to give them anything. However, some soldiers came to the Genevans, with whom they broke out one morning and made another attack on the Savoyards, but with losses on both sides, though much fewer people.</p>
      <p>In all this, the duke has requested a day to personally negotiate with my lords in peace without any mediators. My lords have somewhat agreed, sent their delegation from the council and citizens to Aosta to the duke with 1000 guilders to spend. They are now waiting daily for a message, what and if they will negotiate. However, the duke has some troops in his land, not far from Geneva, and the Genevans have some reinforcements, my lords have recognized that if the Savoyards do anything unfriendly with the Genevans, my lords will immediately recall their envoys and further consult, but if the Genevans do not keep the truce, my lords will give up their alliance with them.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there are rumors, yet credible, that some French on horseback and foot, about 300 less or more, wanted to move to Geneva, were turned back by the Savoyard army not far from Geneva and retreated. However, the talk goes, chapters and articles are set by the French and Genevans against each other. We would have a good neighbor! Then there is a talk, the Antronians have sent out 400 men, sending them through the Allobroges. We do not know what it means. All devils are running in between, so that peace is not made. Yet the whole world cries out against us, we want to go to the meat market and do not know what.</p>
      <p>Do you want me to write more, when I do not know more? Or first let more happen, which I can write about. We keep the bird in the cage, whose song I will depict to you once it is clear.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>29th of November at night, year 31[!].</p>
      <p>Your B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
