      <p>S. Dr. Grynaeus wrote to me with the condition that I send the copied letters to you along with the list of those who are appointed to the convention. There is no need for me to say much about these matters; for you will easily understand what is happening in Worms from his letters. I add what is not included in them: The Emperor suffers from an ailment in one of his feet, which we call lupus, so that he can neither walk nor ride a horse, but is carried in a litter. Furthermore, some of his best counselors have passed away. The people of Lower Germany pursue him with miserable hatred due to his tyranny, to the extent that they refer to him not as the Emperor, but as the Duke of Flanders. I wanted to add this so that I would not write nothing.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your people in Christ.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, November 12, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger and the other brothers, ministers of Christ, his in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
