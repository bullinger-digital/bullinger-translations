      <p>S. D. P. Your most welcome letters, dated August 18, were delivered to me on October 11 by Christophorus, the son of Eustachius Froschauer (with whom I have since shared both lodging and, in part, my studies). With these letters, you have indeed brought my mind back from great worries to tranquility and made many friends even more dear to me. Therefore, it is so far from the truth that I have ever deserved this favor, which you proclaim in your letters to me, that I acknowledge it is not even possible to adequately respond to your great kindness and benevolence. For in me, there is nothing to praise except a willing spirit, which, even if it were as great as you make it out to be, I would still consider the favor returned abundantly by you, as I have enjoyed your patronage so comfortably up to this point. To pass over other matters and speak of your most diligent recommendation made to Lord Sydall, you have achieved so much that you have removed from me the mark of ingratitude, which I had scarcely escaped until now; for Lord Sydall himself, who had begun to think himself deceived by his kindness towards me and was therefore somewhat alienated, now feels not only that I am grateful to him but also dear to you. I wish from my heart to repay the memory of this kindness to you more in deeds than in words, and therefore I will strive again and again to ensure that I may never seem to have used your patronage, advice, and recommendations in vain.</p>
      <p>The letters from Lord Peter Martyr, which you say were not needed, I requested at a time when I felt that what was falsely reported about me was being spread among you, fearing that such suspicions might eventually extinguish your favor towards me; for my father did not cease to urge and almost freely accuse me in his letters to me, so that I might escape this great infamy. But however these things may be, as long as these suspicions are broken, I give the greatest thanks to God.</p>
      <p>As for what you write about Lord Sydall perhaps helping me to obtain a position of teaching or to achieve something through my literary labors and instruction, so that I may remain longer in my studies at Oxford, this, I say, is nothing; for I recognize my own (if it can even be called knowledge) as much less than to undertake such a task, nor are the people of Oxford so fair to foreigners that even if I could offer something of this kind, perfect in every way and complete in all respects, they would give me a position. For, to sum it up in one word, they are γραφαὶ Φαρισαϊκαί (Pharisaical writings). Unless perhaps you wish your words to be taken in the sense I understand, as if referring to some private condition of service, which I would sooner find in London or even at court than in either university. I have also recently written diligently to my father about this matter; for as the cost of provisions among us increases daily and expenses therefore grow almost immeasurably, certainly, unless something else comes to my aid, I fear I will be thrust into the greatest necessity, as my studies, if I continue to resist heavier expenses, can no longer be sustained at Oxford.</p>
      <p>As for what is happening in London and at court now and what has been done so far, I do not doubt that you can learn more easily and certainly than I can, both from the letters of many and from messengers.</p>
      <p>However, what is happening in Oxford, although not greatly worthy of a letter, I think ought to be written to you by me. The people of Oxford, who have hitherto been accustomed, still persistently remain stuck in the papist mire. In opposing them, Lord Cox seems to favor Fabian's strategy too much; for he has begun to act more leniently, I think intending to break them by delay. Lord Hooper is undertaking great and noble efforts, especially against the power and luxury and ceremonies of the popes and bishops, nor have such pious efforts been without success so far; for how much he has advanced, you may perhaps soon hear from him.</p>
      <p>I could not know more to write, as I am far from London. Therefore, it remains for you to continue to protect me with your dignity, as you do, as long as and as much as I am not burdensome, and to encourage my father in promoting my studies, so that he may hold to the proposed course and not abandon the ship in the deep. Your letters were most welcome to Lord Sydall, to which, since he could not respond now due to the management of the royal college, which he oversees in the absence of Lord Cox, he wished to be excused to you through our John and me, and he wished to send you many greetings in our letters in his name. Farewell. Given at Oxford, the day after the feast of Martin, 1550.</p>
      <p>Johannes Rudolf Stumpf, most observant of your dignity.</p>
      <p>To the most grave and excellent man in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zürich among the Swiss, most revered lord and patron.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
