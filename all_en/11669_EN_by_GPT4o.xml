    <p xml:id="regest1">Hopes together with his colleagues for the speedy recovery of Bullinger, Leo [Jud] and other Zurichers; Theodor [Bibliander] and also Bullinger himself, who would be hard to replace, should take care of themselves for the sake of the church. Refers to another letter from the Neuchâtel people [No. 1622]. The imperial cities regret the disunity of the Confederates; they themselves are as much oppressed by the princes and their allies as the Confederates were before concluding their alliances; there are only rumors about their intentions. Encloses the speech given by the French envoy [François Olivier] [at the Imperial Diet in Speyer]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I grieve much more than can be expressed, on account of you, Leo, and the others. I recently wrote to Theodor through Christoph and urged him, as I have often done before, to take care of himself for the sake of the church, if he is unwilling to do so otherwise; for I know how willingly he labors for the public good, and therefore I wish that he would take such care of himself that he might do so for as long as possible. His weakness grieves many brothers, and likewise Judah; they therefore pray that the Lord may be with them in all things. Indeed, I have been ignorant about you for longer than was proper; I believe that no one willingly wanted to disturb me otherwise because of the various troubled events of the world. But I thank you for informing me of your recovery, and I pray together with the brothers to the Lord, that He may restore you completely, as these times require. If I were in your place, I would compel Theodor to take more diligent care of his health. For what will he accomplish if he exhausts himself by working? I also wish to remind you to take more diligent care of yourself for the sake of the wretched church, which is still so weak. If you were to depart to the Lord, who would succeed you? You have excellent talents, I do not deny, but they are so worldly that I do not see how they could endure in spiritual storms.</p>
      <p>May the Lord always protect you. Amen.</p>
      <p>The people of Neuchâtel write again; I do not know what it is about.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that you know the situation of the imperial and free cities; they anxiously complain that the Swiss are not united among themselves, I do not know what they are attempting.</p>
      <p>They are oppressed no less by the prince-electors than our people were before the alliances. They add to themselves priests, monks, monarchs (perhaps through the Lord), so that it is clearer how they vilify the cities. Rumors are spread, of which I do not wish to be the author.</p>
      <p>I am sending the speech of the envoy, in case you have not seen it, so that you may know the effort of the French. It can be useful if someone uses it correctly.</p>
      <p>I am going to the chapter house, therefore farewell in Christ Jesus with yours, Theodor, Pellican, Leo, Caspar, all. Let it be so, let it be so.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, April 28, 1542. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of Christ, in his Lord.</p>
