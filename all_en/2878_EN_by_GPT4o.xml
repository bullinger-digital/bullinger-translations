      <p>On the day I wanted to write to you, most holy man, my illness returned again and so exhausted all my strength that I can write nothing at all. However, I had many things to write. But what can I do? I can barely draw one or two lines. I have hope of establishing a conversation about resolving the doctrinal disputes among all who profess the gospel. If that happens, I would ensure that you are also invited, if I knew you would not refuse to send some representatives. But some here are pessimistic about us. Indeed, they think it would be in vain to attempt it, as they do not believe any of you would come even if invited. This would greatly grieve me. Nor do I think you could offer any just excuse if you refuse. For as far as your national laws are concerned, it would indeed be fair for them to yield in this part to the public necessity of the churches of Christ. For laws are not for people, but people for laws. I think our Calvin and Musculus should definitely be invited. Therefore, if you can promise me anything about yourselves, I would like you to inform me as soon as possible. I am sending you and others there my letters recently written to the homeland. Let the rest be corrected from your copy, for I do not have the time to do this.</p>
      <p>We had a serious conflict here with the ministers of this city. But thanks be to the Lord, we have a magistrate who is quite fair to us, and indeed more and more people are joining our opinion every day. I truly cannot write more, most holy man. I commend myself to the prayers of all of you there, and I respectfully bid all farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, the last day of March 1556.</p>

      <p>What you require in the form of excommunication in our booklet, I would like to know more fully: therefore, please indicate. I also thank you and Mr. Bernhard for responding to Westphal.</p>
