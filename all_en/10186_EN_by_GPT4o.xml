    <p xml:id="regest1">Simultaneously with an inquiry from the Bern Council to Zurich regarding two issues of marriage legislation, Haller poses the same questions to Bullinger: 1. Whether the marriage of a guilty divorced person, if it occurs without permission, against the prohibition stated in the law, constitutes a marriage. 2. Whether those divorced due to adultery are allowed to marry the person with whom they committed adultery.</p>

      <p>S. Our council seeks advice from you on the matter of the judicial censorship, which is called the consistory. Two sanctions were established two years ago, with which we wanted to address cases that arise daily in the future; but with the increasing malice of people, we have achieved nothing, as they daily push us with new attempts, whose malice cannot be hindered by any obstacle.</p>
      <p>The first sanction is this: those bearing the guilt of divorce should remain silent (wait) for at least a year, behave honorably and piously, not marry without the court's permission and sufficient proof of improvement; but those who do so against the prohibition should avoid our city and land, yet at our grace and punishment. Here are two declarations on which the senate could not agree. One part does not want to consider it a marriage, since it should be forbidden by God to no one, and the performance by the state should be considered a punishment for disobedience. The other part: since adultery has such a light punishment, it should not be made greater, access to second marriages should not be so common; otherwise, it would give cause and occasion for fornication, divorce, and adultery. Therefore, since marriage is also forbidden to the youth under age (minors) if they marry without the consent of their parents, and if they marry, it is not allowed, it should also not be a marriage but fornication, those who bear the guilt of divorce and marry against the prohibition. If they leave our lord's command, they should be held, whatever one wants, in other places. The magistrates are inclined to accept persons and admit those once banned back into the city, which would cause everyone to strive for divorce. Therefore, consider what seems more divine, that is, less offensive; for we do not have the word of the Lord on these matters.</p>
      <p>The second law: henceforth no person should marry the person with whom they committed adultery, whether they bear the guilt of divorce or not. This provision wants to be so widely applied that the divorced take their whores or boys, believing that if it does not come to complaint or right, they bear no guilt of divorce, it should not be forbidden to them, however notorious the adultery may be. Some believe, to avoid scandal, one should value the salvation of the church higher than that of individual people. Some desire to remain steadfast by the provision without any breach. Some also, but with the addition that a church court has the power to judge according to the fairness and nature of the cases. Consider this too and write your opinion and support it with arguments, as you can. I do not doubt that Megander has also written to Leo.</p>
      <p>Farewell; there is nothing new with us.</p>
      <p>Last of November.</p>
      <p>Your B. H.</p>
      <p>To the learned and equally pious Heinrich Bullinger, his always dearest brother.</p>
