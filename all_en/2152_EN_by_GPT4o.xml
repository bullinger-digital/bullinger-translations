      <p>S. P. As I was about to mount my horse, your letters arrived, which were indeed welcome, because from them I understood, as has also been written to me from several places, not that it is so; but that the English marriage frightens many not without reason. However, you should have from me and say, I beg you, to your lords that there is no mention of peace or even the slightest truce between the Emperor and us, and although that marriage has taken effect, which will hardly happen through seditions, yet this does not move us much; for if the English become our enemies in this way, they will maintain the old status. But let the German princes beware of doing anything against us, otherwise, as you saw from the letters to Vergerius, I do not know what can be hoped for. In truth, the Emperor insists on the Council of Trent and solicits many; but with the king safe and our alliance with the Swiss lords, he will not achieve this. If only the Bernese and you would not dissimulate so much, - you will pardon me; for I speak from the heart as a Christian -; for this time the Imperialists promise themselves many things, which I hope will not come to pass. But if there were one body and alliance, you would preserve your own without any injury and others theirs, all of which the Imperialists covet in this anarchy. I have letters from our legate, who is in England, dated the 20th of the other month. The Queen wants the marriage, has sent envoys and ships to Spain; the people with all the nobility oppose it, etc. Already some quarrels have arisen; but it is to be feared that the stronger will prevail; yet God is stronger than them. You must especially weigh this with yours; for it is new and unheard of for a thousand years and not without reason our Burgundian neighbors threaten all other nations. Hastily from Solothurn, January 10th. Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassafontaneus. What is said about the Swiss dismissed from Piedmont, believe this was done so that they might rest from longer labors, and immediately after my return, more will be sent. In Corsica, all is prosperous, and by God's favor, nothing unfortunate has yet occurred.</p>
      <p>All of Italy (except the Pope) looks to us, fearing for itself from this monarch, and rightly so. I also hope the German princes will do the same with you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the best man and friend, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
