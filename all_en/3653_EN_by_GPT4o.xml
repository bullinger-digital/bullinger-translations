      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I have received your letters, beloved son, and your mother has received hers. The way of living pleases us. Be frugal. However, I do not want you to be shabby. I do not want you to deprive yourself of what is necessary. For just as I hate unnecessary expenses, I am generous in providing for necessary expenses, which you will calculate. Send the calculation. And if a convenient messenger presents himself, write. See, my son, that you conduct yourself prudently and moderately in the presence of those who are your companions at the baths. Be humane and kind. Show honor to all. Serve the elders willingly, especially the senior senators. Be friendly to them with respect, willing to serve them. Do not talk too much, but be straightforward and sincere with them. You know that moderation in all things is best. I am sending the strings you wanted. If you want anything else, write. Farewell. If the bath does not agree with you, let us know in time. Pray to the Lord for health and His grace. Do not let yourself get into fights with anyone. Conduct yourself modestly and honorably, so that you bring honor to us. The Lord be with you. July 22, 1558. Your mother greets you. All of us here greet you.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Heinrich Bullinger, currently in Baden in the back courtyard.</p>
