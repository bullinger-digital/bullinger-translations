      <p>S. I was going to send back to you what you recently sent; but Mr. Jungius is in such a hurry that I was not able to gather them; therefore, I ask for a delay until another time. I am very grateful to you for sharing with us all that has been written by you. I will make an effort, since I understand it is pleasing to you, that the people of Neuch창tel also subscribe to our confession. The news you sent was read in the senate; but I have not yet received it. I distributed copies among the leaders, all of whom are very satisfied and express their greatest thanks to you and send their regards, especially Consul N채geli, Steiger, Diesbach, M체linen, Graffenried, and others. Farewell. I will write more extensively next time; I barely noted this down during lunch. The one who comes with Mr. Junius is from Neuch창tel and, together with Viret, was expelled from Lyon, where he once served as a minister; he is a noble man who once devoted himself to studies here. He will tell you more about French affairs. The boy they are bringing with them is the son of Mr. Saraceni, a doctor from Geneva. They will explain to you the execution carried out these days in Geneva on Spitameus, who was once the bishop of Nevers; you will also learn the reasons from them. Farewell. Give my regards to all yours in my name. Bern, March 30, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. Zurich.</p>
