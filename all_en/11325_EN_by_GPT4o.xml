    <p xml:id="regest1">The work on the theologians' statement regarding the planned religious discussion prevented him from writing; now he confidentially shares the report submitted to the council as well as his private statement and requests its immediate return through Gervasius [Schuler]. Schuler can report more details based on a letter from Bucer; perhaps his journey was even prompted by Bucer, although he wanted to visit Bullinger two years ago. Zwick has also requested an opinion from Vadian; his response suggests Bucer's influence. He asks to borrow Vadian's letter on the glorification of Christ [No. 894]. Schuler would be willing to deliver a letter from Bullinger and his book "De origine errorum" to [Balthasar von] Kuenring. Congratulations on the birth of Bullinger's son [Johannes]. Sends back Bullinger's article [on the Frankfurt Agreement?].</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>We have been extremely busy until now with preparing the response that we had to give to the magistrate regarding the upcoming assembly, and during this pending deliberation, I could not write anything certain to you. Now, since a very certain message has arrived and we have offered our response to the senate this morning, I have decided to comply with your request and send our documents, from which you will understand what you wanted. Therefore, I am also sending my private deliberation, but all under the condition, my brother, that no one reads or possesses them except you alone, indeed not even the courier should know what I have sent; for it is expedient to keep silent in these matters and not to reveal the opinion before the time; otherwise, some have quite cunning deliberations, so there is no need to arm them against us. Therefore, you, to whom we trust as to a most sincere brother, read these and, if anything pleases you, extract a few things, so that you may return our writings through that most dear brother of ours, Gervasius; for we very much lack copies.</p>
      <p>For the reasons of the assembly, inquire of Gervasius; I understand he has everything ready, for Bucer wrote to him, but not a word to us so far. And lest I do not say everything freely to you, I suspect that Gervasius undertook this journey at Bucer's urging. But I may be mistaken; for two years ago I understood Gervasius to be very eager to see you.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote to Vadian about that assembly; but he responds in such a way that I understand he is perhaps well instructed by Bucer. But what shall we all say in the end? O Father in heaven, thy will be done, etc. Therefore, you have a letter written by Vadian about the distinction between the deification and glorification of Christ, which he ordered to request from you, so that I may read it; having read it, I will return it to you as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>If you have time to write something to Khienring and send the booklet "De origine errorum" etc., you could send it with Gervasius; for it would be convenient to send it to him within eight days.</p>
      <p>As you have been blessed with offspring, may it be happy and fortunate for both parents, but especially for the kingdom of Christ. Greet the mother and the whole household. Farewell. June 18, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick. I am returning your articles, which we highly approve; I am grateful that you sent them to be read.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother in all things.</p>
