      <p>Greetings. I received your earlier letter, most distinguished man and most revered father in Christ, written on August 18th, through the noble servant of Prince Andelot, and the later one dated the 21st of the same month through a fellow citizen. In the former, you asked that I commend Prince Andelot to good men, which I diligently did as soon as I received the letter. In the latter, you sent a letter from good men about the troublemaker Schmidelin and at the same time briefly noted some new matters, for which I offer my greatest thanks.</p>
