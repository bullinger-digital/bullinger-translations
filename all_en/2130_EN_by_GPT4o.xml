      <p>S. I will respond concisely to your most loving letters, since you wish it so. I do not think it could have been perceived from my letter to you that I was greatly disturbed by the actions of Gallitii; nothing could have been written more mildly by me, and that not so much for my own sake as for his; thus it was being spread by the talk of the people. For besides the fact that it was not the business of his office, I am surprised he did not shudder when he wrote that the Emperor was asking the Rhaetians to allow Spanish and Italian soldiers, for a fee of two hundred florins, to pass through here, not to mention that, as you most gravely write, it is against the treaty and oath and is sought with great cunning to separate them from the Swiss. Not to fear that stain and devastation, the confusion of ancestral customs and all institutions! I hear that he now refrains from translating the writings of adversaries because he was paid the wages of so many days grudgingly; however, I prefer to believe he did it of his own accord and for another reason. But I have said too much about a matter that does not concern me. - Nothing new has reached my ears regarding your writing that you were an opponent of treaties with the most Christian king. Those things of yours are excellent, but as the Spartan said, they lack a city; not all men are so fortified against external injury that they do not need the resources of others. You know how often it has been said among the Athenians that they preserve only their spirits from their former fortune, as if to say it is wise to deviate a little from that rigidity to protect freedom and other honorable things.</p>
      <p>However things stand, for so many years since the treaties between us were established, nothing has been done by us that could be blamed. We have always embraced you all as most faithful friends, always striving for the advantages, safety, and honor of your country, which I hope we will do more and more in the future. - With what spirit I wrote to you concerning the collection and other matters pertaining to it, the Lord himself knows; but I add nothing, seeing that your minds are imbued with the opinion that we all, who serve princes, are like Vertumnus and have no regard. As Catullus says, my Bullinger, there is no one whom you do not see to be a Suffenus in some matter, I fear there are more Vertumni in other functions than you think; thus, perhaps, you judge others from the candor of your own mind. Since our life is exposed to the talk of so many people and we are involved in so many precarious affairs, if we manage that nothing improper is even mentioned against us as a reproach, in my opinion, it is something we should congratulate ourselves on. For I have always thought: God is the one who is perfect in every way, above God, who so approves all his words and deeds to everyone that he entirely escapes the sting of calumny, as Plutarch calls it. We have always admired you as a good man with a rare kind of candor and have tried to win your favor with some honorable service. I dictated this very hastily, almost without a horse, to counter the growing fire in many places. Farewell. Chur, 4th day before the Kalends of January.</p>
      <p>With the packet of Vergerius, I received your letters; I will take care of everything diligently. I could not quite understand whether anything remains to be paid to the messenger. I will do as you wish me to do. May it be far from you or our Vergerius to be burdened with expense.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Fraxineus, Bishop of Bayonne. To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, dearest friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
