      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God the Father through Christ the Savior, etc. Two months ago, Ulrich Hafner came to us, who offers you these letters, indicating that he was a schoolmaster among some, from whose borders he was expelled and dismissed because he did not agree with his pastor on the sacramental matter. I do not doubt that he will narrate the cause itself to you more clearly. In the meantime, he is seeking some position with us. Since the children of our citizens are taught for free with the beneficence of our most honorable council, we indicated to him that he would work with us. For (as Claudian says): Everyone wants to know, but no one wants to pay. We therefore provided the man with travel expenses. However, he had those whose advice he used, who wanted him to open a school here with the consultation and permission of the council. He attempted the matter; however, it was less successful than expected, and he finally experienced, perhaps to his own detriment, that we were speaking the truth. Therefore, he is compelled by lack of resources to seek a place elsewhere. In the meantime, as he wished to move to you, he asked us to recommend him to you. We therefore ask that you be willing to assist him so that he can attend to his affairs. He seems to us to be a good man, truly pressed by lack of resources, and he would like to provide for his wife and children. He conducted himself with us (as far as we could understand) honestly and piously. We do not doubt that you will assist him; however, we wanted to recommend him to you in writing at his request in the name of my associates and myself. We are convinced of your candor and beneficence towards the exiles of Christ; therefore, we do not think there is a need for more words, asking in the meantime that this good man may feel that our prayers are effective with you. I have added these new things that follow; I would have sent them long ago, but Mr. Martin said that you would receive them from the French legate, and finally, he wanted me to write to you. They came from the papal court from someone, as he says, who was involved in the councils. They are as follows:</p>
      <p>Cardinal Morone is sent as a legate by the pope to the King of the Romans to attend the Diet of Augsburg, in which the supporters of the Emperor promise themselves many great things with the assistance of the said cardinal; for he departs with ample authority granted to him by the pope and oversees and directs all the Emperor's affairs in Rome and Italy. Indeed, this is a most certain conspiracy made between the Emperor, the King of England, the King of the Romans, the pope, and even some princes of the empire who have remained obedient to the Roman Church, against the evangelical princes, whom they are entirely persuaded will be oppressed and that this diet will be their certain ruin. And indeed, it appears that some great evil threatens them if this secret conspiracy is carried out. The King of the Romans, who is also a participant, does not understand that the whole matter is primarily undertaken against him.</p>
      <p>For the King of England, who expects all favor from the pope, secretly demands in the head of the book that the said pope should provide him with all assistance so that he can more easily reach the succession of the empire. If he does so, he promises to reward his relatives and give them many goods in the Kingdom of Naples. And these things are most secret among them.</p>
      <p>From this conspiracy, both the evangelical princes and the others, to whom the freedom of Germany is dear, should diligently beware and consider the above most attentively, and especially the King of Bohemia, who, because of the friendship he thinks exists between the said cardinal and his father, fears nothing for himself. But if he considers what was said before, that this man oversees the Emperor's affairs in Italy and is subject to the King of England in the Duchy of Milan, and that he hopes to obtain the papacy someday with the help of the Emperor and the said King of England, and to these (which is the main point and the most certain argument), that the Emperor in no way cares about religion, which he has always used as a pretext for his ambition in all his actions, as in this one, to more easily impose on simple and credulous people, the said King of Bohemia and all other princes of Germany should beware and think about their affairs and freedom. To these, Cardinal Pole, the Englishman, who showed how good-hearted he was towards all Germans in a speech published against them in recent days, and the said Morone are very friendly and like brothers.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is established among them that they have regular couriers, whom they will send and return to each other, so that they may conduct the matter with common counsel. From this understanding, the Kings of the Romans and Bohemia can also infer what threatens them. But to weaken this conspiracy, nothing seems more effective at present than if all the princes, whose affairs and freedom are at stake, render the Diet of Augsburg useless by not attending directly or indirectly.</p>
      <p>The credibility of these things will rest with the author.</p>
      <p>Now nothing remains but that you may live long unharmed for the churches of Christ and for us. We are eager to see your work on the Apocalypse. Greet Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, and Mr. Gwalther in my name. Grubilius and RÃ¼ger greet you. Given in Schaffhausen on the 4th day before the Kalends of April in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the man of remarkable candor, learning, and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, brother and dearest lord in Christ. Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
