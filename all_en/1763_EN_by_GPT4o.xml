      <p>Greetings. From your letters, most esteemed servant and minister of Christ, I cannot express in words how much true pleasure I have derived. The persistent rumor of Peter Martyr's death had been confirmed to me; I was grieved when I heard from the same rumor that the churches, which rightly and piously understand the mystical supper, were branded with the mark of heresy by the Council of Trent. Your letter, therefore, arrived at a convenient time, which consoled and revived my anxious spirit; for from it, I learned not only that such a great man is still alive among mortals, but also that he has joined you in arms to wage the war you have undertaken against the Antichrist and his formidable retinue. Therefore, continue, O noble athletes of Christ, as you have begun; in you will live He who said: "In the world you will have tribulation, but in me, peace; but take heart, for I have overcome the world," and He will finally place Satan under your feet, applauded by all whom He has chosen from this world. With this hope, the eyes of all the pious are fixed on you and heroes like you, moved by the divine spirit, praying for you a joyful and glorious victory, etc. Now to the rest of your letter, though in a somewhat disordered manner. You inquire: "If you had moved to us, as you had planned, in time, you would not have seen the barbaric plundering and military banners." It is as you write, most distinguished man; but where would I have moved, with my wife unwilling to follow, having surpassed my sixty-fourth year? What remains of my life, after God, depends on her faithful care and diligent service. Therefore, I saw what I saw, not out of some curiosity and of my own accord, but at my wife's insistence. However, I more willingly forgive this fault, because, as you will soon see, I have in her a benevolent and willing partner in what I meditate for the glory of God. But as for seeing the banners, etc., I confess to you, as a spiritual physician, that I did not see them entirely unwillingly, although I was certainly drained of a sum of money due to my meager fortune; for I saw at the same time the ferocity of the ecclesiastics being restrained, who had frequently said: "You Lutherans will finally feel, once the council is over, what it means to have defected from the Roman Church, and you will have to beware of either a recantation or changing your ground or perishing ignominiously." They then began to openly and roundly blame the cause of these calamities, the prolonged siege of Magdeburg, and the Council of Trent, retreating much from their usual ferocity, although now they begin to raise their crests again because of the present Emperor. I add here that not all were equally treated, but especially those (so that you may recognize divine vengeance here) who were harsher to others and had hitherto more sharply opposed the word. You know better than I how the Archbishop of Mainz conducted himself at the Council of Trent. Among us, the rumor is that the Italian bishops would have conceded many things, which he, exasperated by fatal hatred, was unwilling to concede in any way.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Speyer was such an enemy and adversary of the Gospel that once (which I now recount, I heard from the mouth of one who reclined at the table with that bishop and some companions when these things were said) when the conversation turned to the course and spread of the Gospel, driven by a spirit of envy, he burst forth with these words to the astonishment of all who heard: "Ah, why does some Attila (thinking of that devastator of Germany) delay in coming, who would destroy, who would lay waste, who would plunder everything, even if I myself must perish with those scoundrels (meaning the Lutherans)," etc.</p>
      <p>He was unaware of what he poured out from the goads of envy. But these times have shown him to be a true prophet of himself. For from the Brandenburgers (who were that Attila), no other bishopric was so ravaged as this one and Mainz, with castles burned, many towns, monasteries, and temples plundered and despoiled, both in the Mainz and Speyer territories, nor was that famous temple in the city of Speyer spared; the Bishop of Speyer himself, in flight and exile far from his own, miserably and ignominiously breathed his last. In Worms, among us, none of these things happened; although the Brandenburgers occupied the episcopal palace here and inventoried everything found in it, yet, having paid the agreed money, they took nothing from it or, if anything, nothing unworthy, nor did they harm private priests, nor even Jews, nor citizens beyond a small sum of money. This, most excellent Bullinger, I recount to you at such length, remembering that I confessed to you that I did not see the military banners entirely unwillingly, so that I may provide a defense for my flesh with this mentioned cause. Oh, how many among us would prefer to see such things again and again rather than see those people daily parading before their eyes with such arrogance. But what if some enemy had taken me and my wife from here to England, where Peter Martyr is, or to you in Zurich, where you, Gwalter, Bibliander, Pellican (oh, how sweet it would have been for me to have had the opportunity and the hostile work to achieve my desire) could be heard discussing Christ and divine matters, believe me, I would not have thought I was taken into captivity or exile, but into a true homeland, for to be absent from the good is indeed true exile, therefore to be present with such is a pleasant homeland. In this time of distress, I have cast my care upon God; He cannot neglect whom He loves; He loves him who loves the Son, as Christ says: "He who loves me is loved by my Father." Therefore, however He deals with me, whether through freedom or captivity, whether through life or death, I trust it will result in the salvation of my soul. May the heavenly Father continually increase this confidence in me and preserve it to the end of my spirit, etc. It follows in your letters what Peter Martyr has published, what has been printed among you so far, and what he is soon to send to you, also what you published last winter and this summer, etc. I have taken care to have them brought to me from Frankfurt, it is enough that you have indicated the titles, and there is no need to burden anyone with bringing such things to me. Regarding the booklet titled "On the Clarification of Christ," etc., sent as a gift, I have and give thanks; God willing, I will return and repay it sometime. Thus far, I have spoken to your letters according to my loquacious infancy, quite barbarously and confusedly. Furthermore, what I have planned, now listen with kind ears. Since I can so difficultly arrange my migration from here to you for reasons you have heard once and again, and yet I have once resolved to leave some memorial of myself to the Church of Zurich, which has deserved so well of the salvation of my soul, for almost two or three years now, since I returned to Worms from you, I have set aside a certain sum of money, namely one thousand Rhenish gold coins, with the intention that an annual pension of fifty be purchased, which will perpetually accrue to your church every year after my and my wife's death. Under this condition, if your senate is willing to receive the same while I am still alive and attest to it with obligatory letters (of which I have thought it appropriate to add a draft here), as is customary and fair, I will not hesitate to transmit that sum to you there by September of the coming year fifty-three, etc. If you favor this plan of mine, Bullinger, and consider it beneficial to the Church of Zurich, you will have done me a not ungrateful service if you refer this matter to the senate of your republic at the earliest opportunity and confidently, with these present letters as witnesses by my mandate and order, and then inform me by your letters of the response received at the spring fair in Frankfurt, and this so that there may be no hindrance to the subsequent harvest that could delay the business. May the heavenly Father inspire and favor this plan of mine if it is to result in His glory. Amen. Farewell with your wife, children, and all yours in Christ happily, most distinguished and eternally esteemed Bullinger. From the ancient city of the Vangiones, Worms, November 22, 1552.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Waidner, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, primary and true bishop of the Church of Zurich, my eternally esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Regarding the sum of 1000 guilders. Worms.</p>
