      <p>Greetings. If you ever send letters addressed to your Katharina, I will gladly join mine with them, and whenever there is an opportunity to send letters to Poland, so that they may be transferred from there to Transylvania, I will ensure they are well taken care of, as much as I can. I have shared what I had about the affairs of France; I have nothing else, nor have I received anything else or more in the meantime. It is strange that everything is covered with such silence; perhaps things are different than some would approve. You do well to always inquire something from the honorable provost. He might have more from Italy than others. If indeed the Venetians have occupied the Peloponnese, which they now call Morea, it would have been done excellently; however, I hardly dare to hope for such a great thing, especially since it is said that the Turkish fleet is stationed at Euboea, which they call Negroponte. They will eventually break out, I fear, and engage in battle. I have received again the consignment of Polish affairs sent back by you. I first hear from you that Brunner has been called to Dürnau by Gregor von Ulm.</p>
      <p>I pity the man who is not unlearned and wish he were modest! Marius was dismissed because he seemed not very suitable for teaching and leading the youth. If he has obtained any position among you, I wish him a tractable and calm mind.</p>
      <p>You wonder what happened with the Duchess of Württemberg. I will tell you briefly: She came to Baden for the purpose of bathing, bringing with her her preacher, Master Balthasar Bidembach, who preached the word of God in her court. But the people of Baden, having sent delegates, forbade him to continue preaching against the public peace. He complied and every Saturday went to Königsfeld, where he heard the word of God. However, when she was preparing to leave, the people of Baden demanded a fine of 200 florins from her. When she complained about this in a letter to our most honorable magistrate, our mayor or proconsul informed the people of Baden not to trouble the princess with this matter; that they would take the whole matter upon themselves and respond at the next Swiss diet. Thus dismissed, she came straight to us, thanked the magistrate. She was received honorably and kindly, and all the expenses she incurred here in our city were paid. She was escorted by about 50 of her horses.</p>
      <p>She accepted this most graciously and departed the next day. Thus, the five places are quite courteous towards both strangers and locals. But all things have an end and change.</p>
      <p>Nothing has yet been discovered about the Diet of Speyer. There are various rumors, which I gladly refrain from writing about.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your family. Greet all our friends in order and congratulate on my behalf Mr. Karl, etc.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, July 28, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
