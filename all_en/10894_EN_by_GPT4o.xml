    <p xml:id="regest1">Request to the Mayor and Council for further handling of the following cases from the Synod: The complaint against Heinrich Landenberger, chaplain in Turbenthal, who was accused of excessive drinking and rudeness in dealing with the villagers; the Autumn Synod of 1533, in which he was also accused of profiteering, loitering, and swearing, showed mercy as he promised improvement. Another complaint was directed against Hans Kübler, chaplain in [Hausen near] Ossingen, who, together with his wife, participated in Catholic services and has been at enmity with Pastor [Thomas von Gachnang] for many years; the Autumn Synod of 1533, in which such complaints had already been brought forward, left Kübler unpunished - in the hope of improvement - but recommended citing his wife before the marriage court and imprisoning her due to her wild and blasphemous behavior. It is left to the discretion of the council to provide a remedy.</p>

      <p>Pious, steadfast, honorable, prudent, and wise Mr. Mayor and gracious, dear gentlemen. The entire synod requests and admonishes your honorable wisdom to willingly hear the following matters and to faithfully execute them as appropriate.</p>
      <p>In the last synod held in May of this year 1536, a complaint was made against Mr. Heinrich Landenberger, resident and chaplain in Turbenthal, stating that despite numerous and friendly admonitions and warnings, he still shamelessly indulges in excessive drinking day and night and then speaks so rudely and wildly with honest (upright) people and his neighbors' children that greater harm is to be feared over time. However, since he has withdrawn and did not come to the synod, the synod wanted to present his inappropriate behavior to your wisdom along with the judgment passed in the synod held in autumn of 1533. It reads as follows: Until now, Mr. Heinrich Landenberger has led an unchristian life, not befitting a priest, with deceit, wandering around, drinking, raging, and swearing (cursing), so much so that he is commonly called the "sow of Landenberg." He must and is also known for this. Such behavior is entirely against the synod, scandalous to all honest people, and so disgraceful that a synod would have dealt with him earlier if he had not earnestly pleaded for mercy and promised significant improvement. Now, having been granted this, he should henceforth abstain from drinking and swearing, from drunkenness and deceit, he should stay at home and conduct himself honorably and not come with such articles anymore. For if he were to come again, no mercy would be granted to him, etc. Regarding this, the aforementioned complaint has now arisen, namely after the 3 years in which he has not improved. The entire synod now leaves it to your discretion to handle it appropriately. In the first-mentioned synod, held in May of this year, a complaint was also made against Mr. Hans Kübler, chaplain in Ossingen, for leaning towards the papal religion. For he was present at the anniversary of the Lady of Wyden, along with his wife, who brought the offering. They also have much access to the upper monastery. Furthermore, he is said to be a drunken and dissolute person. Moreover, he has never lived by the judgment given to him in 1533. For when asked at one time how he stood with the pastor, he answered: "As before." Furthermore, the judgment was not carried out, that his, the chaplain's, wife was never imprisoned, as was recognized at the time. Since then, however, this one has also withdrawn and not appeared in the synod, the synod submits this complaint to you, whether you would hear the chaplain on this matter. However, the synod shows you the following complaint and judgment, which occurred against the aforementioned chaplain in autumn of 1533. The complaint was that this chaplain and the pastor in Ossingen have hated each other for more than 13 years and have each taken the path the other has gone. The chaplain has a wild, disorderly wife who swears badly and has not come to church for half a year. The judgment was given: Improvement was expected, and they both should abandon the envy against each other. The chaplain's wife should be sent before the marriage court, then imprisoned, and they both should not come before the synod in any way or form anymore. For if any more complaints were to come, they would be dismissed, etc. Now, however, the aforementioned complaint has come against the chaplain. The synod leaves it to your discretion how to stop such great disorder and punish it appropriately.</p>
