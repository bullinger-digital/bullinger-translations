      <p>C[aelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] sends greetings through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you write, my dearest brother and most esteemed in the Lord, about our dialogues on the blessed kingdom of God's greatness, I will say nothing except that I have done what all others do who commit their thoughts to writing and publish them, so that the judgment of all may be free, just as it is free for them to propose, and I also wrote to you somewhat about this matter when I sent those books to you. Therefore, I am no more to be blamed than the entire class of writers, among whom you will find very few or perhaps none who satisfy everyone or please everyone's taste. But the fact that you, my best brother, could not conceal your feelings about it, so far from loving you less for it, I even consider that little disturbance of yours as part of your love for me and love you more myself. And I hope that the same will happen between us in this holy friendship, as he says: "The renewal of love is the reconciliation of lovers." But enough about this. It remains for me to thank you for also wanting to show that proof of your perpetual love in your son, by commending Johann Rudolf to me, who is by far the dearest of all your possessions to me. I gladly saw him and embraced you in him. The young man's character pleased me greatly, and I pray to God to increase His gifts in him.</p>
      <p>Indeed, what you ask of me in your letters, I have accomplished and not only commended him to my son-in-law in writing while absent, but also in person while present. For he came shortly after your son arrived in Strasbourg, and he arranged for my daughter to be carried to me by litter, and now both are with me; but he himself is also not very well. Therefore, what he cannot do now, but will do shortly before he leaves here, he ordered me to greet you in his name and to excuse him to you. Do not be anxious about your son, for I will treat him as my own son and he will lack nothing in any matter.</p>
      <p>As for my daughter, you are not unaware of how she has been afflicted by a severe illness for a full eight months now, and she still moves nothing except her tongue and head. However, there is hope in God's goodness that she will recover from such a calamity, and there are certain signs. I will keep her here until she has fully recovered, so that I may also bear part of the troubles and burdens. But I beg you, my brother, to continue to help us all with your prayers, as you have done so far. Farewell. All our household greets you with your wife, children, and sons-in-law.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 8, 1555.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, dearest brother in Christ and most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
