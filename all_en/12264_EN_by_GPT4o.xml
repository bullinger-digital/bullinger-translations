    <p xml:id="regest1">Serin is deeply grateful to Bullinger and wishes to express this, in the absence of other opportunities, at least through this little letter. He has been particularly edified and strengthened by Bullinger's commentaries on all the apostolic letters. Since he is convinced that Bullinger is willing to show favor to everyone in Christ, and since Serin is also striving for friendly relations among Christians, he no longer wants to win Bullinger over with flattering words, but rather asks him brotherly to briefly explain what he has written or would have wanted to write in his commentary on Matthew regarding the question of the Lord's Supper. - In [1543], a significant evangelist of Swabia [Martin Frecht?] tried to shake Serin's view of the Lord's Supper by claiming that Bullinger now thinks differently about the Lord's Supper than before and agrees with Luther, at least with the [Wittenberg] Concord. Serin encloses a copy of the Concord, which he recently managed to obtain, with his letter. Incidentally, in [1541], one of its signatories [Martin Frecht?] claimed that the Swiss would approve of it. Serin, who is reluctant to doubt the honesty of his [informant], would like to hear from Bullinger himself whether this is true and whether the enclosed copy of the Concord is faithful to the original. - Serin has carefully read the chapters on the sacraments, baptism, and the Lord's Supper in the 1543 edition of Calvin's "Institutio [christianae religionis]". Since there are people in Swabia and Moravia who represent the orthodox [Zwinglian] view of the Lord's Supper and yet fully approve of Calvin's view of the Lord's Supper, including statements to which Serin is cautious (for example, he can hardly imagine that Bullinger would express himself about John 6 in a similar way to Calvin), he would like to hear from Bullinger himself how he stands on this, so as not to claim anything false to others. - The bearer of the letter [Wilhelm Reublin] will ask further questions on behalf of both Serin and other brothers. Bullinger or his colleagues should not evade these in the interest of the church. - Bullinger should pray for Serin and his listeners. Greetings to all colleagues. - Serin requests the return of his [copy of the] Concord, as Serin did not have the time to copy it [again].</p>

      <p>May grace be multiplied to you through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Although I owe you immense thanks, most excellent Bullinger, and yet have no means to repay them, I could not refrain from expressing my gratitude, at least through this little letter, so that you may understand that you are not deprived of your deserved merit by everyone, and I, which I greatly desire, may prepare some way for future familiarity between us and at the same time present to you what I currently have. For I have been greatly delighted in Christ by your writings, especially those published on all the apostolic letters, and then also by others. However, how much I have been helped and edified by the same, I will not say, lest I seem to arrogate anything to myself or to detract from your work by commending it to divine grace. But whatever the case may be, there is something I owe you and for which I now give thanks, which I have long held and will continue to hold. Furthermore, since I do not doubt that you are most ready to show favor to anyone in Christ privately, I am content that the common bond of all Christians intercedes for me with you, and I do not care for or concern myself with the flattery of words by which men are to be won over and entreated, but as a brother, I ask brotherly that you do not hesitate, if your just and holy affairs permit, to write back to me in a few words and explain what you have written or intended to write in your commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, which book I have not yet had the chance to peruse, regarding the last chapter or the matter of the sacrament.</p>
      <p>For after some others, a great and illustrious evangelist of Swabia, who was not unaware that he favored and esteemed you and all yours greatly, almost two years ago wanted to shake me in the sacramental doctrine by your authority, as if you now thought differently about the Lord's Supper than before and thus approached very closely to Luther's opinion, especially that which now holds the name of Concord. I also send here the description of the said Concord - if it is true, because I recently managed to read and transcribe it in Moravia, which I could not previously obtain a certain description or exposition of. For moreover, one of those whose names are subscribed to this Concord told me four years ago that an example of the written Concord had been presented to the Swiss by the authors and that they had responded by letter that they rejoiced in this Concord and approved it. Whether this is so, although I am reluctant to doubt the faith of this pious and good man, and whether this present example of the promulgated opinion is true, I would also like to learn from you.</p>
      <p>Regarding John Calvin, whose "Institutio" I have as it was published in 1543, and of which I have read not cursorily nor drowsily both some chapters and indeed on the sacraments, on baptism, on the Lord's Supper, there is also something I write and inquire about, namely that there are those both in Swabia and in Moravia who wish to appear to stand firmly by your side, or to speak more truly, by the side of the orthodox, yet in the meantime they fully approve of Calvin's spirit pronouncing on the Supper and do not wish to perceive that which seems to me to be openly denied. You, I think, understand what I mean. I certainly do not believe that you would ever interpret the chapter of John 6 or teach about the true, substantial, or essential eating of the body of Christ as Calvin usually does. Therefore, so that I may be more certain of your judgment on Calvin, a great man otherwise, in this matter and not oppose your authority to others in vain, but rather have the testimony of your judgment, I ask you to write back a few things on this matter as well.</p>
      <p>There are also other things that my messenger will demand from you in my name and in the name of others. In this matter too, I hope you will not hesitate either to serve the church of Christ yourself or to encourage other brothers to such work.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Christ, who may graciously keep and increase His gifts in you, and commend me and all who hear me to Him through prayer, considering my boldness in writing to you favorably and suspecting nothing evil.</p>
      <p>Greet all your colleagues, most illustrious brothers in piety and learning, and beloved and esteemed, most dutifully in Christ for me, and commend me to them.</p>
      <p>Return the example of the Concord; for as I now give you more, so I did not have the leisure to transcribe this either. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Znaim, 18th of August, in the year etc. 45.</p>
      <p>Hastily.</p>
      <p>Leonhard Serin, preacher there.</p>
