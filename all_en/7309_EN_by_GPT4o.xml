      <p>S. We have received all your letters, most illustrious man and father, whom we all revere with singular respect, well secured.</p>
      <p>First of all, we give thanks for such great labor, which you also expend in fulfilling our desires; if only we could sometime respond to your words and writings with deeds! Certainly, nothing would be so arduous that we would not most benevolently undertake it for your sake. It would now be our turn to announce what is being written from Italy; but we have long labored to make the Italians believe that our religion is not being attacked by conspirators nor by any other enemy; so many have been driven mad by pensioners. We expect hourly if anything is brought from there; now certainly there is nothing. However, I will write what we have perceived to have been said or done elsewhere and from others.</p>
      <p>The royal envoy complains much about the Condé faction, by which he pretends to have been intercepted 3000 crowns, which he hoped to receive daily and boasts that they were sent by the king and feigns this to delay our most greedy ravens, indeed our Harpies, with this fictitious excuse and to retain them in office with vain hope. The interpreter openly complains about these things. Captain Conrad Planta returned to us this evening from France. It is said that he stayed in Zürich for a long time; surely you have learned more certain things from him, if indeed he came directly from Lyon (for he was sent there because of our Bellizarios).</p>
      <p>As soon as he came, Mr. Charles met us. He promised to tell us everything he would say, but this evening he could not yet meet. However, from the interpreter, he heard him narrate that the city of Paris is in no way besieged by the Condéans, but the royalists freely break out, roam here and there, skirmish, and prepare for battle. Much has been excellently done on both sides about making and keeping peace; however, the Condéans have so disgracefully erred against the royal majesty that, desperate and mad, they have decided to try anything rather than have peace. What is written or circulated about the sortie and incursion into the city of Paris, Mr. Friedrich von Salis will write something certain (as he thinks). From a certain principal person, he heard that the Condéans broke in and that it was not unpleasant to the king to be so seriously liberated from that maternal and Guise servitude; therefore, they greeted each other amicably. How true this is, I cannot assert.</p>
      <p>It was brought to Zürich by some that the Duke of Alba found among other evangelicals two spouses in Antwerp; whom, given the choice, he forced to the cross or the gallows, and indeed they chose the cross over other kinds of punishments, so that by that long suspension it might be evident to many that they suffer and are hanged for Christ; however, in the very sad execution, the wife gave birth to 2 infants. In the recent assembly (which I could not write about before), it was decreed and confirmed that those who departed should be punished most severely. However, especially the president of Maienfeld, who offered himself as a leader to the others, was deposed from his office and judged worthy that his wife with all his children should follow him. He was deposed from the praetorship and the account of affairs was subtracted. - In the case of the bishop, nothing has yet been done. Three more have joined the 6 arbitrators from each league, under whose auspices (relying on an odd number) the matter will be settled. They did not want to allow the Swiss to settle it; indeed, many minds have been inflamed because the Swiss have involved themselves so much in a foreign cause. Arbitrators and others from both sides gather daily in the episcopal castle, where they strive to finally put an end to this long-standing dissension. The expenses are very great; it has grown above 20,000 gold coins. There is a dispute and contention about where this sum should be paid from.</p>
      <p>Everyone thinks it should be taken from where it is found, namely from the bishopric and ecclesiastical revenues, and unless my mind deceives me, the foundation will have to suffer a crash. All the brothers there are saddened. When the bishop heard that the Swiss were omitted, he did not want to go to our court; but it was necessary to transfer the court to the castle. This is what I have at present, but I do not want to seal the letters hoping that tomorrow I will learn something from Mr. Conrad Planta, but through others and especially through Mr. Landammann Ardüser of Davos, who is also deputed to this episcopal cause.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell, most illustrious light of the whole world, November 26, 1567.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consuls (a. R.: coss.), Pontisella, Gantner, Mr. Charles especially, greet you again, etc.</p>
      <p>Your most observant of your dignity, Th[obias] Eg[linus].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered lord.</p>
