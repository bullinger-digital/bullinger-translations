      <p>Greetings. I received your latest letter, most esteemed lord, which you sent to me through Johann Dam (Palatinate), about whom I am surprised that you write nothing more than that he wishes to converse with the ministers and visit the churches, although it seems to us that he is traveling to these churches for another reason; for he carries with him a booklet in which a hundred propositions on justification are written, the aim of which is (a doctrine he also excellently supports) that nothing should be attributed to the obedience of Christ in the matter of our redemption; indeed, it was necessary for Christ to be such that he would redeem us by suffering, to fulfill the obedience of the law; but he did this indeed for us, but not on our behalf; for redemption should be attributed to his unique suffering, although we feel that Christ did everything he did for us, both in becoming obedient and in suffering.</p>
      <p>For just as through the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so through the obedience of one, many are made righteous.</p>
      <p>I am therefore surprised whether he has discussed this matter with you and whether you have seen those theses or what your judgment is on them. He says that the author of them is a certain minister in Franconia and that they are approved by Dr. Ursinus.</p>
      <p>But we suspect that they are either his or someone from Heidelberg and that he is going to Geneva for this reason, to learn Dr. Beza's judgment on these matters.</p>
      <p>We see how fertile our age is with new opinions; therefore, much caution is needed, and we fear that something similar to what happened with the Poles may creep in among the people of Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>We therefore wish to know your judgment.</p>
      <p>We acknowledge that the whole Christ is our redeemer and do not separate the passion from obedience, nor this from that, lest Christ be divided. I have nothing else to write at the moment.</p>
      <p>Nothing more is said about the covenant.</p>
      <p>We are waiting to hear what is happening in Rhaetia.</p>
      <p>Lord Steiger, MÃ¼linen and the rest, brothers and fellow ministers, father-in-law, mother, and wife send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Greet yours from me as well.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 26, 1565.</p>
      <p>You will hear about French and Genevan affairs from this illustrious Count Ulysses Martinengo. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, lord and compatriot, always to be honored by me with utmost faith.</p>
