    <p xml:id="regest1">I had nothing to write for a long time, but now Satan has sparked a new controversy: Schwenckfeld claims to Frecht that the deified humanity of Christ has nothing creaturely about it; as a creature, Christ cannot be present in the Eucharist. Zwick fears that such teachings could call forth a new Arius and further endanger the unity of the Church. Bucer is on his way to Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] and to Wittenberg. In Strasbourg, the French congregation has received a church where Calvin preaches; they also celebrate the Eucharist there and sing French psalms. Greetings. Recommendation of the letter bearer.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>For a long time, there were no topics to write about, dearest Bullinger; hence my silence until now. Indeed, there is nothing to write even now, except that Satan has now initiated a new controversy, which (as I greatly fear) might soon become widespread. For Schwenckfeld asserts against Frecht that Christ, even according to his humanity, has ceased to be a creature and that it is entirely relevant to the glory of Christ and our salvation to believe that the humanity of Christ is so completely deified that it can neither be said nor ought to be said to be a creature without blasphemy.</p>
      <p>You can easily guess what might arise from this. He also offensively provokes those who seem to affirm the presence of Christ in the cause of the Eucharist more than is reasonable. "For if," he says, "Christ is a creature, what then would the Eucharist be, and how would he be present there," as if Christ could not be present with his own from heaven, who was present with them on earth. But I have long feared that Satan might someday stir up Arius, to whom certainly the most immediate opportunity to leap into the midst of these questions will be given. May Christ restrain him with the strongest chains, so that the unity of the Church is not more and more torn apart, and that with great offense to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Bucer is visiting the Landgrave and Wittenberg; we do not know what he will do. The French congregation in Strasbourg has been given a church, where they hear sermons from Calvin four times a week, and they also celebrate the Eucharist and sing psalms in their language.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I wish Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and all good people well. November 9, 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius sends you his most earnest greetings.</p>
      <p>I commend to you and the brothers the bearer of this letter, a truly good man.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most deserving pastor of the Church of Zurich, my esteemed brother.</p>
