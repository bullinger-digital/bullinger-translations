      <p>Greetings in Christ. I wrote to you, most distinguished man and most revered father in Christ, at the beginning of September quite extensively about the entire state of our affairs. What has become of that letter, I still do not know. For it often happens in these turbulent times that letters are either innocently destroyed or lost on the way. If I learn that they have reached you safely, I will be more eager to write.</p>
      <p>Our churches at this time, by the grace of God Almighty, are at peace. The most holy one has tried, as much as he could, to stir up everything in every way. He sent to us the most meaningless bulls, by which he would deny both Queen Elizabeth the helm of the state and Christ his kingdom. I sent you a copy of them at the last fair, so that you might understand how that old and foolish man raves solemnly. All the mysteries of his plans have been so prudently revealed and skillfully refuted by those who hold the helm of our kingdom, that now they are laughed at by children. Those miserable and foolish rebels, who began to riot in the County of Durham eighteen months ago, are now exiled in Flanders, ruined in all their affairs. Our people in Leuven have not written anything for one or two years now. The Queen of Scots is kept, as you know, with us in liberal custody, honorably and with almost royal display: yet she is kept. She bears this impatiently and indignantly, and cries out that she is being wronged: for you know the Guise spirit and mind. They say the brother of the King of France is courting her for marriage. Meanwhile, Scottish affairs are in the hands of those who profess the gospel. The alliance that we once had with the people of Antwerp, violated some years ago by their injuries and treachery, cannot yet be restored. In Spain, the Moors are growing in number, strength, and victories; Philip is diminishing day by day. But what shall I tell you about Cyprus and Venetian affairs? They say the Turk now threatens Italy. At least he will curb the ferocity of the Antichrist: for the Christian princes, though warned so often, hear nothing. Our Queen Elizabeth has summoned the nobles and called a parliament for the second day of April; may it be happy and prosperous for both the church and the state! There at last, I hope, I will see your and my Parkhurst, whom I have not seen for a whole seven years.</p>
      <p>Walter Haddon, a pious and eloquent man, has passed away. Dr. Grindal of York, Sandys of London, Horn of Winchester, are far from me, each in his own watchtower. Yet they all wish you well and send their greetings.</p>
      <p>I owe my Julius 40 French crowns, namely the pension of the last two years. I have written to him once and again, to indicate to whom he wishes me to pay.</p>
      <p>The money will be ready, provided there is someone to receive it. If he writes nothing, there is no reason to accuse my faith; he does himself an injury.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most revered father and lord in Christ. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for his church for as long as possible!</p>
      <p>Salisbury, March 2, 1571.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, his most revered lord, let these be delivered.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
