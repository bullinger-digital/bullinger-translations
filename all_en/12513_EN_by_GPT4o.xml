    <p xml:id="regest1">The war preparations mentioned by Fr√∂lich in [No. 2460] of the [imperial] opponents in the [Augsburg region] are in full swing. With the arbitrary claim that it is not religion but the disobedience [of some imperial estates] that is the reason for this, they succeed in recruiting the simple-minded soldiers. The cities [of the Schmalkaldic League], especially Ulm, are preparing for an attack.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Undoubtedly, the Swabian cities will send a delegation to the Confederates. Since the formation of such a delegation could take a long time, it would be better if the Confederates immediately dispatched envoys to Regensburg to Emperor [Charles V] and King [Ferdinand] to avert the war, and at the same time sent good troops at the expense of the Protestant estates. Since the opposing side has already attracted many troops before the disclosure [of their war plans], the [Protestants] lack soldiers. In fact, it will not be about religion, but about the dominion over Germany.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Greetings to the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab] and to all scholars.</p>

      <p>Most trusted, dearest lord and brother. What I recently wrote to you about the war preparations in these lands is now fully evident in action. The adversaries are strengthening themselves with cavalry and infantry near our city, claiming that it is not due to religion but solely to punish some disobedience; through this, they motivate the common soldiers in their service. The intention and interpretation remain with them. The cities, especially Ulm, alongside Augsburg, are preparing for the present situation and are still holding themselves bravely. Thus, with God's help, we intend to withstand the assault until rescue, which must be strong, arrives.</p>

      <p>Undoubtedly, a delegation from the Swabian cities will be sent to the Confederates, but I fear the delay will cause harm. Therefore, if someone with a good heart could arrange for the Confederates to take up the matter soon, it would be most beneficial to send a delegation to the imperial and royal majesty in Regensburg to negotiate the cessation of armament, and at the same time send good troops at the expense of the common Protestant estates, the matter would be brought to a good end sooner. The opposing side has, before these things became known, gathered troops everywhere, which is why we have a great shortage of soldiers. It will be a difficult battle, and indeed not about religion, but about the domination over Germany; the other is good to note. I cannot say more at this time. Praying and calling with and for us to the Lord, the strong God, that He may protect us here in time from the power of Satan.</p>
