      <p>God with us. I thank you, dear son, and would have gladly written to you. However, Heinrich had kept a message in his house and never told me a word about it; otherwise, I would have written to you. For I recently received letters from Nuremberg and from the Confederates about many matters. But now, as I sent for Heinrich, he informs me that he cannot come, he must dispatch the men from Berg who want to leave now. Therefore, I have written you this note.</p>
      <p>God be with you. We all greet Susanna, Elisabeth. February 1st, 1571.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf in Berg.</p>
