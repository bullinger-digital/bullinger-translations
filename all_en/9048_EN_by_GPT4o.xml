      <p>S. D. I received letters from you, dear brother. In your previous letters, you excused your sudden departure; but there was no need, at least regarding the letters given to the lazy scribe; for they were delivered to me, albeit quite late.</p>
      <p>As for the letter you copied, I would not want it to be shown to everyone.</p>
      <p>The nobleman would be indignant if he knew I was sharing his letters with others; when I handed it to you, I assumed you would only record it with your own hand and not pass it on to others from your hands. But all of this is bygone and needs no excuse. In your later letters, there is nothing that requires a response, except that I ask you to diligently inquire about the truth of the prodigy you say was seen in the clouds at the beginning of the night, and to describe it to me carefully.</p>
      <p>If I had not actually thought that Mr. Ulysses Martinengo, Count, had opened to you the true history of the murder in France, which he also showed to me, I would have sent you a copy; for Mr. Keller transferred it here. When the French try to excuse the king or blame the admiral for treachery, they are spreading lies. The mentioned history clearly shows how it happened, and what treachery they committed against the poor women and children and so many innocent people, who were murdered without cause throughout all of France despite the given peace. They have shamefully murdered, and now they want to cover their murder with lies. But it cannot be covered. Innocent blood cries out to heaven.</p>
      <p>Neither Basel nor Schaffhausen will give soldiers to the king; they have forbidden it. My lords and Bern have forbidden it under penalty of life and loss of the fatherland. If the Confederates are as trustworthy as one hopes, they will not give any soldiers. If they do, then etc. And it is well for you and other preachers to admonish to sit quietly and be calm until one sees where it leads. The lords of Basel wrote to my lords these days that news came from the Netherlands that the Duke of Alba's forces were defeated before Bergen, losing 8000 men and 36 cannons, and that the prince retained the victory by God's grace.</p>
      <p>The story is lengthy, and there is no time to describe it, and today I first received it from our chief scribe. I know Dr. Stupanus is recommended to you; otherwise, I would recommend him to you. God be with you and your wife and children! They greet me, also the honorable mayor, Campell, Pontisella, etc. October 3, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, his beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
