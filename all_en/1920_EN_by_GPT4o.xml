      <p>Praise be to God, London, July 9, 1553.</p>
      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Yesterday (faithful and most dear friend), the mayor, along with some senators and certain merchants who are citizens of London, was summoned to the king's palace at Greenwich; this lies by the river Thames, and is a thousand German paces from the city. When they arrived there, in the presence of the king's most honorable counselors, the Lord Treasurer, president of the same council, made a speech to them, the conclusion of which is as follows: namely, that our most pious and indeed most holy King Edward VI (who has now departed from this world and the valley of misery, and whose earthly tabernacle has been destroyed, I do not doubt, enjoys eternal residence in the heavens) remembered that although he was a most powerful prince, he was nevertheless mortal, and for this reason, especially since he had recently been ill and sick, he was very concerned for tranquility and peace, so that this English nation might be rightly ruled and governed after his departure; and considering that both his sisters (the elder of whom, Mary, does not favor the doctrine of the immaculate gospel well) were adjudged illegitimate daughters by certain statutes, which were also made by the authority of Parliament during his father's time, being born of an illegitimate marriage; he earnestly requested his honorable counselors to agree among themselves, if the Lord should take his majesty from their midst, to admit and consider as his legitimate heir and successor the son (provided he had one while the king was still alive) of Lady Frances, now Duchess of Suffolk, who is the daughter of Lady Mary, the king's aunt, who was once Queen of the French; and afterwards Lady Jane, a truly learned and pious noblewoman, who this very year married Lord Guildford, the younger son of the Duke of Northumberland, if indeed Frances had no legitimately born male child while King Edward was still alive. He also mentioned that all the king's honorable counselors, along with almost all the nobler lords of this region, had faithfully promised by oath and by the subscription of their hand, in a certain writing concerning the same matter, to firmly bind themselves to execute and complete the matter moved by the royal majesty when he was sick.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they desired the mayor and the senators of London to be similarly conforming, and to subscribe to this writing (which they gladly did): so that, even if Almighty God, indeed because of our horrendous sins, has taken from our midst the most holy Prince Edward the King, about whom all who knew his majesty say they have never seen a more excellent or pious mind in a mortal body; yet we are not entirely devoid of His mercy, for He has now ordained such a successor to such a pious king, under whom we greatly hope (for we do not, praise be to the Lord, see the contrary) that we, his subjects, will nevertheless lead a pious and quiet life in all peace, virtue, and justice; and that the pure word of God will always be sincerely preached in this region, and that the true doctrine of the gospel will be defended to the utmost consolation of the faithful dwelling here, which may the Almighty Lord grant us. Amen.</p>
      <p>When I had written thus far, most revered in the Lord, the tenth day of July arrived, on which it was publicly proclaimed here, in the name of the aforementioned Lady Jane, now Queen of England, that the aforementioned King Edward is dead, that the mother of the aforementioned Queen Frances had no son, and therefore the rule of this kingdom has, I understand, devolved to her, Queen Jane, which may the best and greatest God turn to good. Amen.</p>
      <p>I give you great thanks for the little book which you gave me as a gift, which I received along with your letters dated March 10; and I pray to the best and greatest God, that as you pour out prayers for me in them, I may faithfully continue in faith and charity and all good works, meanwhile trampling underfoot the unjust gains and dishonest pleasures of this world. And if I can gratify you in any matter here more than in delivering your letters to others, I will faithfully and gladly devote my efforts to you, as you desire. You, for your humanity, greatly value, as I understand from your writings, that I should ensure your letters are delivered to those to whom they are addressed. But I judge it fair to expect thanks for no benefit, much less for such a small one conferred by me on you. My wife sends heartfelt greetings to you and your wife and prays for the well-being of you and all your children. You will greet your Lord Pellicanus and your son-in-law Ludwig Lavater in my name, especially Lord Theodor Bibliander, to whom you will say, I pray, that I have delivered his two little books to Lord Cheke and Lord Hoper, as he desired in his letters to me dated March.</p>
      <p>I also myself give him great thanks, that he has deigned to gratify me with such a little gift. You will also say greetings, I pray, to D. Butler, my most dear brother in Christ, and inform him, I pray, that I received his letters dated May 18 in the month of June; but I do not now have time to write a response, nor is there much need for me to reply, because what was to be answered, I wrote sufficiently copiously in my previous letters to him. Live and farewell. London, July 9, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Richard Hilles.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the divine word, let the letters be delivered.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
