    <p xml:id="regest1">Even though Bullinger is very busy, Haller feels the need to write to him, whom he reveres like a father. However, he will be brief.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Emperor [Charles V], who arrived in Donauwörth on April 6, promised the [from Augsburg] sent [former] mayors [Hans] Welser and [Jakob] Herbrot as well as other council members to come to Augsburg after the end of the [Regensburg] Imperial Diet. He is said to be very weakened by his syphilis. In his entourage, he had numerous ecclesiastical dignitaries, just like a Pope! On April 7, he had the inhabitants of Donauwörth swear an oath of loyalty.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- According to the city clerk [Georg Frölich], Strasbourg and Ulm, to the dismay of the [Augsburgers] and especially of Landgrave [Philip of Hesse], announced their intention to withdraw [from the League] during the [Schmalkaldic League] meeting in Worms. However, the dissolution of the League would inevitably mean war! Philip of Hesse and Count Palatine [Frederick II] showed perseverance at their meeting with [Charles V] in Speyer. When Philip came from there to Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg in Stuttgart, he was received with tears and honor. [Ulrich] discussed a matter with [Philip] on behalf of his son Duke Christoph.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Herbrot told Haller about his letter to Bullinger [No. 2392]. However, his desire for reconciliation between [the Confederates] and Philip [Melanchthon] is hopeless. With steadfastness, much more will be achieved than with a concord! The [Wittenberg] Concord of the fickle Bucer has only led to discord! Bucer even seeks an agreement with the Catholics. Fortunately, they did not give in, because through such a compromise [the Protestants] would fall back into the old evil.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- In Augsburg, Haller clearly feels the envy of his colleagues. They are also at odds with each other: A painful contrast to the harmony of the Zurichers!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- If Bullinger should not publish his writing "De sacramentis" contrary to the expectations of many, Haller's [copy] would be copied very frequently. In addition, a [German] translation of it is desired from Haller. However, Haller will not undertake anything without Bullinger's advice.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [Georg] Frölich, [Michael] Keller, and Haller face the opponents in unity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The fratricide [Alfonso] Diaz and [his accomplice Juan Prieto] were handed over to the regional court by the [Innsbruck] government.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Haller sends greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Rudolf] Gwalther, and the family. Bullinger can send a [letter] with the messenger [...].</p>

      <p>Greetings from the Lord. Although I do not doubt that the frequency of my letters will eventually become bothersome to you, most illustrious man, yet, because I love you sincerely as a father, I cannot help but converse with you from time to time through letters. However, so as not to cause you annoyance with my trivialities, I will henceforth write briefly on each matter. For I know how occupied you are with the affairs of the entire church.</p>

      <p>The Emperor arrived in Donauwörth on April 6, where our consuls, [Hans] Welser and [Jakob] Herbrot, along with other senators, were sent to invite him to come to Augsburg. He treated them honorably and promised to come after the Imperial Diet was concluded. They say he is very weak and afflicted with the French disease. He was followed by so many bishops and cardinals that one might have thought it was the Pope, not the Emperor. On April 7, he imposed an oath on the people of Donauwörth, saying, "as God helps us and the holy gospel." With this form, they were content and pledged their faith.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Various things are said about the Protestant assembly in Worms. I heard from the city clerk that the people of Strasbourg and Ulm do not wish to participate any longer, which causes great sorrow to our people and especially to the Landgrave. For with this alliance dissolved, they can promise themselves nothing but persecution and the gravest war. The Landgrave is very displeased with their refusal. He, along with the Count Palatine, met the Emperor in Speyer, and they conversed with him with great steadfastness. From Speyer, he went to Stuttgart to Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, by whom he was received with such honors and even tears as never before. He discussed something with him on behalf of his son, Duke Christoph.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Herbrot wrote to you, as he told me, wishing to reconcile us with Philip; but these are trifles. We see what Bucer has achieved with his concord: nothing but turmoil and dissension. Let us therefore be strong. We will achieve more with steadfastness than with any concord. That Vertumnus also tries to make some concord with the papists. But their stubborn obstinacy is most beneficial and useful to us. For if they were to yield even in one article, we would easily relapse into the old leaven.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I indeed fear nothing so much as those concords. I see so many and such great concessions made by our people that I am ashamed of such great inconstancy. The papists feel that we have begun to repent of our religion, and therefore they resist so stubbornly. May the Lord give us courage, that we may rather conquer by dying than lose the salvation and knowledge of truth we have gained by yielding. I am very disliked by my brothers. They envy the grace granted to me by the Lord, so great is the discord among them that nothing surpasses it; this is very distressing to me, when I remember how great is the concord among you, how great the candor, how unanimous the opinions. But this is the warfare in which the Lord wishes to exercise me. To him be honor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Your book on the sacraments is so desired by good friends to be published that it seems unjust if their wishes are not satisfied. Therefore, write back what you wish to do; for unless you publish it, many copies will be made from mine. I am also urged by some to translate it into the vernacular for those unskilled in the Latin language. However, I will do nothing without your advice.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Lord Laetus, Cellarius, and I are a trio so united that our adversaries can do little against us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>We have heard nothing yet about the parricide Diacęo, except that the government, as they call it, handed them over to the regional court.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>But all these things are written hastily. I pray you take them in good part. I love you so much that I can scarcely find an end to my writing. Greet the beloved fathers and lords Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalther, and especially your family. If you wish to send anything, as I requested in previous letters, you can easily do so through this messenger. Augsburg, April 14, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most revered lord and father. Zurich.</p>
