      <p> Greetings. I am very grateful to you, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, for your great diligence in trying to resolve the matter you know of. You have certainly advanced somewhat in this matter with your friendly letter; indeed, I must confess, I listened to your serious repetition with great distress, experiencing something similar, if I am not mistaken, to what we read about Peter being asked by Christ so many times if he loved him. However, I began to feel better after reading your letters. May the Lord continually nurture and preserve our mutual love; I will earnestly pray that the wishes you make for us may be fulfilled by the Lord's kindness. Be careful never to relax your zeal in commending us to your Christ, since the state of all things demands and requires nothing more than that we console and strengthen each other, and commend ourselves to the King of kings and Lord of lords with constant intercessions of holy prayers, so that He may make us equipped and invincible against the many schemes of our adversaries. The Lord now arranges everything so that the impious may fill their measure, and the hypocrites may appear as they truly are, while at the same time the sluggish and yawning children of God are spurred on, and those who are truly tested may become manifest. All these things cannot shine forth in this way in peaceful times. Let us consider it our daily struggle to prove ourselves and all that is ours to the Lord Christ and His members in the world. Farewell, my soul and esteemed brother in Christ. </p>
      <p> Biel/Bienne, 23rd September 1551. </p>
      <p> If you might be interested in knowing anything further about our affairs, you will receive in return that lively letter you gave, which will faithfully explain everything about us and how we have been with Haller and Musculus, more faithfully indeed than any paper could. </p>
      <p> Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer. </p>
      <p> I have also received those letters, which, along with another letter addressed to me, you sent to Basel to be forwarded here by Gast, and I am very grateful to you for this, as well as for the booklet on Christian sacrifices. I pray that by the Lord's grace, everything returns to you with much interest. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed friend. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
