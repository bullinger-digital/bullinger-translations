      <p>Finally, I am sending back the life and death of Musculus, enriched with these two epitaphs. However, I feel, as you do, that the extensive explanation of the mission to Eisenach and Wittenberg should be omitted. Good man Abraham does not know this story as it happened; I know it very well, as I was also called to Eisenach. But - to say in one word what the matter is - Bucer used, so to speak, a pious deception (others might speak differently), and this whole scheme was composed by Bucer. He pretended to convene Luther's assembly, but everything was done according to Bucer's plan. Therefore, they found no one in Eisenach. There he turned to new strategies: "It would indeed be disgraceful," he said, "if we returned home without greeting Luther. We would be laughed at by everyone. Therefore, since Wittenberg is not far from us, it is better to proceed there." They proceeded and came to Wittenberg. However, only Bucer with his Capito approached Luther, from whom he was received harshly, and it was almost the case that he too would have been rejected if he had not promised much. They barely managed to be admitted to the presence of the pontiff after two days. Once admitted, they were received as if they were stable boys. Among other things: "Why have you made my gospel stink with your fanaticism?" etc. Here Melanchthon and Jonas intervened: "Oh my dear doctor, do not be angry, the good people come to explain themselves and to unite with you" etc. After they had chased the Kuntz enough, Bucer proposed the difference on behalf of everyone with rather slippery expressions. Then each one explained their opinion. Some merely said: "The matter is sufficiently explained by Luther." Many, when they saw and heard this, were indignant at being deceived by Bucer's art. Finally, those articles were written. When they had come as far as Frankfurt on their return, they first made a farewell themselves, what they wanted to say at home. And it was a bold, dishonest piece by Bucer. He did more of this kind in that scheme of concord than can be believed. By this matter, I was greatly vexed and exercised, etc. But let it go with the other errors, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
