      <p>I pray with all my heart to God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ that you may be safe and happy for as long as possible. I diligently commend to you my respect, dedication, and service.</p>
      <p>I finally returned on the 7th of October, revered father, from France, which detained me longer than I had thought, but not without reason by the grace of God; for it pleased me to listen to those royal professors of Hebrew and Greek for several months, which was of no small benefit to me, and it was very useful to observe what is being done in this most famous colloquy. I had already explained to you the reason for my decision and delay in a letter when I was still in Paris; whether it has reached you, I have not yet been able to find out. I have now decided to winter in Geneva and pursue my studies with all diligence.</p>
      <p>If it will not be troublesome to you at some time and if the occasion permits, I pray that you renew that recommendation of yours, which you gave me when I departed from you to come here. For I wish to become known to these pious men of better repute, with whom I might sometimes discuss matters pertaining to the Polish churches. Whatever I may obtain from them in this regard, I will report it to you along with all our brothers. I wish to know something about your students, how they please you and your most pious wife and the whole family, whether they are modest and whether they perform their duty in their studies. I do not doubt that their father has already written to you, if there is anything of the sort, order Laurentius to write to me without delay. For I am eager to know all things, since I have received almost no letters from my homeland so far. Concerning that minister whom you were thinking of sending to Poland to accept a position, I pray, inform me of what you have decided, so that I may more easily and certainly send a response to Poland on this matter, so that if they are still of the same opinion, they may send him money for travel expenses. I suppose you are often informed by Dr. Peter Martyr about what is being done in the French colloquy, and recently Dr. Calvin said he sent you some information on this matter, therefore I do not wish to disturb you with my writings. I pray to the most good and great God that He may preserve you, most esteemed father, for a long time as a survivor and safe for the church, together with your most learned and excellent colleagues, whom I greet with all the reverence I owe and honor and venerate with all observance.</p>
      <p>Given in Geneva on the 15th of October, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Christoph Tretius, the Pole.</p>
