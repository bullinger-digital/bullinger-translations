      <p>S. D. The son of Mr. Collini returned to us safe and sound and delivered your letters to me, and with a long speech, he filled in what seemed to be missing. I, dear son, will respond to each of your letters as briefly as possible. You did well not to accept the degree. I thank both your teacher Philip and God above all, and I praise you for preferring to obey me and wait for my will rather than indulge your own judgment. I see how much you aspire to the degree, how you burn and pant for it. But listen, my son, everything must be considered here. I understand that even Philip himself is not free from suspicions, and that you will obtain it with great trouble and the greatest slanders. Therefore, I prefer that you remain quiet. You see what I have written to Philip; for I have included a copy of the letters here, with the condition that you return them through this messenger, who is now in Leipzig, or otherwise certainly and safely. The main reason that moves me is this, which I did not want to write to Philip for certain reasons. I understand that in Wittenberg, the matter of religion is mixed with the degree and that it is demanded from those being honored with the dignity of the master's degree not to dissent from the Wittenberg church and school in matters of religion, but to accept and subscribe to the Augsburg Confession in all things. But you know that Luther condemned us as heretics both in his own name and in the name of the school. Moreover, the most honorable council of this city never simply wanted to subscribe to the Augsburg Confession, especially since in the 10th article, through the apology, the substantial and corporal presence of the body of Christ is manifestly asserted, and we are not obscurely condemned there, and it is written very significantly from the beginning: "The tenth article is approved." By whom, I ask?</p>
      <p>By the Emperor and his papists. But what do they approve or commend? What we oppose in every way. You could thus be involved in troubles and prepare for yourself the greatest envy among our people with that degree, and thus imprudently sin against religion and be accused of levity, nor would I be exempted, who would have either ignored or allowed this to you. Therefore, see, my son, what you do, and refrain, withdrawing yourself from a bitter tragedy, for yourself, for me, and for all of us, especially since many hate us and everything is filled with slanderers. And indeed, I want you to retain these. I also want you, when leaving Wittenberg, to individually approach Philip, Eber, Major, Millich, and the other learned men and ask them individually for a testimony of the doctrine, studies, and life spent there with them. I will value these as much as the testimonial letters of the master's degree accepted and given by the university or school, and they will be more useful and praiseworthy to you than the degree, etc. Then, if you have entirely decided to accept the master's degree, I would sooner agree for you to receive it in Marburg, but in such a way that you do not give any indication of this in Wittenberg, but say that you are going there to hear the learned men, especially Hyperius, at some time. But why I would prefer you to receive the degree there, listen.</p>
      <p>I have understood from Mr. Sebastian Fabritius that no mention of religion is made, nor are unjust demands made, nor anything that could ever be harmful to us, and it is not required that one complete certain years, but if one is in the school with learned men for a few weeks before the time when degrees are conferred, and if one offers oneself for examination, at the cost of perhaps 10 or 12 thalers, a worthy and learned person can obtain the degree.</p>
      <p>Since it is your intention to return to your homeland in the autumn for the Frankfurt fair, you could go to Marburg around Easter to Mr. Hyperius or Mr. Hapel, who promise you all their effort (I have not written to them about the master's degree, but that you will come to them at some time). However, I would like you to also receive other commendatory letters from Philip to Hyperius and the other learned men of his school if you decide to set out. If I understand that you will go there, I will also write letters to Marburg; I will also write to the prince, which you would deliver to him, so that you may converse. If you then want to remain unmastered, I do not mind; if you want it in the manner just mentioned, I will gladly risk 12 thalers or whatever it may be on you. See now that you know something, lest you be an ass carrying mysteries; but be humble, see, and avoid pride. "God," says Peter, "resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble." You will also have fewer snares in Marburg, nor will it lack praise if you have been in two universities and have brought back good testimony from both.</p>
      <p>You have left this whole matter to me to consider; you have what I think will be useful to you and honorable to both you and me.</p>
      <p>You send the total expenses, my son, which you acknowledge were greater than they should have been. You say this easily and indeed more easily than I can pay with all my affairs in disarray, and I wonder here whether you have received the letters written in April in German and sent to Leipzig through Stekius of St. Gallen. You should have indeed indicated whether you received them, indeed say now whether you received them.</p>
      <p>I explained my affairs to them for you; I would not want them to have been lost at all. But I see that I have made little progress with you. There are, however, things that make me somewhat calmer, that you promise not to incur such great expenses in the future, that you were sick for some time, that you acquired books that are not useless to you, and that you bought a bed, which you can sell again at the same price. Therefore, I am of a calm mind; for in agreements, there is hope... But perhaps we do not agree or coincide in the calculation. This year, I have spent for you from the Frankfurt fair or from September 1555 until September of this year 1556 at the fair seventy-six gold coins; for Froschauer gave 20 gold coins last year, 5 for travel expenses, in March 25 gold coins, in last September 20 gold coins, now for the shirt I gave Brinkius a gold coin. But you write about 54 gold coins, I count 76. Therefore, I want you to start this year from the end of the debt until the departure of the bookseller to the fair and from the return of the bookseller from the fair in September and continue each item until March, when the bookseller will set out for the fair, just as you recorded on the sheet you just sent through Collini. For I approve of this diligence and require the same in other matters. Therefore, the 5 gold coins received for the journey to the mining cities will pertain to the calculation of this half-year from the September fair to March. I have not yet paid 29 gold coins to Froschauer; for I can hardly sustain such expenses; indeed, I am unable to for reasons copiously explained to you in those German letters, which I have already mentioned. See that you have your books ready, especially those you write from the mouth of your teachers, to take with you. You can deal with the booksellers sending books to Marburg and conveniently send your things with them, then you will arrange for them to be transported from Marburg to Frankfurt to Froschauer. Meanwhile, take care of your affairs. Otherwise, the transport is expensive, lest it exceed the price of what is being transported.</p>
      <p>I advise you of this in time so that you may think about these things early. Certainly, to show you that you are loved by me (for Collini gives you a good testimony; see that you surpass him, that is, show yourself greater than his testimony), I write to Mr. Sydemann [Martin Seideman]. The subject of the letter is: I beg him to receive you into his house and provide you with healthy food and educate you in letters. I hope he will not take more than half a thaler per week; you have your own bed, for the heating and other things he will deal with you fairly, I hope. Thus, I think you will enjoy better health. Thus advised Mr. Collini. If you please yourself and think it will be for your benefit, go ahead, present the letter to him; if not, tear it up. I wish Mr. Theodor Collini could live with you. You would live comfortably until March or Easter. Now pretend that you will leave then; but when that time comes, prepare yourself and see that you have testimonial letters from the learned and from Philip to Marburg, as I instructed above. Then I will also gladly write to the learned that I have a special desire for my son to be made a master there, since I have dedicated my work to the Landgrave and have always had gracious princes, etc. But I will see what happens with these when you respond to me about these things. If you further think about making excursions to some famous cities of the Baltic Sea, like Rostock to Daniel Chytraeus or other famous men, before you leave Wittenberg in the spring, I would like it to be done with minimal expense. If it is not possible, that you might join with rich people who would support you or contribute to it. For as I just said, my resources are limited, and the multitude of children prevents me from being able to sustain such expenses.</p>
      <p>Philip writes that he expects exile, and I understand that some are plotting against him. Therefore, if Philip leaves and is expelled, I want you to go directly, but conveniently and opportunely, to Marburg.</p>
      <p>However, write back to me diligently about all these things, adhering also to the traces of this my letter. Also write whether you received the gift we sent, and respond to those letters you received from the fair. I will ensure that Mr. Collini understands that we have not been and are not ungrateful to him. Stygelius has been received by Mr. Provost Haller into the provostship and will remain with us. Albert Brinkius Gellrus has left for Basel; for the number of students is so great and the crowd of the poor so large that he found no place. However, I received him kindly, consoled him, gave him a teston (a thick penny), and provided him with commendatory letters to Mr. Sulcer.</p>
      <p>For he has gone to Basel. We are all doing quite well here by God's grace; my brother, your uncle, has also somewhat recovered.</p>
      <p>Things are now peaceful, except that the French have convened a meeting of the confederates to be held in Solothurn to discuss sending 6 or 8 thousand to Piedmont or Naples; for the Pope, with the French supporting his side, has waged a serious war against Naples; however, we now hear from the Viceroy of Naples, Duke of Alba, that he is strongly attacking the Pope and has pitched his camp not far from the city of Rome and is afraid that the city might be occupied and plundered again. However, he also has enough well-equipped soldiers. What the confederates will do is uncertain.</p>
      <p>There are those who think the Swiss soldier will still set out for Piedmont this month. However, it is certain that neither our people nor the Bernese will grant their soldiers to any prince; for our people are acting according to their laws. We seek peace; may the Lord grant peace and reconcile our confederates either through discipline or by some means known to Him. For unless this is done, I do not see how that unfortunate mercenary service can have a happy outcome. Pray also to the Lord to deliver us from evil.</p>
      <p>You yourself will deliver my letters to Mr. Philip, Mr. Eber, Mr. Sydemann, and ask if they wish to write back. You will commend me to them, also to Mr. Millich and Mr. Pencer, whom you will diligently greet from me as well as the other learned men. Your mother, sisters, Christopher the baker, sons-in-law (to whom I wish you would write friendly letters sometime), and the maid Brigida and other friends greet you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 2, 1556.</p>
      <p>Our crossbow maker from Leipzig has now gone to Leipzig to fetch his manhood. I have given him this letter; he will probably arrive in Leipzig in 10 to 14 days. See that you are ready with writing, so that he brings me an answer from you and others, you finish it for Mr. Ernst Vögeli from Constance, or Mr. Valentine or Caspar Stäcken. However, I have written to Mr. Valentine Paceo and Mr. Ernst (whom Stäckh knows well) about this, that they receive the letters from this crossbow maker and send them to you and return yours to him. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Heinrich Bullinger from Zurich in Switzerland, currently residing in Wittenberg at the school in Saxony.</p>
      <p>From the great Bullinger to his son, Wittenberg. From... Hottingen.</p>
