  <input>Pacem et gratiam per Christum.

Cunctis nostris afflictionibus accedit adhuc alia omnium tristissima simul et perniciosissima; nam Oecolampadius noster, totius pietatis ac eruditionis unica columna et omnium ecclesiarum vigilantissimus pastor, mortem oppetiit 24. novembris, quem dolorem si iustis ac dignis lachrymis persequi vellem, omnes me mee deficerent vires. Sed quid aliud fidelibus aut cogitandum vel loquendum quam id lobi: «Dominus dedit, dominus abstulit, sicut domino» etc. [Hi 1,21]. Nec te latere potest piissimi et studiosissimi Hyronymi [!] nostri Potani [!] miserabilis interitus, quo factum est, ut ecclesia nostra duobus nunquam satis poenitendis, episcopo et ministro, sit orbata.

In his doloribus constituti, tui potiss[imum], eruditissime Heinrice, meminimus, ut quibus nedum tua eruditio, verumetiam et pietas, fervor spiritus, modestia ac dexteritas spectata sint; gratiss[imum]itaque nobis foret, si quamprimum advolares, ut si forte animo tuo collibitum fuerit ecclesie nostre inservire, ut coram de ea re conferre ac dispicere liceret. Ne te offendat, optime vir, nomen meum tibi fortasse incognitum aut nullius neccessitudinis [!] familiaritas; satis amici sunt et famili[a], quos Christi spiritus et eadem studia conglutinant. Hac fiducia ingenue fretus [?] inprimis ędes meas invisere poteris ac fratris hospiciolo frui; fac tamen, ut interea animum tuum cognoscamus.

Vale.

27. novembris anno 31.

Tuus Marcus Bersius, ecclesię apud Divum Leonardum minister.

Eruditione et integritate spectato viro domino Heinrico Bullingero, fratri suo dilecto etc.</input>
  <output>Peace and grace through Christ.

To all our afflictions is added yet another, most sorrowful and pernicious; for our Oecolampadius, the single pillar of piety and learning, and the most vigilant pastor of all churches, has met his death on the 24th of November; and if I were to try and follow his death with just and worthy tears, all my strength would fail me. But what else can the faithful think or speak but this: "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord" etc. [Job 1:21]. Nor can you be unaware of the sad and pitiful death of our most pious and learned Hyronymus Potanus, whereby our church has been deprived of two men, whom it will never cease to be sorry for, its bishop and its minister.

In these sorrows, we, especially you, most erudite Heinricus, remember how your erudition, but also your piety, fervor of spirit, modesty and dexterity have been admired; and it would be most welcome to us if you were to fly here soon, so that we might discuss and consider together the possibility of you serving our church. Do not take offense, best man, that my name is unknown to you or that there is no familiarity of relationship; there are enough friends and relatives that the Spirit of Christ and the same studies bind together. Leaning on this trust, you can especially visit my house and enjoy the hospitality of my brother; but in the meantime, let us know your mind.

Farewell.

27th of November, Year 31.

Your Marcus Bersius, Minister of the church at Saint Leonard.

To the erudite and honorable man, Master Heinricus Bullinger, his beloved brother etc.</output>
