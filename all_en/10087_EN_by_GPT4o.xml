      <p>Peace be with you, dearest.</p>
      <p>A dispute arises among us brothers in Basel over the matter of excommunication, which, if it continues to spread, I fear nothing good will arise in our church. You yourself know how much harm the discord among brothers, those who are in charge of the word, can cause. You know very well what good our unanimity once celebrated in Bremgarten has brought and what evils it has avoided. There is no disagreement among us about excommunication, as it should be handled in the church according to the institution of Christ. For I do not yet see how you can refute the Basel customs regarding this ecclesiastical discipline. We have seen Oecolampadius's response to the letter you once wrote to Berchthold, in which you disapprove of our custom, which he certainly refuted very learnedly and piously, although your name was not yet made public, perhaps because he hoped you would change this hasty judgment, perhaps extracted by a precocious mind. For what do we not all hope for from you, when you will have matured in pious learning and erudition, if in this your youthful age you promise us such a great and renowned example of good studies?</p>
      <p>Perhaps I have digressed too much. I say, there is no disagreement about whether those who, once they have given their name to Christ, have defiled the account of Christianity with their life and morals should be excommunicated. This is where we do not agree: there are those who want to excommunicate those who, while boasting of being Christians, nevertheless do not want to communicate with us at the Lord's table. Marcus and his followers hold this opinion. Furthermore, there are those who think that no one should be excommunicated, believing that no one should be barred from what they themselves consider themselves unworthy of. For if it is not free for each one to approach the Lord's Supper according to the guidance of their spirit, then ecclesiastical jurisdiction will be reduced to tyranny, and we will be like the Pharisees, who, with I don't know what strange flattery or persuasion, attracted outsiders to their people to make one proselyte (as the evangelist has it), who, when he was admitted to their lot, became twice as bad. This is the opinion of Grynaeus, Paulus, and myself. For I do not see how it can be happily done that a limit should be set for the Holy Spirit, by which he should raise up confessed minds, by which he should draw us to himself. I think that by the constant preaching of the Lord's words and the good fragrance of our life, it will be achieved that some ill-disposed minds will return to themselves, especially from those whom the Lord has chosen. Certainly, the contention among us is arduous. Unless the Lord guides it with his spirit, it threatens ruin, I fear, arduous.</p>
      <p>Respond to me by letter, if your occupations allow, which opinion is more in agreement with the sacred scripture. You certainly have a taste. More abundant things on this matter were not allowed due to occupation and lack of time. Otherwise, I will write more as soon as the opportunity presents itself. I do not quite like the shameless arrogance and hidden hatred of some brothers against each other. May the Lord preserve the institution of the Zurich church, whose custom is very valuable to me. May the Lord increase what he has begun. Strive, dearest brothers, to be of the same mind among all.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Do not hesitate to greet your dear wife, your parent who has deserved well of me, Leo, Erasmus, and Pellicanus in my name. Remember your Gervasius, if a more abundant opportunity presents itself.</p>
      <p>Given on the twenty-third day of January in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gervasius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the piously learned man Heinrich Bullinger, brother and especially to be respected lord. To the preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
