      <p>I wish you well in our savior Jesus, dearest Bullinger, and I pray that the coming year, as they say, the new one, will be very happy for you and your household.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, a truly and sincerely pious and elegant man, Mr. Georg Laetus, wrote to me, indicating that there is an elderly man in Augsburg, blessed with many children, who seeks a place to stay with us, completely free from any tyrannical persecution and indeed endowed with such fortunes by the Lord that he would not be a burden to anyone or forced to be ungrateful due to a lack of resources, but would easily win everyone over with a completely generous and benevolent way of life, etc. However, from his letters, I cannot clearly understand whether he seeks a residence in Zurich or St. Gallen, although I suspect that it is Laetus himself with his family who desires to obtain this condition for himself. Therefore, I would like you to inform me whether he touched upon this matter in his letters to you, for mine were brought to me along with yours, so that I can act accordingly and inform this excellent man again about what he can hope for and what he can promise himself from us. This much for now.</p>
      <p>It is still true, and our merchants have written that Prince Philippus is supposed to have arrived at Genoa on Catherine's day, and the city, for precautionary reasons, has thoroughly searched and taken into custody all sorts of practices and in all corners, and has taken him into their guard and power.</p>
      <p>This Christmas, he is supposed to hold a festival in Milan, and the plan is supposed to be that afterwards, with all the people, he will move towards Trent and through the Adige and the High German lands to the Rhine and then travel down the Rhine to his father in Brussels. New bells will be cast there. Where and over whom these will ring and sound, time will reveal. So they write, etc.</p>
      <p>From Saxony, there is news that Duke Maurice, the practiced elector, has divided and partitioned all the lands with his brother Duke Augustus. And as the Emperor's Majesty has again insisted on the matter of the Interim (the monks and priests do it), that space should be made for it, Maurice has written in response that for his person, it is not necessary to obey the Emperor's Majesty; but he does not know how to maintain it with his lands.</p>
      <p>Augustus, however, has finally promised his brother-in-law, the King of Denmark, not to accept the Interim; he is much more inclined to the evangelical truth from the heart (as they write) than Maurice.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Augsburg writes to the most prominent cities of his diocese about the weather-like and mild orders he has from the Emperor's Majesty to comply with the Interim, and wants to have it enforced immediately; he offers to appear personally and to be helpful and advise, ονοσ λυροσ. But I hear no other reason for the writing than the Pannonian script: Thus I will, thus I command, let will stand for reason.</p>
      <p>In this bastion and defense, bishops, priests, and monks remain idle in our days, as long as this war will last for them. The Bishop of Strasbourg is also supposed to insist very defiantly and contemptuously. May God grant grace on all sides.</p>
      <p>It is also certain that the Brenner (as he is called), Duke Erich of Brunswick, is very strictly insisting at the newly established chamber court of Catholic judges in Speyer against all the cities that have taken his land and directed and conquered his fortress Wolfenbüttel with the help of the captured princes of Hesse and Saxony; he demands great goods, etc. Therefore, the confederate cities are supposed to have set a certain day to appear in Speyer; on which day is not indicated in the letters. Meanwhile, the Emperor's Majesty wants to be paid immediately for the remaining penalties imposed on many cities. Whether this is the Emperor's intention or those who still have not had enough at his court is doubtful. The people of Memmingen are supposed to pay 30,000 guilders; they have already paid and laid down over 40,000. Other cities will not be spared any differently (less); and thus the heartfelt desire for the pure and unadulterated truth of our religion suffers a heavy and miserable consideration again and again. And if the matter is done rightly, then the believers should be held, and Christ has clearly indicated it, the glorious and almighty God will alone give his own grace, that they will endure to the end and thus be blessed. AMEN.</p>
      <p>Rosinus is still with us and, as I hear, writes a lot and to many. But there are those who say that, frightened by the Lucerne plague, he has decided to stay under a changed sky for a while, so that his work may not be lacking in the pontiff's affairs, full of tricks and arts, at the risk of life. They say he is a native of Zurich; I would prefer him to be a Ligurian or Tiberian.</p>
      <p>Today I have heard that a day has been set and determined for the cities of the Oberland to discuss a significant contribution to the Emperor's Majesty. The honey must be extracted from the comb, otherwise there will be no peace. Meanwhile, the Duchy of Swabia will be restored, and I wish that we are not destined for its borders and confines, as we were once, as you know, part of the Kingdom of Swabia.</p>
      <p>Farewell and consider my loyalty as good, which certainly will not hide anything from you, whom I know to be a very vigilant guardian of public safety.</p>
      <p>From St. Gallen, on the very day dedicated to the memory of Stephen, in the year 1548. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the very pious and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the president of the most memorable city of Zurich, an incomparable lord and friend.</p>
