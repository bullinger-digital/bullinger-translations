    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer sends a document [written and] shared by Bucer ["A True Report on the Colloquy at Regensburg"] about the [Second Regensburg] Religious Discussion, which Bullinger should return with the next messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Matthias Erb writes that Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg, on behalf of the Emperor [Charles V], has raised an army of 12,000 soldiers to hand over Piedmont to the young Duke [Emanuel Philibert] of Savoy. This explains why the Emperor flatters the [Zurichers] so much, namely because he knows how the other Confederates are positioned towards the Bernese in this matter. Who is behind [the imperial delegation to Zurich] is unknown.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The Imperial Diet [at Regensburg] has not yet begun. The Emperor is taking a cure in [Bad] Abbach. Blarer has heard nothing about the continuation of the Schmalkaldic League.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [P.S.:] The witch [Cecilia Erhart], about whom Blarer recently reported to Bullinger and [Jakob Ruf], was burned on May 17.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my venerable brother. I am sending here what Bucer gave us about the colloquy, which I ask you to return with the next messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>There is nothing else I can write in this short time, except that Matthias Erb writes that Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg, on behalf of the Emperor, is recruiting an army of 12,000 soldiers, and there is a persistent rumor that the young Duke of Savoy is to be restored to the Piedmontese dominion.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>If this is so, you can easily guess why the Emperor now wants to flatter you, since he is not unaware of the attitude of the other Swiss towards the Bernese in this matter. But may the Lord turn everything for the good! One cannot know in which pot or where this brew is cooking.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Imperial Diet has not yet begun, as they affirm that the Emperor is taking care of his health in Abbach. Not a word about the renewed alliance, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Always farewell, my dearest and best Bullinger, and commend us diligently to the Lord. May 19, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Amb. Bl. The witch, about whom I recently wrote to you and your surgeon, was burned three days ago with great trust in God through Christ, so that we hope for her salvation.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
