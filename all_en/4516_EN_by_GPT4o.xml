      <p>From Augsburg, October 18:</p>
      <p>A dialogue has been published in which Melanchthon is cast down to the underworld. The interlocutors are Otto Heinrich, Elector, Maurice, Elector, Albert, Margrave, and some others, who lament miserably that they have been shamefully deceived. From Basel, October 20:</p>
      <p>The people of Lucerne absolutely want a judgment to be made against Gallus on November 3 regarding profit or interest of 16 per 100, and they do not want to remit anything nor allow any delay. The unrest in France is said to be increasing daily.</p>
      <p>It is rumored that the Duke of Florence has occupied the island of Corsica. The Pope is said to be gathering soldiers and wants the provincials and guardians of the convents to prepare themselves so that if a national council in France cannot be disturbed either by itself or by the Spaniard, they will debate in it. Bollwyler wants to borrow a large sum of money somewhere to gather soldiers, perhaps to impose a garrison in Constance. From Geneva, October 14: The King of Navarre, having been summoned to the court, is now on his way, bringing his brother. The French cavalry are so arranged that they surround Navarre on all sides. The outcome is in the hand of God, who may soon scatter whatever they seem to be cunningly plotting. With one head suppressed, they promise themselves an easy victory over all.</p>
      <p>But if they attack Navarre in a hostile manner, many will, I hope, stand up for his defense. He has decided to reclaim his rights in the council, but without arms.</p>
      <p>A delegation has been sent from Spain to disrupt the national council in France.</p>
      <p>On St. Michael's Day in Marburg: "I am sending the theses of the disputation held in Heidelberg, about which you may have heard." This is from Hyperius, who otherwise writes many things to me, but nothing except what is auspicious and testifies that the matter of religion is progressing successfully. I am sending those theses; I am sending what I received from Heidelberg itself about that disputation, which you will send back to me.</p>
      <p>In the year of our Lord 1560, amidst the warlike movements.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Johannes Schmid, preacher in Chur, his kind lord. Chur.</p>
