      <p>S. The son of Leonis delivered your letters to me, a distinguished young man not unlike his father; therefore, both he and his mother have been honored by the council and treated quite honorably by their relatives. However, I had nothing to reply with, especially nothing new, except that those who have returned from Frankfurt report that the Emperor, having somewhat restored his strength, is planning to hold a diet in Augsburg on the first of June (I wish it were the Greek calends!), where he will deliberate on great matters and will not forget the Swiss, whom he will not consider as enemies unless they make themselves enemies of their own accord. Yet he will skillfully manage to restore the Duke of Savoy, so that a large part of them will be forced to be counted among the enemies, unless they yield their lands and return what they have obtained by the right of war to the undeserving tyrant. But which Canton will easily grant this glory to the Emperor?</p>
      <p>Albert Rosinus flew here to Antronium the day before yesterday and suddenly vanished to Abtzellanus, I believe, to plead with them, if I am not mistaken, that they should not fail to attend the meeting on the 14th of this month in Lucerne, where they will deliberate on sending envoys to greet the new pope; for I hear that the pope is seeking this, so that he can testify that he is loved and honored by the Swiss.</p>
      <p>However, I hear Albert publicly boasting that the pope agrees with Emperor Julius in all things, although it is certain that he agrees with no prince more than with the French, between whom and the Emperor there is an obvious enmity that will not be concealed for long. With John Leo, my dear Bullinger, I have discussed many times to remind you of the case of the young Uriel. I would like him to be provided for with the favor of your consuls and council, so that he could be established in an honorable place among the scholars for a year or two for God's sake; about which I spoke with you when I was recently in Zurich. He is the son of the late abbot of Zimmern's brother's unmarried daughter, who was married to Sebastian Appenzeller, etc., and he still has a sister in Zurich and is a very pious, poor young man, whom I have supported with respectable people for several years and brought to the point that I trust, with the help and grace of the Lord, he will become a man. I ask you to let me know without delay if the school in Zurich will be held again. Then I would write to both my gracious lords, the mayors; for the contract year ends on May Day. I will not trouble you further in this kind of request and will show myself grateful with all effort and zeal both towards you and especially towards yours.</p>
      <p>It will also be a particularly agreeable matter to my lords here, who are willing and ready to serve you. Let me know as soon as possible and may God be faithfully entrusted with this. St. Gallen, April 10, in the year of our Lord 1550.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>With the French alliance, I have had to leave some places in my opinion, and the matter has been overturned and perhaps something, I do not know what, has been ended, and yet these allies have been left standing at the gates by the PÃ¶ndten and Wallis, which has now caused bad blood. Therefore, all sorts of tensions have arisen, which could have been avoided with friendly discussion.</p>
      <p>To seem to be despised is a matter of envy. But these things are for you. To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious city of Zurich, his most esteemed friend.</p>
