      <p>Greetings to you, most esteemed and dearest friend, in abundance.</p>
      <p>I received the large book, your Isaiah, evidently explained in your homilies, along with your most welcome letter dated February 25th of the last year, from Lord John Ab[el] (who also sends you many greetings) four months ago.</p>
      <p>With this volume, you have given me a gift (as it will be, God willing) so that I may have this as a symbol of perpetual friendship from you.</p>
      <p>I also acquired Daniel with the epitome, explained in your homilies, from the aforementioned Lord John Ab[el], my dearest brother. Both books please me greatly; and I hope that those homilies of both volumes will bring not a little utility to faithful and diligent readers.</p>
      <p>As for your desire to be informed about the affairs of Brabant, and you ask me not to neglect you here, as much as I can through leisure and business; I now inform you, dearest lord, that I have already committed to writing about the same matters, as much as I myself know for certain, or could learn through friends, and have written a very brief history from it. If I can manage to have it translated into Latin (as a certain teacher, a friend of mine, promised to do), I will send it to you, or at least to Frankfurt for you, at the next Lenten fair, if God grants me to live that long. I am certainly glad that your two youngest daughters, who are of marriageable age, manage your domestic affairs so prudently and excellently that you can live comfortably as a widower.</p>
      <p>It is reported here for certain that the Duke of Alva, who has now come to Leuven or Ghent with the royal Spanish troops, and has stationed those troops there in Lower Germany and Antwerp, in the name of that royal majesty, intends to take away the liberties and privileges from all the cities of that country which admitted or freely allowed the preaching of the Protestants in the past year, and to reduce Lower Germany into a proper monarchy. May the Lord's will be done, without whose permission nothing will be done. Let us pray from the heart that He may deign to give us peace in our days: which still continues intact by God's grace here in the kingdom of England; except that some of our preachers (although not the most learned), detained by great scrupulosity, or overcome by some vain glory or applause of the crowd, sometimes disturb it, because they oppose or contradict the ordinance of the queen and the whole kingdom about wearing or carrying linen garments when psalms are sung in the church, sacred readings are read, and sacraments are administered. However, I feel with blessed Jerome, that it is not "enmity against God if a bishop, priest, and deacon, and the rest of the ecclesiastical order proceed in white garments in the administration of sacrifices." "Moreover, religion has one habit in ministry, another in common use and life: but the Egyptian priests used linen garments" (who also, as you well know, were Christians in the time of Jerome) "not only inwardly, but also outwardly." And truly, the disciples of Christ, as much as is in them, will cultivate peace with all men; nor will they be a stumbling block to unbelievers nor to the churches of God. The Lord must be prayed to, that He may make us dwell together in unity in the house of God, which is the church, and that He may remove all unnecessary contentions and all evil stumbling blocks.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you.</p>
      <p>London, August 23, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, etc.</p>
      <p>[Richard Hilles.]</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest friend, let letters be given.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
