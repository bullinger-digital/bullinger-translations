    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger's letter [not received] was very welcome, especially since Bullinger promised in it that he would take good care of the future of Lavater's studies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Strasbourg delegates mentioned in the last letter [No. 2829] to Ulm returned well and will have warmly recommended the Merciful [Emperor Charles V.] to the council, as they obtained this peace on a second embassy, which is not one! The terms of peace were kept secret from the people, as there was fear of an uprising. The peace has dire consequences for the Helvetians, which Lavater had long been aware of. The Emperor could not have wished for anything better than for the people of Strasbourg to no longer hinder him from waging war against the Helvetians and France. In Strasbourg, so many food supplies had been stockpiled for the defense of the city that now a few thousand Spaniards can be fed from it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Householder Matthias [Zell] often said that it was not enough to strengthen the city walls and set up a city garrison. But with this, the unfortunate council was able to deceive the population! Now they claim that even a most unjust peace is better than a just war! Why did they not say this from the beginning? After making Strasbourg hated by everyone, they should treat the pious differently!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] This failure is attributed to the merchants, who are distinguished not so much by their status as by their vice! Lavater never thought that there were such terrible people in Strasbourg who, with their advice, are working towards the destruction of the fatherland. Almost all councilors are corrupted by greed, including Jakob Sturm, who exposes his homeland to danger, even though he should have supported the exhausted state. Councilor Mathis Pfarrer, also a merchant, who fears for his income, remained silent in the council and did not speak out against the homage! The head of all merchants, Konrad Joham, as a councilor, always ensured that the council did not oppose the Emperor, and as a vassal of the latter, he even financed an imperial squadron! Wolfgang Rehlinger, the former mayor of Augsburg, went so far as to join the Emperor's entourage. He is probably to be thanked for the good peace terms! When the citizens heard that he had gone to the Emperor, they were very upset. But since he returned with the councilors who had been sent to the Emperor, he has been visited by merchants and nobles. What are the citizens supposed to do in the face of such indecency? Some are happy about the peace, while others are ready for the extreme. May the Lord save his church on this turbulent sea!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony is said to have recorded military successes and taken Zwickau (where Duke Maurice of Saxony had left a garrison).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Lavater knows what he has to do. As already indicated in the last letter, he will await the course of the war against the Elector and the further development with the Helvetians in Strasbourg. Should he notice that the nobles and counts who fled to the city are leaving, he will leave Strasbourg (where he would like to stay) early enough and go to Basel in the company of many citizens. Meanwhile, the council is deceiving and even claims that thanks to the homage, Strasbourg is a good refuge. But who should believe these traitors?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Lavater thanks for the transmission of his father's [Hans Rudolf] advice. He will comment on it at a better opportunity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger asked about [Beat Rudolf] Göldli. He made such progress in Strasbourg that he will probably one day be an ornament for his homeland. He finished the last school year as third in his promotion and might have been first if it did not play a decisive role in Strasbourg whether one is from Zurich, Swabia, or Strasbourg. His preceptors valued him for his diligence and good conduct. His parents want him to study law. However, he is also very attached to theological studies. The [school-issued] recommendation praises his good conduct, and during the examination in Zurich, Bullinger will be able to ascertain Göldli's progress.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] After Strasbourg, one of the strongest fortresses in Germany, has surrendered, the Helvetians will have their hands full! Yes, even Strasbourg, which was often warned by Zell, will feel the tyranny of the papacy. Meanwhile, the people of Zurich should ensure that the [Catholic] places fulfill their obligations. Lavater fears that they will pretend and prove to be timid should an attack occur. For if they were indeed confused by the Pope [Paul III.] and the Emperor and behaved quarrelsomely at the last diet in Baden, then there is surely a trick behind it! Or does Bullinger believe that they are not cunning? Everyone knows them as such! One must be particularly careful if Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, comes to the upcoming diet, that he does not outwit the participants. Now the Christians will feel the bitter hatred of Cain's followers! And if the places cannot be obliged to defend their homeland, nothing good can be expected from them. Lavater may not have been allowed to comment on this, as it falls under the jurisdiction of others. But he knows from experience that one should not believe those who promise great things, and that fathers can turn against their sons.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Bullinger will hear everything else from Beat [Göldli]. God preserve Bullinger! He should greet his family as well as Lavater's parents [Hans Rudolf and Anna, née Röichli]. Zell also sends greetings.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, reverend father, which were very welcome because they promise that you will continue to be as diligent in my affairs as you have been so far.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the state of the Strasbourg republic, here is the situation: Our delegates, whom I mentioned in my last letter as having gone to Ulm to seek peace, have returned. They have greatly commended, if it pleases the gods, that fountain of mercies to the council; as the outcome shows. For having gone a second time to the Emperor, they obtained a peace that is not a peace! The terms of which will not be easily spread among the people, to prevent public unrest. However, as I understand and my mind always foresaw, this evil will fall back on the Swiss, whose peril will have to resolve all these matters. The Emperor could wish for nothing more than that Strasbourg does not hinder his war against the Swiss and the King of France. They have provisions, which they gathered under the pretext of fortifying the city, with which they can feed several thousand Spaniards.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I now finally see what I often heard from my lord Matthias: It is useless to fortify the city, gather an army, and place a garrison in the city. For with all these, the impious council deceived the people! Moreover, they can still say excellently that even an unjust peace is to be preferred to the most just war. But how much better it would have been to say this from the beginning! After they see that they have aroused the hatred of everyone against them, they should have acted very differently with the good people.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>This entire situation is owed to the merchants and those who are not so much distinguished by their birth as by their vices! I would never have thought that such wicked people could be found in our republic, who with their advice would draw daggers against the republic, plotting the destruction of their fellow citizens and fatherland. This pains many good and outstanding men. However, there are few among the senators whom the pursuit of money has not led astray. Among them is Mr. Jakob Sturm, who, when he should have advised the weary state, exposed the fatherland to danger. Mr. Pfarrer, fearing that something might detract from his profit (for he is also a merchant), I do not know whether he suffered from συνάγχην (strangulation) or ἀργυράγχην (greed), did not want to speak sharply in the senate and oppose the shameful surrender. Conrad Joachim, the leader of the merchants, was always entirely in this, that they should not oppose the Emperor, and although he sits at the helm of the republic, he is said to have been compelled in this war, because he is the Emperor's vassal, to support several horsemen for the Emperor. Meanwhile, Rhelinger, who was consul in Augsburg in previous years, followed the Emperor; and it is undoubtedly due to his benefits that the Emperor accepted the surrender on somewhat more tolerable terms. The citizens, when they first heard that the Augsburg man had followed the Emperor, were very upset. But recently, when he returned to the city with those lords who obtained the peace, his house has been frequented by merchants and nobles. What are the remaining citizens to do when they see such indignity? It is indeed hard for them to kick against the pricks. Some rejoice that peace has been obtained, others would prefer to try any extreme. God, when we are almost submerged by the storms of the waves, help the church!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Meanwhile, it is reported that the Elector is waging war with good auspices. He has taken Zwickau, where Maurice had placed a garrison.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>What I should do is not unclear to me. I will wait, as I wrote in previous letters, for the outcome of the war against the Saxon. Then the matter of the Swiss will be addressed. Meanwhile, it is safe to stay in Strasbourg. I can seek the most certain sign of when I should leave here from the nobles and counts who wanted to use Strasbourg for defense: For some of them will also move elsewhere. Moreover, I do not doubt that many good citizens will leave for Basel. The senate dissimulates, as I hear. For they say that this surrender is not shameful and that there is also a place for refugees. But who would believe those perjured scoundrels? And although I would prefer to stay in Strasbourg until the world calms down from these disturbances, yet, since I see what the Emperor is planning and in what state our affairs are, I will move to Basel early enough.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The advice you gave me about my parent was very welcome. But I will write more about this when a better opportunity for writing arises.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>At the end of the letter, you wish to be informed in writing about how Goldli has conducted himself. You should know that this young man has made such progress in Strasbourg that there is no doubt he will one day be an ornament to his fatherland. For in the promotion made last year, he held the 3rd place, and certainly would have been worthy of the first, if it did not matter greatly whether you were born in Zurich, Swabia, or Strasbourg. However, he was dear to his teachers because of his diligence and integrity of character. His parents have destined him for the study of law. And certainly, he seems to be destined for theological study. For thus he could have been of great benefit to his fatherland; but you will understand that he is not unworthy of recommendation from his character, if you observe, and from his learning, if you take the test.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Swiss now have something to do, after this most fortified citadel of all Germany has followed the victorious arms. But it will also pay the penalty, being subjected to papal tyranny. Mr. Matthias often warned with great gravity what was to be expected, and the matter itself cries out what he has achieved. Meanwhile, you will have to work with care and effort to keep the [Catholic] places in duty. However, I fear that our [Catholic] places will dissimulate everything for the time being and, when matters need to be seriously addressed, will procrastinate. For if these things are true, that they were agitated because of the promises of the Pope and the Emperor, and that they recently sowed discord at the diet in Baden, it is certainly to be feared that a snake lies hidden in the grass. Or do you think that the plans of the [Catholic] places are free from deceit? These men are known for this! Whatever it is, deceit is hidden. Especially, however, it is to be feared if Granvelle attended these diets with malice. We certainly see in these times the implacable hatred of the Cainites against the Christians! And unless those [Catholic] places are led by public or private zeal to defend the fatherland, nothing good can come from them. But perhaps these matters do not concern me. Others should be concerned with these affairs. I have learned in many things what is to be believed from those who promise splendid things, and what is. There will be a father against a son, etc.</p>

      <p>These are the things I thought should be written to you at this time. You will receive the rest from Beat. May God deign to keep you safe for us for a long time! Do not hesitate to convey my many greetings to your parents and your family. Mr. Matthias wishes you well. In Strasbourg, the day before the calends of April in the year 1547. Yours sincerely, Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed father. In Zurich.</p>
