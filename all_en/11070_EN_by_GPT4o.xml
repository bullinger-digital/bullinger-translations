    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Vadian's letter through [Christian] Fridbolt. Hopes that the Saxon conflict, which could engulf all of Germany, will be resolved by [Landgrave Philipp] of Hesse or another. Would like to see the mentioned agreement between Melanchthon and Bucer; heard of Bucer's harmful activities regarding the image question in Augsburg. Knows nothing yet about the Lucerne [Diet], as he has not yet seen the Zurich envoy [Hans Rudolf Lavater]. Asks for faithful solidarity. Best wishes, also to Dominik [Zili] and [Valentin] Furtmüller. Greetings from Leo [Jud], [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], and others.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. Fridbolt here has delivered your letters to me with the utmost fidelity. They were, as all your letters, very pleasing to me; however, they have made me sad, as I now see what evil is likely to arise from the Saxon war. It will certainly involve and embroil all of Germany. Surely, our morals deserve this. Meanwhile, I implore the Lord's grace, that either through Hesse or another strong and religious man, this war may be settled, unless perhaps the Divine Majesty has decided to once and for all remove those disastrous bishops from the midst of the church, without whom I do not know if the church can be safe. If in the meantime you have received anything about the agreement you mentioned in your last letters, written by Melanchthon and Bucer, I beg to see it, since a certain good man has reported to me some unfortunate things about Bucer's actions in Augsburg regarding the matter of idols, etc. At present, I cannot report anything certain from Lucerne; for I have not yet seen our envoy. But if I learn anything that would be beneficial for you to know, you will be informed. Continue, as you do, to love me and write very frequently. Farewell together with all yours, with Dominik and Furtmüller and the others. Leo, Pellikan, Theodor, and the rest wish you well. August 5, 1537.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen</p>
