      <p>To the good and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, his especially dear patron, Johannes von Ulm sends greetings. If you are well, it is good; I am indeed well. I wrote to you recently about Alexander Schmuz, as diligently as I could, not because I doubted your memory and constancy, for I knew how you served your gravity and were least forgetful in the affairs of friends; but it was then given to Alexander by me, who had urged us to commend him to you most carefully: however, what I now write to you again on the same matter, I do of my own accord, as I wish to encourage you who are already running, and I see in what troubles he lies, and I draw such pain from it as I can hardly bear in my mind. Here indeed I lack words with which to commend him to you; for whatever can be said by me, I said it when I wrote about this matter twice already. What then? Let it suffice for the present to have said this one thing, that you are now the only one in whom all hope of maintaining that leisure is placed; which hope may not deceive him, I earnestly and repeatedly ask you for your zeal in the members of Christ. I think the way and hope of completing the business was shown clearly enough in previous letters. For whether you write to Henry Grey, Marquess of Dorset, or to John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, I am certain that the matter will succeed according to your wish, that is, excellently: but if you have found another plan, you can certainly use it for me; this is my present one and not devoid of great hope, but I leave this to your prudence. Oh Lord God, if you knew and saw what great hope this young boy is, it should indeed concern you heartily, that you should extend your cousinly help for so long and might be of use and good to him with less effort in the greatest and most necessary matter. I confess indeed that it is not wise to affirm anything about the will of another, especially a person still a boy, who cannot be guaranteed what he will become; but however, as I am in judgment of discerning people and choosing friends, I pledge to you that this young man will not only sustain the favor of his friends, and already uphold duties, but also repay and illuminate benefits. Therefore, if you love us, or rather as much as you love Christ himself, apply yourself to this matter, and make sure that we soon understand something has been accomplished by you according to our wish; whether it be to the Marquess of Dorset or to the Earl of Warwick. For know this about this matter: I am not as much in suspense about any other expectation at this time as about that of which we have already written to you three or four times. But enough of this.</p>
      <p>Nothing new occurs to me now to write to you. The council is not yet concluded.</p>
      <p>There are indeed those who suspect that the matter between the English and the French will be settled. I think nothing of it; but if it happens, I will say it happened beyond expectation: but you know this better, and rather best of all. As for my mutual love towards you, or rather respect, there is nothing that I should write to you here in more words. For I would be altogether unworthy and plainly inhuman of those letters and studies to which I have dedicated myself since childhood, if I did not respond to you in this, but also satisfy you abundantly; which although I see how difficult it is, I nevertheless trust that I will accomplish it in the end. Make sure you love me, as you have begun, and be well. Dr. Peter Martyr wanted me to convey his greetings to you here. Given in Oxford, the day before the calends of February, 1550.</p>
      <p>To the most pious, learned, and erudite lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the citizens of Zurich. Zurich.</p>
