      <p>Greetings. From the most distinguished men sent by our republic to Baden, I received your two letters, dear brother, and I have nothing to write back to you now. Eight days ago, I did not send you anything because, apart from what I had previously and lastly written, nothing new had been brought up, and not even now. The king's envoy, Bellevre, indeed wrote many things about the battle and the captivity, wounds, and death of the admiral; but now I hear that all those things are false and that he himself, not being correctly informed by letters, gave uncertain things as certain. It is said that the admiral is alive, neither captured nor wounded, which you have undoubtedly already heard from Pellican and Lumaga, who are coming directly from Lyon. But it is also reported from elsewhere that the matter was conducted and is held in France far differently than is being spread. However, I will not tell you anything certain yet because of the varying and contradictory reports, and I have not yet received any letters from Bern, Biel, Neuch√¢tel, or Geneva. When something is announced, I will share it with you, and I indeed fear that too much blood has been shed on both sides, yet I cannot believe that the matter has been conducted entirely as Bellevre narrates, since the narrative itself contradicts itself in places and strongly reeks of the bias of the opposing party, which is not surprising, and it does not have anything moderate; for they exaggerate everything, and make an eagle out of a fly, as is their custom. May the Lord kindly settle this mournful war and grant peace to His people through His ineffable mercy and keep us from evil. While I write this at 9 in the morning, nothing has yet been brought from Baden. The day before, the consul announced that nothing certain had been brought about the battle, which many interpret as the matter being conducted differently than has been announced so far, otherwise it would have been written long ago.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I hear that Bellevre has received letters from the court after the news that I said the consul had made. We are therefore waiting to see what he will bring forth again. But what can you believe from someone who deceives so often?</p>
      <p>Farewell. May the Lord strengthen us in truth and deliver us from evil! Greet the consuls, Karl, Bonett, Pontisella, Ganthner, and especially Ruinella and other friends along with your household.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in haste, on the feast of Simon and Jude, 1569. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
