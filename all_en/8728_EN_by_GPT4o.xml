      <p>Honorable, well-learned, wise lord, my friendly greetings and willing service to you beforehand. Since I recently received a report from the honorable Lord Josias Simler, informing me that some fragments of Phlegon of Tralles have been published, I have asked him to help me obtain them for money. As a result, I received a letter yesterday from the aforementioned Lord Simler along with a booklet, in which the aforementioned fragments of Phlegon, as well as some other authors, are included; he writes to me that your honor has gifted me with the now-mentioned book. For this, I express my diligent thanks to you; as this gift has particularly pleased me. If I could in return show you any recompense or otherwise love and service, I would not hesitate. May God the Lord preserve you for a long time.</p>
      <p>Dated Glarus, December 18, 1571. Your willing servant Gilg Tschudi of Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned, and wise master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zürich, my gracious lord.</p>
      <p>D. Ägidius Tschudi 1571. He died at the end of February 1572.</p>
