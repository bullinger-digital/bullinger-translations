      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have nothing to write now, except that I am eagerly awaiting your most delightful letters and that I hear the Schmalkaldic League meeting has concluded and everything there has succeeded according to wishes. However, I do not know what was done, except that I hear everything has succeeded most happily. If you have any certain information, let me know. The people of Basel have sent a copy of a letter from Dr. Luther, written to Jakob Meyer (the Mayor), of which I am sending you a copy here; but on the condition that you return it along with those which I sent you earlier. Farewell. March 21, in the year 1537. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Joachim Vadian (von Watt), his most esteemed lord.</p>
