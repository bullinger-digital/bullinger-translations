      <p>Grace from God. I have nothing else to write to you at this time, except that today the matter was before the council and citizens; it is a unanimous decision by God's grace that we will not separate from Zürich. It has therefore been decided that we, along with you, will send envoys to the Seven Places, as you will understand from my lords' writings. There was indeed a discussion about not separating from Basel, but it was only proposed by one man; it did not gain any followers. I feel nothing from God's grace but loyalty and honesty. As soon as I received your letter, I went to Mr. Schultheiß Nägeli, Imm Hag, treasurer, etc., and found everyone upright and well-meaning.</p>
      <p>Today and yesterday we had examinations. Farellus is here; he has been accused of some misconduct regarding the sacrament; he wants to clear himself before my lords. Also here are Mr. Michel and Mr. Jacob from Biel; they all send you their warmest greetings along with young master Nicklaus von Witenbach, Mr. Josen, Mr. Hansen, Eberhart, and Niklaus, also from my lord treasurer and standard-bearer Imm Hag.</p>
      <p>Dated December 28, 1548. Bern.</p>
      <p>Yours, Haller.</p>
      <p>Regarding Blarer, I ask you to ensure that we finally know where we stand. I have no news from Xystus either.</p>
      <p>Musculus' matter depends solely on Blarer. You wish me and your people, along with Musculus, a blessed year.</p>
      <p>To his beloved lord and godfather Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the church in Zürich.</p>
