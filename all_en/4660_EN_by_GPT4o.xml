      <p>S. It seemed strange to me that you made no mention in your letter written on February 3rd of those things I had previously written about, which I had learned from the Bishop of Rennes, that the Emperor did not want the bull of indulgences or jubilee to be published, because it makes too explicit a mention of continuation. But in another, these things are added "we declare, with all suspension removed["?].</p>
      <p>But from other letters written to me from Germany and Austria, I see that there are none who approve of the plan, neither Catholics nor Protestants, indeed those who do not want to step out of their homes if the council is celebrated against the will of their neighbors. At the Diet of Nuremberg, there are now two nuncios of the Pope and three envoys of the Emperor; we are waiting to see what they will accomplish. I suspect the nuncios will achieve nothing and will depart with the matter unresolved. The three envoys might be able to agree on some diet in which the council will be discussed.</p>
      <p>From France, I have nothing but good hopes.</p>
      <p>I recently sent you a bundle of letters from Gech, yesterday I received a larger one, which I now send. From it, I would gladly have the booklet titled "Copy of the Letters of the Church of Z체rich to the Poles." The envoy of Savoy was here for five to six days, he went to Neuch창tel, from which I have not yet learned anything. Greet the most honorable council and our mutual friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, February 11th.</p>
      <p>Yours, as you know.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Z체rich.</p>
      <p>Z체rich.</p>
