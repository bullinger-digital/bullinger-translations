    <p xml:id="regest1">The alleged plan of the Pope to capture the Emperor amused him. He once saw the Confession of Strasbourg [the Confessio Tetrapolitana], but has never heard of Bucer's Apology [of the Confession]; none of these writings can be found in Basel. He cannot write more at the moment. Some booksellers have suffered shipwreck. Grynaeus has taken over the professorship for the New Testament as his successor.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I laughed enough because you write about the chains prepared by the Pope for the Emperor. I fear that such a noble deed might be true.</p>
      <p>I once saw the Confession of the people of Strasbourg, but I have never heard a word about the Apology. In Basel, there is neither a confession nor an apology.</p>
      <p>That I write both more rarely and more briefly, I ask you not to be moved. At this time, I am not able to do otherwise. It will be given that I may make up for everything.</p>
      <p>Some booksellers have suffered a shipwreck near Strasbourg. They say it is serious, but it is not yet known to whom this misfortune has happened.</p>
      <p>Grynaeus has become a theologian and succeeded me in lecturing on the New Testament.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, Basel, April 7, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
