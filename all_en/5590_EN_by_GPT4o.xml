      <p>Greetings. I have received all your letters, reverend father in Christ, and I easily recognize that you find it difficult to satisfy everyone; I know what happens to me, who do not bear a tenth of your labors.</p>
      <p>I copied yesterday evening and sent, with the name suppressed so that others might read it, to our consuls, who are the Ilanzers in the assembly (daa besetzt man die Ã¤mpter). A certain person came from Milan, who claims that meanwhile in Milan a sign of joy was given with cannons; but this is done at the instigation of the priests and the council, to raise their hopes and keep them in duty.</p>
      <p>The same is said to have been done by the people of Constance, undoubtedly in favor of the cardinal.</p>
      <p>I am sending the speech of Cardinal Lorraine, which I would have gladly had before but could not obtain until now; if you do not have it already, it will not be unwelcome.</p>
      <p>I am sending the decrees of the sixth session; if you have them, I will send these back, if you do not have them, keep them.</p>
      <p>I could not learn more, except that those who come from there affirm that all of Trent is defiled with debauchery and lust, and the bodies of the slain are found in the streets every morning.</p>
      <p>We are continually expecting more certain news from France.</p>
      <p>Yesterday two came from Genoa, who affirm that the English are advancing as far as Paris and that the army of the Queen of Navarre is stationed to prevent the Spaniards, should they attempt to come anew; likewise, a Turkish delegation of about sixty men arrived in Genoa under their observation and then proceeded to France. If the burden of copying tires you, give part of the work to my relatives.</p>
      <p>But where is our Beza, is he alive, or is there no letter from him? Whatever has been done, wherever victory may fall, certainly one Guise remains on the other side, whom God undoubtedly reserves for greater mockeries of fortune.</p>
      <p>Yet you will consider with your own eyes and see the retribution of sins.</p>
      <p>We will live and proclaim the works of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>I pray to God that He may preserve you safe for us and the church for a long time.</p>
      <p>Chur, January 18, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your most observant.</p>
      <p>What I write about my own business, keep to yourself and... lest it accidentally gets out. Perhaps I will come to you, if only I can and my personal and ecclesiastical affairs do not hinder me, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
