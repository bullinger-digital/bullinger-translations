      <p>S. P. D. I have not yet received any letters from you, doubting that you have not received mine; for I am held by a burning desire for your letters. My dearest father has placed me together with my cousin in the college of Prélès with a learned and erudite teacher, whom I believe will not fail in his efforts to educate us, and I will not lack the spirit, and I believe I will spend my time so well that I will fulfill my duty to you satisfactorily.</p>
      <p>Moreover, if you wish to know about our health, know that I am enjoying good health, which I wish you may also enjoy.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new now to write or send to you; but at another time, when I have more leisure, I will write to you more extensively.</p>
      <p>Thus, I will end my letter.</p>
      <p>I ask you to greet, in my name, Veritas and Dorothea and all our most familiar acquaintances whom you know. All my dearest parents and Stuckius send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, who may always keep you safe. Given in the study on the fourth day before the Nones of December 1565.</p>
      <p>Your always most beloved and always most obedient son Matthieu Coignet.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, father, most vigilant of the church of Zurich, to be greatly respected. In Zurich.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
