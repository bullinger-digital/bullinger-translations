      <p>Greetings in the Lord. The books you requested will soon be delivered along with other newly published booklets. Here is a brief account of the news from our side: Lord von Heideck recently departed secretly by ship to the people of Magdeburg; for he was summoned by them. He will stir up a tragedy and either end the war or bring great harm to the maritime cities. The Bishop of Magdeburg, who is from Brunswick, is attempting to cause trouble for them by gathering a band of soldiers. However, we will hear more about this soon; for the maritime cities are holding a convention to establish a new alliance against certain bishops and pseudo-evangelical princes. What do you say to this? The Spett, who was outlawed by the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, you know the reason, has obtained from the Emperor that Duke Ulrich must return his land to him, reinstate him as before, and forgive everything. This, the Duke is said to have agreed to. This Spett came riding with 35 horses, well-armed, and between Grimingen and Asperg, he was burned from the sky with a fiery drum along with his horse. Nothing happened to the servants, so they withdrew again.</p>
      <p>No damage was found on his body or his horse. So the rumor goes.</p>
      <p>Also, the people of Breisach and Freiburg have agreed to hunt down the murderers, as many people have been lost in the forest; for they have a forest that borders another. On one day, both cities went out with dogs, searched the forest, and found 13 bodies dead, some completely decomposed, some still fresh, recently murdered, and captured 3 murderers in the forest. A large number of robbers hide in these regions; they cannot or do not want to work.</p>
      <p>From Leipzig: Lazarus von Schwendi is with us, sent by the Emperor to our prince. Now he is staying in Torgau; what he is consulting there with his advisors, we will soon find out, and from early morning until evening, councils are being held. Theologians are in disagreement among themselves, and various pamphlets are being spread. The people of Magdeburg have plundered and burned three towns of Prince Joachim. War is escalating in the Saxon cities.</p>
      <p>Farewell. More soon. August 17th.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius. Dr. Lelio will be a living letter about our affairs.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest teacher. Zurich.</p>
