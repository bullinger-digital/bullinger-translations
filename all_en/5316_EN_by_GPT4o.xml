      <p>I have received all your things in good faith (reverend father in Christ) and I confess that I owe you as much as I do to no other mortal at present. When I read your letter, that saying of the psalmist came to mind: "But you will look with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked." I send back the rest; I have kept a single copy, which I do not think I have done against your will, so that I can more easily send it to the brothers and share the common joy with them. What you command will be my care and concern; I will certainly not neglect any effort and diligence, I will write to Klosters, in Engadin and Valtellina.</p>
      <p>Here too, I will take care to inquire through others not suspected by the papists. Now there is plainly nothing new.</p>
      <p>I am occupied with writing a speech, in which I intend to give an account of why the Council of Trent cannot be attended by Christians without sin. I know that I am bringing no new arguments, but I believe that the Roman tyranny must be attacked with common forces. If it can be done (I hope, however, that it can be done) among my other occupations, I will complete it, so that in the next synod I may discuss it with the brothers.</p>
      <p>Please, continue to inform us about the affairs of France with your unique kindness towards us. You deserve well of our churches, which are greatly helped by the knowledge of these matters. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all your people, as happily and for as long as possible. Chur, May 11, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man of singular learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and patron.</p>
