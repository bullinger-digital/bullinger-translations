    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger longed for a letter from Blarer, and behold, he was delighted with two letters [not received]! Praise be to God that He still stands by His own, even when He frightens them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In the matter concerning Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz, Bullinger fears having angered the Richmut family. For they now presumably suspect that Bullinger is responsible for their [castle] Dübelstein not being purchased. The family heard from others that he knew about the deal. They even wanted to know from him why the purchase did not happen. He replied that he knows nothing about it; that Blarer had indeed inquired [about the castle]; that he responded, but does not take on the deal, as he does not know Schankwitz and Schankwitz has not written to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Hans Schöner was absent for a few days. He is said to have gone to Strasbourg when he heard of the death of his [resident] wife [Dietburg, née Schellenberger]. Thus, Blarer's letter to Schöner was entrusted to his house steward [...]. Bullinger is willing to help Schöner and to advocate for him in Augsburg according to Blarer's instructions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] He is also pleased to hear that Georg Frölich is doing well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger does not know under what conditions Strasbourg reconciled with the Emperor. However, he knows that an understanding was reached, which is presumably as deceptive as in the case of the other cities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] May God grant that the Emperor is caught between the Saxons and the Bohemians and properly beaten!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Blarer should continue to convey news. If Sultan Suleiman recognizes the situation, he will be able to advance his cause well this year. May God strengthen Landgrave Philipp of Hesse, and may Blarer soon share joyful news!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The people of Constance should remain steadfast. Even if there were increased Swabian Leagues [among the enemies], they would be of no use to them because God is kept away from it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The day in Baden [on March 28] was not as bad as claimed. Zurich and the Confederates hold together well. The Seven Places have sought a settlement in the dispute triggered by [Rudolf Gwalther's] booklet ["Endtchrist"]. The ambassador of France [Guillaume Du Plessis, sieur de Lyancourt] did not behave impossibly, especially since he can assume that he will receive the number of mercenaries claimed. On April 17, there will be a day in Solothurn, where France will also pay the [1516 agreed] peace money [to the Thirteen Places]. Details of the past diet can be immediately taken by the people of Constance from Bullinger's notes on the diet for Joachim Vadian from St. Gallen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] On March 31, the old King Francis I died. Thus, the [planned] campaign [of France against the Emperor] is unlikely to happen, as the Emperor will probably come to an understanding with the young successor [Henry II]. In any case, with Francis I, an evil man has died! If only the Confederates would desist from the princes and the petty nobility! May God free them from greed and the bloody business associated with it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] On the evening before, a letter from Lucerne by Renward Göldli arrived in Zurich, according to which a great campaign [of France] is still to happen, as Henry II is allegedly bringing a lot of money for the recruitment of mercenaries by Lyancourt through Antoine Morelet du Museau.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] There is no reason to pity Duke Ulrich of Württemberg! He should have behaved differently.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Greetings to the family, the councilors, and the friends.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I longed greatly for your letter; and I am delighted once again! Praise be to God, that He still provides some help to His own (though with fear). Let us earnestly pray that He may be our God.</p>

      <p>Regarding Marcell, the matter is very disagreeable to me because I must fear that I have incurred great displeasure from the family (relatives) of Dübelstein. For they might suspect that I am to blame for the castle not being purchased. Without my saying, they knew that something reached me. They also sent to me and asked how the matter stood, what it was stuck on. I replied that I knew nothing about it; Mr. Ambrosius had asked me about something; therefore, I had given an answer; I did not involve myself further in the matter; I did not know Marcell; he had not written to me, etc.</p>

      <p>Schöner has not been here for several days. I understand he is in Strasbourg, having learned of his wife's death. I have given your letter to his host, so that he will receive it when he returns. I am also willing to comfort and help (as you suggest, to address it, and as you indicate to me), to act in Augsburg.</p>

      <p>If Laetus is doing well, it is a great joy for me. May God preserve him!</p>

      <p>I do not know how Strasbourg was reconciled. But I do know that it was reconciled! It is likely, as with other cities, false and deceitful, etc.</p>

      <p>May God grant (if it is not against His will!), that the Emperor comes between the Saxons and Bohemians and is truly defeated!</p>

      <p>Do well and write at all times how things are shaping up. The Turk (if he is wise) will manage his affairs well. May God grant grace to the Landgrave, and that you may soon write to me joyful news of the Lord's wonderful providence!</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>May you in Constance remain constant at all times! May God be your strength and grace! Even if they are forming many Swabian Leagues, the nexus (contract) is not with God. It is now harmful to them!</p>

      <p>On the day in Baden, it did not go as badly as the rumors. Zurich and all the Confederates are well united. The Seven Places have intervened and made a settlement regarding the booklet. The French envoy did not act so arrogantly. He will not dare, for he will receive mercenaries, and as many as he wants. On April 17, there will be a day in Solothurn. There he will pay the peace money, etc. You will have all this more completely from St. Gallen, as I have sent the summary of the acts of the Baden diet to Vadian with the agreements, so that he may also share them with you promptly.</p>

      <p>On the last day of March, the king in France, Francis the old, died. Therefore, we think there will be no campaign now; the Emperor will come to terms with the young king. Yet I cannot know how it will go. Nothing good has died! May Almighty God grant that we Confederates desist from the princes and lords as my lords! But it is perhaps not in our fortune. May God help us and deliver us from greed and the bloody ensuing dealings!</p>

      <p>Last night, Renward Göldlin wrote from Lucerne: A great campaign by the Confederates is to happen; for the young king sends Morlet to Lord Leoncourt with much money to arrange the Confederates, etc. We will see how it goes.</p>
