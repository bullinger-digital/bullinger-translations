      <p>The fact itself shows, most illustrious man, that you have labored much for our Gideon. In return, you will find us grateful and mindful. I add this: we will not trouble you beyond this year, since from the death of his brother, a little has been added to the matter, so that he can almost be sustained from his own resources. Scipio Lentulus finally sent those 2 crowns, which I have enclosed with this letter, and I also send you the letters addressed to you. We have no news, and everything with us is quite well; praise to the most gracious God. May the Lord God deign to keep you safe for us for a very long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me and my son in your commendation. Please convey my greetings to the most illustrious man, Lord Gwalther, Lord Ludwig Lavater, as well as to your sons and other relatives, most learned men.</p>
      <p>Chur, 14th of September, in the year 1567. Johannes Pontisella, your most devoted and respectful.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
