      <p>To the Honorable Martin Borrhaus, Greetings.</p>
      <p>I am indeed responding rather late to your letters, most illustrious man, most esteemed lord, and dearest brother; but for some time I had decided not to write anything, as a response did not seem to be particularly necessary. However, so as not to appear ungrateful or to seem to make little of your efforts, I wanted to send you these few words and first of all to thank you for your labors and the kindness with which you have diligently and abundantly responded to my letters. You explain two main points in your letters: namely, by what reasoning you call the sacraments signs of the present, not of the absent, and then you show that the heaven in which Christ dwells is not a material but a spiritual throne. As for the former, you clearly express your belief that Christ is present with the spiritual nourishment of his flesh and blood, and that his flesh and blood benefit us through the spirit for the completion of all salvation, without which nothing is beneficial, etc. However, I do not think you mean that the body of Christ is present spiritually, as if it truly moves among us in its own substance and is present. For it is the opinion that the Lord's body, apprehended by faith, is spiritually present to us because it quickens us with its spirit and grace and enriches us with heavenly and spiritual gifts. Hence, I gather that you do not disagree with the doctrine of the most holy men who have taught that Christ, residing bodily in heavenly glory, is spiritually present to his faithful, whom he spiritually nourishes and satisfies with his body and blood, who also truly participate in and enjoy Christ by their faith. For you add that you do not teach that the impious or those lacking faith truly partake of Christ except in a sacramental rite, which Saint Augustine in his book "The City of God" (Book 21, Chapter 25) called eating sacramentally, leaving the symbol to them without the reality itself. You further add that you wished to serve the mending of concord.</p>
      <p>Would that it could be mended in Christ with as much ease as it is desired by all good people. Regarding the latter point, you discuss heaven somewhat more extensively.</p>
      <p>You exclude the throne of God and the right hand of the Father from every place and extend them through all things, because the throne of the Messiah's empire pertains to all things, with Christ himself affirming and saying: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me," etc. "Hence no one should say," you assert, "that the throne of Christ is confined by any boundaries or spaces, but that it is the seat of power and administration, by which Christ, reigning over all things contained in heaven and on earth, wisely administers all things." I willingly acknowledge the power of God the Father, as well as the Son, who is consubstantial with the Father in all things, to be immense, and the kingdom to be of all ages, and that he is the emperor of heaven and earth and of all things, and thus the right hand of the Father is frequently called in the scriptures the immense power of God, not limited by any boundaries. Meanwhile, it is undoubtedly true that the same right hand of God is sometimes and often used in another sense, which will be discussed shortly. Again, when you continue the discussion about the heaven in which Christ, God and man, dwells, you remember the material and, as you say, visible heaven, from which the birds of heaven are named and from which light is sent down to us and rains fall. But in this: you deny that Christ ascended into this heaven, you deny that this is the seat of the blessed, and indeed, you add that there must be another incorruptible and spiritual heaven, in which the pious lay up their incorruptible and eternal treasures. Of this you profess to hold the same opinion as of the right hand of the Father, namely, that this heaven is not visible, material, measured by place or time, but a heaven illustrious with the splendor of divinity, which extends as far and wide as the glory of the Father and the Son extends, and thus is not remote from us, but present. Where I willingly acknowledge that scripture remembers the heavens as aging and to be renewed. To which those testimonies pertain: "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away," and again: "The heavens will perish, but God remains, and all will grow old like a garment and will be changed like a cloak." Likewise: "The heavens will pass away like a storm, and the elements will melt with fervent heat." Finally, I know that scripture remembers the heavens and that the apostle Paul testified that the Lord Jesus ascended above all heavens, namely, that he did not remain in those spheres and lower heavens, as the Seleucians or Hermians once foolishly thought that Christ had placed his body in the sphere of the sun or in the sun itself; yet again I know that the body of the Lord Jesus Christ, although it ascended above all heavens, was not lifted beyond and outside all heaven, but was received into the highest heaven and thus into the heaven of heavens, and in this way, as the apostle says, made higher than the heavens, sat down in the heights at the right hand of the Father. For Saint Peter said that Christ must be contained in heaven or that heaven must receive him until the times of the restitution of all things. And who would not acknowledge that this heaven differs greatly from the lower ones, as it is illustrious with the light and glory of God, subject to no vicissitudes, but entirely such as John describes in many places at the end of the Revelation of Jesus Christ. Of this same heaven, apostolic truth elsewhere pronounces thus: "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." To which the opinion of Saint Augustine, cited by you from the book "On the Lord's Sermon on the Mount," beautifully agrees, explaining those words of the Lord: "Our reward is great in the heavens," and saying: "I do not think that here the heavens mean the upper parts of the visible world; for our reward, which ought to be unshaken and eternal, is not to be placed in things that are changeable and temporal, but I think it is said to be in the heavens, in spiritual firmaments, where eternal justice dwells," etc. Yet the same Augustine, who here calls the heavens spiritual firmaments, elsewhere speaks of heaven, the seat of Christ, and the right hand of the Father as a place of blessedness, so that it appears that Augustine did not entirely strip that heaven, the eternal homeland of the blessed, of all place or circumscription. For to Durdanus he says: "One person is God and man, and both are one Christ Jesus, everywhere by what he is God, but in heaven by what he is man," and again to the same: "Do not doubt that Christ our Lord, the only-begotten Son of God, equal to the Father and the same Son of Man, by whom the Father is greater, is present everywhere as God and in the same temple of God as God inhabits, and in some place of heaven because of the true mode of his body." Again, in "On the Christian Struggle": "The right hand of the Father," he says, "is perpetual blessedness, which is given to the saints, just as his left hand is most rightly called perpetual misery, which is given to the impious, because the body of Christ, which is the church, will be in the same right hand, that is, in blessedness, as the apostle says: 'For he has raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly places,'" etc. And since the resurrection of our bodies is truly to come, they certainly cannot be removed from place unless we wish to think them reduced to nothing. For Augustine also says: "Take away the spaces of places from bodies; they will be nowhere, and because they will be nowhere, they will not be." The Greeks have not disagreed with these things. For Cyril in his book "On the Trinity" (Book 2) says: "If the divine nature were a body, it would be in place altogether and in magnitude and quantity, so as not to escape circumscription." Theodore, bishop of Cyprus, also in his dialogue (Book 2) says: "I have learned from the holy angels that Christ will come in the same way as the disciples saw him going into heaven; but they saw a circumscribed nature, not one that cannot be circumscribed. I also heard the Lord saying: 'You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven. Moreover, both sitting on the throne of glory and setting the sheep on the right and the goats on the left signify what is circumscribed," etc. Didymus of Alexandria also shows that it is fitting for God alone, not for any creature, to be everywhere and to be diffused through all things.</p>
      <p>I certainly see that scripture significantly enough points out heaven as the royal residence of the blessed and a certain place for us, although in the meantime I do not deny that it is more adorned with divine light and glory than any human sense can now attain or conceive or express in words, from which it can be, as Paul also says in 1 Corinthians 2. The Lord Jesus himself (of whom John the Baptist testified, saying: 'He who comes from heaven is above all, and what he has seen and heard, he testifies'): "Where I am," he says, "there will my servant be also." But it is manifest that the ministers of God will be in heaven, not everywhere. Likewise: "In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am, there you may be also." Again: "Father, those whom you have given me, I desire," he says, "that where I am, they may be with me, that they may see my glory," etc. Finally, I see that scripture most willingly in many places joins the right hand of God and heaven, so that we might understand that the right hand of God also signifies a place in the heights of the blessed, which when Christ the head occupied, he also occupied for all the members of his body. In Mark we read: "The Lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God." In the Acts of the Apostles, with eyes fixed on heaven, Stephen saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. Peter also: "Christ is at the right hand of God," he says, "having gone into heaven, with angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him," where another meaning of the right hand occurs. Similarly, Paul.</p>
      <p>"God," he says, "raised the Son from the dead and made him sit at his right hand in the heavenly places." Likewise: "If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God," and again: "He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high." Therefore, I do not see how the heaven in which Christ dwells with the saints is everywhere and thus also present to us who are living on earth, not absent.</p>
      <p>For we have just said that the heavens above which the Lord ascended are not the place into which he ascended and in which the Lord dwells, who ascended above all visible heavens, those spherical ones, so to speak. If, however, he is not in these heavens, he is not everywhere, nor is heaven, the seat of Christ and the blessed, everywhere. (Nor) therefore is it spread as far and wide as the immense majesty of God itself.</p>
      <p>And the word of truth seems to assert most clearly that heaven, the seat of Christ and the blessed, is a place distinct from the earth and most remote from us who dwell on earth, so that nothing is equally so. The apostle of Christ says: "We know that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord." And the evangelical and apostolic scripture says: "The Lord departed from the disciples and was carried up into heaven, and a cloud received him out of their sight." For the Lord himself, while still with the disciples, had said: "And henceforth I am not in the world, for I am coming to you," etc. The angels also say: "Why do you stand looking into heaven?" It is said by them that the Lord will return in judgment in the clouds of heaven, and the apostle even more significantly: "Our citizenship or dwelling is in heaven, from which we await the Lord." Likewise: "The Lord will descend from heaven with the trumpet of God; we will be caught up together with the resurrected in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Thus we will always be with the Lord, not in some air, but above the air in the seat of Christ and the elect. Therefore, although the saints have acknowledged that God and his Christ are present everywhere by majesty, power, and administration, and are not bound or enclosed in any place, they have nevertheless worshiped and invoked him in heaven, as in which he singularly presents himself to be seen and enjoyed by the saints, from which all the good gifts of God flow to us and to which he commands his elect to lift up their minds. Hence the prophet cries out: "Your God is in heaven; he has done whatever he pleased," and: "The Lord has prepared his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all. The heaven of heavens is the Lord's, but the earth he has given to the children of men." Therefore, elsewhere the prophet exclaims: "To you, O Lord, I lift up my eyes, you who dwell in the heavens." For this reason, all the holy fathers throughout the entire holy history have cried out to heaven and invoked God with eyes lifted to heaven. For Christ the Lord lifts his eyes to heaven and invokes the Father, and he also teaches us to invoke with eyes lifted to heaven. Although in the meantime we recognize that by such expressions it is also signified and commanded that we should pray with minds lifted to heavenly things. The apostolic history testifies that Christ was lifted up by the apostles from the mountain through the clouds into heaven and was no longer seen, with the angels testifying that he had now sat down in heaven, from where he will someday return in the clouds for judgment, and they worshiped the Lord residing in heaven and returned to Jerusalem. Instructed by these testimonies of holy scripture and the concordant doctrine of the ancients, I feel that heaven, the seat of Christ and his elect, is far removed from the earth and thus distinct from the celestial spheres or orbs above all these heavens in the heights, most splendid and adorned with divine light and all kinds of glory, and therefore divine and spiritual, which nevertheless is a place suitable and fitting for spirits and glorified bodies, in which Christ as true God and man dwells eternally with all his elect and glorified ones, and in which God himself, the eternal light, presents himself to them to be enjoyed in the fullest and most delightful truth, as they have hoped in him according to this pronouncement of the holy apostle and evangelist: "The heavenly Father has pursued us with great love, so that we who are now called the children of God, in the meantime, it has not yet appeared what we shall be. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is." And in these things, indeed, I willingly contain myself, not curiously investigating the secrets of the heavens, but rather beseeching the Lord to soon admit me to behold that glory more fully. I certainly remember how much the ancient disputants about heaven have exhorted that they conduct themselves soberly and moderately in this matter.</p>
      <p>John of Damascus in "On the Orthodox Faith" (Book 2) says: "There is no need to investigate the substance of the heavens; it is unknown to us." Perhaps to this also pertains that saying of Job: "Who can recount the order of the heavens?" For Saint Augustine in "On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis" (Book 2) considers the disputes about the heavens and their form and figure to be useless: "Which our authors," he says, "have omitted with greater prudence, as they are of no profit to those learning for a blessed life." Likewise, in "On Faith and the Creed": "Where and how," he says, "the Lord's body is in heaven, it is most curious and superfluous to inquire, only it is to be believed that it is in heaven. For it is not for our frailty to discuss the secrets of the heavens; but it is for our faith to think sublime and honorable things about the dignity of the Lord's body," etc. Therefore, I believe simply with true and not at all curious faith that Christ our Lord, according to the truth of his body, is truly in heaven, and that heaven, which contains the Lord, is altogether of such a kind as to be most fitting for his true body and finally for his glory.</p>
      <p>And with these things, I have thus far opened my opinion to you, most illustrious man and best brother, about heaven, which I think you will not disapprove. As for the rest, which cannot be answered briefly, I respond to nothing, lest I also cause you annoyance with prolixity and distract and hinder you, who are occupied with many other things. Continue to love me, as you do, and consider these things favorably, live and be well.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and all yours. The fellow ministers and all the brothers in Christ greet you; greet also all our brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 15, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
