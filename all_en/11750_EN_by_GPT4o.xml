    <p xml:id="regest1">Froschauer will send him the parts of the [„Biblia sacrosancta“] that have been printed so far; Bullinger confidentially informs Vadian which parts Leo [Jud] and which Bibliander have translated, and has informed Froschauer of the presence of the messenger [Alexius?] Knoblauch. Vadian had already predicted the defeat [against the Turks] in Hungary earlier, and Bullinger feels transported back to the time of Jeremiah; even worse are the reports brought by guild master Hans Wegmann from Nuremberg. The judgment of the Imperial Chamber Court [regarding the recusation?] is blatant injustice; Bullinger is amazed at the patience [of the Protestants]. He sees in [King Ferdinand and Emperor Charles V.] - in view of the damage that Germany and the Empire are suffering - more of a "plague of the fatherland" than "fathers of the fatherland". He returns the catalog[?], which was also read in the council. As Zwingli had already feared, in the Confederation, through the bloody business of the pension lords, freedom and the soul have become purchasable; no one stands against it, but God's judgment is approaching. The bailiffs of Locarno, Lugano, and Mendrisio feel threatened by [the governor of Milan] Margrave [Alfonso d'Avalos] of Vasto and have asked for ammunition; Zurich has sent the letter to Lucerne [to the Catholic places], for they are the ones provoking foreign princes; Bullinger does not believe that the Confederation could withstand an attack. If Pope [Paul III.] is wise, he will have himself given the authority to persecute his opponents at the council; it is reported from Italy that Cardinal [Gasparo] Contarini has been poisoned; perhaps [Jacopo] Sadoleto will open the council in his place. To Vadian's question about the Italian [refugees]: In August, the Capuchin Hieronymus came to Zurich, who had read Bullinger's writings in Naples, and during his almost month-long stay, he disputed with him about faith; since the people of Chur could not provide him with a position, he returned [to Italy]. Then the learned Celio Secondo [Curione] arrived, who inquired about this very Hieronymus and also revealed himself as an exile; Bullinger recommended him to the Bernese, who called him to the school in Lausanne - previously he had taught in Pavia, Venice, Milan, and Lucca. Meanwhile, Bernardino [Ochino] from Siena arrived, an impressive personality, who had fled with the support of Ascanio Colonna and during his two-day stay reported how he had been sent by the Pope as a preacher to Genoa, Florence, and Genoa, then summoned to Rome because of his [evangelical] preaching; due to warnings, he fled from Florence and now lives in Geneva, from where he wants to spread his printed sermons in Italy - Bullinger sends a volume with ten sermons [GBG 236], which Vadian can have translated by merchants. After a month, Celio [Curione] returned, wanting to bring his family from Italy and asked Bullinger for a recommendation to the [Duchess] of Ferrara [Renata of France]; Bullinger called on the princess to support the persecuted and gave her his commentary on Matthew. Shortly thereafter, Peter Martyr [Vermigli], formerly abbot in Naples and prior in Lucca, arrived, accompanied by Paulus [Lacisius], a connoisseur of ancient languages; Bullinger includes a letter from Vermigli from Basel [No. 1674] for viewing; he now teaches in Strasbourg. Bucer left on November 20 [correct: December 2] [from Strasbourg] at the invitation of the [Arch-]Bishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] and may reform Osnabrück, Paderborn, and other cities. Celio [Curione] returned with his wife and children from Italy, reported terrifying things about the persecutions, and brought a letter from the Princess of Ferrara [No. 1683]. A servant of Colonna, whom Bullinger referred to Geneva, delivered money to Ochino and asked upon return for a letter from Bullinger to his lord, an enemy of the Pope; around December 6, Bullinger gave him a letter and his commentary on Matthew. Assuming Vadian is informed, he has written nothing about these events so far; he feels hardly up to his many tasks; greetings. He adds another letter as a testimony of the faith of the Italian refugees; God's judgment will befall the whore Babylon [i.e., the papacy]. Due to headaches, among other things, he can only briefly report on the Basel Quran print: Johannes Oporin printed the Quran edited by Theodor [Bibliander] based on an Arabic and two Latin manuscripts, along with accompanying writings, to refute the Turkish faith - the arduous work caused Bibliander to fall ill for several weeks -, but the Basel council was prompted to intervene by certain "donkeys", whereupon Oporin was imprisoned despite the intercession of [Oswald] Myconius, Markus [Bertschi], [Johannes] Gast, and [Martin Borrhaus], and the Quran was confiscated; in a letter [WA Correspondence 3802], which Vadian is yet to receive, Luther advocated for its release, and the people of Zurich have also written to Basel [No. 1703], but the outcome of the matter is uncertain; the devil does not like being attacked. Has Vadian received the sent Reislaufmandat [BZD C 317]? Greetings; apologizes for his hasty writing.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through the Lord Jesus Christ. I believe Froschauer will send you whatever parts of the Bible he has printed so far. Leo of blessed memory, a most learned and pious man, translated the majority. What he could not complete due to his death was translated by the very learned Mr. Theodor Bibliander, namely the Book of Job, the last 50 Psalms, Daniel, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs. He surpassed Leo in both the purity of the Latin language and the accuracy and elegance of the translation. However, I want only you to know this, so that the diversity of translators does not harm the printer. The learned will soon suspect that the work is not by the same artist; but it is better to keep this quiet for now and not spread it among the public. The New Testament began printing this week. I have prayed that he sends you everything he has printed, and as I began to write this, I sent a messenger to inform Knoblauch of the presence and the most convenient transport. What you and other good men have now written about that Hungarian massacre, you foresaw long ago, Vadian, and predicted in letters to me, not without lamentation. But our morals, utterly corrupt in every way, do not deserve a better fate. We must persistently pray to the Lord to spare us for the sake of His holy name, having mercy on His church. I wish we had fallen into the times of Hezekiah; but I greatly fear that we live in the age of Jeremiah. The tribune of the first tribe, Master Johannes Wegman, returning from Nuremberg these days, reported much more atrocious things than yours. Whoever today thinks the judgment of the Imperial Chamber Court is anything other than open violence and injustice, though cloaked under the pretext of supreme law, is completely mistaken. One thing I have not yet been able to admire enough: the misguided patience of our people. But the fisherman will learn, though late, from the blow. I clearly see that this pair of princes is nothing less than what they want to appear, Fathers of the Fatherland. What if you interpret "Fathers of the Fatherland" as "plagues of the Fatherland?" For I doubt whether other kings have lived under whose rule and auspices Germany has suffered so many and such great disasters, and the Roman Empire has endured such misfortunes. I presented the catalog, which I return with great thanks, to the consuls, who ordered it to be read to the entire council. The affairs of the Swiss Confederation have finally reached the point that Zwingli of blessed memory always feared they would: that through the work of factions, the corruption of the Catilinarians or pensioners, and extreme wickedness, the whole would fall apart. It is shameful to say, but true: for gold, both our freedom and our soul are for sale. Gods, avert such a plague from the lands! There were indeed good men who foresaw this destruction of the fatherland and therefore wanted to prevent it, but they were most undeservedly slain. So far, no one has been found to oppose the bloodthirsty. Now, therefore, the judgment of the Lord is approaching. The prefects of Locarno, Lugano, and Mendrisio are in great fear for themselves. They wrote to the Swiss cantons in recent days, saying that the Margrave of Vasto is plotting something. They ask where they can get that gunpowder and stones. The people of Zurich sent those letters to the people of Lucerne, so that they may consult, since they, having spurned good and sound advice, continually provoke princes and kings into war against themselves, etc. This I want to tell you. I can think of nothing else than that Switzerland is doomed if a strong enemy were to invade us. If the Pope is wise, he will convene a council from his own and take the power of judgment in the church for himself, condemning and striking with anathema all who do not worship the three-headed beast. Cardinal Contarini is not alive, but has been poisoned; so reported those who came to us from Italy. Therefore, another cardinal, perhaps Sadoleto, is appointed in Contarini's place to begin that holy council. I see that we must say the Psalm: Why do the nations rage, etc. - What you noted in passing about those Italians is as follows: In August, a monk of the Capuchin order (they defected from the Franciscans or Observants, led by Bernardino of Siena, to a more austere way of life) of vast stature, Hieronymus, still covered with a cowl and monstrous garment, came wishing to speak with me about the articles of our religion; for he said he had read my books in Italy and even in the city of Naples, and now, driven by the persecution of the Pope, he had fled to me to confer about many things. I received the man and listened to him disputing with the utmost patience. I also responded, as much as the grace of the Lord allowed me. In short, I found him to be quite learned and otherwise upright. So, having supported the poor man for almost a month, I sent him, commended by letters and provided with travel money, to Chur, in case someone there might be of use in the evangelical ministry who was skilled in the Italian language; but he did not find a suitable place and therefore returned. Meanwhile, while he was away, a certain Coelius Secundus, a man very learned in Latin and Greek and very skilled in piety and all kinds of literature, came first. He inquired whether a certain Hieronymus had come to me and where he had gone. I explained to him what had happened. I soon understood that he too had been driven from Italy and was seeking another place. I advised him to go to Bern. He obeyed and, provided with letters and travel money, went to Bern after a few days. I had recommended him to the consul and some Bernese nobles, through whose efforts he was soon appointed to the school in Lausanne, where he teaches theology and good literature; for he had previously publicly taught good and pious literature in Pavia, then in Venice, Milan, and finally in Lucca in Italy. While these things were happening, Mr. Bernardino of Siena, a man distinguished in holiness and learning, a venerable old man and gray-haired, of tall stature and bearing a remarkable majesty, arrived. Prince Ascanio de Colonna had equipped him with horses, servants, and travel money. He stayed with us for two days, discussing matters of religion with us. He showed us several apostolic briefs, which he had received from Pope Paul, ordering him to preach first to the Genoese, then to the Florentines, and then to the Venetians. But when he sensed that he was preaching Christ, he was summoned to Rome by an apostolic brief. The brave man left; but he was forbidden in Florence and sent to Germany by the pious, who reported that certain death awaited him in Rome. He finally went to Geneva, where he would live at his own expense because of the proximity to Italy. He is having many sermons written in Italian printed there and transported to Italy so that those who cannot hear him preach in person and with a living voice may hear through writings. He has, not undeservedly, the greatest authority among all Italians, indeed they almost venerate him as a saint. Here you have 10 of his sermons, printed in Geneva and sent to us by him in recent days, which will be interpreted for you by merchants skilled in the Italian language who are with you. After a month, Coelius returned from Lausanne, intending to enter Italy again to bring his wife and children to Germany. He asked me to write to the prince of Ferrara, who is the daughter of Louis, King of France. I complied and exhorted the prince to piety and to kindly support those driven out for Christ's sake. I added a gift of my Commentaries on Matthew, and with these received, he set out on his journey and left. Scarcely had he left when Peter Martyr arrived, brought by four horses, as the saying goes, himself driven from Italy. He was the prior of Lucca and abbot of Naples, of the order, if I am not mistaken, of the Premonstratensians. He had as a traveling companion a certain Paul, a very learned man; he himself is learned in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and moderately in Chaldean, a humane, eloquent, and pious man. He also consulted on where to stay with his companions. Basel seemed suitable, if perhaps a place was available for him to teach publicly. To help you understand this better, I have added his letter written to me from Basel, which you will return. He is now called to Strasbourg and has been given the function of lecturing publicly. Bucer, on November 20, was summoned by the Archbishop of Cologne and left, perhaps to reform the bishopric of some cities: Osnabrück, Paderborn, etc. Coelius returned late from Italy, bringing with him his wife and children, reporting astonishing things about the Pope's persecution. He also brought letters from the Queen or Princess of Ferrara written to me with great kindness and utmost piety, thanking me for the gift, in turn exhorting to piety, etc. As Coelius was going to Lausanne, Prince Ascanio de Colonna, Duke of Taikoza, sent a servant to inquire where Bernardino, the famous professor of theology, had gone. I indicated Geneva, where he soon went, carrying money for the man of God. Returning, he asked me for letters to his lord, a most zealous enemy of the Pope. So I wrote and added a gift of my Commentaries on Matthew. He left cheerfully, promising a response shortly; for he would return to Mr. Bernardino within a few months. These things happened around the 6th of December. I described them in more detail because I have not yet mentioned these matters even in a word, thinking you are not ignorant of them. In truth, I am overwhelmed by the burden of affairs, not because they are so great, but because I feel myself more inexperienced and weaker than I am in bearing them. Therefore, take these things in good part, live and farewell. Another Italian also writes a letter, which I have attached here so that you may see the faith of that nation, pray to the Lord for them with all yours, and praise God. That whore of Babylon will be revealed and judged, to God be praise and glory! I would also have amazing things to write about the Quran if time and leisure, especially the headache, would allow. Briefly: Johannes Oporinus printed the law of Muhammad, which they call the Quran, with Greek and Latin refutations added, as well as Arabic, Saracenic, and Turkish histories up to these times, a remarkable and memorable work. Our Mr. Theodor prepared this, and it is in opposition to the Mohammedan perfidy and the Turkish kingdom, with an elegant preface attached. An Arabic copy of the Quran was brought from Italy, he used two Latin ones, and he transcribed the entire thing by hand. Exhausted by the labor, he fell ill for several weeks in July. That work cost so much; and when it was about to be published, certain donkeys suggested to the most illustrious Basel council that it should not be allowed for the Turkish law to be published from the city of Basel. The pastors Myconius, Marcus, Gastius, Cellarius, etc., opposed this, teaching that it should be published piously; but they prevailed, and Oporinus was imprisoned and the Quran was confiscated. These things happened before the autumn Frankfurt fair. Meanwhile, Luther heard that the Quran had been printed in Basel, so he wrote to the council and almost implored them to publish it; for he had always greatly desired to see this book, etc. You will have a copy of the letter in due time. So now we await what will happen. We, who minister to the church, have also written to Basel in recent days. What will happen, the Lord knows, and you will not be ignorant. The devil snorts and does not like that one wants to crush both his horns. I wonder if you have received the senatus consultum or plebiscite of our republic against mercenary service; for I sent you a copy. Since you made no mention of it in your last letters, I doubt whether you received it. Farewell again and pray to the Lord for me. December 19, in the year of our Lord 1542. Forgive the poor handwriting; I wrote in great haste.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, my most esteemed lord.</p>
