      <p>S. D. D. Tell Gallicius that I have received his letters. He attributes too much to me out of his love for me; but let us attribute all good things to the Lord and pray that He may increase gifts and bless us among the sheep. Greet him.</p>
      <p>I have not received any of your letters now; I hope mine have been delivered to you by post, in which I discuss Vergerio with you. Say nothing about me and mine to him; indeed, if you can think of any of yours to communicate things to him, remember to keep all of mine to yourself until he has departed on the day unmüssig burdi. Guysianus, as soon as he came or returned from the Tabernas convention in Alsace, invaded the church of God.</p>
      <p>You have the story briefly described here; see that you keep it to yourself alone. There is a place in Champagne, Wassy, not far from Joinville, where the church numbered about 1500 people. This church was taken under the king's protection; therefore, it gathered securely for the assembly to listen to the word and prayers unarmed. Guysianus suddenly invaded and slaughtered about 150, wounded over 200, the rest fled in flight. They complained to the king about the injury.</p>
      <p>There was someone at the king's side who defended Guysianus; others thought the innocent blood should be avenged. Finally, an inquiry was decreed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Guysianus advances with a strong cavalry prepared for himself. The queen mother orders him to disband the army or expect the king's indignation.</p>
      <p>He replies: "If I come to the queen, I will clear myself so that no one can complain" etc. The queen is said to have contended with the king at Orléans; meanwhile, he hastens with the cavalry to Paris. Orders are given to others, that is, to ours, not to take up arms.</p>
      <p>What will happen or has already happened, the Lord knows, who must be earnestly prayed to by us. These things are written on March 17th in Paris etc. The council proceeds in such a way that, if the Lord does not destroy it, we may experience what we now least expect; for the pope is vigilant and Satan is active. Would that we pray earnestly and the Lord hears our prayers.</p>
      <p>The Diet of Hermetschwil will not proceed, because one of the judges, the amanus at the court of Uri, has died; only the amanus Dieterych remains. Therefore, the day is postponed again, night after night. I have not yet received letters from Frankfurt. Farewell and pray to the Lord diligently. I suppose you have received Coignet's letters by post.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 3rd, very quickly, 1562.</p>
      <p>Greet the friends and especially the honorable consuls. Our people greet you etc.</p>
      <p>Yours truly.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
