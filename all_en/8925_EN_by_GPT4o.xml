      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, I offer you my willing service, etc. On the 2nd of this month, I sent you the latest along with a red flannel, - I hope it has been well received by you. As for the cost, I will inform you shortly with God's help (I have sent it to Winterthur to the inn "Zur Krone"). Herewith a letter from Augsburg, containing money, also a letter from Paris to my gracious lord of Saxony with a request to convey my willing service to his grace. You will learn about the situation in the Netherlands; I have heard moreover that the Duke of Alba's cousin and son have been captured and divided into four parts; may God soon bring down the old tyrannical fox as well. Arras is also said to be in the hands of the Nassau forces. The King of Navarre is supposed to wage war in his name; may the Lord God grant grace that all may serve to the praise and honor of His holy name. Amen. I hear that the Confederates are not to be united, due to this delay; I hear nothing else about it. Also, the lands will demand the confederation letters. It might soon happen that a Confederation will also be punished. May God graciously prevent it. Amen. You will know how to send my gracious lord of Saxony his letters with certain dispatch, etc. The good people, whom you entrusted to us, the city clerk and me, have bought a good little house for 190 florins. I send you the greetings of your magistrates, also our dear lords preachers, city clerk, you, Mr. Walther, and others. With that, I commend you to the dear God in grace.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant at all times, Hans Liner. To the venerable and well-learned sir Heinrich Bullinger the elder, faithful servant of the church in Zurich, my honorable beloved lord, in Zurich.</p>
