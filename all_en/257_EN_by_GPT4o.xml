      <p>God with us, Your letter, dated the last day of August, has been well received by me, and I have gladly read therein your good trust.</p>
      <p>Joyfully, God will not abandon His righteous good cause; He will show grace, help, and comfort to all His own. He will punish His adversaries here and there. Therefore, let us confidently proclaim His word. The devil in this last time is making his final assault; but the invincible Christ the Lord will conquer and triumph in His own; for He is not only German, Spanish, Hungarian, Sicilian, and Neapolitan, but also Asian, African, European, insular, indeed the Lord of Heaven and Tartary.</p>
      <p>His word will remain not in vain, but forever, as it is most evident from the Hessian, the persecutor of the gospel and the defender of the Interimists. You have not learned to say mass, nor have I; we will not learn further with God's help, but rather we will surrender our souls for the testament of God. Let him who wishes to buy and sell take the mark of the beast; I will not. May the Lord help and strengthen us in His truth. I fear greatly that Strasbourg will not recover; the parties and sects are too great, the treachery is swift. May God strengthen them.</p>
      <p>Dear friend, if you have any substantial news from Strasbourg, let me know, although I am expecting a letter at this time, which should have been sent from yours to ours.</p>
      <p>Dear friend, do you have any information on where the emperor has gone, whether he is still in Speyer, whether he has set up the chamber or court, where he now wants to establish a nest with young devils and plague the people with it. You write that Augustus has taken the daughter of the King of Denmark and hopes to do something in the marriage for the cause of Christ.</p>
      <p>My dear Myconius, you do not know what the feasts of kings are like, and what the most holy John brought back from the feast of Herod? Oh, the lords are all made from the same mold. Christ has no place where the prince of this world is lord; therefore, we have now too much experience.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, two envoys from Constance were here before the council, showing that the community simply wants peace; they are informed that the emperor is summoning the envoys of the Confederates; they are advised to make a submission and accept the emperor's articles. They fear it must be so; for they have no quiet life with the community anymore; if that happens, they ask that the Confederates intervene, to beg some articles back from the emperor, etc. My lords write this to all places. They lament, as is rightly lamented, that the republic has collapsed and been scattered. I fear it is all in vain; the emperor is not so well disposed towards us Confederates that he will now allow apologies; I fear it will go badly for the poor people, etc.</p>
      <p>In the imperial cities, things are getting more and more turbulent. The peace sought with the false peace and apostasy does not come, but rather the opposite.</p>
      <p>In a notable place, a prelate hears: 1. that one should return to him his tithes, houses, all lying goods and give them back into possession; 2. that one should account with him for all tithes and rents that have been collected during the years of his absence, and that all this should be returned; 3. that one should hold him harmless for the costs incurred during the years of his absence; 4. that all gold, silver, precious stones in the church should be returned or made similar; 5. that the church should be adorned and equipped with all furnishings, altars, panels, paintings, clothes, velvet, damask, crimson, silk, wool, and linen, as they were formerly. This will be opposed; for there is no grace for anyone. Soon monasteries, churches, and chapels will also have to be built; there the poor cities will be completely oppressed. Thus it shall go if one does not want to hold firmly and bravely to God, the truth, and freedom.</p>
      <p>Thus one shall become aware of what priests are, where there is nothing but priest, priest. We cannot endure it. Yes, where one has done them good and no harm. These are severe judgments of God; may He have mercy on the poor troubled church and protect us from such distress. Have comfort among your own. If we do not hold ourselves honestly, it will go even worse for us.</p>
      <p>You may inform my gracious lord of WÃ¼rttemberg of this new news from Constance along with my greetings and all subservience.</p>
      <p>The report goes that many Italian troops of the emperor are moving through the pass by Memmingen over the mountains into Italy; indeed it is true, into Piedmont.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve us.</p>
      <p>Farewell eternally.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 7th September 1548. Greet Gastius and inquire about the defect in the Offices of Cicero.</p>
