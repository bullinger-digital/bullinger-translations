      <p>Greetings. Dearest compater in the Lord, a few days ago I sent you my opinion on your response to the Landgrave, and I have no doubt that you have received it. I am now sending my "Loci," which you should have received from Hervagius long ago; however, what was omitted by him through forgetfulness and is now so late being rectified by me, I ask you to consider kindly. I do not ask that you read them, but that you grant them some place in your very full library. The reading of them is intended not for the learned, but for young candidates of the sacred scriptures, and the title of this work promises nothing else.</p>
      <p>With what intent the Antichrist and his satellites are now again plotting a council, no wise person is ignorant, for this is not to be divined, but is most manifest from all past events. Perhaps something of malice is added to the former; for a new pope must necessarily devise new malice, and one suitable to him. But God is in heaven, who utterly scatters all the cunning plans of the popes. Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>I wish health to all yours, and also to the lords and brothers. Bern, 1560, the last of August.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and compater in Christ. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
