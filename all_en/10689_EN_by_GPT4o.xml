      <p>Greetings. What I wanted you to know, my lord, you will learn from Froschauer. It concerns the council. The Frenchman attempts to undermine the plans of others with his schemes. He seeks the favor of certain individuals. An honorable delegation is expected. He is plotting something remarkable: I believe he intends to unite the Roman Pope against the Emperor with us Germans, who embrace the renewed doctrine of Christ.</p>
      <p>I am grateful for your warning; I am vigilant, although I still seem to perceive no danger from there, except that I would prefer our people to be as far removed as possible from the contagion of that pestilence.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to all good men, such as Resch, the consul, the tribunes, the prefect of Baden, Edlibach, all friends alike, especially the learned lords and professors with the parish priests. I do not know what to send you in return from here, as I wrote similarly recently.</p>
      <p>September 25th.</p>
      <p>Examine Philipp's "Loci" carefully. Indeed, I have not yet seen it, but he promised me all good things.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Capito.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zurich, a most learned man and true brother in the Lord.</p>
