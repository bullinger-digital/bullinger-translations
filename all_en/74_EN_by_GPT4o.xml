    <p xml:id="regest1">Enzinas would not have refrained from the journey to Constantinople just because of Bullinger's [written] warnings [not received]. However, an unexpected, stronger reason now keeps him in Western Europe. He wants to inform Bullinger in particular, but also the other Zurich colleagues, about what unexpectedly happened to him in Strasbourg: He has found a partner for life in Margarethe Elter! She is an honorable woman, well known to John Hooper's wife [Anne, née t'Serclaes]. Enzinas would rave about her virtue if he were not obviously biased... Bullinger should preferably learn about her extraordinary talents personally from [Anne, née t'Serclaes] rather than in writing from Enzinas. He should pray together with all the Zurich colleagues for the marriage and the shared life of the newlyweds.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">If there had been time, Enzinas would have written to each individual Zurich colleague. God willing, he will make up for this in a few days after the wedding celebration.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Enzinas recommends to Bullinger the Spaniard Fernando [Díaz Paterniano], who has lived with him for several months [and is now delivering this letter]. He has noticed that this man needs Bullinger's instruction and teaching in many respects. He has therefore persuaded him to set out for Zurich, so that he may be instructed in the true doctrine by the scholars there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Greetings to Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Gessner, the other pastoral colleagues, and Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Your threats could not have deterred me from the journey to Constantinople, unless a stronger bond unexpectedly held me back in this part of Europe. For, to inform you (as a foremost friend) and the other brothers with you, about what unexpectedly happened to me in this city, know that I have taken a life partner, Lady Margarethe Elter, a noble maiden well known to the wife of Master Hooper. I would extol her virtues to you, if I might not seem somewhat biased. But I prefer you to learn of her uncommon qualities from Master Hooper's wife rather than read them in my letters. I earnestly ask you and all the brothers to commend this our undertaking and the entire course of our life to God in your prayers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I would write now to each individual, if leisure permitted. But I will do this (God willing) within a few days, when the sacred wedding has been celebrated.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I now commend to you Ferdinand the Spaniard, who has lived with me for several months, and because I perceive that he needs your teaching and instruction in many matters, I have advised him to visit you and learn some solid doctrine of religion from learned men.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Convey my greetings to Masters Theodor, Gessner, and the other brothers. Farewell. Strasbourg, March 20, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, F. Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant minister of the Church of Zurich.</p>
