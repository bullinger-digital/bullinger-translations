    <p xml:id="regest1"> In the evening, the [Zürich] envoys [Johannes Haab and Itelhans Thumysen] returned from [the Baden Diet]. The [four Protestant city cantons Basel, Bern, Schaffhausen, and Zürich] wanted to know from the five [Catholic] places what to expect from them. They replied that they were ready to uphold the alliances and the [Second] Peace of Kappel [of 1531], but that they were entirely against the faith of the four places. To the French envoy [Antoine Morelet du Museau], they declared that if Francis I and the four places were to go to war to aid the Schmalkaldic League, they would have to terminate the [mercenary] alliance [of 1521] with the king and the alliances with the four places to protect their faith. The envoy replied that the [mercenary] alliance was not a submission [to Francis], but a friendship agreement, and that France would consider an agreement with [the Schmalkaldic League] and the four places in the event of a termination of the [mercenary] alliance. The five places are very embittered! However, the four places have made it clear to them that they are also not willing to give up their faith. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> - [The Zürich council] is surprised that the [Constance council] does not write, nor reports on the Swiss banners that are [near Füssen] at the Ehrenberg pass, where many people from Zürich are involved. Constance should inquire about the situation there and notify Zürich. It would be negligent to let the [imperial troops coming up from Italy and those already in Germany] come together! May the Lord protect [the Protestants]! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> - Bullinger has received Blarer's letter [No. 2592] from the bearer [...] intended for [Hans] Schöner's dispatch. Therefore, Blarer should ignore the remark in Bullinger's letter from the previous day [that the letter had not arrived]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> - The Venetians are likely waiting to see how the situation develops. After all, they are also [Italians]. So far, the [Protestants] have been lucky. Should it turn, there would be many on whom one could no longer count. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> - The Bernese have decided to adhere to the [doctrine of the Lord's Supper] that they adopted during the disputation [of 1528]. However, because some of their pastors prove to be Lutheran, the Bernese are now seeking a preacher in Zürich. Bullinger, together with Walthart Schwarz, will endeavor [to address this]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> - Peace negotiations are still being reported. A good, honest peace would indeed be welcome, but given the already significant expenses incurred for this war, a premature peace at the start of the war is to be avoided. Rather, one should resist! Blarer should write this to [Georg] Frölich and others. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> - Allegedly, there is disorder among the Swiss [banners] near Füssen. The people of Constance should ensure order there. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest8"> - Greetings. </p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Our envoys returned home last night. However, they do not bring anything special, except that the five places have responded to our request about what to expect from them: They want to accept and uphold the alliances and the peace. In summary, they are entirely embittered against our faith. In response to the French envoy, they have declared: They can see how the French are with the empire. If the French get involved in the war and the four places, their confederates, join the empire, they will also consider how to protect their faith and give the king the alliance and the four places the alliance, etc. The envoy replied that the king had not submitted to them with the alliance, but had accepted them as friends. If they give him the alliance, he will consider whether he can make an agreement with the empire and the four places, etc. In summary: They are bitter. Our people have unanimously informed them that they cannot abandon their faith, etc. So much for now in haste.</p>

      <p>My lords are greatly surprised that yours do not write at all, and especially about our confederates at the Ehrenberg pass, how things stand with them, and what the situation is. For my lords have many of their people lying there and would like yours to make contact with them and inform them of the situation. I ask you to take the matter seriously and report. It is truly not good to let the troops come together like this, unless it is God's will that the confusion is found all in one place, as a punishment for themselves or us. May the eternal God protect us!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have received your letter along with Schöner's from the post. Therefore, do not mind that I wrote yesterday that I had not yet received it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Venetians are also watching to see how the situation will develop. They are also Italians! So far, things have gone well for us by the grace of God. Should it turn, there would be enough treachery.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Bernese have decided to adhere to their disputation. However, since some of their preachers are not satisfied and lean towards the Lutheran way, they have recruited here, and are still recruiting, for a preacher.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>With Lord Walthart Schwarz, I will diligently apply myself. Further negotiations should be conducted for a settlement and peace. Honor God, call upon all good friends. Write to Laeto and others that such great costs should not be spent in vain and that a foul peace should not be accepted at the start. Listen, whoever can hear! A good, honest peace, however, is a good thing.</p>

      <p>There is said to be disorder among the confederates at Füssen. Advise and help to ensure it is properly managed.</p>
