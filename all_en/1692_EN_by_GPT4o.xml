      <p>Greetings. Your letters were most welcome to me, which I received at home today, as I understand they were written on the eve of John the Baptist. Good heavens, where have they been hiding for so long? A girl came during the holy sermon and gave the letters to a maid; therefore, I do not know who she was, nor did she say where she brought them from or from whom she received them. Meanwhile, our Gwalther was with us, who conveyed greetings from you and praised your kindness and affection towards us. I wish your wife a speedy recovery, so that you may not be troubled by any domestic care; but the Lord will not forsake your piety.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us, except that the princes are said to have made peace with the Emperor; I hope that from this no most savage wars and most severe persecutions will arise. May the Lord have mercy on us. If you receive any certain news about these matters, you would do a most welcome thing by sharing it. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>August 9, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most faithful bishop of the Basel church, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
