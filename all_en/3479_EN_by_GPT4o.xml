      <p>Greetings. I am sending you, as you requested, honorable lord and godfather, your letter written to Sultzer. Our Musculus has also read it and approves it candidly.</p>
      <p>In one place, you indeed urge him to declare himself, what kind of person he wants to be if he has to confront the adversaries. I have always been wary of this man; for all who know him more intimately here affirm that he is deceitful and very slippery. We ask, if it can be done by your grace, that you also share with us the letter sent to you by him, and you should not think that we will use it imprudently; it will be enough for us to have inspected it once.</p>
      <p>We also ask that, with such an opportunity presented to you, you do not cease to urge him until he declares himself. You will learn about our Decades from Froschauer the Younger.</p>
      <p>As for the latest news, I have nothing to write except that a rumor is spreading here about the city of Calais being captured by the French. However, we have no more certain basis for this than the following: On the past Friday, January 14th, my lords, who have sworn the citizenship in Geneva, were in Bätterkinden, where a messenger arrived in haste, who reported this and claimed that he was hurrying to the Duke of Ferrara to announce it. He also reported how it happened, namely that the French drove the English from the sea with several ships, and when the English realized that all the force of the French would press on Arras, they turned and hurried with foot soldiers, in all the cold, to Calais and conquered it quickly, as there were no more people than the common garrison inside. So he said.</p>
      <p>We are, however, waiting for more certain information.</p>
      <p>Musculus has been ill these days, but by the grace of the Lord, he has recovered again.</p>
      <p>He greets you and all the brothers; may they be well in my name too, along with your wife and family. Bern, January 17, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and godfather, to be honored perpetually.</p>
