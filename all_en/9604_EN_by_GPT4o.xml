      <p>The writer of those pages on the eating of the flesh of Christ and the celebration of the Lord's Supper writes in a very intricate and disorganized manner, using neither natural nor artificial order. He mixes everything together and pushes out whatever first comes to mind, and therefore, what he writes does not fit together well and coherently, and for this reason, it is read not without difficulty. However, as to the main point, he indeed says many things correctly, which he could have said more correctly with fewer words, that the flesh of Christ is not eaten carnally or, as our adversaries monstrously speak, orally, but only spiritually through faith. What he adds about sacramental eating is also intricate and sufficiently obscure, nor does it seem that such a tangled and affectedly novel writing should have been published. What he disputes about the day of Passover, he does not support with firm enough reasons that it should be simply accepted and believed. The evangelists express most significantly that our Lord first indeed ate the paschal lamb with the disciples, and then instituted that commemorative supper. He so entangles himself with the words of the evangelists that he thinks the Lord did not eat the legal lamb with the disciples, but merely our new and memorial one. Hence, he believes that this new and our memorial should be arranged with a variety of foods, so that those feasting may leave satisfied and not hungry, which without controversy clearly conflicts with apostolic doctrine; for it commands the hungry to eat at home, and in the sacred assembly, with the common table removed and the mystery celebrated. He seems too confident and audacious, who dares to affirm that in this part there has been an error since the times of the apostles. Indeed, he contemptuously calls those who, without other foods and freer drinking, content with a little bread and wine, soberly perform the memory of Christ's death, looking more to the things signified than to the sacramental signs, "buccelarians" and "guttularians."</p>
      <p>Otherwise, this writer seems to be not entirely a bad man, yet in the meantime, with all due respect, he seems to have a head too inclined towards new things, in which he indeed pleases himself too much in my judgment, so that a bridle should be put on him rather than agreeing with him in these matters. But what benefit has returned to the reader or what salutary aid has been added to our true faith and confession, or what, I ask, of consolation or resolution from doubts have the consciences of the simple received from these disputes, even if he has prevailed in these chapters, which he alone and newly has disputed so perplexingly? Would that we all might wisely act with moderation according to the proportion of faith and to edification with humility and charity, etc.</p>
