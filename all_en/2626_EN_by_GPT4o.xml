      <p>Greetings. Most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, although I have suffered from a very severe and dangerous illness for several weeks, so much so that I could neither read nor write due to the dimness of my eyes and dizziness, nevertheless, because I hear you are very concerned about the letters of Justina the abbess, I could not refrain from writing, even though I have barely managed to write this, so that you may not remain in suspense any longer.</p>
      <p>Therefore, know that the aforementioned letters were delivered to me the day after they were written, and on the third day after, I sent them to Engen through a reliable messenger, a good citizen, who was already planning a journey there. He also informed me that he took great care of them, and you should not ever doubt my faithfulness and diligence if any of your matters need to be expedited by me.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more. I will await, as you promised, news soon about the reconciliation between Charles and Heinrich, about the actions of the bishops and cardinals against the lord and his anointed ones, about the virtue and name of this pope. I have epitaphs and pasquinades on the death of Julius III, which I will send soon; I could not copy them now. Farewell again, and keep these diligent young men, who seem to me to be good, commended to your trust, as they have previously worked with you in letters. Farewell again. Schaffhausen, March 3, 1555.</p>
      <p>Jakob Rüeger, most devoted to your kindness. To the most illustrious man, endowed with singular learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his lord and brother in Christ, most highly esteemed.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
