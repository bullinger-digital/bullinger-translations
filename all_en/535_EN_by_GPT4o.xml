      <p>Guillaume Plançon to Heinrich Bullinger sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Most learned Lord Bullinger, in recent days I received a letter from our mutual friend, Lord Florian, in which he urged me (as he could command with his authority) to ensure that the package and letters addressed to you, which were brought to me from Strasbourg to Basel, be delivered to you as soon as possible. Therefore, I am sending them to you; for I have nothing more important than to be able to do something pleasing for such wise and learned men. I want you to understand, learned Bullinger, that I hold you in uncommon esteem for the recommendation which I clearly perceived from Lord Florian's letters.</p>
      <p>It was certainly a mark of your candor to consider a man who is not connected to you and barely known to you by name, and not commendable in any way, worthy of such praise from you. May Christ grant that I may be able to return equal favor to you someday.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 5 days before the Kalends of June.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, G[uillaume] Plançon.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful teacher of Christ's church among the people of Zürich, most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
