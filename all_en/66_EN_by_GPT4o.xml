    <p xml:id="regest1">Renato's frequent and intimate letters are not based on his own merits, but rather on Bullinger's kindness, as his letters allow one to expect not everything, but very much from him. Moreover, everyone who was recommended to Bullinger by Renato thanked the latter so effusively for this support, as if nothing better had ever happened to them! Thus, Renato is encouraged by Bullinger's clear willingness [for further recommendations] and confidently recommends [Martino Paravicini], who is currently standing before him. Hopefully, this does not come at an inconvenient time!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Raphael Paravicini, a Christian and pious man from a very good family from the parish of Caspano in Valtellina, has written to Renato to ask him to write to Bullinger about his son [Martino] as follows: His talented and very sociable thirteen-year-old son shows a strong inclination towards education and piety and should therefore be sent to Zurich for education. There, he should live with Bullinger and be raised in a Christian manner together with his children. Raphael Paravicini has full confidence in Bullinger's [care]! For education in the liberal arts, he should assign the boy a teacher. Raphael Paravicini is willing to pay the price Bullinger names for his son's maintenance and also to adequately compensate the teacher. Bullinger's consent would be akin to a divine blessing for him. How much [Bullinger's agreement] would please Renato, he does not need to elaborate in writing. Bullinger should respond to this request as quickly as possible and specify what costs will be incurred for accommodation and instruction.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Greetings to him and his family from all friends. He should greet the Zurich parish on their behalf. May they pray for the people of Valtellina. In these times, this seems particularly necessary! Bullinger and his colleagues can [in turn] count on the great willingness to help from the people of Valtellina.</p>

      <p>Camillo Renato sends greetings in Christ to Heinrich Bullinger. Indeed, the reason I write to you so often and so familiarly is due to your kindness, not my own worthiness. You present yourself in such a way in your letters that everyone seems to be able to expect not everything, but very much from you. Moreover, if I have recommended anyone to you for any reason, they express such gratitude to me on your behalf, as if nothing more desirable or greater has ever happened to them through my recommendation. Therefore, the more I understand that my recommendations to you hold weight, the more your humanity makes me ambitious in this regard. For this reason, I write to you boldly whenever I please, and I recommend someone whenever the occasion arises. I hope both will be most pleasing to you.</p>

      <p>Raphael Paravicini, a Christian man of notable nobility and piety in the parish of Caspano in Valtellina, has written to me asking that I write to you about his son in this manner: He wishes to send his thirteen-year-old son, who is as light-hearted as he is inclined towards both humanity and especially piety, to Zurich. There, he should live in your home together with your children, to absorb evangelical discipline from you, in whom he places great trust for your piety, and to be entrusted to some schoolmaster for instruction in the liberal arts. He will pay you for his maintenance as much as you wish, and to the teacher as much as is appropriate for his work. You will seem to have bestowed a divine favor upon him if you accept the condition. As for how pleasing this will be to me, it is unnecessary to write as plainly as what is most evident. Please let us know as soon as possible what you think and what you wish regarding this matter.</p>

      <p>All friends in the Lord send greetings to you and all yours. You will greet the Zurich church on behalf of everyone, to whose prayers we commend ourselves greatly to God. For we consider this most necessary in these times. Know that our service is most ready for you and your colleagues, most honorable men and dearest to me. Farewell, and that in the Lord. On the tenth day of March 1548, Clavenna of the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a man of outstanding piety, minister of Christ, and most friendly man. In Zurich, otherwise known as Tigurum.</p>
