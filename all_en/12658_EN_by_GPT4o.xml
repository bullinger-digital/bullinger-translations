    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Von Cham thanks Bullinger for his letter [not received] and for the enclosed collection of news. He has good reason to hope that God will preserve the [Schmalkaldic League] in His grace, for if He does not, Emperor [Charles V] would proceed harshly and without mercy against them, which would also have dire consequences for the [Confederates]. Therefore, let us pray unceasingly!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Von Cham is willing to reciprocate the service rendered, asks to be kept informed, and commends Bullinger to the Lord.</p>

      <p>Honorable and well-learned, gracious, dear sir, my friendly greetings and entirely willing service beforehand! Dear sir, I have received your friendly letter along with the new collection of news that you sent me, and I have read it with joy, with good hope that the Lord God will graciously preserve and maintain His own for His honor's sake, for it is well to fear that if the Emperor succeeds against this pious people, as he and his followers would act so tyrannically and mercilessly against them; furthermore, it is well to fear how it would affect us. Therefore, we should rightly call upon the Lord God without ceasing, that He may graciously protect these pious people from this tyrant, so that they do not become a cause for pity.</p>

Dated at Kyburg, on the 6th day of October 1546. Your willing servant Bernhard von Cham.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, my dear lord and good friend.</p>
