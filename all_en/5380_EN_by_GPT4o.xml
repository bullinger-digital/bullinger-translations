      <p>Greetings. Hercules von Salis is coming to you, whom I do not need to recommend to you, as he has already been recommended before and is known for his virtues. He is departing today to Jenins to Carl, and soon from there to you.</p>
      <p>He is undertaking difficult tasks; but only difficult tasks are conquered. I earnestly ask you to assist him with advice and resources, and I am convinced that you will not hide anything from him regarding the matters he wishes to learn from you. It is a common cause for all. He will inquire with you about what the cities will do and whether Zurich, if something is to be undertaken, would have a loyal outlook towards our land.</p>
      <p>You also know that grain must be transported through and over the Swiss territory from Zurich to the Grisons. Insist on it, they are preventing it.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the greatest concern is where one might have the best and how. I think that the Lord of Sax would be good for these discussions.</p>
      <p>You will hear everything else from Hercules.</p>
      <p>If God wills, yours will do better; if God wills, they will pay attention and also let some things pass. What about the Bernese? It is said that they have allowed the pass to be blocked for them.</p>
      <p>Regarding what I had written about sending Carl in his name, know that we have changed our plan; Hercules is sufficient. While I write this, we receive letters from Mr. Paul Vergerio written in Tübingen, in which he indicates that he has returned safely. He wishes us to write (but in vain); for he hopes that he can obtain permission from the prince to return to the Rhaetians. But let us leave Vergerio aside.</p>
      <p>I ask you again and again to assist in this cause. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 26, 1562.</p>
      <p>There is no need for me to instruct you to ensure that Hercules is treated magnificently by the magistrate according to his merit. You know yourself, due to your prudence and humanity, how such men should be treated.</p>
      <p>Yours respectfully, whom you know.</p>
      <p>I wish, if it were possible and the Prince of Condé would write, that one of them would also write individually to Carl, so that it would not seem neglected.</p>
