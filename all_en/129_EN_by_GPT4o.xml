      <p>Greetings. When I found a reliable person, most esteemed Mr. Bullinger, who was traveling to my brother Christian, I could not refrain from also sending you, my best friend and patron, something in the form of a letter as a token of duty. It is indeed the duty of a client that, if he cannot honor his patron with other gifts, he should at least show himself dutiful by sending greetings. I decided to discuss with you some of the emperor's cunning plans; for there are certain points being circulated among us, which seem to me to pertain more to deforming than reforming the church, yet he pretends to want to assist the struggling and dissenting church. But I ask you, who is so dull-witted that they cannot perceive the stench that lies hidden here? For except for the single article of justification, what is not tainted with some Spanish trickery and poison? The sacrament of the Lord's Supper (to mention just one thing) he wants to be administered under both kinds, and indeed well; but in the meantime, he decrees that the mass, that horrendous, deformed, huge, detestable monster, which should be cursed by all, is to be retained in the church, and he adds to this deceit something like a wrapping and covering, so that it is hidden more deeply, lest it be celebrated henceforth either for the living or the dead. Oh, cunning malice, oh Spanish craftiness. But let us not be led into excessive admiration; for this kind of people, as we know, is, as it were, from their very cradles, diligently versed and trained in hunting and bird-catching.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he very cleverly knows how to prepare the baits of such allurements and enticements. I certainly persuade myself that all these points contain nothing but pure impostures; for there is also appended and inserted the Interim, which seems to me more ambiguous than any Delphic oracle and can be interpreted in whatever direction you wish.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we must pray, venerate, and implore the Father of mercies to defend the bride of his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who is meant to be most beautiful, flourishing, and powerful, from the nefarious crimes and deceits of the most wicked men. These things, excellent Bullinger, I have briefly sent to you as a testimony of my duty, having much more to say on this matter, if either your engagements or my writing allowed it. It will be your part to take these things in good and fair measure and to always keep your Hospinian (as you do) recommended to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel the day after Pentecost in the year of the redeemed world 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, Johannes Hospinian.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man in divine and human letters, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, acting as the chief bishop of the most renowned city of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed patron in many respects.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
