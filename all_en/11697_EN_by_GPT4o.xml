    <p xml:id="regest1">In view of the strong Turkish garrison in Buda, the army of the Empire does not dare to attack, and only the high water [of the Danube] prevents the advance of an enemy superior force; in the army camp, where many prostitutes are present, Johannes [Agricola of] Eisleben preaches with twelve helpers. On one side, [in Zittau] they are threatened by the Turks, and on the other, from Bohemia, by the plague, but from the writings of the Zurichers, they have learned to regard death lightly. However, in their surroundings, the fear of death is great, as there is a lack of scholars who could counter it; also, Pergener's brother-in-law [Tobias Engler], despite his admonition in Wittenberg, has learned neither Greek nor Hebrew. Blessings and greetings, request for a brief reply.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ, dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Once again, you begin to abandon the prayers and wishes of your brothers, who are now neighbors to the Turks. Buda is about 50 strong miles away from us, fortified with the strongest Turkish garrisons, while the leaders of the Empire have set up camp 6 miles above Buda, not daring to engage with the Turks. Our forces would have long been expelled from Hungary if the Turks had been able to advance to Buda with new armies due to the multitude of waters. Nothing has been achieved all summer. There are about ten thousand prostitutes in our camps. Johannes Agricola of Eisleben is the chief preacher in our army, joined by twelve evangelical preachers. A sermon is held daily.</p>
      <p>We, I say, would be utterly fearful, living here between Charybdis and Scylla - for on one side looms the most cruel enemy, and from behind, that is in Bohemia, the plague terrifies us - if we were not comforted by your holy commentaries. From them, we learn that the death of Christians is nothing other than a transition from a worse life to a far better one. Those who truly love God desire to be dissolved and be with Him. As long as we live here, we are daily more and more tainted by affections, which is very troublesome to all worshippers of God. The writings from Zurich teach us from the holy scriptures that death is not to be feared by us, but to be awaited with the greatest joy.</p>
      <p>It cannot be expressed how great the fear and terror of death is in our land. All cities in Bohemia and Wrocław are closed; for they say the plague is at their doors, although the plague is not everywhere in Bohemia. This prohibition is made with great consensus of the preachers. Here, it is impossible to find anyone who would teach contempt of death; all are dismayed at the name of death and its mention. No one dares to write about how great the shortage of scholars is here. My wife's brother spent two years in Wittenberg, returned as a Terentianus, and did not touch the beginnings of either the Greek or Hebrew language, to which I greatly encouraged him; but I sang to a deaf man.</p>
      <p>We, who by God's kindness have obtained your books, give you all the greatest thanks. May God deign to protect and preserve you with His beneficence, mercy, and grace. We wish D. Konrad Pellikan, Leo Jud, Theodor Bibliander, and Caspar Megander to be safe in Christ. We ask for one brief greeting.</p>
      <p>Given in Zittau in the Margraviate of Upper Lusatia, in the year 1542, on the twenty-third day of the month of August.</p>
      <p>Oswald Pergener, secretary (Stadtschreiber), Laurentius Neumann, Celestinus Hennig, Onofrius Herzog the Swabian, Friedrich Helvetius, Konrad Nesen, licentiate, who was in Zurich, Bartholomäus Beneš the Bohemian, and many other brothers who think piously of your doctrine.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most ample church of Zurich, his dearest friend and brother in Christ.</p>
