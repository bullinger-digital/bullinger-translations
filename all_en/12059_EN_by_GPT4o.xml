    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's writing ["Hope of the Believers"], whose German translation by [Johannes] Fries he likes; he wants to reciprocate someday and sends for Bullinger's review the Latin [dedication epistle and introduction to Bullinger's writing "Resurrectio"], as Bullinger gave him the opportunity to print it in Latin. The first [city] scribe [Oswald Fürstenlob] will take on the recommended young man [Gerold Meyer the Younger] as an apprentice, as soon as [Hans] Vogler [the Younger] returns to his family. The church [in Alsace] would be better off if the new [regional] administrator [Hans Henman (Amandus) Truchsess von Rheinfelden?] took action against the good-for-nothings and protected the [new] orders, but he is a very bad person; the prince [Count George of Württemberg] is eagerly awaited back from Wildbad to dismiss him. He makes every effort to ensure that what he and Erasmus [Schmid] have built is not destroyed and the opponents do not triumph and expel him; if he, as an old man, had to retreat, he would return to Switzerland; [the people of Zurich] should pray for [the people of Alsace]. Just as previously the church of Montbéliard, they are now being insidiously attacked by false brothers from Württemberg, especially the followers of [Erhard] Schnepf, [i.e.] innovators and ceremonialists, and they rely entirely on the word of God. The grape harvest is very sparse, a punishment for the ungrateful wastefulness [of the people], against which one preaches in vain. He commends himself to Bullinger and his church and asks for their prayers; greetings to Pellikan, Gwalther, Megander, Bibliander, and Erasmus [Schmid]; greetings from Nikolaus [König].</p>

      <p>Grace of the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>I give you immense thanks, most learned Bullinger, for your little book, and if I can, I will repay you more greatly someday, etc. I am pleased with Fries' learned and familiar translation, which has provided a very diligent encouragement of faith to the pious and the Church of Christ, and to those who understand German, towards the hope of future glory, which will be revealed in us. For the simple and those devoted to piety will read, recognizing with Job that this hope is certainly laid up in their bosom; relying on this hope, they would more easily endure the adversities of all ages, etc. However, since you have also given me the opportunity to print the same work in Latin, I send you a copy of it, which I beg you to review. For it would be rash to publish it without your recognition, etc.</p>
      <p>The young man you mention in your letters, our first scribe, as soon as Vogler returns to his family, will easily enlist him in his service with a salary, undoubtedly not very large, for the sake of you and all the people of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Our church would be quite well if that new administrator, on whom the entire republic and the town and the countryside depend, would punish those infamous scoundrels, who defile the holy discipline of Christ with their disgrace, according to their merits, and protect the laws (by which honesty has hitherto been planted in this barbaric and Alsatian people). But since, on the contrary, the man is impious, harsh, inexorable, a slanderer, shameless, and, to say it all in one word, the sink of all crimes, bearing everything with indifference, he cares rightly neither for God nor for the republic, therefore we eagerly await the prince, who has been bathing in the Wildbad for two months. Perhaps when he returns, he will cast the hypocrite from his position; if not, it will be the end for both religion and good discipline.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we will move every stone, so that what your Erasmus and I have built in this church with the help of the divine, with great labor, does not collapse, nor will I yield to Satan - with the Lord strengthening me, without whose kind help I am nothing - nor to his satellites, until either they expel me by force, which God forbid, or a better one, who will protect this Sparta more than I, succeeds. But if I, as an old man, must depart, I will return to my ancient homeland, Switzerland, unless the Lord drives me to other shores. These are general remarks about the perverse minds of the impious; for to pursue each in detail would be long. The time is now upon us; after darkness, we hope for light, etc. Meanwhile, you, with your brothers and your church, pray to the Lord most earnestly, who leads us into this temptation, that we may not be overcome by evil.</p>
      <p>Many are the snares, many the perverse minds, not a few false brothers from Württemberg, especially the followers of Schnepf, innovators and ceremonialists, attack us no less than they have hitherto attacked the church of Montbéliard; as many heads, so many opinions. But the solid word of God and the pure speech of the Lord will soon expose their foolishness. We, as many as are ours in this field, rely on this foundation; without it, we do not swim in the sea of this world. These are hastily about our affairs, more when there is time.</p>
      <p>We are occupied with the grape harvest, which has yielded very sparingly among us; no wonder, since the benefits of God are so ungratefully squandered. Against such squanderers, we cry out to the point of hoarseness, profiting little. In the dearness of all things, there is no frugality, but greater luxury; hence, for the impenitent, we see nothing else to be expected than the heavier hand of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most holy man in Christ, and commend us to God and his son Jesus Christ in your prayers and to your church, that he may triumph in us, not for our sake, but for the glory of his name, over the adversaries. Greet in my name all your fellow workers in the word of God, especially Pellikan, Gwalther, Megander, Bibliander, and my Erasmus, and as many as are joined to us in Christ. Nicholas König and all the leaders of our church greet you. Hastily, in Riquewihr, October 13.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, his very dear patron.</p>
