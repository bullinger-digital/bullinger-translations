      <p>S. D. I received your letters, dear brother; the excuse is complete.</p>
      <p>The Aarau assembly ended some time ago.</p>
      <p>I hear that it dealt with the people of Glarus and the council.</p>
      <p>The council is progressing; I received the first session held on February 26; the second is decreed for May 14. All learned men who wrote books and were condemned in the catalog of Paul IV are summoned to the council under safe conduct; for they begin the council with those books that introduced false doctrine, etc. In France, the situation is in extreme danger.</p>
      <p>Guise, having left directly from the Alsatian conference at Saverne, invaded the church of Vassy in Champagne; it is said that about 150 were slaughtered in the assembly, over 200 wounded; soon all their belongings were plundered. They complained about the injury at court; there were various opinions; finally, an inquiry was instituted. Meanwhile, it is reported that Guise, equipped with a strong cavalry, is advancing.</p>
      <p>The queen announces: unless he disbands the army, he will incur the king's wrath; he replies: "If I come, I will excuse myself as best as I can." The queen is said to have retreated to Orl√©ans with the king, while Guise hastens with the army to Paris. These things are written from there on March 17.</p>
      <p>What has happened in the meantime, the Lord knows... There are those who say... and the papal legate, the Cardinal of Ferrara, has obtained that both legates and bishops be sent to the council. Thus, the devil's work grows.</p>
      <p>My lords write to the Schwyz court the day at Einsiedeln; for Uri sends to Schwyz: their official Imm Hoff, who was an appointee, has died; the other appointee in Schwyz, official In der Halden, wants to wait until another appointee is set for him. The sick appointee from Glarus, Tschudi, the treasurer, is also mortally ill, but recovering. Schwyz writes to Glarus, they should not visit the day.</p>
      <p>Glarus writes to my lords, who are the other court, etc.</p>
      <p>I think, when the day has passed, the bishop of Chur would have summoned us because of the council; perhaps he will do it otherwise. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In great haste. April 3, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, as always.</p>
      <p>I think the rumors spread about the mountain are fables; it will be something else, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Winterthur.</p>
      <p>Return.</p>
