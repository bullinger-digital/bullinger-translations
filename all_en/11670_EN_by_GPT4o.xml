    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds on behalf of [Johannes] Comander to Bullinger's question about the unrest in Graub체nden: In the last 30 years, actions have been taken several times against the corrupt pension recipients, but - especially after the French alliance [of 1521/23] - almost without success, as the profiteers of the mercenary service are powerful. Now, two such gentlemen from Bergell, Bartholom채us Stampa and Anton von Salis "de Run" [Runconius], captain in Veltlin, have fallen out, whereupon the Engadiners, the French envoy [Louis Daugerant, Seigneur de Boisrigaut], as well as envoys of the Gotteshausbund got involved in the conflict; this led to a division among the population, with most - probably wrongly - considering [the Habsburg-minded] Stampa as the troublemaker; the Confederates as well as the other two leagues [the Upper and the Ten Jurisdictions League] also got involved. While the Gotteshausbund and Chur were preparing a meeting, there was an attack against Stampa and further armed riots, which, however, ended without serious consequences. A court established in Savognin had to be dissolved under pressure from the accused; at the meeting of the Three Leagues [on April 20 in Chur] convened instead, they got away with high fines and a five-year disqualification from office; Valentin Vatscherin, married to a woman from Zurich, was fined 100 crowns, Anton Travers 250, Peter Finer 60. The preachers are not to blame for these disturbances; their admonitions went unheard. The country people will not forget how the bishop [Lucius Iter] and his loyalists in Chur and the local friends of the French behaved. Pfister and his vicar have been pushed out of the school. Travelers from Italy could not confirm the rumors of war preparations. After some B체ndner joined the French king [Francis I.], the authorities issued a ban. Greetings to Leo [Jud] and [Kaspar] Megander; Bullinger may inform them and others of this report and should keep it. Request for news from Germany. Greetings from Comander and Blasius.</p>

      <p>Nicolaus Artopoeus Balingius to Heinrich Bullinger, a man of utmost learning.</p>
      <p>Greetings. You inquire from Comander, most honorable man, to be informed about the state of our republic during those most turbulent times, about which many have surely spoken much and variously among you. He has imposed this task on me according to the proverb: "saddles on an ox." I will, however, recount the matter from a higher perspective, though with a simple mind; it will be your part to overlook many things and not to observe everything with fixed eyes. But as to the matter at hand: within thirty years, actions have been taken more than once in the Three Leagues against those who are devoted to foreign lords, and sometimes very badly. Those who cared for the safety of the fatherland and had some wisdom continually moved every stone to uproot and drive away this corruption, the plague of all good things. But where there is a struggle over grain and pasture, as is now the custom of men, hardly any healthy exhortations or honest reasons are admitted; you know the saying: "the belly has no ears." Then, after the French alliance, as is usual, the concern for the fatherland of both the leaders and the wise and all fell asleep, and such laziness seized most within a few years that whatever pleased the lust and tyranny of a few, the rest seemed not only to endure but also to suffer. Ah, the calamity of things and wicked fortune! Finally, it had come to such a state of misery that the worst kind of men presided over all councils and assemblies, held all magistracies, and, what is abominable, bought and sold them, briefly ruled and daily propagated their faction more. But certainly, the Lord did not want these things to continue longer, and he stirred up two men from Bergell suitable for this business - one named Bartholom채us Stampa, the other Anton von Salis "de Run" from Salicibus, who is the captain of Valtellina - who labored partly because of this matter, partly because of private mutual hatreds and discord. With these beginnings, the matter became more perplexed, nor was Homeric Ate lacking. The Engadiners, a severe and justice-loving people, are added as allies. Hence, the king's envoy writes there to act more quietly, and many other things unworthy of a prudent man, adding fire to fire. The people are enraged; envoys are sent from the church, if it is permissible to speak thus, of one League according to the old custom. We call this League the House of God; it once obeyed the bishop. The envoys stir up the assembly; the crowd is divided into opposing factions; Stampa, in my judgment a good man, is accused by many as the author of the disturbances; for what they accused him of, he clearly explained to the judges, as was proper, to speak with Terence. What more?</p>
      <p>There is running back and forth; some are even sent from village to village to protest the institution and persuade the foolish populace not to subscribe to the authors of the matter. The Swiss fly in; they threaten our League with the greatest evil from the other two unless they desist from their undertaking. See what the advocacy of malice does. Meanwhile, there is consultation everywhere, but variably, as are the minds and affections of men; finally, the better part conquers the worse. A meeting is called here. Our senate acts like Proteus; for our town has almost the leaders of that most pestilent faction. But the effort is in vain. Behold, when the meeting was being agitated by our League and the most depraved men saw that their affairs were being dealt with, and they could not harm Stampa by any other way, they attack him and stir up a tumult. Arms are taken up, which happened three times and always turned out very well, thanks be to the Lord. You cannot believe how long we were in fear and danger. I will return to the subject.</p>
      <p>Judges, prosecutors, heralds, defenders of the judges, in short, whatever is usually constituted for this matter, are established in the district called Schwainigen, which is three German miles from our city, if I remember correctly. Some are summoned to court; a trial is held. No one comes. Others are summoned; they do the same. For they avoided this trial, as they say, worse than a dog and a snake. Meanwhile, everything is tumultuous and turbulent everywhere. Our people threaten the city unless we send those suspected and summoned for this matter, so to speak; we consult not once through the tribes and also with various assent. Those who fear for themselves do not tire nor rest until they break the institution of our League; for some feared that they would be compelled to plead their case from chains. Finally, a meeting of the Three Leagues is convened; the established trial is revoked. By whom? By those who least favored the undertaking. How well it then went for our envoys, you may conjecture. Can anything be considered in a seditious council that pertains to the tranquility of affairs? With the trial changed, those who had often thought of fleeing before regained their spirit - and some, I know not under what pretext, had already deserted the city - nor were their hopes entirely deceived; for they suffered almost nothing besides a monetary fine, which is nevertheless huge. Some were removed from offices, as they call them, for five years; but it is of little moment in my opinion if you compare it to the harm. Valentin Vatscherin, who has a wife from Zurich, was fined 100 crowns, Anton Travers 250, Peter Finer 60. I think you know only these. There are those who attribute these disturbances to the preachers of the gospel, but undeservedly, believe me; they have long done their duty, but they preached to the deaf. Their impudence is the cause. Our bishop does not hear well, who, besides what he had agreed with our lords, fortified his castle with foreign garrison and also secretly harbored some of our lords in the city, who stood separately in the sedition; for what purpose and by whom they were suborned or supplied, although nothing certain is held, the infamy nevertheless falls on the French and the little bishop. But hey, Bullinger, he will one day pay the penalty for this deed, unless I am mistaken. Our rustics will not let this pass. Do you want me to finally finish? I will add only this: the malicious envy of some has driven me and my vicar from the school and dragged us into I know not what hatreds, so that there are not lacking everywhere their pests for excellent things and institutions and their Satans for good men, may it be said without envy. I will now finish. There was a rumor here that war was being prepared in Italy; but those who come to us from there think and say otherwise. Some from the Three Leagues went to the king of France to serve as soldiers, but contrary to the king's expectation, if it is permissible to believe. After their departure, it was forbidden by our magistrate under severe penalty that anyone should follow them. Farewell, most learned Bullinger. Greet in my name Leo and Megander, with whom you may share this, I ask, and others who please you. Keep my handwriting carefully. If you have any news of German affairs, let us know; here we hear nothing of these matters. Chur, the day before the calends of May. Comander and Blasius greet you very much. To Heinrich Bullinger, a man endowed with eloquence no less than great learning.</p>
