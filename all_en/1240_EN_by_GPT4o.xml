      <p>From the letters, which you recently wrote to Martin Micronius, our colleague, most holy man, I received with great pleasure of mind that everything is still in good condition there with you.</p>
      <p>For which reason we give immortal thanks to our Lord God and pray with the most ardent wishes that God may preserve and govern you there with your churches. We have almost nothing new here. I suppose you have already heard about the liberation of Lord Hooper; he is now in his bishopric and teaches the people entrusted to him.</p>
      <p>Stephen, the Bishop of Winchester, has finally been deprived of his bishopric and is still detained in prison. In his place, a learned man and favoring piety, John Ponet, formerly the Bishop of Rochester, has been appointed. Not long after, Martin Bucer passed away. After his death, the Lord of Canterbury shared with me the plan to invite some learned men here. I therefore proposed Musculus, your Bibliander, and Castellio. He himself added Brentius; but when I said that he does not agree with us on the sacramental cause, he replied that he has already been admonished about this matter. I would very much wish, most holy man, to have some of yours here; for I already count Musculus among yours and have long known Bibliander to be your fellow minister. The task has already been given by the Lord of Canterbury to the very good man John Hales, to provide for the travel expenses of Musculus and Bibliander, if they wish to come. If you think it possible to persuade Castellio to come here, I ask you to inquire about it and then inform me. Your book on the sacraments, sent to me three years ago, is finally at the press; when it was recently brought to me with the rest of my library, I presented it to the Lord of Canterbury. He, upon hearing that it had not yet been published, wished it to be published, even if he had not read it, adding that your work needs no inspection. Therefore, it will be published soon. I will dedicate it to the royal sister, the most learned and pious virgin, Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>I would have sent you some copies if it had been completed; but it will be completed this week. Lord Bucer had begun a treatise on the sacraments shortly before he died, but he did not complete it; he had also begun, as I hear, to respond to me; but I have seen none of these, though I would have wished to see them.</p>
      <p>As far as I understand, he persisted in his opinion on the presence of the covenant and the real exhibition of the body and blood of Christ with the signs or in the signs or through the signs. I will soon send to you what he sent to me and what I replied to him in turn. Now, what remains, I diligently commend our church here to your prayers there and most dutifully bid all the brothers, your colleagues, farewell, especially our father Lord Pellicanus. I beg you, most upright man, to make an effort that we may have Musculus and Bibliander here, or if we cannot have Bibliander at all, that we may have someone from yours in his place. They will not lack travel expenses nor an honorable condition, provided they are not reluctant to come. Hastily in London, April 10, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, as much as he is, Johannes a Lasco.</p>
