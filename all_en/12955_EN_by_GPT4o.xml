    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has received the letter [No. 2891] from Blarer, in which he announced that he would only write in the future if there were verified news. However, Bullinger can hardly bear the silence of his correspondent, especially since so many rumors are circulating.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] At one time, it is announced that Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony has been captured, then again his release. At another time, it is said he has been defeated and Wittenberg completely destroyed, then again, he has won and Wittenberg is celebrating the victory. It is also said that Emperor Charles V has lost cannons and is acquiring new ones, or that his army is scattered and he is gathering a new one.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Since all this is always asserted with the same emphasis, it is completely unclear whom to believe. In Zurich, nothing certain is learned. Presumably, the Elector is in a bad situation. However, this corresponds to God's plans. One must pray! Blarer should communicate both conjectures and verified information. Christoph Froschauer is recommended to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Although in your last letter you testified to me, venerable brother in the Lord, that you would not write again unless you had the most certain news, and I have no doubt about your faith and diligence, it is nevertheless amazing to say how impatiently I bear your silence, especially amidst such a variety of rumors.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now it is said for certain that the Elector has been captured, then released again, now it is said he has been defeated and Wittenberg completely destroyed, then it is proclaimed he is victorious and celebrating in Wittenberg, that Emperor Charles V has lost cannons and is acquiring new ones, his army scattered, yet he is forming a new one.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>All these things are said with such equal certainty that you do not know whom to safely believe! Here in Zürich, we have no certain information. However, I fear the Elector's situation is worse than is beneficial. But what the Lord works is beneficial to the saints. Let us pray to Him to keep us. I beseech you, if you have any conjectures or certain information, write and have Froschauer recommended.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell with all yours. Zürich, May 23, 1547. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his dear Ambrosius Blarer. In Konstanz.</p>
