      <p>Greetings. I wrote through Mr. von Stein about the council, which I consider an abomination before the Lord. Regarding the people of Magdeburg, someone from Leipzig reports: they are surrounded on all sides, so that their exit is completely blocked; they are to be conquered by starvation, not by any other means. But soon, on St. Vitus' Day, they came to Mr. Marbach of Strasbourg, who reported thus: the emperor's army of enemies had ordered their men not to engage with the people of Magdeburg for a month. Upon learning this, the people of Magdeburg sent cattle to the famished enemy; for they are greatly suffering from a lack of resources, and when this broke out, the people of Magdeburg immediately followed in troops to the cattle and, acting bravely, killed and captured 4000 and gloriously brought their spoils back into the city. Soon a pious and learned man came to Mr. Theobald Schwarz of Strasbourg, reporting thus: three of their messengers had arrived in Aachen in one day and announced in this manner: Maurice, along with 24 nobles, had passed through Prussia on the night of St. John the Baptist and, recognized by the Prussians, was badly mistreated, wounded, and taken captive into Prussia. Thus spoke the man. Everyone wishes that the matter, if it has not happened thus, will happen immediately. About the former stratagem, it was written to Count Georg about eight days ago, whose letters Schertlius read and spread; however, I did not dare to believe it; now I almost believe it. About the latter, I thought it was just a rumor; now my mind is closer, we await the truth of the matter. Oh, what a remarkable deed, if the matter had happened thus.</p>
      <p>It is reported about a certain preacher, who in the army of Brandenburg openly cried out: all who persecute the people of Magdeburg persecute Christ himself. But while I was thinking about this matter, a booklet was sent, which contains such a sermon, and it is by Illyricus. This before the supplicatory sermon, so that the messenger would not leave empty-handed. Farewell with yours in Christ. Greet all friends. Basel, July 4, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
