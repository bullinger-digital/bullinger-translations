      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Especially dear lord and brother. As on last Easter, Jacob Riner, blessed, and I were sent for my gracious lords of Zurich by the command of all the brothers, the preachers in the Rhine Valley and Gotshaus, so that the established peace of the land would be clarified, and also which articles might break the peace of the land, we were hopeful that all matters would be brought to a point in the meantime that we could preach God's command freely and without hindrance, it is becoming more distant the longer it takes. For I want to keep nothing from you, that the abbot practices such tyranny in Gotshaus that it is pitiful. For on this last Friday, he sent his representatives to Berg with such arrogance and defiance, especially as the honest people opposed the Mass and the entire abomination, that they boldly declared that my lords of Zurich had told him in Frauenfeld to protect, shield, and uphold him in his lordship, justice, and all his practices, so that many honest people say that God must be complained to, that they want to protect him in the abomination and all idolatry. They have thus announced our benefices and have almost everywhere reestablished the papal Mass, which is greatly displeasing to the honest people, for especially in my parish (though no longer mine) over 600 people belong, and not a single person, neither woman nor man, desires it anymore. Yet the honest people are so eager and zealous for God's word that they would support the preachers at their own expense. However, the defiance and arrogance are so great that if my lords of Zurich do not take special action, we cannot remain. For the abbot's steward, Friedrich von Hadaham, has freely declared in the house of the bailiff in Berg that it is not right until his gracious lord salts four or five preachers in a tower and then cuts them into slices, so that heads fall off and blood splatters. The honest people have also requested that the Mass priest sing around 8 or 9 o'clock, so that they might also set up their preachers. This was completely denied, for he does not break the law, but one should not hinder him, even if he would only sing around 12 o'clock. Thus, on a certain Sunday, the preacher in Steinach could not preach because he was only able to sing around noon. I have not wanted to keep this from you out of special trust, which you have in the truth and all preachers.</p>
      <p>The pious and wise mayor of Watt has also asked me to write to you and report. Therefore, it is my friendly request and desire to advise me and all of us preachers on what to do. For, praise the Lord, the preachers are all brave and capable. If you would also advise, I would like to suffer that trusted, as mayor Rösten (for he himself has seen the capability and zeal in my congregation in recent days), would be informed, so that we are not overpowered, and the defiance and arrogance would be stopped. I will certainly rely on you, as will all brothers.</p>
      <p>With this, may God's grace protect us, and may the rich God also comfort us, so that we remain firm in his promise and cross, for he is a rich rewarder, temporally with the eternal. Amen.</p>
      <p>If my brother-in-law Gebhart Brunner meets you, tell him many good things and honors from me, also about the past dealings.</p>
      <p>Given in St. Gallen, on the 7th day of December in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Sebastian Grübel, your servant in Berg, your friendly brother.</p>
      <p>To the pious and faithful Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my special lord and brother.</p>
