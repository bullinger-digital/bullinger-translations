      <p>Greetings. Since you, my father, write to me so kindly and extensively despite your very poor health, I am ashamed of the brevity of my letters and no less ashamed to bother you with trivial nonsense, as we have and do almost nothing but nonsense otherwise. But, since this is the main thing, I give you great thanks in my and Johannes' name for your advice, to which he willingly agrees, and the news you sent us was no less welcome. We hope that, by God's grace, the churches of France will be restored to a more peaceful state. If only the state of our common homeland were better, so that we would not be forced to derive some joy from the misfortune of our confederates.</p>
      <p>But since they want and pursue this, let them enjoy these delights and finally realize what the reward of the Babylonian harlot is.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you. Greet my daughters, my sister, and our Heinrich for me, and encourage him to come to us soon, so that his wife does not languish too much from longing for him.</p>
      <p>In Girenbad, June 26.</p>
      <p>Josias Simler.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, my honorable father.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
