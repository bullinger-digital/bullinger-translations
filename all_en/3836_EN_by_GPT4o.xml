      <p>Greetings. By the grace of the Lord, I have extricated myself from the Lausanne mission recently entrusted to me; for nothing more burdensome could have befallen me. Others are being sent who will handle everything more effectively than I could have managed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I do not know what is yet to come; we await the outcome. Our Englishmen from Aarau, through Lever, the bearer of these letters, today requested dismissal from our senate, having given thanks for the hospitality granted to them; thus they were dismissed with good grace and with the great congratulations of all the pious.</p>
      <p>We indeed fear that it may be too soon; but while we consider their presence to be necessary, we cannot disapprove of their decision. Meanwhile, testimonial letters are given to them, regarding how they conducted themselves, and since they used me as an interpreter with the senate, I also proposed, with the counsel of Mr. Consul Negelin, what you recently wrote to me about writing letters to the queen. These pleased the senate so much that they decided to send letters to the queen with these very ones to be delivered.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is not necessary for yours to write again to ours about this matter, but that they themselves also write to the queen, which you will easily accomplish with yours. Otherwise, I have nothing to write now; they are in a hurry, so I too had to hurry. All of ours greet you, especially Musculus.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 11, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
