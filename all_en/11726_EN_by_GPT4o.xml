    <p xml:id="regest1">News from Antwerp: On October 6, the troops captured Düren, which must pay 60,000 guilders; the next day, the council was deposed, and the citizens had to swear allegiance to Emperor [Charles V] and take on the maintenance of 200 soldiers; the mayor [Jakob König] has left the city. The troops also moved to Jülich, which surrendered on October 10; Hambach Castle [in Niederzier-Hambach] was captured, while other places had to swear an oath and support the troops; they are now moving to Bergheim near Cologne, a group is supposed to be stationed in front of "Irrtordt" [Sittard in Limburg?] - soon the whole land of Jülich will be taken. Now the likely easy conquest of Kleve is at hand, the troops will winter in Jülich; it is still unclear how the cities of Gelderland will behave; the secret agreements of Duke [Wilhelm of] Jülich[-Berg-Kleve-Geldern] with [King Francis I] have been uncovered; allegedly, Duke Wilhelm wants to ask his brother-in-law Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony and Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] for help, which could end in a bad war. The war between England and Scotland is not yet decided, the Scottish King [James I] wants to make peace. Rumor has it that the Dauphin [Henry] is dead and the [French] King [Francis I] is ill; in Jülich, there are 800 soldiers and 300 horses; all had to swear allegiance to the Emperor; the soldiers under Martin van Rossem will fare badly; in Jülich, there were many goods from Frankfurt, Leipzig, and Augsburg, so the soldiers made good loot; the cities of Gelderland are negotiating in Antwerp with the Queen [Maria of Hungary, Regent of the Netherlands]. An ambassador from Spain, the Archbishop of Santiago [de Compostela, Gaspar de Ávalos], has arrived with 200 people and great splendor to negotiate a marriage between the Emperor and [Maria], the daughter of King [Henry VIII]. Reports from Vienna say that the [imperial] troops are retreating in disgrace and lost about a thousand men during the siege of Pest; many soldiers are ill, and the money is running out; may God have mercy. Writes to [Konrad] Pellikan about the death of Jo[hannes] Z[wicks], which saddens him. Greetings to [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>

      <p>October 17 in Antwerp: On October 6, our troops came before Düren, fired six shots, held a speech, and after shooting through the town hall, it was agreed that Düren would be surrendered at mercy and unmercy; they had to pay sixty thousand florins, of which ten thousand were to be used to fortify the city. On October 7, the great Hanses rode in with 400 horses, deposed the council, and both young and old had to swear allegiance to the Duke of Brabant and the Emperor, and they also had to maintain 200 soldiers at their own expense; the bailiff has retreated.</p>
      <p>Further, our troops moved towards Jülich, in between a castle 1 1/2 miles from Düren, called Hambach; from the castle, they have 1 1/2 miles to Jülich. The city surrendered on the 10th of the same month with the reservation of life and property, as those of Düren had done; however, they will also have to pay a large sum of money. Hambach is the castle where the prince and the old lady held court; they found it half open, with wine and other necessities along with a cannon; it is not known if they burned it. But all other castles and villages belonging to the nobles, which were passed through Brabant, have been burned; some have been ransomed, taking an oath from them, and they must further supply provisions for the soldiers. Now they have moved on towards Bergheim, which lies three miles from Jülich towards Cologne; they will surrender soon; then one will lie before Erftstadt; it will also surrender, so that the land of Jülich is almost completely taken.</p>
      <p>Now they will go to the land of Cleves; there is no resistance; for our troops are getting stronger and stronger, and the army will stay in the land of Jülich this winter. And with the cities in the land of Gelderland, there is still no clear decision on what they want to do; they are holding daily meetings with them. The secrets of the Duke of Jülich with the French have come to light. He is supposed to call upon his brother-in-law, the Elector of Saxony, and the Landgrave; it is not believed that they will take his side; otherwise, it would be a bad war. With the English and Scots, it is still the same: one does not hear that they have fought each other, only that they are strong in the field. The Scot desires peace; the others do not want to do so.</p>
      <p>It is said to be true that the Dauphin is dead and the king is ill. In Jülich, there are 800 soldiers and 300 horses; they all had to swear allegiance to the Emperor; but as for the knights who were with Martin von Rossau, things will go badly for them. There was much wealth in Jülich, which came from Frankfurt, Leipzig, and Augsburg; it has all been seized and made prize; the soldiers have had good loot; it is to be feared that there were thalers and silver among it. The cities of Gelderland are now here in Antwerp, negotiating with the queen; peace might still be negotiated.</p>
      <p>Also, an ambassador from Spain has come, namely an archbishop of St. James, with 200 people and great triumph, supposed to negotiate the marriage between the Emperor and the King of England; it is believed that the marriage with the Englishman's daughter and the Emperor will have its course. So much from Antwerp.</p>
      <p>From Vienna, it is written that ours are withdrawing with mockery and disgrace and have lost up to a thousand men in the storm before Pest; many soldiers are sick, and there is no more money available, and the previous expenses were in vain. God have mercy on our sins!</p>
      <p>Nothing further, my Bullinger, was possible. I write here to our most holy Pellicanus about the death of Johannes Zwick, which affects me so much that I greatly desire to free myself from the bonds of this flesh and the filth of the world as soon as possible. Greet, as lovingly as you can, in my words, Gualther, an excellent friend, to whom I wish I could write as much as I want, also with the benefit of time.</p>
