      <p>S. I received your letter promptly and was very surprised that you tempered the final clause with such words, as if you suspected that I was somewhat upset by your previous letters or certainly felt hurt. But, dearest Bullinger, I am so delighted with the freedom of all those whom I have in the book of friends, especially yours, who holds the first place among them, that even if you were to write more sharply than what could be excused by the right of freedom, I would love you all the more for that very reason, because I would see in those words a person worthy of sincere and genuine friendship. For unless I am mistaken, there will never be true friendship that is sprinkled with pretense; but freedom is contrary to pretense and plainly hostile to it, which I have certainly used in my own way in my writings to you when I was to persuade you of the truth. For unless I loved you from the heart, I would never write freely; indeed, I would not write everything unless I had long experienced your remarkable kindness towards me. But enough of this. Regarding what you write about the remaining Decades of your sermons, I would like to ask you to ensure that, as soon as they are printed, a copy is sent to me. I have and read the first two with great benefit, which I think would not be complete if I had to do without your other works.</p>
      <p>Vergerius has returned from Basel to the Rhaetians. We do not know the reason for this, but we hear that he has been appointed to a prominent church to lead the people who have been redeemed by the blood of God. I truly promise myself that he will be not only a learned but also a sincere minister of the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Germany, it has become completely quiet again, and the preparations have completely subsided, although the arrival of the emperor is awaited; and some think that Caesar will, according to his custom and nature, initially attempt to recover with cunning rather than force. Therefore, letters have been written from certain places here to us in St. Gallen, stating that the Confederates have well prepared themselves so that they do not separate but remain united; for the plan to install the Duke of Savoy is certainly present. However, there is also concern about the plan to influence certain places so that they burden themselves with those from Bern at least; from which, however, a public separation would be recovered, as it was also recovered in Milan years ago, when they withdrew from each other from the field and we had to endure the defeat at Marignano alone. But in this matter, the separation would have to be expected to be of much greater danger than ever before; therefore, with all loyalty, the heads should be held together. Lord Nicholas of Meggen was at Wila with Antronius a few days ago. Antronius then went to Rorschach, accompanied only by Captain Escher; for the chancellor and the master of the court were absent. There, around the 10th day of this month, two companions, sworn to the emperor, Friedrich of Fürstenberg and Hugo of Montfort, visited him, having arrived by ship.</p>
      <p>This abbot has shown much honor for a day until four and held a good carnival. But who would be so foolish as not to suspect that this was done with remarkable hypocrisy for the public, while in reality, something else was being done with the monk, who for many months now has not only been suspected by those men but has also conspired with other distinguished men across the lake. Antronius excellently abuses the simplicity of the captains, clouding their minds with false pretenses and meanwhile keeping them far from secrets. And although there are no plans concerning temporal matters, there will still be something concerning the bishopric of Constance, for which reason both aforementioned counts have recently held much counsel in Überlingen together with the abbot of Weingarten. Meanwhile, rumors are flying that Antronius does not agree much with the Bishop of Constance; how true this is is evident from the fact that the bishop's prefect (as I tell you) received the captain with his wife and daughter at the Arbor Felix with a solemn banquet. Thus, everything goes on under the hat, and the good man is too pious for these people, nor can he think that in these actions at least something quite rebellious and swift against our true and wholesome religion is being undertaken and practiced. May God protect us from evil. I entrust this to you alone and to Lord Lavater with utmost faith.</p>
      <p>Our people have written from Augsburg that there is a new pope, who is of the French party; they do not write what his name is. The emperor proposed four; but none could last long. That may be or not; but it is certain that the Marquis of Müs is strongly positioned before Parma and it is to be feared that if help is not provided quickly, they will catch the emperor. In short, unrest will be present, God knows where they will direct their head. It might happen that they will turn towards us.</p>
      <p>May God grant it.</p>
      <p>The dean of our monastery is said to have become the abbot of Wettingen; he will be quite suitable as an abbot. Moreover, he is adorned with all those virtues in reality, which the apostle attributes in the second letter to Timothy to those who have the form of godliness but deny its power. I have no doubt that this pot will have a most worthy lid. But I burden you with too many things. Farewell, therefore, and greet all our people in my name, especially the lords of the council and that hero Lavater, a man worthy of heaven and an ornament of your city. St. Gallen, February 21, 1550.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most distinguished city of Zurich, lord and most esteemed friend.</p>
