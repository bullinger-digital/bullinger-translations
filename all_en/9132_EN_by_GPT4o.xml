      <p>Venerable and well-learned sir, on the 8th of this month, with Heinrich Zily, I sent you my latest letter, along with what was assigned to me at Rottenstein. Since then, I have received your letter along with the documents; I managed them on the 12th of this month. I thank you very much for the news, as well as the gifts, which I have shared with our dear lord preachers, who send you their kind and devoted greetings; they have let Mr. Kessler know the story before I sent it. My dear wife and I would also like to send you something that would please you; if we had something, it would be yours. Our people from Lyon have arrived, praise be to God, as I have reported. The Duke of Montpensier is said to have told his brother-in-law, the Duke of Guise, that when they had the pious Mr. Pigremont hanged, it was too much; they should see that it does not cause regret. From Nuremberg, I have heard that Ferdinand is to become king in Poland. That is all I have at this time. In ill. I thought ZÃ¶ger would stay until tomorrow. God be with you, yours, and all of us, amen. Greet Mr. Walther and other gentlemen for me, etc.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant always, Hans Liner. To the venerable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful servant of the Church of Christ, my honorable and beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
