He assures that he has not entered into a forbidden secret marriage, but only promised the girl in question that he would marry her upon his return, provided she was still unmarried and her parents consented; his relative, who was the only one privy to this, likely exaggerated.

      <p>Greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>It has not escaped me, most learned and beloved father Bullinger, that you have misinterpreted my letters; this is easily indicated by the certain fervor and passion with which your letters are filled. How much these have driven me into storms of sorrow, how many heaps of sadness they have placed upon my head, cannot be said or believed. Besides the fact that I receive these grave letters from you, yet mixed with paternal advice, I also receive grave ones from my brother, who reports a significant calamity regarding our estate, namely that our relatives are squandering our patrimony. As for the matter in which you accuse me of being guilty and thunder against me with the gravest of words (first in deliberative, discussing what kind of fault this is, then demonstratively arguing that clandestine marriages are prohibited; thirdly, in the judicial form, you accuse me of impiety and ingratitude, as if I do not respond to the benefits received, but pollute myself with the filth and incontinence of my life), our stance will be one of denial, namely that I have not married her nor intended that through letters, which you perhaps infer. For if I were to affirm that I had married her, I would be worthy of being refuted for lying. For, dearest father, the divine commandment has not escaped me, nor am I unaware of the divine will, which forbids illegitimately contracted marriages. Never, even if I could have ensnared her with the most convenient reasons, did I consider piety to be lesser than affections. This, therefore, which you infer, alas, how it stings my soul, namely that I have made a pious, honorable man's daughter rebellious (alienated), yes, even deceived her, and even more: that she has suffered disgrace at my hands. Should not these things move one's soul? Even a diamond would admit these wounds; even the rigid Battus would feel this. Ah, why do you level these accusations? Why have you conceived such an opinion of me? Do you think me so ignorant of the divine law, which is handled daily, or do you consider me to lead such an incontinent life? Do you think me so prone to ingratitude? For how could this be called a contract, when I have promised her nothing more than what I indicated in previous letters, namely, if I am called back to my homeland safely and she is still unmarried, I will marry no one else but her, as long as it can be done with the consent, advice, and will of her parents. Can or should this be called a marriage? For I did not write to you, dearest father Bullinger, that I had married her, but so that she and I could better adhere to these promises. Why would I marry a wife, either her or any other, against the wishes of either you (who are like parents to me) or her parents? Therefore, I both deny and refute and reject that I have contracted marriage with her and alienated her from her father (which would be the greatest theft). Nor has it escaped me that my relative has so disturbed your mind, who also tried to persuade me that I had married her and promised her too much. This indeed leads you to such a great and false suspicion against us. But God, the best and greatest, is my witness if I have promised her anything more or less than what I have just mentioned. Do not think that I have spoken of this matter to my relative, whom I know to be full of leaks, but only to his wife, my relative, whose faith and silence I do not doubt at all. No other people have discovered this. Therefore, dearest father Bullinger, do not persuade yourself of such grave accusations against me, do not let your mind be led. You know who I am, who would rather leave my soul than conceal anything from you as the most faithful parent. You have what I promised her, what she promised me. To better adhere to these promises on both sides (with all valid reasons considered), we have informed you, as the most faithful parent and silent supporter, of my relative's advice. I will always use your most salutary advice, to whom I do not hesitate to reveal the secrets of my soul, who will also be regarded as a parent to me throughout my life.</p>
      <p>You will learn the state of external affairs and our studies from the letters of Johannes Volphius (if I am not mistaken). We are still waiting for and desiring letters from Gwalther from Marburg. I consider that I must experience all these things; it will also be pleasant to remember them one day. God will grant, after these storms of misfortune, a calm serenity in His Christ. He will also enrich and clothe us with doctrine and virtues if we have executed our duty piously and holily, which indeed we will hasten to do with the utmost piety and holiness under the guidance of Jesus.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and love your Johannes Haller, not as you now think him to be, but as you wished him to be, as you are accustomed to, and consider our importunate matters kindly; for I could not write better due to the departure of the messenger. Greet your mother, wife, and children a thousand times for me. In TÃ¼bingen, on the Nones of June in the year of salvation 1540.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, entirely yours, as you know.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his faithful and dear lord and father. Zurich, at the Great Minster.</p>
