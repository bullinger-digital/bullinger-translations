      <p>Greetings. Now at last, most reverend father, I send to you the final actions of this Chur forum, which I have described more willingly for your favor, because I remember you mentioned in some letters written to me last year: that there are people among you who specifically accuse me of being the author and leader of the Rhaetian seditions. I truly respond that he is not an honest man nor worthy of any trust, who does not shudder to condemn me of such a crime, especially without a trial, based solely on rumor. If I, with my colleague or alone, bear this suspicion, why then did the most honorable senate of this city, why did the very frequent assemblies of the Rhaetians receive our protests with a kind face? Why did they not rightly punish us, the protestors, with punishment, when in the midst of the assembly of fathers we affirmed that there are notorious scoundrels who attempt to transfer the blame of this evil onto us? Or why did the Upper League remain more silent than a fish, when the senate of this city, while the Rhaetian ruler still stood, excused us with public letters to the same league, which were later also publicly reviewed in the first capital trial when the matter and cause stood at the extreme fortune? Nor do I doubt, since not so long ago the envoys of the Pagans flew in, who hate us worse than a dog and a snake, that they most insidiously inquired into our customs and speeches with oars and sails, as they say, whence, if we were so criminal, without a doubt they would have devised not one punishment for our necks. They are also mistaken, who think that foreign men would not have dared so much against us, since no one is unaware, by whose instigations this last forum was established in the episcopal castle. What indeed was the end and aim of this? Was it not that the leaders and princes of these disturbances, having been brought to light, should pay the penalty for their crime? So indeed it is. Why then did those reformers pass us ministers by?</p>
      <p>Why did they not summon me to the same court, if I seem to you such a vociferator, if I contaminated myself with the same crime as the seditious innovators of things?</p>
      <p>Could our sin have been hidden from them? Not at all. For indeed, a singular inquiry about us was held in the tortures of some. Why then do others accuse us of sedition, whose blame even the most severe tortures could not extort from us? Surely faith is to be had in the past royal envoy, a stupid, wicked, adulterous man born for insults, quarrels, and the most turbulent disturbances.</p>
      <p>He may have said whatever he wanted at the Baden assemblies and may have touched me with whatever slanders and perhaps burdened me among some of his own kind: yet I consider it a great consolation to be free from guilt, and all Rhaetia will never be able to forget what kind of stench the most frivolous man left behind him.</p>
      <p>Bribes, gifts, royal stipends, bloody military service, injustice, simulations, and domestic hatreds and other sins of this kind or rather of this bran laid the foundations for these tumults. This is that Helen, for whose desire the kings of the Achaeans did not hesitate to sweat so much. Let those of yours now go, who so rashly sharpen their tongues against Christ, against the word of Christ, and against innocent ministers, and warned by the example of others, let them seek and blame the cause of our evils in those very ones, to whom they have lent ears more kindly than is fair, as to the most wicked informers. These things, my most esteemed father, I have been pleased to write to you, so that it would not be obscure to you with what conscience I enjoy. I therefore ask that you interpret all these things in a milder part and have me, as a son far removed from this crime, committed to your paternal care and benevolence. Forgive me indeed; for I have written everything quickly.</p>
      <p>Chur of the Rhaetians, January 19, 1574.</p>
      <p>The consul and all our friends here send you greetings. I bid greetings to Mr. Haller, my most esteemed relative. Gantner has not yet departed; for new monsters are being nurtured.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your excellence, Tobias Egli. To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant and illustrious bishop of the church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich to the pastor at the Great Minster.</p>
