      <p>Greetings. I write briefly, as our messenger is about to depart. You have learned from your delegates what happened in Aarau. Your letter and the meeting in Aarau have achieved so much that the matter will again be brought before the council and citizens. The messengers have ridden well to Baden; however, they will be written to again. Today, all my lords who are out have been informed. What to hope for in the meantime, I do not know. The general citizenry would be good; the leaders are troubled. Many think it could be made worse, but not better. We perform our duty; in every sermon, we speak about this to everyone, and we also approach the council, as I recently wrote. But our evangelical people return to the point where they care little for the words 'THE MOUTH OF THE LORD HAS SPOKEN.' I await what you will write through Apiarius.</p>
      <p>The letters I send here, I received from Calvin yesterday. I read Peter Martyr's letters, as they were open. I hope the matter in Geneva will turn out well; I dare not write how things are going with them; but they, in their wisdom, bear the importunity, not to say the impropriety, beautifully. Perhaps Calvin will say something about these matters; he is set as a sign to which there is opposition.</p>
      <p>Farewell. In haste. Greet the brother; I could not write to him now. May all yours be safe. Bern, 28th October 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To Wolfgang von Erlach, departing for Baden, I have transcribed all the scripture passages and handed over all other arguments collected both from your letters and from elsewhere relevant to this matter, along with some passages from the Fathers and canon law, gathered through Musculus's work.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest lord and compatriot. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
