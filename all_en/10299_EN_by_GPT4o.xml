      <p>Greetings from Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear brother, know that I was in Bremgarten on Wednesday; our Anni, who was at the bridge with Jacob and involved in the matter of the accepted judgment, told me that he was very angry, and Hediger did not want to show him anything. However, he wants to let it be with such a thing, that we pay him the money in cash within 14 days, otherwise it will not be valid for him, because he wants to have the money (yes, Saint Velti). I reported the matter to Schodeler; he said he must take the letter and keep it, he has delayed in Ottenbach, and we should proceed with ours; he does not want to let it be delayed any longer, etc. The letters will be with me by Saturday.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Hartigel, along with his wife, came to me in the little house and wanted to give me 20 Rhenish guilders, which I did not want, since house, barn, and garden are all in a row. Such and all those who were present at the purchase (when the Vogtli gave it to Marthi to buy), were not intended, I was also with Vogtli; he addressed me as the letter states, and with such an intention, I gave it to him to buy, yet they desire to improve the letter. If you can send it to me with this messenger, I can present it on Saturday, as I promised. Vogtli said that if the 20 guilders are lying there, we must take it and give him the letter. He and Hartigel urged us to take such money, since the 50 guilders are still well on the house. Write me a response, and if there is any news.</p>
      <p>Farewell, greet the family.</p>
      <p>I have given my horse, which is very fat and beautiful, to Rudi Staffar, who wants to ride it to Zurich and sell it. Hoping for good luck.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes.</p>
      <p>If the letters arrive, I will come to you on Tuesday and bring the money and letters; should I take it otherwise? It seems to me that we still have sufficient security.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother in Zurich.</p>
