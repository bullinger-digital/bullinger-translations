      <p>Greetings in Christ! At the end of last December, I received your letter (dearest Mr. Bullinger), written on August 24th, the day on which the Admiral and other nobles, along with a great multitude of the faithful, were slaughtered in Paris with monstrous and unheard-of cruelty. This is the fruit brought to us by that excellent French alliance, from which we had hoped for so much good. There were indeed the infamous Sicilian Vespers before; but these (so to speak) French matins leave them far behind. The Lord sees this and will demand an account. Many exiles from France have flocked to London, and among them many ministers of the churches, who are kindly received there with hospitality and are supported by the alms of the pious.</p>
      <p>Our affairs, after that controversy about rites was settled, were very peaceful for a while; when suddenly some rather virulent pamphlets appeared, secretly printed against the laws, in which almost the entire external polity of our church was attacked. For they think that archbishops and bishops should be completely brought into order; that ministers of the church should be elected only by the people; that equality should be established among ministers; that in every city, town, parish, or village, a consistory should be erected, consisting of the pastor and elders of that place, who alone should judge all ecclesiastical matters: that the Anglican Church scarcely has any appearance of a Christian church; that no fixed form of ecclesiastical prayers should be prescribed, but that in sacred assemblies each minister should pray as the Holy Spirit dictates: that the infants of obstinate papists, as far as the use of baptism is concerned (I use their words), are unclean, yet not therefore to be excluded from divine election: I pass over many other things, which would be too long to recount. But recently a royal edict was promulgated, which provides that such infamous pamphlets should not be published hereafter; which will (I hope) retard their efforts. The young men who spread these have their supporters, especially among those who covet church goods: but I am glad that Humphrey and Sampson and some others, who previously raised questions about rites, are completely alien to this faction.</p>
      <p>The Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, about which I wrote before, was battered by our English artillery for twenty continuous days, and finally, on May 28th last, was forced to surrender: punishment was inflicted on the leaders. Therefore, all of Scotland is now brought to the obedience of the boy; completely alienated from the French because of the disparity of religion and the cruelty exercised against the faithful last year; and most devoted to our queen, who has so often delivered the Scots into freedom; which you can easily infer from the enclosed verses, printed in Edinburgh. The affairs of France are well known to you. In Holland and Zeeland, the Prince of Orange is superior at sea; on land, the outcome is always uncertain.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on His church, and at last put an end to these evils, so that we may glorify Him with one voice; may He preserve your piety for His church in safety for as long as possible!</p>
      <p>York, the last day of July, 1573.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you in the Lord, Edmund of York.</p>
      <p>Postscript. I have decided (God willing) to send you something of our μνΗμοσθνον at the spring fair: which was not prepared now due to the negligence of the craftsman.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful minister of the Church of Zürich, brother and dearest fellow in the Lord.</p>
