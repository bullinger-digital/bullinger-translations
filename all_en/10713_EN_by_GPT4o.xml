      <p>Greetings. I will not have the opportunity, dearest Heinrich, to thank you, let alone repay your kindness. You know, having experienced it many times, how eager I am for your writings and also for those that I hear are recommended by you, as they have greatly contributed to my ministry, however small it may be. Now, since such a holy opportunity has presented itself, that you have particularly endeavored to make me a participant in so many of Theodor's writings, I have decided: Where you do not easily believe they should be printed, I absolutely wish to keep them at the assigned price, however poor I may be and despite my health consuming everything, as well as that daily expense, which Sulczerus has sometimes indicated to you. But if they should indeed be printed, you know how reluctantly I would not buy them. Therefore, I entrust everything to your paternal spirit towards me. Do what seems best to you. However, you will do nothing, of that I am most convinced, that is not also most convenient for me. I am sending you two crowns, so that if it seems to you that I should buy them, you may give them to the widow. But if, due to poverty, a third crown is needed, either you will lend it in my name or write to the prefect of Lenzburg. He will not fail to pay in my name. I would also wish that when you want to send the volumes, you send them to Lenzburg through the prefect's messenger, who delivers this to you, well protected, so that neither storm nor rain may harm them, to the prefect himself. He will ensure they are safely returned to me, or I will send a messenger from us there to bring them. I am still dealing with Genesis for the sermons from the beginning, from which I would very much wish, since I hear that only 31 chapters were completed by that deceased brother, that the remaining ones be completed on spare days, so that by Easter I could have the remaining part with the writing fee well paid.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am sending you Capito's letters, which you should return with your advice and response, so that we can also agree with you.</p>
      <p>My pious colleague Franz Kolb has certainly passed away from this world with a blessed death, whose memory will not easily fade. Although Conzenus teaches piously and with the applause of the whole church, this Christian heart has consoled me greatly.</p>
      <p>On the 20th of this month, our delegates will meet the Duke of Savoy in Aosta to negotiate peace without arbitrators.</p>
      <p>I sent a copy of your letters, written by my hand, to the exiled Solothurners through a certain messenger. I advised them to send to you a brother of the Roggenbachs, otherwise most well-equipped in all matters, but not from the number of those nine who now live with us in Nidau. Whether they have done so, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell and continue as you have begun and always done, so that I am never abandoned by you as my father.</p>
      <p>Indeed, my days are short, unless the Lord preserves me by a miracle.</p>
      <p>Your parish priest from Rifferswil near the chapel was with us these days. When he comes to you, he will be able to report what he has seen.</p>
      <p>I will send the third crown to the widow as soon as you write, or if she cannot wait, do as I indicated above.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>November 13, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your B. H.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his especially kind lord and brother.</p>
