    <p xml:id="regest1">Has received Bullinger's letters and expresses understanding for his prolonged silence due to illness and work overload; praises his influence extending far beyond Zurich. Megander showed him a letter from Bullinger and reported on the meeting with Leo [Jud]; that the matter did not come before the council is solely thanks to Haller. Asks Bullinger to resolve the discord among the Basel people. A suitable successor for Franz [Kolb] and also for himself is not in sight; might Bullinger perhaps be willing to come to Bern? Asks him to send his [Karlstag speech]. Would have resigned his office if Schultheiß von Wattenwyl had not persuaded him to stay. Cannot procure Vives' "De subventione pauperum" for him. Hints at concerns regarding the monastery property. Requests confidentiality.</p>

      <p>S. How much I have grieved that you have not written to me for so many days, dearest brother, you have understood from the recent letters sent through Burkhard. The pain was partly mitigated because I did not receive the letters already prepared in April - meanwhile, others were already on their way through Studer from St. Gallen -, partly increased by your poor health, as you write that you are suffering from fevers and are so overwhelmed by so many and untimely labors that you cannot fulfill what you owe to both the churches and the brothers. May the Lord restore and add to your strength, so that what you have begun for the glory of His name and the edification of many churches, you may also be able to complete with His help. Recognize yourself, my Heinrich, as an organ and instrument of the Lord, which He uses not only towards the people of Zurich but also towards the Germans, French, English, and all those eager for divine truth, for their knowledge and our salvation. I write without flattery: I do not recognize you as the apostle of the people of Zurich only, but of the whole church. Therefore, continue, as long as you can, in your Pauline work, and you will do a most pleasing thing to God and the world. I will never fail you in my prayers, nor will the church, nor will others who are helped by your works through the Lord. I owe everything to the Lord, much to Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and Luther, but the most to you. Although I have been a preacher in Bern for almost 16 years, I have felt more progress since the calamitous war and from the time you took me under your instruction than in many years before. One thing I lack is that I cannot hear you in person. You have the outpouring of my love for you again and again, and so truly, how truly I wish God to be my favorable judge on that great day, and nothing disturbs me more than when silence intervenes for some time. For I always fear that ill-disposed people have defiled our friendship.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Megander showed the letters you wrote in the town of Büren, where I met him returning. He commended Leo and after much extorted tears, because I could not meet either of you. But I must write this to you alone, if I had not been there, the matter would have come to your answer for advice and not to a familiar conversation. Now God always arranges it, as much as I strive for unity, that I always stand therein.</p>
      <p>Now, dear Heinrich, Rudolf Fry from Basel has today brought some ways with kernels to our fire, indicating the discord among the Basel brothers. If you wish to have the matter entrusted to you, that it may be removed, and it would not harm if you yourself appeared in their synod, where the matter should be taken up again in the presence of Capito. However, I know well that you know more about this matter than I do.</p>
      <p>In our city, things are somewhat. Franz can no longer preach, so a goiter has grown on him. We will both, with the help of Rellicanus, who now preaches twice, do the beast on the next fast. But what about you, dear, can you not be brought from Zurich, while so many of your learned ones, no one is with us? Dear, open yourself once and show how it is possible or impossible, for it is said by our magistrate, if I desired your service, you would not refuse, only show appropriate means to acquire such. You know Megander's nature; if the other also had such a head, it would be done. Simply, they both will not have the authority before the people or the magistrate to accomplish anything, however learned they may be. I am perpetually failing. If it does not succeed for me or someone takes over the province next to me and while I am alive, I do not know where the church can call him. I am completely at a loss, do not know where to go. Simon does not have the speech for preaching in our great minster; fears, Rellicanus will also lack. Now I would not oppose preaching if I had one who would also take other things from me. Megander is weak, spares himself excellently. I cannot, they do not allow me the leisure, even if I am already lying in bed. Beloved brother, please consider these things and write to me how to deal with these matters. Furthermore, what you wrote about the moderation to be observed in the matter of providence, predestination, and free will, if they are not published, please send them to me. For you do not ignore what you wrote to me about this matter some years ago and I in turn to you.</p>
      <p>One more thing: I was inclined this fast and even after Easter to leave my province here, but the Schultheiß von Wattenwyl persuaded me otherwise.</p>
      <p>I cannot find Vives' "De subventione pauperum" in Basel.</p>
      <p>The devil will deceive us with the monastery property.</p>
      <p>That is enough for now. Dear, let it remain with you what I write here. I will explain better in the next letter and send you your copy back. Always consider me most commended to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May the Lord restore you to your former health, so that you may be of service to His church.</p>
      <p>10th of May, in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, as much and as little as he is, B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
