      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most esteemed man, on the first day of December, and indeed nothing could have been more welcome to me; for it delighted me twice over, partly because it consoled my complaining spirit, which was quite troubled due to the miserable condition of the pious, and restored it to calm, and partly because it showed that your goodwill and love towards me are not ordinary, as you, setting aside all your affairs, did not disdain to respond to my writings, and even handed over the letter to the messenger in the mixed crowd of merchants, wishing me well with your own mouth. From this, it was clearly given to me to understand that you not only regard me but indeed hold me in high esteem.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, from your letters, I understood that it is not advisable for the church to respond to all the slanders of the sycophants, to retaliate slander with slander, to gnaw with a Theonine tooth, by which manner of writing the pious are more offended than advanced in piety. You affirm that it is more worthy of Christian candor to handle the matter of Christ with a certain sincere modesty rather than to overturn it with inconsiderate importunity, yet with this end, that we do not imprudently overlook everything and play in religion, but rather vigorously refute and confute the errors and trifles of the impious, so that it may soon become clear to the simple and good, in which miserable errors they are entangled, and they may choose to hate these worse than a snake. I go along with your opinion wholeheartedly; for experience, the teacher, has long since taught me that naked and simple truth builds more than if it is sprinkled with biting wit and taunts. Your sound principle pleases me greatly, namely, to act as a theologian, not a sycophant.</p>
      <p>Therefore, continue in your holy purpose of completing the Decades; your plan and labor will be approved by all the pious, and it will greatly benefit those who have devoted themselves to sacred philosophy; for through the index, you promise to respond learnedly, circumspectly, and quite maturely to the enemies of the gospel, thus refuting and overturning their bombast, lies, babblings, and dreams, so that it is clear enough to the good that the faithless and reprobate men, with their imposture exposed, have been routed and put to flight by you. Perhaps you will bring back the weary ox by planting your foot more firmly. I would call myself fortunate if I were ever allowed to enjoy those labors of yours. For this, we will pray to the Lord with unwearied prayers, that under His auspices the Decades may be completed and published for the use of the church as soon as possible. But above all, take care of your health as well, lest, worn out by immense labors, you become either infirm or perish in your writings, and in the end, be of little use to the church. We rejoice over such a man, who by merit of knowledge and a life of integrity is to be preferred to all, not only in our Switzerland but as a light and ornament of the entire Catholic church. Therefore, see to it that you also take such care of your body, that you may be able to be of use to the Lord, to yourself, and to us, lest, exhausted by untimely cares and labors, you become empty and finally be snatched away by premature death. Farewell, most distinguished man, and take my writings in good part; for my intention is not to disturb your affairs any longer, unless a very urgent matter arises. Farewell again, and count me in the catalog of your friends.</p>
      <p>Given in Glarus on the 3rd day of December.</p>
      <p>Fridolin Brunner, your brother and friend in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Minster in ZÃ¼rich, my kind lord and friend, to his hands.</p>
