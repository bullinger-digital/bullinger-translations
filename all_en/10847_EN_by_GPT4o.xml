    <p xml:id="regest1">Shares Luther's invitation letter to a meeting in Eisenach on May 14, which he already received on April 24 with an accompanying letter from Bucer; he has been waiting for the council's position for so long. Bucer wrote extensively to dispel the concerns of the people of Konstanz; Zwick was delegated to the convent, but this is extremely burdensome for him if [Bullinger and Pellikan] do not accompany him. Bucer would welcome the participation of Vadian, Bullinger, and Pellikan. Zwick also urgently desires their presence, as he estimates their influence to be higher than his own; he hopes to receive their commitment through the messenger, a refugee from Rottweil. He has written the same to Vadian. Luther is responsible for the short notice.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace of Christ Jesus be with you.</p>
      <p>On the 24th of this month, I received a letter from Bucer, in which he informed me of the day of the meeting called by Luther, as you will now learn from the letters. The reason I am writing to you a day or two late is that I could not understand in the meantime what the magistrate wanted me to do. I offered him everything Bucer sent me in letters.</p>
      <p>Luther writes to Bucer as follows: "Grace and peace in Christ. I am compelled to write briefly because for the past 14 days I have been laid low by unbearable pains in my left hip; I can barely breathe now. Regarding our meeting, our prince has designated Eisenach, on the border of Hesse, 28 miles from Wittenberg, where Justus Menius is bishop, as the location. The time that seems suitable to me is the 4th Sunday after Easter. Therefore, deliberate with your people on this matter and respond. If the third or another Sunday would be more agreeable, we will not hesitate to accept it. Just ensure that Brentius, Schnepf, and others whom you think should be present are informed through you. I will inform Osiander and others in Nuremberg, and no one else in Upper Germany, leaving that responsibility to you, etc. Farewell. On the day of the Annunciation of Mary, 1536."</p>
      <p>Along with these letters, Bucer writes to us symmists a seven-page letter, urging us to convene, gathering whatever he can to persuade us how beneficial this meeting will be for the kingdom of Christ and the peace of the church. He writes to us more extensively, perhaps because he fears we might refuse this journey. We have indicated to the good man more than once our opinion on the gatherings of bishops. Now, however, the burden of this journey has been placed upon me. Unless your company eases it for me, nothing more burdensome has ever happened to me in my entire life.</p>
      <p>Bucer adds these words in his letters to us: "Regarding the Swiss churches, in my opinion, it would be very beneficial if they sent Doctor Vadian with one or two preachers to this assembly at the very least. [...] I would be pleased with Bullinger and Pellican. May God grant what is good."</p>
      <p>From these words, you understand Bucer's intention. However, it is not his intention or words that should be weighed in this matter, but rather what the mind of Christ is and what He wants you to do for His church. If the synod is held without you, the church will seem divided, even though we profess one Christ. Your presence would be beneficial for two reasons: either to promote your wishes, which will be undertaken for the benefit of the church, or to delay those things that do not seem to serve the purpose. But, oh God, how I wish to embark on this journey with such companions! Bucer wishes for you to be present at the meeting; I wish even more for you to be present, as in your absence I know no one among the entire number of those to be gathered with whom I could freely and safely converse. I implore you, make an effort not to be absent. Luther has some opinion about the Swiss, which you could beautifully dispel in that friendly, as I hope, meeting. Oh my Pellican, you were once compelled to travel to Rome and journey over sea and land at the command of your Francis. I implore you, undertake this labor also in the name of Christ, so that I, a son, may not be without a parent. You all know how insignificant I am, so you cannot excuse yourselves unless you extend a hand to me, miserable in a thousand ways. If I were learned and skilled, also well-spoken in Latin and German, the matter would not be so difficult for me; but, almighty God, you know my insignificance. Furthermore, I do not doubt that the entire congregation will follow Luther's opinions, since those who once stood with us have become entirely Luther's. Consider this matter very carefully.</p>
      <p>I am sending this messenger at my own expense, so that through him I may have a response; may it be happy and as desired! If the messenger needs to be awaited, I implore you, Pellican, to host him; for he is a most honorable man, an exile from Rottweil with many others.</p>
      <p>I wrote the same to Vadian as to you.</p>
      <p>The day of the meeting will be the Sunday Cantate. The time is indeed short, which Bucer also laments. The fault lies with Luther.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. And may God hear the desires of my heart!</p>
      <p>In Constance, April 27, 1536.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned men, Masters Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellican, and Leo Jud, most beloved brothers.</p>
