      <p>S. The painter you recommended, we have also recommended, and I wish that the recommendation of all would have benefited him as we would have liked. For while writing this, I did not know with what gift the council had reciprocated to him.</p>
      <p>Moreover, our churches are being greatly troubled in the countryside by the Anabaptists. This evil could not be countered so far, as we had simultaneously devised a means - namely, we acted with scriptures against their error. Even when they were convicted, they could not be persuaded to desist from their error, so they were imposed silence, not to preach the gospel itself. When this was neglected, they were sent away from the territory. When they returned stubbornly, they were drowned in water, and upon returning again, they were completely submerged. With this persecution, many have joined the error, moved by stubborn constancy, and the council was also swayed to a different opinion. Some wanted to imprison them perpetually without executing any of them, while others fearlessly wanted to destroy them all entirely. It also came into question with us whether it is permissible to use the sword against the Anabaptists. Some assert it is permissible according to Deuteronomy 13 [1-5] and 18 [9-20]. Others think it is not permissible unless they commit such an act that by everyone's judgment falls under the power of the sword, and they should be immune from the magistrate, even if they teach, according to: "Let both grow together" etc.</p>
      <p>[Mt 13, 30]; "Avoid a heretical person" [Tit 3,10]. You once advised through a letter what you think, but you neither supported it with scriptures nor reasons, which you can still do most conveniently, especially now, when the matter has come into question, so that the magistrate desires to hear from the envoy sent by the people of Strasbourg how they deal with this most pernicious sect among them.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we do not know how your affairs stand, except that a certain concord has been prescribed to you and the people of Andernach, to which you have consented, but others have not yet. In summary: Das wiglen bringt immerdar bletzwerck (Flickwerk). May the Lord grant us more steadfast minds and firmer in His word, so that we are not so easily swayed here and there by the threats of those men. We are now the next ones they will contemplate what they can do.</p>
      <p>Niklaus von Wattenwyl sent you a certain cheese. When you receive it, let me know. Moreover, you have long since received my judgment on your synod. But I still expect yours on ours. I have nothing more to write, nor can I write more due to poor health.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>February 9.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own</p>
      <p>B. Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, his dearest brother of all.</p>
