      <p>S. in domino. I am sending two booklets, which you have long demanded from me, and I will send the other two if I receive them; for I have written to Strasbourg for them. Today I received a document from Duke Albert and Maurice, which is already in the press, and letters from Leipzig, which I have not yet read; for a young man said early in the morning that he was leaving; but soon I will carefully report what I receive from Leipzig, along with the printed booklets.</p>
      <p>Regarding Nancy, this has happened: as soon as the King of France approached, they closed the gates, moved some cannons to the market, and prepared for defense. But when they saw such a large crowd of soldiers, they were frightened, although they had raised some flags in the town, they sent out and asked for peace. The king rode there, the duchess and the duke fell at his feet; he ordered them to go home, and said he would send them away the next day. In the morning, they were sent away, the young duke was taken to France, a new council was set up, and the city was also strengthened with 2 flags. Thus he moved away. It is said that the king has demolished the suburbs of Metz. If this is true, the people of Strasbourg should rightly be afraid, lest they let in someone who does not seek the peace of Germany, but establishes an empire and tyranny greater than Caesar ever exercised. Farewell. Soon more and various things. What have you heard about Ulm? We are bombarded with various rumors, some say it was taken by force, others say it surrendered. If you have any certain information, please share it.</p>
      <p>The people of Constance are timid and have no courage left; they write flattering letters to us; but who does not know the cunning of foxes? Basel, April 25, 1552.</p>
      <p>Greet Dr. Theodor for me, to whom I will write at length soon. Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich.</p>
