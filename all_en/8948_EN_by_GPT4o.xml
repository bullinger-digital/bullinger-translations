      <p>Your letter written on June 22 was delivered to me, most illustrious man, by the efforts of Lavater's son, a young man adorned with good hope and expectation. Various things are now being spread here by uncertain and unreliable authors about the warlike actions, and indeed much more fortunate than I would dare to believe.</p>
      <p>The Geuzen have captured a Portuguese fleet laden with rich goods, with only three ships escaping during the fight: many Belgian cities, oppressed by the arrogance, insolence, lust, and insatiable greed for plundering and pillaging of the Spaniards, refuse to admit the Spaniards within their walls; therefore, they have been declared rebels to the king by Alba. One small town, Vlissingen, hanged several captured Spanish nobles at sea. Unless the King of France, the Queen of England, and the princes of Germany complete this begun task, a horrible slaughter and massacre awaits the wretched. Alba presides in Brussels as usual, issuing orders, and reviews four legions of foot soldiers in the Luxembourg and Trier regions. Two recruitment locations have been disrupted by the Orangists. The Duke himself, hardened with great obstinacy, is preparing for war, with captains and leaders, Bulweiler, Fronsberg, Schaumberg, Counts of Eberstein, and many others preparing impious arms. Otto, Count of Eberstein, wanted to descend the Rhine eight days ago to Lower Germany with a ship laden with arms; however, below Worms, he was forced to land on the shore, where he was intercepted by the Elector Palatine's musketeers and taken to Alzey. A convention of Protestant princes will soon be held in Naumburg, Saxony. Prince of Orange is said to have left the castle of Dillenburg on June 23 to Lower Germany, accompanied by six hundred horsemen and a thousand musketeers, to places designated for the recruitment and review of soldiers. In England, everything is quiet at the moment, and the parliament of all the orders of the kingdom is currently being held, by whose decree and judgment the Duke of Norfolk was beheaded on the second day of June: I have not yet received anything about the fate of the other conspirators.</p>
      <p>I am sending these four letters from England, brought to me at the present fair in Hamburg, addressed to Mr. T. and your most illustrious son-in-law Mr. Rudolf G., to you along with the dedication of my services.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, July 8, 1572.</p>
      <p>Christopher Mont.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and most learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed patron.</p>
      <p>"The last letters of Mr. Christopher Mont, secretary in Germany to the most serene Queen of England, written in July 1572. He died of dysentery."</p>
