      <p>Greetings. I have decided not to write anything beyond what you receive here, from the many things that are spread without any reliable source. What you read here is true, and I have marked the doubtful ones.</p>
      <p>Michael, our man here, will add what else is being spread by some here. We are expecting the merchants returning from the Frankfurt fair at any moment. But I think there are also those there who frequent these fairs. The people of Strasbourg are eagerly awaiting Bucer's return; since the sixth of August, he has not sent any letters, having promised them his early arrival. In Bingen now, as Hedio wrote, four Rhenish electors are meeting, and no one can affirm with certainty what they are attempting, except that they are said to be concerned with making peace, but too late. It is said that the French king will come to the aid of Jülich with a large army; if this does not happen in time, it will be over for the not-so-bad prince. May the Lord deem us worthy to be removed from these evils to the heavenly seats as soon as possible! I certainly seem to see with my own eyes the miserable devastation of our Germany, unless soon, which I can hardly wish for, it repents and returns to the right path, although all things are possible with the Lord, who may grant that whether we live or die, we are His. I wish to be continually supported by your fragrant and constant prayers to the Lord, so that in the duty entrusted to me, I may be vigilant, eager, and diligent, and await His coming with confirmed confidence of spirit. Greet your entire household with all your ministers in the gospel of Christ. Convey my most respectful greetings to your excellent consul Rösti, whose son and daughter-in-law I warmly greet with my words. My brother and Zwicky, along with the others, wish you well and to be in good health in Christ. Farewell, my heart and soul in the Lord. September 22, 1543.</p>
      <p>If you had not already begun to love this Michael, I would recommend him to you in many ways, as he is entirely worthy of being loved by sincere Christians and whose endeavors they would wish to be supported. He has conducted himself among us without reproach and is dear to all, so that if our circumstances allowed, we would wish him to be a permanent companion.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>I miss the introductory page in your commentary on the 10th. It almost pains me that there will be no prosperity to enjoy these goods.</p>
      <p>To the man of outstanding piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
