      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not written for several days is that I lacked both messengers and material. Now that I have both, I will write, though briefly, because, God willing, I will soon come to you myself. First of all, I am sending back to you the letters of Peter Martyr, which I read with great pleasure, and I am glad that this man thinks so purely with us. The other brothers who read this letter also congratulate themselves on this point.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I have also received your book on the sacraments, which you once wrote for my benefit and gave to me when I was about to leave for Augsburg, printed in London. I would have sent it here, but since you do not need it, I took the liberty to keep it so that I can also read the letter that Mr. Laski added to it about the sacramental matter. I only received it yesterday and have not had time to read it today due to business; however, I will bring it with me. I am sending the preliminary letter and the first quire so that you can see them; you can do without the rest until I come. Thanks be to God, who so powerfully asserts and vindicates the truth of this necessary doctrine against so many armies of papists and Lutherans.</p>
      <p>As for news, I have only this: the Emperor has returned to Munich from Augsburg, and there is no hope of his departure from there; without a doubt, he will be vigilant over the council, to which he directs all his efforts.</p>
      <p>Then, the son of Musculus writes from Tübingen that near the town of Eich in Bavaria, a certain spring has emerged, the use of which cures all kinds of infirmities, so that even leprosy is cleansed, and there is a great rush to it. He does not mention superstition; but I fear the effectiveness of illusion. If it is true, we will hear more and more certain things. From France, I have absolutely nothing now, nor does Viret have anything, who is here and sends you many greetings. I do not yet know what has been done at Baden. Without a doubt, the council, if nothing else, will bring us troubles. Therefore, we must be vigilant, pray, and ensure that we are united. The plague is raging in Lausanne to such an extent that it has taken Schor from us, a very learned man and still in the prime of life, about whom, I think, I wrote before; he died along with his wife and little daughter, with whom, after being separated from them for 15 months, he now dies in the Lord; we had great hopes for this man, and it was intended that he would be called here because of his learning and because he was German. Now another learned man, Theodor Beza, the foremost in learning among all professors, is also ill; he has a bubo, which I have never heard of before, in the groin, and an anthrax elsewhere. When Viret left Lausanne, there was little hope of life left for him; we do not know what the Lord has decided for him in the meantime. Meanwhile, the flourishing school is being dispersed, and many of the students there are coming here. As for Raphael the Pole, I have recommended him to Mr. Treasurer; he can report what he has obtained. The bitterness of our people towards foreigners is the same as with you, and at this time, when consideration should be given to the pious, laws are being established against them. I fear that we may eventually dissolve to our great detriment. That's all for now. All our brothers, especially Musculus, send their greetings to you and the rest. I impart much health to your household from myself and all of mine. Bern, the last day of June 1551. Mr. Treasurer also sends his greetings to you, he took up his office yesterday; however, they did not want to release him from it. Hagius also, who is above all a hater of proselytes.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
