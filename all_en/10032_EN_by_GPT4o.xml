      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>How much pleasure, indeed how much benefit we have begun to derive from your "Prophet," dearest Heinrich, we have decided to pass over in silence, lest we seem to praise you to your face or strike with flattery. Therefore, we not only praise but rather admire such a rare invention, such sharp judgment, and such beautiful arrangement. Here everything is alive, everything is consistent and fitting, everything is clear and transparent. Therefore, I beg and beseech you to share this most polished "Prophet" not only with certain private friends but with the whole world. Since prophets were called seers by the Hebrews, who indeed sees in the dark? Therefore, I would like you to expose the seer to the light. For as I have always been displeased with the audacity of some writers, who fill the whole world with the most confused little books and thus capture the minds of simple Christians, leading them away from the holy scriptures, so I cannot but approve the work of those who aim solely to lead faithful minds back from human commentaries to the oracles of the divine spirit. If all Christians had hitherto devoted themselves to this matter, there would not be so many hypocrisies, so many contentions, heresies among them, I dare say: they would never have fallen into such dire servitude to the Antichrist. Therefore, since I see that your "Prophet" is entirely focused on ensuring that the people of God adhere to the words of their creator, redeemer, and savior alone, I am fully convinced that great benefit will arise for the Christian republic if, revised and polished by your diligence and printed, it is made public.</p>
      <p>May the heavenly Father, who has sown the seeds of true piety in you, himself promote a bountiful harvest and a hundredfold fruit [Mt 13,23], so that you may be able to benefit yourself and others perpetually. Farewell and continue to do good.</p>
      <p>From Zürich, the day before the Nones of July 1525.</p>
      <p>Your Leo Jud.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a young man of excellent hope, his brother in Christ.</p>
