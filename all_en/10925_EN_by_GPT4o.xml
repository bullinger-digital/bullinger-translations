      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>It greatly saddened me, venerable brother in the Lord, that I was not able to show you greater kindness and hospitality; certainly, the will was not lacking. Now, we are eager to know what you have achieved in Bern. Here you have what Doctor Johannes Zwick from Konstanz has written. If your people wish to convene a general meeting, it seems most advisable, both for the cause and for us, to do so after the Frankfurt fair. In the meantime, Luther will receive Vadian's books and will openly express what he has in mind. Certainly - to speak freely what I feel - it seems that Zwick alone has explained this matter more clearly than the people of Strasbourg. We await your response.</p>
      <p>Greet Grynaeus, the ornament of the churches, most diligently on my behalf. Share with him continually what I write.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>August 24, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours in all things,</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
