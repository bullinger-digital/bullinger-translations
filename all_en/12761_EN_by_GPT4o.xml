    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] As Vadian recently announced [with a letter that has not been preserved], he wrote to [Martin] Frecht, so that he would urge his people in Ulm, for the sake of their souls, to oppose those through whom the [sadly] famous alliance came into being. Frecht responded very kindly and aptly and gave Vadian permission to forward the letter to Bullinger for information. Bullinger is to return the letter after he has read it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is repeatedly reported that Emperor [Charles V] shows concern while gathering gold and planning future expenses, and does not know at all where he will resume the war in the coming spring, with speculation that the troops he has recruited here and there will attack in several places. May God break his courage and teach him better or throw him into the fiery pit of the [giant] Enceladus! Everything is in God's hands. However, swift and efficient action must be taken to ensure that Germany is not deprived of its freedoms. If Bullinger has anything significant to report, he should do so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The recently published book by Gwalther about the Antichrist is being bought everywhere! [Christoph] Froschauer should also send a copy of it. Furthermore, thanks to Froschauer for the recently received third book of [Johannes Stumpf's Swiss] Chronicle. What a magnificent and extensive work, which must have required Stumpf a lot of effort and consultation of many sources!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote to Frecht, as I recently indicated I would, and to the best of my ability, I consoled and encouraged the man not to let his people's spirits falter and not to allow themselves to be easily torn away or distracted from those with whom they have entered into such a renowned alliance. I advised him with as much diligence as I could. He responded quite candidly and with letters that were by no means inappropriate, which I decided to send to you, so that you too might be informed about these matters he mentioned to us. Once you have read these letters, please return them.</p>

      <p>There is a persistent rumor that Emperor Charles V is troubled and anxious while gathering gold and preparing expenses, and it is not at all certain where he will resume the war in the coming spring, although there is speculation that he will harm in several places with the soldiers he has recruited here and there. May the Lord break his spirit and grant him better sense, or if that is not in the fates, may He burn him in the fiery pit beneath the caves of Enceladus. Amen. Indeed, everything is certainly in the Lord's hands; however, swift and effective measures must be taken to support the ancient Germanic liberty, lest its ancestral glory be entirely abandoned. If you have anything worthy of my attention, please write.</p>

      <p>The book by our Rudolf Gwalther, recently published about the Antichrist, is highly praised and is being bought quickly and everywhere. I am eager for it to be sent to me by our Froschauer so that I may see and read it. I would also like you to thank him on my behalf for the third book of the Zurich Chronicle, which I received from him the day before. Immortal God, what an elegantly compiled and extensive work it is, and how great are the labors of our Stumpf, who sought and wrote about such great matters from such broad sources! May the Lord preserve him for us as well.</p>

      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious city of Zurich, his most beloved lord.</p>
