      <p>Grace of the Son of God be with you.</p>
      <p>That woman came to me standing in readiness, so that I could not write more.</p>
      <p>But these few things: Our church is safe and grows daily, reformed as far as sound doctrine and the administration of the sacraments are concerned, according to the model of your church.</p>
      <p>May God grant that we persevere.</p>
      <p>Yesterday Adam Diem, the chancellor, an adversary of piety and the school, died, and if the lady had not steadfastly resisted with God's help, religion would have long been at an end.</p>
      <p>It is not for me to write more about his character, lest I seem to speak ill of the dead.</p>
      <p>All the citizens rejoice, indeed they triumph, as if they had been freed from prison, etc.</p>
      <p>Our lord will likely winter with the Emperor; it has been a month and a half since he left.</p>
      <p>We all hope he will achieve something further for the sake of religion, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell safely, farewell three and four times, greet the brothers. The woman urges and fully presses on the shoulders, etc.</p>
      <p>Rappoltsweiler, October 5th.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erbius.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian in learning and piety, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his brother.</p>
