      <p>Greetings. At the end of the previous week, the most honorable council of the Bernese republic informed our republic through a submitted letter that they do not find it necessary for our people to intervene as mediators in your dispute, as the matter itself seems to be able to be amicably resolved soon, so that our people can easily spare their efforts and expenses. We hope that the Lord will lead this to a happy and desired conclusion. Certainly, our people would have gladly contributed all their efforts in this matter, as you will understand from the present messenger, whose piety and integrity have greatly pleased me. May the Lord increase his gifts to him and preserve him in integrity.</p>
      <p>I believe you are not unaware of what has been done in the matter of the oath. The Lord has dispelled that cloud. For the matter has been postponed for the present. Friends write that our most esteemed men and dearest brothers, Mr. Latimer and Mr. Ridley, the Bishop of London, have been burned. The Archbishop of Canterbury was a spectator, yet testifying that this punishment is more severe than death itself because he is not sacrificed to the Lord on the same pyre with his brothers. He was led back to prison in chains. They think he has already been reduced to ashes. They say the Emperor is going to sail to Spain, but first, he will place the crown of England on Philip. For they think he will divert his journey to England. May the Lord protect his faithful and repay the bloodthirsty on their own heads, etc. Regarding the matter you inserted in your letter, most esteemed brother, I will write another time when there is more leisure. In the meantime, do not think that I favor the parties of your adversaries. If anyone else loves you and is devoted to you, I am certainly that person. Therefore, you will forgive me if I have slightly deviated from you in the manner of conveying the same matter.</p>
      <p>I am glad you are now responding to Westphal, to whom I also intend to oppose something. May the Lord grant you the strength and talent to handle this matter in such a way that you greatly help all the pious. This is what we all hope for, and for which we pray to the Lord. It would be most welcome if, as soon as your book is published, you would send it to us. Live and farewell eternally with all yours, most esteemed lord and dearest brother in Christ. May all your brothers and fellow ministers be safe. All of ours greet you, especially my three sons-in-law. November 27, in the year of our Lord 1555.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
