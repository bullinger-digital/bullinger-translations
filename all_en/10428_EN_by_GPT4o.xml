    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for his long silence since his visit to Zurich. He does not want to report on public affairs now, because Berchtold Haller is already doing so; he is only interested in his studies. Currently, he is engaged with Aristotle and the Gospel of Mark, learning and teaching at the same time. He asks for Bullinger's help, especially for his study of the Gospels. He gets along very well with his colleagues Kaspar Megander and Johannes Rhellikan, and Berchtold Haller is a fatherly friend and protector to him. Greetings.</p>

      <p> Greetings. Most honorable Bullinger, the reason you have not received any letters from me until now is neither due to negligence nor forgetfulness of you. Your acts of kindness and merits towards me, who is undeserving, are such that I hold you in high regard. Since I last departed from you, not a day has passed without me often recalling you. However, partly the messengers were to blame, as I could never find them except when I was extremely busy, and partly a certain rustic shyness and singular reverence for your name prevented me from expressing my gratitude in writing, as I should have, when I could not do so in person. But so that I would not incur the suspicion of neglecting the friendship you offered me due to this rather ungracious silence, I decided to break the silence, putting aside my shyness, especially since I seem to have discovered such sweetness and gentleness in your character that even if I write most foolishly, as I am wont to do, or otherwise fail to properly consider your authority and learning, I am convinced that you will easily forgive me for this fault. Therefore, I make known to you at this time that nothing could have been more pleasant to me than your acquaintance and friendship in the Lord, which if I could enjoy in person, I would consider myself truly happy and blessed. However, even in this distance, you will never be absent from the mind of your Sulzer, as you once did not disdain to extend your hand to me as I lay fallen and deemed me worthy of your love. Although I can bring nothing to your friendship except faith and goodwill, I will ensure that you never lack these in me. Please embrace them for now until I have the opportunity or occasion to clearly and abundantly declare my goodwill towards you, which, when it arises, I hope you will understand that you are dealing with a man who is by no means ungrateful to you. </p>
      <p> Furthermore, I do not write to you about public affairs because I know that Berchtold is diligently doing so, and because I lead a secluded life, I neither inquire about these matters nor do they reach me unless they are widely spread. I remain hidden at home, dedicating myself entirely to my studies, which I pursue with all my heart, having set aside all other matters, for without them, I consider all life to be truly bitter. Besides reading Aristotle, I have recently also begun with Mark. This reading exercises me greatly, as I am forced to learn and teach at the same time, being quite unskilled in all literature, especially in this profession. Both are done with great effort, but I do not know with how much progress. In the explanation of the text, as they call it, I willingly follow the judgment of others, trusting nothing to myself. However, in the treatment of commonplaces, while I establish a peculiar method, wishing to circumscribe each thing within its own boundaries in a certain order, immense difficulty arises for me, so that having entered as if into a certain sea, I can hardly perceive any end. Therefore, I ask you, as the one from whom I have desired to inquire about these matters as if from an oracle, to assist me with your advice, which will bring benefit to me and the students. And if you have anything else either on all the evangelists or on this one in particular, I would like you to share it with me for a time. I will return everything in good faith. Behold the beginnings of a new friendship, as I trouble you so soon with requests. If there is any fault in this matter, attribute it to your humanity, on which I rely, believing that everything is permissible for me with you. </p>
      <p> Everything else is quite well. I get along with Megander and Rhellikan. They have learned to bear with me and have ceased to hate me. May the Lord grant that we all breathe Christ with one accord. I am entirely content with the friendship of Berchtold as a most ardent patron and defender, into whose bosom, as you know, I have long since entrusted all my resources. I would commend this man, so devoted to you, to be loved by you, if I were not rather to be commended to you through him, and if you were not already inclined towards him of your own accord. But I have already been quite troublesome to you. </p>
      <p> Farewell, and keep Simon, who is most devoted to you, commended in your prayers to the Lord, which you will do in return. Farewell with your most chaste wife, whom you will lovingly and diligently greet in my words. </p>
      <p> Bern, June 11, 1534. </p>
      <p> Yours as his own, Simon Sulzer. </p>
      <p> Greet Theodor, Leo, Pellican, Binder, Erasmus, and all good men. </p>
      <p> To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful herald of the divine word, his most esteemed patron. Zurich. </p>
