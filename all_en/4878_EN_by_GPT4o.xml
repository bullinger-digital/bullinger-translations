      <p>St. Paul here in Altdorf, who from Judaism [...] I send through this letter the matters concerning the Turks that were communicated to me. And because I lack a copy and, since I have just received it from the Margraviate, I was not allowed to transcribe it, I ask you to return it and at the same time inform me by letter how Velsius was received and dismissed by you. He complained here about the insolence of some in your inn, who provoked his and others to drunkenness, having been reprimanded by him, and that these are the fruits of the doctrine of imputed righteousness. He greatly insulted us and secretly posted theses against Bartholom√§us on the doors of the colleges. Now he has returned to Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Written in Basel, July 16, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, Simon Sulzer.</p>
      <p>Send my regards to the symmists and your entire household.</p>
