      <p>S. Pl.</p>
      <p>Regarding Mr. Peter Martyr, although grieving is of no use, yet somehow the grief itself is pleasant.</p>
      <p>Alas for me! Indeed, he was worthy, with that greatness of intellect, that multitude of letters, that piety, those manners, that life, that he should never be taken from life.</p>
      <p>But I had already predicted this would happen, as soon as I heard that a man of his age had turned his mind to marriage.</p>
      <p>May God, the best and greatest, kindly look upon His church, and raise up others for him who has passed away.</p>
      <p>You are few, my father, you are few, upon whom the whole matter now rests; for I have always counted you among the foremost.</p>
      <p>Oh, would that there always be some to whom you can entrust this torch! But I will let that be.</p>
      <p>Your Hercules of Tübingen, the fabricator of monsters, not the conqueror, now triumphs idly.</p>
      <p>In that whole kingdom of his, the Ubiquitarian, with such vast spaces and regions, I wonder if he can stand.</p>
      <p>If he wishes to plot anything against a dead man, and his writings can be brought to us, unless one of you wishes to forestall me, I consider it my duty, as far as my affairs allow, to respond to him; if nothing else, at least so it can be understood that England and Switzerland agree against these Ubiquitarians.</p>
      <p>The death of the Guise Pharaoh, which we accept today as certain and confirmed, believe me, has struck my innermost soul and heart.</p>
      <p>It was so sudden, so opportune, so fortunate, it surpassed all our hope and expectation.</p>
      <p>What now do we think is the spirit of our brothers; whom that beast had already surrounded with a siege, and whom he had almost devoured with bloody jaws in hope and thought? Blessed be the name of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Châtillon now attacks the fortress of Canossa, and grows daily; and there is good hope that the adversaries will come to our terms, and everything will be as we wish.</p>
      <p>Our queen gathers soldiers from Germany, and pays them, and spares no expense.</p>
      <p>At this time we are holding a convention of the whole kingdom, and we are discussing religion with favorable minds, and the republic, and the sinews of war, that is, money.</p>
      <p>From Scotland, all is reported well.</p>
      <p>The queen almost alone retains the Guise obstinacy of mind and her mass, against the will of all.</p>
      <p>Our queen suffered from smallpox last autumn, with considerable danger.</p>
      <p>Impatient of heat and weariness, she almost destroyed herself. But we give thanks to God, who freed her from danger and us from fear.</p>
      <p>What those little fathers of yours in Trento and the hydropic pope are planning, we hear nothing.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the Holy Spirit does not wish to be present, or cannot speak.</p>
      <p>Whatever it is, in such a convention, with such expectation, it is surprising that nothing is being done.</p>
      <p>After the intemperance of last summer and this winter, and several days of spasms and catarrhs, I am now finally beginning to recover.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that you will take care that the writings of Mr. Peter Martyr do not perish: they cost him much while he lived, and they are worthy, as you know, to be held in high regard.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man, and most esteemed brother and lord in Christ.</p>
      <p>Greet that excellent woman, your wife, your sons, daughters-in-law, Mr. Gwalther, Mr. Simler, Mr. Lavater, Mr. Zwingli, Mr. Wick, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Haller, Mr. Gessner, Mr. Frisius in my name. May the Lord keep you safe and sound for us for a long time! March 5, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your brother in Christ and most devoted to your name, John Jewel.</p>
