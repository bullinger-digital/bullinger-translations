      <p>Greetings. In almost all the famous cities of France, there are sacred assemblies with pastors; but now they gather for sacred purposes as in the time of the apostles, as the Acts of the Apostles teach, in private houses. Therefore, while in Paris on September 5th, more than 400 gathered in the spacious house of a certain noble widow to pray, hear the word of God, and celebrate the supper, and indeed at night, they were betrayed by informers. Although many escaped, more than 130 were captured and imprisoned, and soon some were led away, among whom was that noble widow, not yet 30 years old, distinguished in beauty, birth, and wealth, but much more renowned in virtue. She bravely faced execution, moving the minds of all the spectators. Burned or scorched, she showed no sign of any fear and joyfully departed to the Lord. An inquisition has been instituted in other churches throughout France, and stakes or pyres are being prepared for the faithful. Meanwhile, a delegation of supplicants sent to the king by the people of Zürich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen came to Paris, approached the king, and pleaded for the safety and well-being of the prisoners, and that the king should not continue to persecute the religion which we share with the prisoners. The king kindly listened to the petitioners, received them humanely, and dismissed the delegates, but said it was impious for him to accept another religion than that which he had received from his ancestors, and that it did not pertain to the safety of the kingdom to allow these people to introduce another religion, etc. Thus, with the matter unresolved, they returned home.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it remains for us to commend our fellow believers to God in our prayers.</p>
      <p>There are those who hope that because of that delegation, the king will act more mercifully towards his people. But we must await the outcome.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that this king will act like David, not Pharaoh, for which we must earnestly pray to the Lord. Meanwhile, regarding the colloquy in Worms, Mr. Laelius writes from Tübingen on December 8th: "The colloquy was broken off and postponed to the next assembly, where perhaps a better form will be discussed. However, everyone has already departed.</p>
      <p>I joined the Württemberg delegates and came here with difficulty due to poor health. Therefore, I will rest here until I regain my strength, then, God willing, I will soon return to you to report everything that happened there. I hope this will happen by the Christmas holidays." So much from our Laelius, who set out for Worms at the beginning of November, instructed by our prayers and letters, to deal with Philip and others. But I would like you to keep Laelius's name confidential, etc.</p>
      <p>Friends from Augsburg write that an assembly has been called in Ulm for January 12th. Now, however, rumors are flying that King Ferdinand is excusing himself and indicating to the princes that he cannot attend the assembly due to royal affairs. Hence, many suspect that no assembly will be held yet, but postponed to a more opportune time, I say, due to the opposition's tactics. The assembly in Baden has long since ended, where the Burgundians diligently excused themselves for not having conspired with Bollweiler, as it seemed to the royal envoy.</p>
      <p>Now we will see how the matter will unfold. Otherwise, all the Swiss get along well with each other.</p>
      <p>The Bernese have formed a perpetual alliance with the Genevans, which may Christ's blessing make prosperous and happy. There is complete silence about the war in Belgian Gaul.</p>
      <p>I expect much from you regarding Italian affairs. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zürich, December 17, 1557.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet the honorable consuls, Pontasella, all friends and brothers, the Traversos and Saliceos.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur in Rhaetia, my esteemed and beloved compatriot and brother. Chur.</p>
