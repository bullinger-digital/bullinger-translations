      <p>Greetings. Since these young men from your region, most illustrious sir, are now departing from here to you, I could not allow them to reach you without my letters. Know, therefore, that I am in good health, which in these days has been a singular blessing from God; for throughout this kingdom, we have been afflicted by the English sweat (a disease), and (which is gravely to be lamented) we have lost several distinguished men. Among them, the Duke of Suffolk, a most noble young man, very dear to the king and his peer and raised together with him, has perished. He was of such promise that for his age, he was thought to have no equal (except for the royal majesty, I mean); he had advanced so much in both letters and piety that he was admired by all and was soon to be of great assistance to the republic and the church alike. And, to leave nothing lacking in this calamity, his younger brother died with him. Therefore, this summer has been little joyful for the English. May God grant that this mourning is not the prelude to other calamities. I say this because I see that the gospel of Christ is of such a nature that to touch it lightly and perfunctorily is most pernicious; and when sins are neither ended nor moderated, a richer knowledge of divine matters often brings about more severe punishment. I do not write this because I see any imminent dangers by human reason; but I recognize that the treasures of God's wrath and wisdom are equally unsearchable. Therefore, we must never be secure unless, with all else cast aside, we cling to Christ alone and him crucified in all things.</p>
      <p>As for civil matters, there are signs of the greatest friendship on both sides between the King of France and ours.</p>
      <p>Our envoys, from among the foremost counselors and princes, have gone to France and were received there by the king as honorably and splendidly as any embassy ever was; the same courtesy, no less than that shown to the French envoys, was extended when they came here. Moreover, it is widely rumored that the mind of the French king is irritated against the Roman pontiff. Would that the Phrygians (French) might be wise, even if late! I will not write about Italian affairs, because, since you are nearby, you can learn more certainly than we can how they stand. Master Hooper is ministering in his bishopric with great zeal and success and is well regarded by all the pious, as I always hoped he would be. May the Lord grant that we may finally have many other bishops who will devote equal zeal and labor to the church.</p>
      <p>I am expecting my book to be printed at this Frankfurt fair, and I would very much like, if it could be done, to have five or six copies before the booksellers' parcels are brought here from Frankfurt, so that I might distribute them to friends before the books are publicly available for sale; for that transport is much delayed, and many often pester me, eager to have that exposition more than is proper. Your little book on the sacraments was printed here four months ago, for which I give you great thanks; for it is very pleasing to all the pious and is wonderfully approved by me. Moreover, I have received and read the fifth decade of your sermons, which you sent me as a gift; it pleased me so much that I greatly desire you to progress as widely as possible in this kind of work; for in this way, you prepare the most useful material for ecclesiastical preachers, which, if they have it familiar and at hand, as they ought, they will be able to teach the people both copiously and fruitfully. Regarding the young men from Zürich who are staying with us, I will say only this, that they conduct themselves rightly, honestly, and piously and, unless I am mistaken, are making not unsuccessful progress in their studies. May you fare well and love me in the Lord, as you do. I would very much like all your fellow ministers to be greeted in my name, especially our Gwalther, who has labored so much in reviewing my book.</p>
      <p>Oxford, August 6, 1551/1555.</p>
      <p>I ask that the letters destined for Geneva, which I have attached to these, be faithfully delivered there.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted to piety and learning, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the word of God of the Zürich church and most esteemed by me. In Zürich.</p>
