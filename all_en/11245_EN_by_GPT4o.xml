      <p>Especially gracious, dear sir. Regarding your letter and request concerning Mr. Hans Heinrich Göldli, my dear nephew, I want to let you know that I, along with others, am willing to help him gladly according to your and Mr. Heinrich Göldli's letter, as he will inform you himself. I also want to commend him to you.</p>
      <p>I also wish to commend myself to you before God and in time, offering whatever friendship, love, and kindness I can show you, finding me always willing. I ask you to kindly overlook my poor writing (take it in good part), as I am so tired of writing that I can no longer do it. With that, I commend us to God, and whatever is dear to you. May God protect us all.</p>
      <p>Given in the valley of Schramberg, on Monday after St. Andrew's Day in the year 1538.</p>
      <p>Hans von Landenberg of Schramberg.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Grossmünster in Zurich, my especially gracious, dear sir.</p>
