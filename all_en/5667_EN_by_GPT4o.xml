      <p>Peace and grace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>I received your letter on the 20th of March, along with the little book you sent me as a gift, for which I give you immense thanks, and I will pray to the Lord to soon provide an opportunity to repay the favor.</p>
      <p>Through this small gift and your many kindnesses, I understand more than enough that I am dear to you and that you always remember me, and that I am not the least among your friends.</p>
      <p>It was not necessary to excuse the rarity of your letters to me, as I read your writings sent to Beldius every week; for he shares everything of yours with me.</p>
      <p>I was filled with great joy from your letters sent to us on the 27th of March, from which I learned that peace has been restored in France and that everything is now safe and secure.</p>
      <p>May all these things redound to the glory of God.</p>
      <p>Immortal thanks are to be given to God, who does not spurn the prayers of the pious, but in His own time redeems them from the power of tyrants and makes their enemies fall into the pit they dug for the pious.</p>
      <p>To Him be praise, glory, and power forever, amen. I do not doubt that you are informed by Beldius about our affairs and how they stand; therefore, it would be superfluous to write much about them.</p>
      <p>This one thing I now ask of you and wish you to be entreated, that you send us as soon as possible a faithful minister of the word, who is distinguished in doctrine and piety, to whom the church of Betschwanden may be entrusted.</p>
      <p>It is dangerous to handle the business of Christ among so many enemies here; therefore, the minister must not only shine with doctrine but also with an honest life; for if piety is lacking, a well-taught profane life will destroy.</p>
      <p>Annually, he will receive 80 gold coins from the church treasury; I myself have no greater stipend, but the greatest revenue is frugality.</p>
      <p>If you send someone, ensure that he does not come to us without your and the magistrate's recommendation; he must have testimonial letters about his doctrine and life; otherwise, he would not be accepted as a minister by the church.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily, and may the Lord grant you the years of Nestor, so that you may long benefit His church, as has been done until now.</p>
      <p>To Him be praise and glory forever.</p>
      <p>Given on the 28th of March, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Fridolin Brunner, minister of the church of Glarus, most observant of you.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and venerable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word in Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
