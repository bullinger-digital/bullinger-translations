    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has sent terrible news, which brought Myconius to tears. Thanks be to the Lord, for he fights for his word and for the Schmalkaldic League! How infuriating that the author of these cruelties, Emperor Charles V, cannot be captured! May the Lord bring him the downfall he deserves, for it is truly dire!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Merchants from Antwerp have reported that on their journey to Basel, they repeatedly encountered soldiers coming from the imperial camp. However, the peasants are said to band together and kill those mercenaries dressed like Italians and Spaniards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Duke Christoph of Württemberg reports many good things about the French King Francis I. He believes that if he were younger, he would stand against the Emperor and even support the Gospel. Yet, Myconius doubts this. It is certain, however, that Johann Heinrich Ryhiner? from Paris reports how in the town of Meaux, about 45 km from Paris, around 60 Protestant men, women, and youths were arrested and brought before the Paris court for interrogation at the behest of the Sorbonne, along with their teacher Pierre Leclerc. Some recanted their faith out of fear and were banished, while others remained steadfast and were sentenced to death by fire in their hometown. As the latter passed through Meaux, they praised God with loud voices because they were deemed worthy to die for their Lord. By decision of the Paris Parliament, the house of Pierre Leclerc was demolished, and the wood from it was used to build the pyre. The house of Estienne Mangin, where the believers gathered, was also destroyed, and in its place, a chapel adorned with idols for the worship of the devil was built. The reporter himself saw the condemned pass through the city and heard their cries to God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] What Bullinger reported in his earlier letter [No. 2659] about Duke Maurice of Saxony is outrageous; indeed, no one believes it! However, it is known that the Emperor promised the electoral dignity to the Duke if he supports him. This fills Myconius with fear, for he knows what ambition can cause.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It is reliably reported that Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, recently traveled through Basel and stayed with the Bishop of Basel, Philipp von Gundelsheim. If this is true, the Emperor's cause will likely stand differently than expected.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Bernese have summoned 10,000 soldiers under the great banner led by Mayor Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl; the lieutenant is the banneret Wolfgang von Wingarten, and the ensign is Peter Thormann, the strongest man Myconius has ever seen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Two letters arrived from Strasbourg, the first reporting that the Emperor has dismissed a large part of his army, while the second states that 500 riders have defected to the Schmalkaldic League.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You send terrible news! Let us give thanks to the Lord, who fights for His word and indeed for us. May He grant that we do not lose it (the word of the Lord) through ingratitude. I could not read your letter without tears. Meanwhile, it is miserable that the author of these cruelties cannot be captured! May the Lord pursue him until he perishes, as he deserves! He has truly begun a dire matter.</p>

      <p>Duke Christoph of Württemberg speaks many good things about the French. He believes that if he were younger, he would attempt great things against the Emperor, indeed for the Gospel. How true this is, I do not know. It is very true, however, as written to me from Paris in this manner: There is a small town 12 leagues from Paris, no more. It is called Meaux. In it, about 60 men, women, and youths who know the Lord were arrested. The Sorbonne, suspecting this, arranged for the captives to be brought with their teacher to the Paris court. Some recanted out of fear of punishment, some remained steadfast. Those were condemned to the fire, the others were exiled. The condemned were sent back to their town. As they passed through the city, they praised God with a loud voice, for they were deemed worthy to die for their Lord. By decree of the Paris Senate, the teacher's house was destroyed, and from its wood, a pyre was built on which they were to be burned. Another house, where the pious always gathered, was destroyed, and in its place, a chapel was erected, and idols were placed there for people to worship the devil. The writer saw with his eyes those passing through the city and heard with his ears their cries to the Lord.</p>

      <p>What you reported in your earlier letters about Duke Maurice is outrageous; indeed, no one believes it! However, it is known that the Emperor almost promised him the office and dignity of elector if he acts bravely for him. And this greatly terrifies me, for I know where ambition leads men.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It is reliably reported that Granvelle recently passed through here and went straight to the Bishop of Basel and stayed with him overnight. If this is true, the Emperor's affairs are different than believed.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Bernese, if you do not know, have summoned 10,000 under the great banner. The leader is Mayor Wattenwyl; the lieutenant is the standard-bearer Wingarten; the ensign is Thormann, a man stronger than any I have ever seen.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Two letters have come from Strasbourg. The first: The Emperor has dismissed a large part of his army; the second: 500 horsemen have defected to our side.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell with all good things. In Basel, hastily, on the feast of Martin in the year 1546. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and best minister of Christ, his venerable lord in Christ.</p>
