      <p>From Leipzig, January 4, 1549:</p>
      <p>"We fear that there will be a very serious war in Saxony in the coming summer because of the people of Magdeburg, who have been proclaimed and outlawed by the Emperor. The city of Bremen adheres to them; all others, both princes and cities, are enemies. Melanchthon was in Leipzig, who is excessively tormented, tortured, and ulcerated by scabies, with whom I dined; if he could, he would not remain in Saxony. A diet was held in Leipzig, which was dissolved on the first of January after the departure of Maurice.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the imperial knights and cities did not want to accept; however, the learned, among whom the most prominent were Doctor Belgeranus, Melanchthon, and Joachim Camerarius, admitted certain things for the sake of common concord, such as confirmation, anointing, fasting, and certain feast days of the saints. Erasmus Sarcerius was present at the diet, who was exiled because of the gospel and is staying in exile with a nobleman named Wolfgang von Linderau, along with 24 preachers expelled from the county of the Counts of Nassau. Here all the preachers are outlawed, and the people are now miserably without pastors.</p>
      <p>The second article is about the expedition to be made against the people of Magdeburg and Bremen; the Magdeburg market has been transferred to the March, and all other revenues have been taken from them by the Emperor's command.</p>
      <p>Joachim, the Elector, accepted the Interim with other princes of Saxony. Papal masses are held throughout the March. The brother of the Margrave, Johann von KÃ¼strin, completely opposes this and is gravely angry that he has given his consent to the papal Interim, abandoning the word of God; he said he wants to die with the ministers of the word, especially with the gospel of Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>The third article is about paying tribute. The Emperor desires 8 tons of gold from the electors Maurice and Augustus for the imperial crown, which he wants to give to the Pope and the Pope to request from him. 2. Ferdinand requests 5 donellos of gold for the cities where mines are found. Also, Maurice has increased wine and beer, from which he can annually take in 10 donen of gold... income. Thus, the luxury of princes must destroy kingdoms."</p>
      <p>These things were written to me and Myconius, who is gravely ill, from Leipzig. February 6, 1549.</p>
