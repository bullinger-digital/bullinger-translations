      <p>My humble, diligent, albeit very small service is always willingly ready for your reverence, kind, and also beloved lord and father in Christ Jesus, our savior. I do not doubt that your reverence has received a report from the reverend synod about how my lord steward has behaved towards me after the sermon on Holy Easter Day. So now your reverence should know this: The aforementioned steward said to me that he wonders what his gracious prince and lord will say about my fine sermon. He does what his lord commands him; he owes nothing to anyone. A house in Bubikon is not a monastery, nor is it a compulsory mill. As for me, he has given me hope that I will not have to complain for much longer. He does not attend my sermons; he has forbidden me to come to him for grain until Lent is here; in the meantime, he will not give me any, and I must buy it here, where it is expensive, hoping that when Lent is here, I can redeem with the 6 bushels he gives me what I have consumed during the long Lent, hoping that the grain will then be cheaper than I have to buy it now, always having to pay or buy. Would to God that his matter (as I know well before him) would go in his favor, it could not go worse for me. He has insulted my dear wife for the second time and called her a priestess, has reproached us and started many things with us that I have rightly forbidden him. Some good lords and brothers had completely assumed that I would be changed; but nothing has come of it; as I understood from some, 4 services have been compared, otherwise I would not have known about it. My wife has taken to bed from grief and sorrow and says that the deceit, contempt, and utmost unfaithfulness of my steward cause her so much trouble, and my old mother, also the debt I owe you, my gracious lord the canon, namely 70 guilders, that she actually knows that she is not really healthy and well because she must be here in Bubikon; for it will not be possible for us to pay here at any time. Therefore, I appeal once again to your reverence, that you may do your best and arrange for me to be changed. Lord Haller writes to me that he is very much considering my change; so his words sound. I do not write further to your reverence, but I ask that you may hear me and take up and understand my simple complaint in the best way. I am very contrary and very discouraged; therefore, if I have erred in writing, attribute it to the same. Therefore, I ask your reverence most highly; I express myself and complain to you like a son to his father. May God be with you, who may keep your reverence in health with joy in Christ for a long time.</p>
      <p>My wife sends many greetings to your reverence, to whom I also commend myself. My wife sends you eggs and asks that you consider them well, as it is said that there is a very small supply of them in your market. Most devoted to your humanity and reverence, Abraham Sartorius.</p>
      <p>To the reverend, pious, wise lord and father in Christ Jesus Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the word of God at the Great Minster in Zurich, his honorable and beloved lord. Zurich.</p>
