      <p>Greetings. Although I gladly read your diligently written history, there was no need for you to trouble yourself with such great efforts. Even though the envoys wrote to me about this matter, I was not moved against you; on the contrary, I say and feel that you have fulfilled the duty of a good shepherd. Therefore, be of a calm and peaceful mind; the Lord will happily resolve all those disturbances.</p>
      <p>You must get used to the rumors; the great lords sit on eggs; one may give a little push: they scream very loudly and fear for their eggs.</p>
      <p>I am sending here the response that I give to the letters written to me eight days ago. Make sure that my letters are delivered to him.</p>
      <p>I have also ensured that a copy of your case was made, so you can see what I replied to him. Make sure you return this reply enclosed with yours to me via the next messenger; I wish to keep a copy with me. Farewell and be of strong and undaunted spirit.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more due to business; I barely managed this. Zurich, January 20, 1559. All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The Emperor came to Augsburg on December 31; few or no envoys were there by January 8. On the journey, he lost Chancellor Dr. Jonas, a great enemy of God and the saints; he died, etc.</p>
      <p>The Council of Trent has a delegation there and other priests, etc.</p>
      <p>A canon from Augsburg says for certain that this Dr. Jonas, when he realized that his affairs were no longer of any use, had some lords of the court summoned to him and then publicly confessed in their presence that he had opposed the recognized truth until now; they ask that they would help him pray to God for forgiveness and not be offended by him, etc. To the most excellent man Dr. Johannes Fabricius, the most vigilant minister of the Church of Chur, esteemed and beloved lord and brother. To Mr. Johannes Schmid, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
