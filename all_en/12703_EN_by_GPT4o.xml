    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas requested in his last letter [No. 2654] to Bullinger to send him the decrees of the first three sessions of the Council of Trent. However, with the book printed by [Johannes] Oporinus on this topic, they have reached a point where only a short version of these decrees is desired. Bullinger should have such a copy made by a student at Enzinas' expense as soon as possible. He should forgive Enzinas for bothering him with such a trivial matter. Enzinas does this for the sake of his host, Oporinus, whom Bullinger also likes. Enzinas hopes to be able to express his gratitude to Bullinger and the Church of Zurich in an important matter. Since he feels how much Bullinger is inclined towards him, he does not hesitate to trouble him with this request.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] But whoever proves to be unrestrained once, dares even more... Bullinger should also request from Theodor [Bibliander] to send the Latin "Summa" [the confession of faith] of Juan Diaz (Bibliander possesses the writing, as he translated it into German). Enzinas would like to add this short text to the biography of Diaz he plans to print. He could neither find the Latin print of Diaz's confession of faith in Basel nor obtain it from Strasbourg. Enzinas and Oporinus thank you in advance!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Enclosed are letters for Lindau and Constance. Bullinger should forward these.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. In my last letter, I asked you, most learned Bullinger, to send us those first three sessions of the Council of Trent, which I saw with you. Now, however, we have reached a point in the booklet on the same subject, which Oporinus is printing, where we only desire these brief writings. Therefore, I ask you to send them with the first messenger, even if they are copied by some student at my expense. Forgive, I pray, my audacity in bothering you with matters of no importance; for I wish to gratify Oporinus, an excellent man and my host, whom I do not doubt you also love. And if only I could declare in some more serious matter the spirit I have towards your entire church, and indeed towards you! You would all surely feel that anything could be lacking in me rather than diligence and integrity. Therefore, relying on your kindness, which I am convinced is entirely in agreement with my own, I did not hesitate to trouble you in this small matter.</p>

      <p>You also know this: Whoever has once crossed the boundaries of modesty must be boldly shameless. You will also request from Master Theodor the Latin "Summa" of Diaz's confession of faith, which he himself translated into German; for I would like this brief writing to be added to the history, which is now under the press and will soon be completed, as otherwise, it can neither be found in this city nor can it be sent from Strasbourg in time. I ask that these be sent shortly, in both my name and Oporinus'.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am also sending letters to Lindau and Constance, which I ask you to transmit diligently and faithfully.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell. Basel, November 3, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
