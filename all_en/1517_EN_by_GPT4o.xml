      <p>Greetings. I hope that you all are well there, dearest compater in the Lord. Our city, being close to one entirely corrupted by the plague, is threatened by some unknown evil. Everything is teeming with the corruptions of depraved life, so it is no wonder that we are repeatedly visited by the scourge of God. The people of Basel are very much afflicted by the black plague, and it takes many lives daily. Last week, our Myconius, a pious man and veteran minister of Christ, departed from this world. You have already heard about our Jodocus. Many are departing from this life, whose ministries have long aided the church of Christ; may they be succeeded by others who, if not superior, are at least equal and correspond equally to the course of their predecessors.</p>
      <p>The enclosed letters you find here are from our Ambrosius; he sent them to me eight days ago, so that I might send them to Augsburg as soon as possible. However, since there is no one at hand and I cannot hope that someone reliable will be available soon to whom I might entrust them, it seemed best to commit them to your care, so that through you they may be sent to St. Gallen to some friend, by whose effort they may be handed over to a courier frequently going to Augsburg. I know you will not undertake this duty reluctantly for the sake of our Ambrosius.</p>
      <p>Regarding the warlike movements, which perhaps the impending winter will soon restrain, not a word reaches us, nor do we hear anything about the affairs of Hungary after the recent defeat. If you have any information on these matters, I ask you to share it. Our Gastius used to write about new things he heard from time to time; after his death, there is no one in Basel who shares news with equal enthusiasm. Farewell excellently, dearest compater in the Lord. Greetings to all yours; all mine, wife and children, greet you. Bern, 1552.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musc[ulus], your compater in the Lord. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the church of Zürich, his dearest compater.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
