      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter, formerly a deacon of the church in Heidelberg, was recently dismissed by his prince-elector due to a confrontation with the arrogant opponent of truth, the pastor and teacher of the same church, who was recommended to me by Mr. Xylander, a professor at the University of Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>I also wish him to be recommended to you and your fellow ministers. He will explain to you the entire reason for his departure, which is so sound that there is hope that the most illustrious prince would not have dismissed him, had he not feared that the discord, which flared up at an inopportune time, would cause some disturbances.</p>
      <p>You will hear from him in good faith to what extent those miserable true sacramentarians fall into madness and blindness, so that the opinion of the papists on the sacred mysteries is almost more tolerable than theirs. However, I fear that the good and learned man, as things stand now, can hardly be restored to that church unless the Lord opens the eyes of the princes or those learned men, of whom there is a good part everywhere, finally cast off that human fear, which has so far held back so many, not without serious wounds to their consciences, from bearing witness to the truth they have recognized. Let us therefore pray diligently to the Lord that He may finally look upon His church and remove that scandal from its midst. Amen. I thank you for the book you recently sent; I sent another to Mr. Thomas Colmar.</p>
      <p>I have worked on the matter with the Meissen half, so that those from Ribeauvillé write themselves; but I do not know if it is successful or not. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Basel, 19th October 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and most dear brother. Zürich.</p>
