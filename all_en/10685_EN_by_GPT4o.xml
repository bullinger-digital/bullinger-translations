    <p xml:id="regest1">Is concerned about the health of Bullinger and his family. The Bernese pastors hope for a continuation of his commentary work on the Pauline Epistles. What the Zurich envoys [regarding the Solothurn bandit trade] demanded, the Bernese council had already decided on its own. Viret is staying in Bern and is still suffering from the effects of a poisoning attempt. Luther is said to have sought Bullinger's friendship.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Nothing I desire more now, dearest brother, than the good health of your household. I am increasingly terrified that the plague has crept into your home. If it has taken anyone, I grieve, as long as it does not take you, your wife, and children. May the Lord preserve you as a survivor for His church; for how much you benefit it, I do not wish to write, lest I seem to want to ensnare you with flattery. Therefore, since you have such certain news of our city, I beseech you to console me with the health of you and yours, so that my own poor health may receive consolation from yours, which I hope is happy and fortunate.</p>
      <p>The brothers hope to receive the remaining commentaries on Paul's epistles from you, and I also hope and would easily believe that my hope will not be deceived, unless the Lord prevents it.</p>
      <p>Since the departure of your envoys, nothing new has happened here. They obtained what they requested, and they requested what the council had previously promised to do. May all things turn out well and for the glory of God!</p>
      <p>Viret, the preacher of the Genevans with Farel, is with us, a very learned young man, but still in poor health due to poisoning.</p>
      <p>I hear that Luther seeks your friendship. I wish he truly does! Nor do I believe you would refuse him.</p>
      <p>Farewell. My duties call me away.</p>
      <p>10th of September, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To the most pious minister of the Zurich church, Heinrich Bullinger, his uniquely beloved brother.</p>
