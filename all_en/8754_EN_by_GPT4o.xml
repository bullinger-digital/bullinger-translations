      <p>Greetings. I wholeheartedly pray that this new year may be happy and beneficial for you and yours, and especially for the church and the republic. It has been several weeks since I greeted you with a short letter through our local bookseller, most illustrious man and father in Christ, whom I greatly revere. In the meantime, I have not written to you nor have I received anything from you, except for what Beatus Leo communicated from the letters sent to your son in Berg. Nor do I have much to write now, except to express the affection of my heart towards you.</p>
