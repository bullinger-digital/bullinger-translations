      <p>S. D. I read the book of Schwenckfeld on the Church, in which I judge, as from his other books, that this man was given by God to punish those who reject the simplicity of the revealed gospel and prefer subtle, indeed tangled and convoluted things. For I see that all of this man's works are most obscure.</p>
      <p>He disputes about the Church or proposes such questions about it that even the practiced might suspect whether there has ever been a Church in the world. You rightly say that this man does not gather, but scatters.</p>
      <p>I say nothing now about his depraved doctrines.</p>
      <p>I hear that many nobles in Swabia adhere to him; truly, it was said that similar lips have similar lettuces. I wish him a better mind for Christian charity and modesty, and also eyes for his disciples, or that the Lord may restrain his audacity with His hand. I return the book, but I do not return the paper on French affairs; instead, I give thanks for it. I had understood some of it from the royal envoy, but I had not yet seen the entire history skillfully written (namely by Beza). For this, I repay what I received yesterday; for the envoy of the king writes from Solothurn in these words: The king will be consecrated in Reims on May 11 and will enter Paris with pomp on July 20.</p>
      <p>Great progress is made daily for the word in France, and the fury of the false priests is restrained. Having written thus, I receive letters from Vienna in Austria from the Lord of Rhedon, the envoy of our king to the emperor, written on the 15th of this month, in which he signifies that the business of the council seems as uncertain to him as never before. However, something will be decided after the imperial diet; God knows when or what will happen. War begins between the king of Poland and the Muscovites.</p>
      <p>Thus far, I have set forth the very words of Rhedon.</p>
      <p>There is much talk about a future alliance of the pope, the emperor, Spain, and Savoy; may those you know not insert themselves! On the 5th, a middle ground was proposed between them and Glarus, briefly and smoothly rejected with the indication that they would remain by their previous answer. The arbitrators have not set anything more on the middle ground nor driven it, but have spoken of the right from the call of the Glarus, and that it is now time that they, according to the law and saying of the confederates, name place, time, and conditions, which the five places complain about: Why such haste? Now the Glarus have committed themselves in previous treaties that when a Christian council is held, they will abide by its determination; so if it is present, why do they not wait? Their lords and superiors have given them no further command than the aforementioned. And when the arbitrators pressed hard on their previous intention of the right, the envoys of the five places answered: they would gladly do the best in the matter and bring it to their lords, and if they determine place and time, etc., they will write to my lords from now until mid-May; if not, they will bring their answer to the future annual account of John, which was accepted and agreed upon, that peace and quiet should be maintained on both sides against others, etc. All this is included in the decision, in which this matter is comprehensively contained, but the actual summary is told. And since there are restless people who always fear an attack, good care is taken at this time when the land assemblies are held. May God give His grace! etc.</p>
      <p>I can say no more now.</p>
      <p>The pope's envoy has demanded what has been decided about the proposed council, with the indication that the learned should be sent with sufficient safe conduct, etc. Zurich's answer: "We have no command about it; for we think the council is postponed." Bern: "We will see what other people do;" Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug, Glarus papists, Appenzell will obey the council, as will Fribourg and Solothurn; Basel remains by their previous answer: when a free, general Christian council is held, where alone it is concluded from biblical scripture, they will not separate from the true Church of Christ and will hold themselves as pious Christians should; Schaffhausen will see what is done; they have no command. The Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg has complained about the violence from the Rhine, and if it comes to war, what damage would arise to the Confederation, with the request to send an embassy to Burgundy, etc. Envoys will be sent from Zurich, Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Basel, Solothurn, to speak for peace and dissuade Burgundy, etc.; the lord of Cham rode from there yesterday, that he may be in Basel today, from where they all ride together to Dole, or wherever necessary, etc. May God give grace!</p>
      <p>The seven places have also complained about my book De conciliis; the lord of Cham has answered it, that they said nothing further. Be assured, they will come back with it again; for the bishop of Chur, the pope's legate, is restless, and is hostile to the book. Since this matter is truly of the Lord, in His fear and trust I will easily endure the attacks of the enemies of truth. It is agreed that the arbitrators will no longer come to the meetings, but the seven remaining places (if it is brought to the right) will help bring the matter to a good end. May God grant it!</p>
      <p>Return this read pasquinade; I received it from France. As you have also heard, how the books of Pincier and Poquin were forbidden in Basel, so they are again allowed to be sold at the request of the Elector Palatine and the Landgrave. A copy of the Landgrave's is sent back to me.</p>
      <p>Greet for me Mr. Mathias, both my lords mayors and good lords and friends. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Your brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, on the first of May, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
