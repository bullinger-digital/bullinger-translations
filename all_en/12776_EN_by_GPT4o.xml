    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Gast has nothing to report that Myconius has not already written [with No. 2729].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Saxon [Elector Johann Friedrich] has plundered the cities in the territory of the Mainz [Arch]bishop [Sebastian von Heusenstamm], stolen provisions, and attacked the clergy while passing through [towards Saxony].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Nothing certain can be reported about the death of Emperor [Charles V.]. The cities [of Southern Germany] do not seem willing to fight. They do not want to suffer for Christ, even though the devil will torment them as soon as the papist tyranny is reestablished.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Gast would have long since bought the wool, but no reliable messenger was available to him. The best quality is to be found around Pentecost after the wool has been dyed. The goods sent here cost two guilders. It is five pounds. One pound costs ten shillings. There are several divided strands, yet good quality.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also to Anna [née Adlischwyler] and the children.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [PS.:] Gast, or rather his wife [Apollonia, née Glaser], could not acquire less wool.</p>

      <p>S. I have nothing new to report that Myconius has not already written.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The Saxon has plundered the towns of the Archbishop of Mainz, taken provisions from the villages, and paid nothing. He has caused much damage to the bishop and also to the clergy, whom he has attacked while passing through.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>There is uncertain news about the death of the Emperor. I notice that the cities are unwilling to go to war. They are not willing to suffer for Christ, even though they will have to suffer much for the devil's sake when the papal tyranny begins again.</p>

      <p>I would have long since bought from you if I had had a reliable messenger. You should buy around Pentecost. That's when you find the best quality after it has been dyed. But this costs 2 guilders. It is 5 pounds. One pound costs 10 shillings. There are also several strands. They are divided. They have threads. Therefore, you should not think that it is worm-eaten wool.</p>

      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Greet your wife and all the children for me, etc. Basel, on the day of the Innocents 1546. Yours, Gastius from the heart.</p>

      <p>I could not, indeed my wife, take less wool.</p>
      <p>This letter belongs to the well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear, gracious lord, to his hands.</p>
