    <p xml:id="regest1">After being worried about Bullinger due to rumors of a deadly illness in the house of [Theodor] Bibliander, he was reassured by Bullinger's letter. Mayor [Jakob Meyer zum Hirzen] has died, another irreplaceable loss following the death of [Simon] Grynaeus and a clear sign of God's wrath. Instructed by Bullinger, Myconius can now take a position on the decree [regarding the isolation of convalescents], which was received differently by the pastors; shares the mourning for the sons [of Bibliander(?) and Bullinger]. Thanks for the communication of [Ambrosius] Blarer's report [No. 1575] on the conversations with the Passau [Dean Ruprecht von Mosham]; after returning to Strasbourg, it has become apparent that he only pretended towards Bullinger and Pellikan and holds on to the righteousness of works; his intentions remain inscrutable, but he will surely cause unrest through publications after his exploratory journey. In Strasbourg, 18 promising boys have died of the plague, especially Wilhelm Zwingli and Eusebius Oecolampadius, in Basel two schoolmasters and [Johannes] Affinius; Myconius also lay sick for 10 days, but it was his old ailment. Announces a Neuchâtel [Eynard Pichon] who will seek advice in Zurich, as [Guillaume] Farel is being pressured to resign due to his stance against a noble adulteress [Jeanne d'Alliez, née de Rive]; Farel, who proceeded more moderately than before, holds on to the lawfully conferred office despite a call [to Geneva] and finds much support, but due to the resistance of the governor [Georges de Rive] and his despicable followers, an uprising threatens. Cannot report more extensively on Farel due to the penitential service scheduled for tomorrow [October 25]. Greetings to Bibliander; is glad that he is healthy.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Your letters always delight me greatly, especially the ones you sent recently through Quirinus. I was beginning to complain to myself: "Why is it that no one writes; surely those who always keep you informed of their condition are lying low." This opinion was formed because I had heard rumors that Theodor's godson had been taken away and that he himself was infected. Therefore, after seeing your handwriting now, you cannot imagine how relieved I am. May the Lord, I pray, sustain this joy for me for a long time!</p>
      <p>We have lost the mayor of this city, an irreplaceable treasure. He was a man of solid wisdom, that is, wise in the Lord, such as I do not think can easily be found here (may the word not bring envy). What do you think, how great is God's wrath against us? He took away Grynaeus, the light of letters, he took away the mayor, the light of the republic, both examples of religion, and there are none whom we can substitute as equals. It is necessary that we who remain faithfully submit to the known counsel of God, unless we wish to incur even greater indignation.</p>
      <p>You rightly reminded me about the decree, so that I can defend what is contradicted. It gave our people a reason to decide similarly. Three of us did not want to carry it out, the fourth presented it beautifully before his church. I indeed weep with you for the lost sons, but in the meantime, I do not envy them being with Christ.</p>
      <p>I truly thank you for Blaurer's letter, because from it I know your mind is more than friendly towards me, and also because it is entirely worthwhile for me to know what the Passau [Dean] did in Constance. For after he returned to Strasbourg, he acted with Bucer in such a way that you understand it was a deception, whatever he discussed with you and Pellican. For he defends all his own things very fiercely, yet he tries to attribute all the error of the falsity of justification to Luther alone.</p>
      <p>But while they inquired into the matter more diligently, it was discovered that he believes and teaches here that satisfaction can and must be made to the law, and he fixes the consummation of faith in Christ on works. What the man's intentions are, it is not easy to divine.</p>
      <p>There can be no doubt that he does everything through simulation. He will henceforth hide himself from the known opinions of all and by writing will sometimes cause trouble anew for piety, unless the Lord prevents it.</p>
      <p>There is nothing to write about the plague; it rages. Eighteen boys, from whom the greatest expectations were held, have been taken in Strasbourg, among whom the most splendid was Zwingli; Eusebius, the son of Oecolampadius, followed not far behind. Among us, it killed two schoolmasters and Avinius, the ordinary rhetorician. I do not see when the mode of raging will end. I also lay sick for ten days; none of the doctors from the beginning did not judge it to be the plague; finally, the old disease was recognized. May the Lord grant that we may receive his coming, whatever it may be, with joy!</p>
      <p>A certain man from Neuchâtel will come to you in a few days because of Farel, whom some impious people wish to have expelled. He will seek advice on what should be done; for he thinks that without God's indignation, he cannot leave the office, in which he was legitimately placed, especially because of a very noble adulteress, not a mere harlot. I warn you to quickly absolve him when he seeks advice, while he is present.</p>
      <p>I have indeed known Farel's severity for a long time; but in this matter, he seems to have completely abandoned it, he conducted everything so moderately. Therefore, I fully support him. Would that something may be found most suitable for the concord of the pastor and the sheep! He indeed has a calling elsewhere, but through the former, which could not have been more just, he thinks he should not yield, since apart from the adulteress, whom the prince with all the dregs of the city stubbornly supports, there is no other reason why they do not want to hear him anymore. He has all the parish priests on his side, a good part of the senate, many from the common people; yet the prince drags a greater number with him. Hence, a sedition is to be feared unless it is prevented. I could add certain things about Farel, which perhaps would contribute somewhat to the consultation; but there is no leisure because of the supplications appointed for tomorrow. Farewell in Christ with yours and Theodor, to whom say how anxious the rumor about him being infected made me and how glad I was when I found it to be false.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect us from all evil. Amen. Basel, October 24, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zurichers, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
