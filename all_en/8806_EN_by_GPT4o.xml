      <p>Most revered father, the private and public concerns make me brief, and there is not much need now to say more, since the event itself, unless God averts it, will provide a very sad occasion through frequent letters. On the 5th of March, six messengers arrived from the communities of the Prättigau, Upper Saxony, and some other communities, who were entrusted with the extraordinary task of recruiting other supporters from the remaining communities as well, who would travel through Rhaetia village by village and educate the people about the true nature of these bulls, which the magnates strive to obscure and pervert in favor of the most powerful men, and accuse us of malicious interpretation, and graphically present to them the snares by which we are attacked by the Roman pontiff and his creatures. Therefore, when they also came to us on the aforementioned day, they immediately added a messenger in the name of the city to all the tribes gathered, who now together are heading through the Rucantian Valley to Davos, and a great multitude surrounds them everywhere. They want not only those infernal diplomas to be understood by the people, but also for the Rhaetian to be punished more severely by a free judgment held by themselves, not with fortunes, but with the body. This intention of punishment certainly struck the mind of the Rhaetian so much that on a certain night he began to fortify his castle with the nearby peasants as a defense, which he later allowed to be dismantled. The pastor of Maienfeld, Victor Fabricius (who was once in the place of a son to your reverence, when his uncle acted as a corrector at Mr. Froschauer's), instructed by Mr. Conradin Planta, came to me yesterday, imploring in his name and at his request, that some remedy, whatever we can devise, be applied promptly to this rampant disease and the plan of these emissaries; for the sake of God, Planta earnestly requests this. We certainly, who were prepared at the beginning of this matter to avoid all danger voluntarily by the duty of charity and modesty, if only they would hand over the bulls and no longer covet the provostship of Tilsit, now responded that it is difficult to counter this rampant evil. For besides the fact that this aid has given a harmful occasion to detract from the exiles and schools, everything is now in such turmoil that there is a danger that we may be judged similar to the privileged if we wish to dissuade the people with untimely intercessions.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in our judgment, no other means exists than for the Rhaetian to acknowledge his fault and submit himself to the will of the communities by pleading.</p>
      <p>We will soon hear what judgment the communities everywhere have made, which now rage and rage everywhere all the more, as their leaders had secretly tried not to pursue this arduous cause, but to suppress it and eradicate it from the memory of men and crush it with perpetual oblivion. Some of the more powerful ones have also shown themselves to be quite belligerent, who, in order to make the people more uncertain about what to believe, accused our interpretations of the bulls of falsehood, correcting which they brought forth marvelous meanings and deceitful explanations in favor of the Rhaetian. For where we called him a heretic, ein Käzer, they substituted, erasing our interpretation, ein ehrlichen Secter, and so in many other cases. We, however, not only reproached these things in the synod at Glarus in Davos, but also previously said in the senate of the Three Leagues that no honest or honorable man would accuse us of this falsehood. But many have hardened their foreheads so much that they would mix heaven with earth, as long as they could satisfy their desires. I cannot yet send the acts, but I will soon free myself. - Josua von Salis, a papal supporter, is said to have been hired among us by the Venetians to lead away the Rhaetian soldier. Today, however, a subcommittee is held here, in which passage will certainly be denied. But why do they not first bring their own into order, who, prudently blocking the passage to foreigners and outsiders, are blind? These things to your reverence. Most swiftly.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the whole choir. All of ours greet you. Chur, in the year 1572, March 10th.</p>
