      <p>Greetings. I am very concerned that the letters I have written to you several times may have been lost and fallen into the hands of ill-wishers. The treasurer, who is delivering this, knows that I have written to you extensively, which he himself said he has taken good care of.</p>
      <p>Last week I wrote again and included new information in the letters, and the week before last I sent you others, which a certain person from Maienfeld received and promised to take good care of. But you have not written to me about these three. I am now sending this fourth one, but it is brief.</p>
      <p>For our treasurer, who has been appointed president of Thurgau, is a living letter.</p>
      <p>I have entrusted him with the news I received from trusted sources, to be given to you. I ask that in this most dangerous matter, from which war may arise, whereby we may be stripped of both freedom and religion, you do what you can to bend and mitigate the more rigid ones, so that the turmoil, otherwise dangerous in many ways, may be settled on fair terms, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet Mr. Consul Willi, our Campell, and all other friends and acquaintances in order. July 1, 1573.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and brother Mr. Tobias Egli, preacher in Chur.</p>
