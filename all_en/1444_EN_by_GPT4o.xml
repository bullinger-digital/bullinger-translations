      <p>May the grace of Christ be with you. When I encountered this Ulrich Escher, a fellow countryman of yours returning home and a faithful messenger and model of all modesty, I did not want, most learned, not to say dearest brother of all, Bullinger, to commit this offense against you, the patron of our churches, which are mocked by neighboring malevolent people as if they are soon to be destroyed, so that you might have certainty about our affairs, etc. The churches still enjoy their freedom in Christ Jesus, although there are those who think that we should accept Baal's priests, God forbid. But God will provide better things; for the republics of the churches have so thickened their skin, instructed by the word of grace, that now they hate the Spanish faith or religion more vehemently than ever; for they recognize the deceptions. Would that they might persist without sedition, but with true patience in Christ and repentance. The Anabaptists cause us much trouble, whose foolishness is now somewhat detected even by the wise. Nikolaus Bauner, whose slanders you have read, if I am not mistaken, sent by the prince, has recanted, now admitting the Holy Spirit as the third person of the holy Trinity; likewise, he asserts that Christ assumed true flesh from the seed of Abraham, David, and finally from the Virgin Mary without any stain and sin; now proscribed, he is in exile and through letters asks to be received into grace, etc. There is a persistent rumor that the Council of Trent has been dissolved; the Bishop of Strasbourg has returned, it is certain, as well as those of Mainz and Trier. Christ will not fail both his own and his cause.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ. The brothers in Christ greet you, especially Regulus. Greet for us your fellow ministers Gwalther, Bibliander, my fellow presbyter Pellican; tell him that I am gathering provisions for the pilgrimage, which will soon be at hand, so that he may do the same. Would that we might be delivered according to the Lord's will. In Riquewihr, October 26, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and sacred learning, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the people of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
