    <p xml:id="regest1">Gifts Myconius' wife [Margret] his book ["Der christliche Ehestand"], which he wrote because so much useless material is being read. He is surprised that Myconius does not write about how he and the Basel church are doing; fortunately, there is nothing unpleasant to report from ZÃ¼rich. The newly elected Bishop of Constance [Johann von Weeze] has been paid homage on Reichenau, in Arbon, and in some other places and is said to have met with delegates from four Inner Swiss locations in Markdorf; when demands he made from Kreuzlingen to Constance were not met, he rode down the Rhine to [Emperor] Charles and [King] Ferdinand in Brussels, where [Francis I] of France and other kings are also expected. On February 7, Ferdinand was received in Nuremberg with great honors and rich gifts. Many are glad that the mass and images were not abolished, as the king's favor would otherwise be harder to obtain; so much do frivolous merchants overestimate the transient power of worldly rulers!</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The little book you see, most esteemed Myconius, you will give to your wife and ask her not to disdain this small gift. I wrote it at the request of many brothers and for the benefit of the citizens and Germany, which I see occupied with useless and vain little books, tales, and songs, etc. I wanted to provide an opportunity for the pious to become more devout. May the Lord grant growth.</p>
      <p>You have not written for a month and a half about your affairs and those of the church, which makes me wonder what is happening. However, I hope to soon read things that will be encouraging. I cannot write anything unfortunate about us, thanks to the Lord, who also strengthens what He has begun in us.</p>
      <p>That Bishop of Constance, whom they call the "postulant" or, if you prefer, the "pustulant of Constance" or Lund, has been received in faith at Reichenau in Lake Constance, furthermore at the Happy Tree, which they call Arbon, and some other small towns. He was greeted by delegates from the four Inner Swiss locations in Markdorf and detained for a few hours. So they say; how true it is, I do not know. He also came to Kreuzlingen and made some demands from the people of Constance, which, when not granted, he rode with a few men down the Rhine to seek his gods Charles and Ferdinand, who are said to be meeting in March in Brussels, Brabant, with the King of France and some other rulers.</p>
      <p>On February 7, Ferdinand was received very decently and sumptuously by the people of Nuremberg. The entire senate and the most honorable citizens, numbering 300, went to meet him; several thousand armed men were distributed from the city gate to the castle, providing him with an easy entrance. He himself rode under a huge canopy made of silk, which was carried and supported by the fathers walking alongside. And indeed, he stayed with them for two days. They offered him a silver cup worth eighty marks, filled with several thousand Nuremberg gold coins. Some extend the number to 10,000. The prince, having promised everything, departed on the third day after his entrance. Many voices are said to have been heard: "How well it has gone with us that we did not abolish the mass entirely nor remove the images from the temple. What would other cities give to have a king as gracious to them as we do?" But oh, frivolous merchants, oh foolish mind, which values the favor of a mortal and miserable prince more than that of the eternal King! May the Lord Jesus strengthen His own with His spirit, so they are not moved by the noise of those foolish kings, who will soon either migrate to another world with little honor and decency or be led captive by someone more powerful. For Scripture and the course of all things itself teach that the earth must either be changed or overthrown by the most just Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell and write, so I may know how you are. February 28, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the first preacher of the Basel church, esteemed brother.</p>
