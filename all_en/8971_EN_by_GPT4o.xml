      <p>Greetings. I was about to write you a lengthy letter; but the bearer of this letter, a learned, honest, serious, and knowledgeable man, Mr. Jeremias Mederus from Montbéliard, once the treasurer and secretary of the late Count Georg of Württemberg, relieves me of much of this labor. Having visited us purely for the sake of friendship during these dog days, he has also decided to travel to you, even if only for your sake, whom he saw many years ago. He seems to be very sincere and a devotee of the teachings of our churches. He can narrate more about the events currently happening everywhere, whether in France, Germany, or even in the Netherlands, than I could write or anyone else. He will report how many French are now in the Netherlands with the Count of Nassau, what progress they are making, which and how many places they have already occupied, what the King of France replied to the Spanish King's envoy, how the Admiral treated the Parisians and what he demanded from them, a clever act and a ridiculous story, how and where Count Eberstein was intercepted by the Palatine, how the Turk, after an incessant eight-day assault, captured the city of Zara in Dalmatia, what kind of edict the new governor of the Netherlands, Medinaceli, proposed, which abolishes all inquisition and promises freedom to anyone, how in the meantime Orange proceeds, where, when, and with what army he crossed the Rhine, how he conducts himself towards everyone and under what title he manages his affairs, where the so-called Catholic fleet is, and what discord exists among its factions. He will also tell more about the disputes of the Saxon theologians and many other such matters, including a remarkable dialogue written by someone about a conversation held between Satan, Pasquillus, and several cardinals and bishops, which he can enumerate so easily and promptly that it would be entirely superfluous for me to write anything about these; I only wanted to give you the opportunity to inquire about these from him. Meanwhile, we await your letters. There is nothing particular with us otherwise.</p>
      <p>Our consul was in Solothurn these days because of the Genevans; but what was done there, I do not yet know.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, we hear the school has been disrupted again because of the plague; in Lausanne, they are not much better off.</p>
      <p>Steiger will soon depart for Baden; he sends his regards. The same does Mülinensis, the other consul, as well as Diesbach, both treasurers, Hagenberg, Telamon, the father-in-law, Schöpf, the doctor, and all friends and brothers. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 25, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
