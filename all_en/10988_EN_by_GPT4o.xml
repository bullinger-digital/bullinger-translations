      <p>My friendly willing service and all good things, well-learned, honorable, dear sir, etc.</p>
      <p>As I discussed with you last time regarding my matter concerning Berger, I have done so, and therefore, if it is not convenient for you to write properly, do as you see necessary and good. But here is my request: If it cannot be more, at least help me to get back my money, which I lent to his son. Otherwise, it would be very difficult for me, and I would have to forgo much. He has never done anything for me for free in his life. However, I hope the arbitration process will also bring me something more. But whatever you do, I will be satisfied once, and let me know how I stand. And with this, I commend you to the one and good Lord God.</p>
      <p>Given in Ill, on the Sunday before Valentine's Day in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Hans Rudolf Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the Zurich church, my especially trusted and dear sir, in his hand.</p>
