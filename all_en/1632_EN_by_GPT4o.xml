      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. That Paul, son of the late Paul Fagius of blessed memory, returning from England in recent days, stayed with his relative Johann Ulstetter, the teacher of our school, to consult about another place more suitable for his studies. It was finally agreed among us, in harmony, that the Academy of Zurich would be beneficial to him for many advantages.</p>
      <p>The young man was not displeased with the decision, and as soon as he was ready, he committed himself to the peril of the journey, beset by so many bloodthirsty soldiers, etc. Furthermore, Bullinger, most learned, there is no need for me to commend him to you at length; for he himself will provide a shining example of piety and learning, as well as honesty, unless, God forbid, he wishes to be otherwise than he has been so far, and we hope he will bring back his father. Therefore, you, with your singular kindness, which you show towards all students, help and promote him and his studies, especially so that he may have a lodging worthy of him; for we all hope well that he will not disappoint our expectations.</p>
      <p>Here we live peacefully among so many preparations for war and the noise of neighboring cities and heroes, being spoken of badly by rivals and haters of peace, as if we, who profess Christ, were the cause of this turmoil. They accuse us just like that wolf, who, drinking at the spring, reproached the lamb below him for disturbing the water. Therefore, they threaten greatly, saying they will utterly destroy this whole area if besieged by the French. The day before yesterday, they made a sortie from Breisach into three neighboring villages of the prince, plundering supplies with violent hands; but they were driven back by our prefect. From this single example, you understand the dangers we are involved in. The enemy promises freedom to the fatherland. Would that we stood in the freedom with which Christ has set us free. I do not see how we can defend our freedom against such endeavors and schemes. The French have occupied all of Lorraine, taking the younger and surviving duke, who is ten years old, with them in the army. What will happen, time will tell, etc. Therefore, pray most earnestly to the Son of God for us, you our brothers and your churches, that in these storms our little church may not be overwhelmed by the waves of war, but that He may preserve this Bethulia by His usual mercy for the glory of His name. Farewell with these words and greet all the brothers, especially Pellican; tell him to now adorn himself with iron armor for the defense of his fatherland.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, 7th of May, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus KÃ¶nig, a widower, who came to me while I was writing, greets you.</p>
      <p>Especially to the man distinguished in piety and doctrine, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, theologian of the people of Zurich, his esteemed brother.</p>
