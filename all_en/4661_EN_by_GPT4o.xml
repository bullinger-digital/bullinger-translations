      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I give and will give you immortal thanks as long as I live, for your more than paternal kindness and care towards me. Everything has succeeded (praise be to the Lord) for the glory of God.</p>
      <p>However, in order to achieve this, many things have come together and contributed, but above all, the diligent and dutiful recommendation of my most illustrious lords of Zürich to this assembly.</p>
      <p>May God himself, by whose authority and persuasion this most honorable council is moved to defend and propagate the glory of our Savior, grant that I may someday provide some public demonstration of my respect for this city.</p>
      <p>To you, most revered father and especially dear lord, I confess that I owe so much that even if I were to lay down my life for you, I would not seem to myself to have attained the least of your services to me. In this matter, I am consoled by the fact that I see all these services to the ministers of Christ arising from the most ardent affection of your heart, by which you are led to desire to assist everyone. How our cause was handled and concluded in the assembly, the most revered brother and lord Fabricius wrote to you, a man, to speak truly, so diligent and steadfast in attending to those things that pertain to the evangelical business, that nothing can be desired in him. May God, in His mercy, preserve you, him, and other such helpers and promoters of this holy institution. Today, God willing, I will return towards Misaucos, where, if the Lord wills, I will administer the function entrusted to me by Him. Indeed, some sworn enemies of Christ will rage there; but nevertheless, the Lord, who is almighty, will restrain their crowds. Severe penalties have been decreed in the assembly against the disobedient.</p>
      <p>What, shall I not endure anything, provided I see it done for the glory of God? I have not seen my wife for several days now; as I was departing, she instructed me to greet you with your most pious wife, children, and sons-in-law in her name, which I do, and I pray to our Lord to keep you all whole and blameless until the day of Christ Jesus. Farewell and live, and continue (as you do) to conduct the Lord's business.</p>
      <p>Chur, February 12, 1561.</p>
      <p>Giovanni Beccaria, your most devoted son.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, most revered lord and father. In Zürich.</p>
