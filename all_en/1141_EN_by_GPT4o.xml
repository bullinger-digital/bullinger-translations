      <p>Dearly beloved lord and brother. Zöger is indeed a good, pious, quiet young man, who for a time, while I lived here, was a steward, and afterwards, through me, was promoted to manage the school in Bischofszell, where he has conducted himself excellently well up to now, so that he has a good word and praise from all the pious, as I have credible written testimony of this.</p>
      <p>But now, in a short time, his father has died, who was a pastor in N., and has left me, as those from Winterthur have filled the pastorate; he left nothing but approximately 300 florins of debt, a poor widow, and several children, two of whom are still with their mother and are not yet able (due to their youth) to support themselves. The subjects would gladly see the pastorate given to the young Zöger, so that the mother could also remain in the house and the debt could be paid off over time, which the good young man has agreed to, in case those from Winterthur would grant him the pastorate.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he is now coming to you to be examined, in the hope that God might arrange for those from Winterthur to grant it to him, which he desires solely for the sake of his mother and siblings, and so that he might honor his deceased father and pay off the debts. Therefore, I wish to commend him to you for the best; for by all human judgment, he is a pious, good man. There is otherwise another candidate, a merchant by birth, who has many friends here; he might perhaps be preferred. He also wants to be examined in Zurich or has done so. Zöger will need your help, perhaps one of his young brothers might come into the harbor or into the monastery, etc.; it would be well arranged. Do your best and help the poor fatherless children for God's sake.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have no news except a letter from Lindau, that it is full of war cries there and all the old soldiers are ready, so they do not promise themselves anything; but what will come of it, one cannot yet know, except that the suspicion among everyone is that it is against Magdeburg again.</p>
      <p>May God not let them be put to shame for the sake of His great name! To Him they are commended. Praying for me and mine along with yours. Dated the 7th day of January in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable friend.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
