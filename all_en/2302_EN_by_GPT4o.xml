      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Ten days ago, most honorable man, I sent my letter to you with a young man, the nephew of Massarius, who was passing through your area, in which I was responding to your most recent letter sent to me.</p>
      <p>I am writing again now solely for the reason of knowing the fidelity of that messenger, whether he delivered them or not, which you will kindly remember to indicate to me with a single word at your convenience. I have nothing else to write at the moment. However, it is said to be certain that the English people have laid down their arms and the new king, namely Philip, has arrived. The Emperor, made happier by this event, has become stronger day by day, so much so that he is now engaging in hunting. The German princes are armed, yet remain quiet, in favor of the Emperor. It is almost over for Albert. They believe that few Rhaetians will survive the return, etc. May the Lord keep you safe, happy, and for a very long time. From Basel, on the 4th day of June, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Guglielmo Grataroli, physician. To the best pastor of the Zürich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>To Zürich.</p>
