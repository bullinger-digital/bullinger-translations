      <p>Greetings. It is more blessed, my Bullinger, venerable brother in Christ and incomparable friend, to measure the misfortunes of others that could happen to oneself. I have deeply mourned the loss of a daughter, as if she were my own, and this for two reasons (as you write), not just fourfold. Many things have happened that have greatly amplified the cause of my sorrow, which were unknown to you until now.</p>
      <p>I did not want to trouble you with these matters; however, you will hear the full account of the whole affair from either me or my wife at some point, not that it would compel you to change your holy counsel (for it is firm and unchangeable, as it is of the Lord), but so that you may clearly see how deeply and not without great offense I have been moved. I have always, with a sincere heart (God is my witness), and with a mind conscious of no deceit, been forced to lose a daughter with great sorrow of my soul. But why say more; I believe you can measure this pain of your Gervasius by your own affection for your dear pledges. Yet your sympathy has not a little reconciled and calmed my spirit. Your counsel pleases me, believe me, because it is plainly divine, and after the departure of my daughter, I have not resorted to any curses or devotions, whatever the world may say. The immense pain of my soul and my former love for my daughter have always met each other, so that neither affection could prevail. But your counsel has made it so that love for my daughter has taken the principal place in my heart, as befits my fatherhood.</p>
      <p>May they seek forgiveness and pardon the error, which I still desire in both; when this has been done, you will feel in reality, you will feel, my brother, how much the counsel of the Lord accepted through you can do with me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as for your amazement at the new and unheard-of calling of the people of Kempten, cease, brother, to think that this is the offspring of my affections, which began before my daughter left. I know the insolence of the Lutherans, not to say madness, with what rashness and open boldness they riot for their own, truly their own, not God's opinion; I also know with what constancy our opinion on the matter of the Eucharist has always been preached and defended in Kempten by Jacob Heystung, then the preacher there, and later by Master Paul Rasdorffer, in a pious public sermon, of which I diligently reminded the people of Kempten in my response and abundantly explained my mind to them in this matter. To this, I added that I am bound by oath to the council of Bern, hence it is necessary for them to plead their case with the council there. What they replied, though late, you have here, where you can see how cunningly they have avoided the sacramental issue in this writing of theirs, lest they be forced to admit their inconsistency. But I give thanks to the Lord, who has not failed me in this part with His grace; I have other things, to tell the truth, that ulcerate my mind in Lenzburg, so that I almost despair of the progress of evangelical preaching. But I have resolved to continue through the Lord, especially since I know that the Lord teaches those whom He teaches with mercy, and those whom He does not teach, He does not teach with judgment. My son-in-law Leonard received the letters from Kempten, which I had forgotten. The summary is this: "Since we understand from your letter that you are bound to the city of Bern, we trust you this time, since good preachers are not to be obtained from your lords; we will therefore wait to see how God provides for us in another way," etc. So much for the former; now to the latter letters, which you sent through the messenger. I rejoice that the state of your church is in a pleasing bloom in God; may the Lord advance it further. Would that I could freely say such things about the state of the church committed to me. I hear with difficulty about the tumult of wars being so fiercely joined; I do not yet see to which side victory is to be wished; God knows.</p>
      <p>Germany is in danger, would that it may prevail. But our sins have deserved this, as we so irreverently either receive or refuse the visitation of the heavenly Father. The captain Fuchsberger from Mellingen, the audacious bloodhound, has perished in Piedmont; the Confederates have retreated four miles. I fear we will eventually also end up in the soup. This is what we get from the bloodhounds who sell the fatherland for money. I have already sent the letters to Bern to be delivered there; for a messenger was then offering himself, to whom I could safely entrust them. I thank you for the booklet you sent; may the Lord make it so that you may benefit His church for as long as possible. Greet your entire family in my name, Master Pellican, Theodor, and farewell in Christ, my dearest Bullinger. Given at Lenzburg, July 18, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church of ZÃ¼rich, lord brother and old friend in Christ most dear, etc.</p>
