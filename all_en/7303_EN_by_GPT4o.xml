      <p>Greetings. I have received all your letters, honorable father, both those you sent through Fietz, my relative, and those through the steward of Königsfelden. I have also read what you wrote and sent to the steward himself. I have nothing certain to add to these; everything has been silent for several days now. It was indeed reported that the Swiss in Paris, driven by hunger, had broken out to bring in some plunder, but were repulsed by the adversaries not without loss; for three captains were said to have perished, and they were named Praroman, the consul of Freiburg, Häss of Glarus, and a certain man from Solothurn. But I cannot yet affirm what the truth of this is. I hear that a certain German merchant from Solothurn has been captured because he said these things, and he will not be released until it is known what he said is true. As for the latter, two cohorts passed through here not without the murmuring and indignation of our people; they were forced to stay in inns; otherwise, there was such a gathering that departure would not have been without conflict.</p>
      <p>We hear they are heading to Lyon to join the remaining papist forces there. The Duke of Savoy, through his envoy, informs our people that he is being urged by the king to assist him; however, he cannot refuse this, and so he will send him 1000 horsemen. The king has also requested passage for the Italian army through his territory; he also cannot deny this and wishes to inform our lords of this so that they know what his preparations mean and do not think that he is plotting anything against them. This common syncretism against the pious and the truth is apparent; but these matters will also be discussed in Baden with your envoys. What counsel should be taken is unknown; danger appears if we also involve ourselves in this war; again, what will happen to us if our side in France succumbs! Therefore, we must pray to the Lord to suggest counsel and wisdom and to moderate everything for the common peace, for the salvation of his people, and especially for the glory of his name and the preservation of the truth. Collections are being made by some churches for the exiles from Lyon, who, miserable and stripped of everything, come in great numbers to Geneva and Lausanne. What will happen in our city, we do not yet know; we are urging, however, that it also be done here; may the Lord grant success! I have nothing else now; as soon as I receive anything, I will inform you. May the Lord keep you!</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you in return; greet yours as well. Bern, November 14, 1567.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
