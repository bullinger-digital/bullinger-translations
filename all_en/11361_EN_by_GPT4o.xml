      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our most beloved Lord Jesus Christ be with us all.</p>
      <p>We have received, dearest brother in the Lord, your letters, which you sent to us these days in the name of Gallus (the one who changes his mind), in which you also announce the service rendered to him by you, all of which have affected us in a wonderful way, and we give thanks to Christ our Lord, who has granted us this gift, that you are not averse to such things. May He make it so that through the Holy Spirit we may continually perform such work, that He alone may be exalted, and we may desire more and more. As far as it is in us, if at any time we can gratify you (although our things are very poor and worthless), it will be yours to command, and ours to obey in all things. Furtmüller is handling the matter of negotiating with a certain church in Zug, which Gallus himself can report in person. As soon as these things are completed, we will transcribe them to you very quickly. In the meantime, it will be yours (which I know you do) to advise, exhort, correct, whatever in him might be less suitable for this task, so that having sincerely entered this province, he may administer it with great glory to the name of God and with eternal disgrace to papism and all impiety, with the Lord assisting by His grace.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I would like to ask you, if business permits, dearest Bullinger, to send me the books of the "Anabasis" by Arrian printed in Greek type in Basel, if you have a supply of them, by a convenient messenger, in Greek only. The price they demand, once you have indicated it, will be promptly reimbursed. And if the Lives of Plutarch were available in Greek, you might bid for them in my name, and show what would need to be spent, if by chance there was an opportunity to purchase them. And because I know you are not burdened by this task due to your kindness, I impose it more easily and more boldly.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, and be continually blessed in the name of Furtmüller and myself with the other brothers.</p>
      <p>In St. Gallen, October 18, 1539. Your Dominik Zili.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
