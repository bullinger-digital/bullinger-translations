      <p>To the faithful pastor of the Church of Geneva, Mr. Johannes Calvin, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Your immense dedication, Calvin, most esteemed brother in the Lord, and your diligent efforts to make the doctrine of the sacraments more illustrious day by day and to remove offenses from the midst of the church, which seem to have arisen from a somewhat obscure explanation of the mysteries, bring us no trouble at all. Instead, we consider them not only worthy of praise and commendation but also deserving of our support and imitation to the best of our ability. For since the sacred laws of our prince Jesus Christ refer all actions to the cultivation of charity and mutual assistance, they prohibit nothing more severely than that anyone should place an obstacle before another, preventing them from rightly and truly judging those matters whose knowledge is necessary or certainly useful and salutary for people, or from performing their duty, which is owed both to God and to their neighbors. They also command with the same gravity to remove, as much as possible, the stumbling blocks into which people are accustomed to fall. Therefore, the reason for your visit to us and Mr. Guillaume Farel, our venerable brother, seemed to us most honorable and especially worthy of ecclesiastical men, that we might first, in a simple and familiar conversation, mutually express our opinion on the sacraments, especially on those points where there has certainly been some controversy until now among those who have delivered the purer doctrine of the gospel with great consensus in other respects, and then to testify our agreement by publishing a written document.</p>
      <p>For we see no other more suitable way and method by which religious controversies may be resolved or vain suspicions of disagreement dispelled, where no disagreement exists, or finally, offenses that sometimes arise in the church of God from the controversial opinions of teachers may be removed, than if the parties who seem to disagree or indeed do disagree, openly explain their mind to each other both in speech and in writing. But it would be of little use for the truth, once investigated and discovered, to be retained among them unless it is also made known to other people by more fully explaining those things that were indicated more sparingly, and by expressing in more familiar words what was said more obscurely, and by declaring with certain proper and significant words what was ambiguously stated. This method has always pleased the ecclesiastical fathers and has been very often used in settling religious controversies and has never failed to be beneficial to the church, finally being approved by the supreme example of the apostles of Christ, our Lord and God. For as we read in Acts chapter 25, no other way and method was used to settle the greatest dissension when the apostles and the true disciples of the apostles taught that hearts are purified by faith in the name of Christ and that people are saved by his grace alone, while some contended that it was necessary to be circumcised and to keep the Mosaic law. Therefore, we cannot but highly approve, Calvin, your holy efforts and those of all the pious who strive by suitable means to remove offenses and restore the disturbed peace and tranquility of the church, while they endeavor to make the Christian doctrine more and more illustrious and complete by simple and accurate explanation and to remove vain opinions of discord from minds or even to bring those who have differed somewhat in words and opinions into true, solid, and holy concord. Moreover, as we hope for the fruit you predict in your letter from the publication of the document by which we wish to clearly testify our agreement to both the pious and the adversaries of the truth, we are also led by the experience already made; for we have shown it here to some men who love Christ and the truth and are not unskilled in sacred matters, who not only recognized that we agree even in those points where we have hitherto been thought by many to disagree, but also gave thanks to Christ the Savior, seeing us agree in God and the truth and promised great hope of more abundant fruit in the church, although some desired a more copious treatment of this argument due to certain dispositions, who, having heard our plan, admitted satisfaction not with difficulty. For what was the point of explaining in so many words that God is the author of the sacraments and that they were instituted for the legitimate children of the church, how many sacraments have been handed down by Christ to the church or what have been invented by men, what are the parts of the sacraments or in what place, at what time, with what sacred instrument it is fitting to perform the mysteries. In which and some other points, the books published, which either our teachers of pious and holy memory or we ourselves have written about the sacraments, sufficiently prove that there was no appearance or shadow of disagreement among us. But concerning the bodily presence of the Lord Christ, the genuine meaning of the solemn words, the eating of the body of Christ, the purpose and use and effect of the sacraments, in which points many have hitherto thought our opinions or certainly our words to conflict, we have spoken so copiously, so plainly and simply, that we hope that those who are eager for both fraternal concord and clear truth will not lack either abundance or clarity of expression in our writing. Nor do we doubt that the ministers of other churches of Christ throughout Switzerland will easily recognize that we have expressed the very doctrine of the sacraments which has been made known to the Christian people for many years now, and that they do not differ from us in the least in the truth confessed. This we promise ourselves not without great reasons concerning all the pious throughout the churches of other nations. However, if anyone should produce a more evident explanation of the sacraments, we would prefer to use that very one with all the pious rather than urge one person to subscribe to our agreement, in which we have used and openly expressed the words of the holy scriptures, in what sense we understand them, and we are assured that we do so with the catholic church. Furthermore, if this writing does not remove the offenses of all those whom the appearance of discord among us has hindered in the ways of the Lord, which we most earnestly desire, we will still consider it to have performed its duty excellently, because we have testified not obscurely nor deceitfully to all that we, to whom Christ has given the same mind and speech concerning religious doctrines, do not differ at all in the explanation of the mysteries...</p>
