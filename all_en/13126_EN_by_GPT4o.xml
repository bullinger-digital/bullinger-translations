    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Last night, Vadian had dinner with Francisco de Enzinas. He is on his way to Memmingen, where he intends to settle a private financial matter with Hieronymus Sailer. On his return journey (which he plans to undertake soon), he intends to travel through St. Gallen again and then proceed to Zurich to, as he said, visit friends. He will certainly bring back news, perhaps not pleasant, but welcome, which will spur vigilance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] After Vadian had already sealed his last letter to Bullinger [No. 3076], he learned from a trustworthy friend [...] of the city of St. Gallen that Emperor Charles V plans to reinstate Duke Charles III of Savoy in his territories (the Emperor and the Duke are said to like each other very much). Initially, he intends to reconquer Piedmont along with Turin and the surrounding cities for the Duke. After that, he wants to move this side of the Alps and regain the rest of the Duke's territory [the Chablais and the Vaud]. And if the Confederates were to come to the aid of King Henry II of France or try to prevent this, he would immediately attack them and harass them with all his forces so that they cannot resist him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Another [...] reported that it is assured that the Electors are currently deliberating on the [Swabian] League (which is to include all the estates of the Empire) and that they will join it despite their reservations, especially since all are compelled to do so by the power exercised by the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is certain that the establishment of this League is very dear to the Emperor's heart. However, his war plans are less certain. But since Vadian's friends repeatedly warn in their letters of an attack by the Emperor, it could well be that he will indeed try to involve all of Helvetia in a protracted war at once. May something unexpected happen to thwart this plan!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Last night, I dined with Francisco de Enzinas, who is heading directly to Memmingen to settle some private financial matters with Hieronymus Sailer. He mentioned that once he returns to us (and he will return shortly), he plans to go to Zurich to visit friends. He will undoubtedly bring some news, perhaps not entirely pleasant, but nonetheless welcome, to ensure that nothing is neglected through vigilance.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Meanwhile, after I had already sealed my previous letters to you, one of my close friends from our city informed me that Emperor Charles V has decided to reinstate the Duke of Savoy. It is said that the Emperor is greatly esteemed by him and, in turn, greatly loved by the Emperor. He will endeavor to first reclaim the Piedmont region with Turin and other nearby towns, and then, after crossing the Alpine passes, to occupy the rest of the territory under his dominion. If the Swiss or the French King were to assist or try to defend against this, he would suddenly attack them and harass them with his military forces so that they would not be able to gather a large force anywhere.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Another person added that it is now certain that the Electors are discussing a major league of the Empire's states, which almost all are reluctantly joining. However, all are being pressured by the Emperor's authority and will, so that it is not permissible to refuse deliberation on this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is certain that the Emperor is concerned about this league, but the plans for war are not so certain, except that it is widely indicated in the letters of our friends that it is scarcely possible for the Emperor to aim his arms where he intends without involving all of Switzerland in a war, and indeed a prolonged one. But may some unexpected and fortunate event render all these plans vain and frivolous!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I wish you well. St. Gallen, 16th day of November, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most pious bishop of the people of Zurich, a singular lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
