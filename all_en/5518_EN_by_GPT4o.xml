      <p>Greetings. I suppose the news has reached you that our most holy and learned Martyr has passed away to the Lord. I am almost overwhelmed with grief otherwise, and yet this is the greatest of all my sorrows and nearly crushes me. This man was incomparable and dearest to me among mortals.</p>
      <p>Not only our church but the universal church has suffered an almost irreparable loss in him. He shared many things with me while he was bedridden.</p>
      <p>He was bedridden for barely 8 days.</p>
      <p>The illness struck him down almost from the beginning: but he was of undaunted spirit, with the most sincere and robust faith.</p>
      <p>He passed away sitting in a chair on November 12 at 3 o'clock in the afternoon or shortly after. It pained him that he could not respond to Brentius, but he also entrusted this matter to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I continue to respond to him as best I can. I wish other good men would also oppose his foul errors.</p>
      <p>He denies that heaven is a place, contending it is everywhere. He affirms that Christ was glorified immediately at conception, and that Christ's body is so elevated in glory above creation that it is now in no place, but everywhere at once, just like divinity, etc. He fully agrees with Schwenckfeld's doctrine.</p>
      <p>He invents marvelous rules and twists the scriptures, and obscures the humanity of Christ no less than Servetus obscures the divinity.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on him and restore his sight. Our neighbors are engaging in astonishing plans with the fathers of Trent.</p>
      <p>They say that the Duke of Lorraine has also come to Trent. There is no doubt that arms will be brought against us as soon as the council concludes, unless we prefer to worship its decrees. They will be more vehement and swift if the opposing side wins in France.</p>
      <p>We hear with great sorrow that Rouen has been captured and such a great slaughter of the pious has been committed. Everyone wonders what the English and Germans are doing.</p>
      <p>Hope placed in men is vain. Let us hope in the Lord and seek His help with unwearied prayers.</p>
      <p>Even if He allows His own to be oppressed, He will still be with us in time. I have not received any letters from your kindness for a long time.</p>
      <p>I do not know what you are not writing about the affairs in France. Only dire news is spread among us, especially by the five neighboring cantons, who boast that they continually receive letters about their victories. I always hope for better and long to hear certain news from you.</p>
      <p>Would that you be restored to us, so that you do not double our grief and make it unbearable with your death. Farewell with all the pious, with Jonville, Budé, and the others.</p>
      <p>Where is our Beza? May the Lord protect him and bless him. Zürich, November 22, 1562. Yesterday marked the anniversary of our Martyr's return from France. The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Pray for us.</p>
      <p>I have not re-read this.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
