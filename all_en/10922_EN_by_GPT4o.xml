    <p xml:id="regest1">Fears that Vadian's illness might be the reason for the lack of a response to his letter [No. 877]. Asks him to write to Luther and send him his "Aphorisms," while he himself intends to send this work of Vadian, which appears to him like a commentary on the Wittenberg Concord, to Melanchthon. Vadian should also send the book to [Jakob] Sturm, Bucer, and Thomas Cranmer, and mention both of them to the latter, who responded very kindly to Grynaeus' letter of recommendation for Bullinger. Three distinguished Englishmen have arrived in Zurich, who praise Cranmer highly. Froschauer will forward the letters. Inquiry about news.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We sent you, most humane man, a lengthy letter last week, to which you have not responded. I do not know what the reason is. However, I fear miserably that you are hindered by ill health. If you are still suffering from a stone and pain in the kidneys, may God grant that you recover for the benefit of His church and republic.</p>
      <p>I ask three things from you: First, that you write a friendly letter to Doctor Martin Luther and also include your Aphorisms. I believe this endeavor will not be without its own fruit. I will also write to Melanchthon, who greeted me quite amicably with a letter these days; I will add your Aphorisms to the letter. - I have read your book of Aphorisms again, and behold, I find commentaries on the articles of the Wittenberg Concord. Therefore, I believe your books will soon be auspiciously published. - Second, that you send copies with friendly letters to both Sturm and Bucer. Third, that you write amicably to the Reverend Doctor Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of England, and seek his friendship, sending a copy of the Aphorisms as a token of friendship. You will freely say that you have Grynaeus and Bullinger as friends advising you on this endeavor. And what I advise here, I advise according to Grynaeus' opinion. I cannot express to you how diligently Grynaeus thanked me for making him a familiar and friend. I believe he will be more pleased when he senses from your letter that he has gained a new friend and that we are his advisors.</p>
      <p>These days, three young Englishmen of noble parentage have arrived in Zurich, with minds far more pious and noble. They have come here for no other reason than to learn about religion. They wonderfully praise the piety and humanity of the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you will entrust these letters to Luther, Sturm, Bucer, and Cranmer to this courier Froschauer for delivery. He will ensure that those you write to Saxony are faithfully delivered to Saxony, and those you write to England are delivered to England.</p>
      <p>If you have any certain news about the affairs of the Emperor and the French, please let me know, I beg you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 22, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Doctor Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord.</p>
