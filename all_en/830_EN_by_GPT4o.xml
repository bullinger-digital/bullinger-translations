      <p> Greetings. I did not see Mr. Halesius; I was preaching when he came to my house, then I had to attend to two condemned men, and I regret not having seen such a pious man. What will he do among the English with such a seditious people? A great shipwreck has occurred at sea; more than 300 bodies have been found, which the sea has cast out, and some maritime cities are still finding them. Some think they are Spaniards, some English, which is more likely; therefore, their minds incline towards peace. Without a doubt, there will be peace between the French and the English. Duke Christoph von WÃ¼rttemberg was with us for 5 days and wanted to stay overnight in the inn next to the ruined Augusta; meanwhile, he received letters, I don't know from whom, which he read and immediately left in a hurry. He seeks Hohentwiel; perhaps his father is in his last moments or is planning something new. Some spread the news that Strasbourg received messengers on February 2nd; but I expect more certain information. </p>
      <p> The people of Freiburg sent priests and scholars to complete the mission with more splendid pomp. </p>
      <p> And it is strange, on this day they light all the lights and expel the true light, which is Christ, bringing in darkness. Sulzer was inaugurated as pastor of the Peter's Church on January 19th by Myconius, who, having returned home, soon fell back into his former illness. Wolf is consumed by a silent fire. </p>
      <p> I am also sending you two pages from the booklet on weights, so that you may have a taste until I send the whole. </p>
      <p> I will shortly send the complete story of the baker's servant burned in Vienna, Austria, which someone among us will print. </p>
      <p> We hear that two men in Konstanz have been condemned by public judgment and subjected to cruel punishment; but nothing certain is spread; I wish to know this story from you. </p>
      <p> The booklets you request are not available with us, and it is strange that you have delayed so long in buying such booklets. From the fairs, if you please, I will arrange to have them brought to me. Schertlin is in Baden at the assembly, to whom I will give your letters if he comes. I am also sending you a confession about the Eucharist, which is less intricate, which I certainly would not understand unless I consulted your previous writings. The articles in this matter should be written openly, without the deceit of words, and it would be useful to omit ambiguities of words, so that true concord among the churches may be established. </p>
      <p> Farewell. More soon. February 3, 1550. Greet Mr. Theodor and the others. </p>
      <p> Yours, Gast. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
