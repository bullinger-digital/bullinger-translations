      <p>I have had nothing for a long time, reverend father in Christ, that I deemed greatly worthy of your knowledge; therefore, I also refrained from writing, so as not to trouble you, a prudent and otherwise busy man, with my empty letters. Christian, who was recommended to you by the ministers of Basel, I do not know where he is. We faithfully presented his matter to the synod; he was accepted into the fellowship of brothers on the condition that he be examined. This task was assigned to me along with two others; but he is so lacking in education that I could not be sufficiently amazed.</p>
      <p>What more can I say? He does not even grasp the basic elements; he has so far read some postil of someone, and has not even looked at the epistles of Paul. He does not grasp the matter of justification at all, and in the matter of the sacrament, we found him to be plainly a papist, not because he was unwilling to be taught better, but because he did not know better at present. However, he could not defend what he believed.</p>
      <p>He does not understand the Latin language.</p>
      <p>If he had any education, we would consider promoting him to the people of Davos, who promise a stipend quite ample for the standards of these regions; they are the head in the Third League. They need a prudent man, not a novice, but above all sober and modest.</p>
      <p>Assemblies are also held there in turns. Good men seek us; but we do not have anyone to give them.</p>
      <p>If Glastius has not yet provided for himself (as long as he is of blameless life), I do not doubt that he will be accepted. Please, let me know shortly what has been done about him.</p>
      <p>But to return to Christian, he solemnly assured us that he would devote himself day and night to studies; therefore, we took pity on him and recommended him to the church in KÃ¼blis, which was to receive him if he first preached. He then promised me, upon departing there, that he would return to us to receive letters to you; but where he is staying in the meantime, I do not know; I doubt whether he has been received. I am returning your letters to you.</p>
      <p>The royal envoy, who was sent to us, is said to be an abbot with a limp in one leg. I have not seen the man; he confines himself within the bishop's cloisters.</p>
      <p>I fear his practices not a little.</p>
      <p>It is said that he asked for soldiers from us; but what he obtained, you can hear from the consul. - It is reported to us, though with uncertain rumors, that the Frenchman thought of capturing Strasbourg by treachery with the hope of internal betrayal. If you have any certain information about this and can do so at your leisure, please inform us.</p>
      <p>I still have with me the shirt of Mr. Heinrich's son, which I will send next time when I have found someone to whom I can conveniently give it.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write; therefore, I wish you and all yours safe and sound. Mr. Philipp and Mr. Pontisella send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 25, 1558.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the excellent man in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church in Zurich, his lord and most esteemed patron. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
