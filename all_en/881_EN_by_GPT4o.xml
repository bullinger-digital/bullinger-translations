      <p>Froschauer delivered your letter written on March 14th to me, most honorable Bullinger. Here we are caught between a rock and a hard place; for we have serious adversaries in the priests, and the Interim itself, not accepted, threatens us with indignation and condemnation. But it is better to fall into the hands of men than of God. It is rumored that the Imperial Majesty will summon a diet of all the orders of the empire in Augsburg on July 25th, and that His Majesty will set out from the Netherlands towards the Vindelici by the end of May. There is no news here of any war preparations. Saxony is said to still steadfastly maintain the profession of evangelical truth, and from there rumors have reached Frankfurt that the Brunswickers have so surrounded Duke Henry with arms that he is believed to have little chance of escape. But you will receive these reports from your merchants with the same reliability and authority as we do. From England, we have not yet received any certain news of an established peace; however, from the ongoing actions and negotiations and the cessation of hostile attacks, we hope that peace will be achieved, which God in His mercy may deign to grant.</p>
      <p>The Parliament in England has also been postponed to the twenty-fifth of this month, by whose authority and majesty I believe this peace will be confirmed and sanctioned. The Bishop of London, who was kept in custody for four months, has recently been deposed and stripped of his bishopric due to papism, and in his place, due to his piety and outstanding learning, the former Bishop of Rochester has been appointed. Two other bishops, of Worcester and Chester, have also been summoned to London to explain why they have not complied with the institutions for the reformation of religion issued and published by the most serene king and the entire parliament. The Roman pontiff has a legation at the emperor's court and feigns great goodwill and zeal towards the emperor, offering and pledging his efforts and will for the settlement and stabilization of religion, and submits to the emperor's judgment wherever he wishes to convene a general council, not refusing any place even in the middle of Germany. I fear that these speeches may bring us some deceit and danger; for we would suffer serious prejudices in our causes; such a great consternation and trepidation has now invaded all of Germany that we are not moved by the gravest matters of religion and liberty's dangers and losses, deserving of vile and ignoble servitude; for whatever you suffer lightly, it must be borne deservedly. What has been brought to Frankfurt, you will learn more certainly from your merchants than from me. I entrust all my matters to you; I ask that you kindly and lovingly commend me to Mr. Gwalter, Bibliander, and the other colleagues, and convey my greetings to our Englishman Butler, whom I suppose has now returned to you. Farewell excellently. Strasbourg, April 9th, 1550.</p>
      <p>Thank you for the book sent.</p>
      <p>Ch[ristopher] M[undt].</p>
