      <p>My friendly, willing service is inclined to you with a ready will, gracious Master Heinrich.</p>
      <p>I am sending you here a new song about our current Geneva War; a good fellow made it and sent it to me. Therefore, my friendly, earnest request to you is to arrange for it to be printed, and then to send me several copies of the same. I desire this in every way to be indebted to you, and hereby commend you to God eternally, etc.</p>
      <p>Dated March 6, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your always willing</p>
      <p>Sulpitius Haller, bailiff of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word and the church in greater Zurich, his especially good lord.</p>
