      <p>Most esteemed Lord Bullinger, greetings again and again.</p>
      <p>It has indeed been a very long time since I last wrote to you, and there is no other reason for my prolonged silence than the one I usually give, namely that I have had nothing worthy of writing and furthermore, it seemed inappropriate to trouble you, who are entangled in arduous affairs, with empty pages.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you to take it in good part from me if I seem to have been more silent. Now, however, I wanted to let you know that I am well, along with my entire family, and my affairs are in a sufficiently tranquil state by the grace of God. As for news, it is reported here that the Venetians are being harassed by the Turks in war at Cyprus, and moreover, that nothing but discord has arisen among the leaders of Florence and Ferrara and some other rulers of Italy, especially concerning the city of Lucca. From this, there is a fear that the war may be transferred to Italy. However, I also believe that there are other underlying causes (if it is true that the rulers of Italy are in disagreement) and perhaps even that they themselves are secretly plotting something against the Venetians, as they are exposed to the envy of almost all their neighbors because of their wealth. But however these matters stand, time will tell. Among us, there is a great scarcity of all things necessary for sustenance. May the Lord God help the people suffering from want. I very much wish that you would inform me of how you are doing with all your family, and may you convey to me news that would be most pleasing to hear.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed lord, and always keep me and my son in your commendations. My son also sends you his very best regards.</p>
      <p>Given at Samaden, March 6, 1570.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
