      <p>Greetings. Your letter, most reverend man and dearest brother in the Lord, dated August 27, was very pleasing to me, both because I understood from it that you had received mine sent through the Basel city courier to Mr. Sulcerus along with the response given to the papal legate by our most illustrious duke, and because it was very well received. However, you should not regret having lost it by sharing it with friends; for I sent you another copy from the Danzig fair along with the response of our theologians to a certain writing on the Lord's Supper by the ministers of the Vilnius church, as well as the book of ceremonies of our church, etc. To these, I added two tanned hides, from which you should have boots made, a half-ounce of alcinum, rings, and stones of the same material, etc. I carefully folded and sewed all these things and sealed them with my seal, and handed them over to Hermann, the servant of Wilhelm Langut, a merchant and citizen of Leipzig, so that he would deliver them to Froschauer in Frankfurt along with the attached letters. If, however, due to time constraints, he could not reach that fair, he was to give them to Mr. Ernst Vögelin in Leipzig, who would ensure they were carefully delivered to Zurich. I also wrote to Mr. Ernst to ensure that the letters enclosed with the package were delivered to you. These letters were covered with another sheet of paper, on which I instructed the aforementioned Hermann in writing, as a reminder, to act in the manner described if his journey to Frankfurt was hindered. Whether he fulfilled my request and his promises, I do not know, which is why I have now written to Mr. Ernst to inquire about this matter. He will send these letters to you and, at the same time, if he has not received the package from Hermann, he will inquire whether it was delivered to Froschauer or not, and will narrate the entire matter to you and me in writing, I hope. I am very grateful to you for the works of Lavater on the Proverbs of Solomon. I greatly desire copies of the same work, the published booklet of the rites of the Zurich church, and two or three separate copies of the Bible Index, if they are available. I hear that a booklet of three or four pages on the origin of the contention between your churches and the Saxon ones has been printed in Basel, which has been highly recommended to me. If, with your help, I could obtain some copies of it, I would consider it a great act of friendship; for I believe it would be very fruitful among our people. I am sending you a third copy of the aforementioned response and ask you to inform me whether you also received the second one included with the package along with the letters; if not, I will send other gifts with your first response, although they may be small, yet pleasing.</p>
      <p>There is little news here, among which the assembly of the Kingdom of Poland, currently being held in Piotrków, can be counted. It deals with the restoration of old privileges, which were abolished more by the greed than the negligence of the kingdom's first nobles, as well as the successor to the king, since he has no heir, and matters of religion and similar very serious articles, all of which they demand to be executed immediately. There are those who say that Prince Wisniwetzki of Russia will be present, who, for some unknown reason, had incurred the king's displeasure while serving as his chamberlain, then became a fugitive and fled to the prince of the Muscovites, who appointed him to lead his army against the Tartars. However, having been defeated by them, he gained little favor with the Muscovites, so that he was not safe there either and was able to return to his homeland through the intercession of the nobles with the king. He is said to be about to publicly declare and prove with some evidence the incredible and horrendous betrayals practiced among the king's counselors with the prince of the Muscovites; what they are and what outcome they will have, time will tell.</p>
      <p>The state of Livonia is deteriorating daily, so that it can rightly be compared to a heap of hay, from which the whole world is snatching; for it gains more masters every day, and the Muscovite does not cease, who is now attacking Lithuania, so that the citizens of Vilnius are beginning to prepare for flight, as the constant rumor goes. May the Lord resist him and suspend the well-deserved penalties and have mercy on us, so that we may at some point recognize our sins, repent, and turn to the Lord with all our heart.</p>
      <p>A convention is also being held here with us, which began on November 23, the day our most illustrious prince entered this city in 1512, after having been designated master of the order for 15 months, etc. The most illustrious prince proposed to the orders or estates to consult on how some treasure might be collected, by which hostile assaults might be repelled at some point, and how the common grievances and burdens, which have crept in through the negligence of the magistrates and the greed and malice of the subjects, might be averted, and also that the ministers of the church, whose complaints are increasing daily, might be more honorably supported in the future; for they were poorly provided for in the first reformation. In short, the most illustrious prince desires a common reformation of his entire duchy, so that, if he now suffers to be worn out and oppressed by old age, he may rather make Pauls out of our Sauls from among the adversaries. Farewell in the Lord with your whole family and love me, who loves you dearly.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given in Königsberg on December 12, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your most loving Johannes Jaske.</p>
      <p>To the most reverend man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful antistes of the Zurich church, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother, to his own hands. Zurich at the Great Minster.</p>
