      <p>Greetings. I received and read your letters, but last week I received none from Mr. Friedrich von Salis nor did I see any. I thank you for the diligent reporting of various matters, especially from Italy; in return, I share this with you: Mr. Melanchthon writes in a very friendly letter to me that in Worms he is engaged in a double battle, both against the papists and against the allies; for some of them demand that the Zwinglians be excommunicated, but several of the delegates oppose this. We will hear more soon.</p>
      <p>The troublesome people have quieted down for a time.</p>
      <p>Philip shows himself to be kind to us. - In France or Picardy, some say PÃ©ronne is under siege, others say it has been captured, which I do not believe. The king is preparing a serious expedition to confront the advancing enemies.</p>
      <p>Several ships of the English and Belgians, which contained large sums of money and supplies, are said to have been captured by the French in the British Sea and taken to France; large ships laden with men and goods coming from Spain perished not far from the English port due to shipwreck. A serious war has erupted between the English and the Scots, and the Scots, allies of the French, have been victorious so far.</p>
      <p>Recently, they slaughtered 500 horsemen; daily incursions and skirmishes occur. We owe all this to the most holy; the devil would give them the reward, etc.</p>
      <p>The wise expect nothing from the Worms colloquy; they think it will either not be concluded or, if concluded, will lack a favorable outcome. - I am now receiving very extensive letters from Poland.</p>
      <p>The gospel is being preached in Poland; however, the papists are strongly opposing it. Nevertheless, Christ's church grows daily, while the papist one declines.</p>
      <p>The king, occupied with the Livonian war, has not yet been able to address the cause of religion in public assemblies. He received Mr. Johannes a Lasco very kindly, who, as he writes to me, has conceived the highest hopes of him. I cannot say more now amidst the turmoil of affairs.</p>
      <p>Greet for me the most honorable Mr. Consuls, brothers Philipp and Pontasella, and especially Mr. Friedrich von Salis and Mr. Johannes Travers, with whom you will share this letter along with your enclosed and promptly sent letters. Their son is well and making progress, though he is again troubled by scabies, as is often the case with young men of this sort. Farewell with your household and continue to write to me frequently or very often, and there is no need to make excuses; most of them seem too carefully written, far from appearing to me as lacking diligence. Zurich, the first of October, in great haste, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, his faithful compatriot and dearest brother. To Mr. Hans Schmid, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
