      <p>Greetings. What you have instructed regarding Felix Engelhart, I will take care of with as much faith and diligence as I can, in which matter I will have to labor less, as I hope that all those to whom he has been entrusted for discipline will be more diligent; for there is no one among us who does not consider all those sent here by you to be entrusted to them. For there are many things, besides those common duties which we owe to all by the right of Christian society and for the sake of common ministry, that bind us more closely to you and make us more united with you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, be assured that no duty of ours will be lacking in this regard.</p>
      <p>But if it were to be lacking, my excellent colleague Valerius would easily make up for our negligence with his faith, diligence, and care. He returns to you...</p>
      <p>Cellarius, who will report better on the state of our school and church than I could recount in a long letter. Joshua Pistorius also seems to fear that he too will be recalled shortly, once the year that was set for him is completed. For this reason, he asked me to commend him to you; for he desires that the time be extended for him, if it seems useful to you for his studies, which he hopes to achieve easily only through your efforts. Therefore, consider how much you think should be granted to this most studious and excellent young man in this regard, which to me seems not to be frustrated except for the most just causes. For if his time is extended a little longer, I hope that he will make great progress not only in the knowledge of the three languages but also in ours and will not disappoint your expectations. His talent and character greatly please me; he is diligent in his studies, and in sermons, he has achieved so much with his diligence that I marvel that a young man could achieve so much in a foreign language in such a short time.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us, except that very joyful news is being reported from England.</p>
      <p>The Viceroy, having been tossed by various storms, has finally been brought into a calmer port, for he has been restored to his former rank. The altars have been cast down. We have nothing certain about the Emperor; what he is planning can be easily conjectured. The mind has desired many things; but the supreme monarch, God, will moderate the outcomes of human plans. The Emperor's forces do not terrify me, but only our own crimes, the contempt of evangelical doctrine, the foul trampling of all ecclesiastical discipline, the abuse of God's gifts, the common ingratitude of all, Epicureanism, and atheism occupying the Christian world everywhere.</p>
      <p>These are the weapons of the Emperor that we must fear, which, as you rightly advise, must be repelled from our necks with prayers, peace, and our concord and sincere repentance. This matter should indeed incite us more to the pursuit of restoring the discipline that the Church of Christ requires, rather than overturning what little remains, which was achieved with great labor. In this matter, I hope all good men will contribute all their strength. I am not writing anything yet about your letters, because I hope you will soon receive common letters from us in the name of all, which I believe will not be troublesome to you. All of ours send you their most dutiful greetings. Farewell. Lausanne, June 29, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Peter Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zürich church, brother and fellow minister, and most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
