      <p>Greetings. Since I am very concerned about your well-being amidst those disturbances, brother, and can do nothing but offer prayers and supplications to the Lord for your safety and the health and peace of the entire people, I have given this letter to the courier so that you might have the opportunity to reply and in a word or two (for I know you are otherwise quite burdened with cares and business) inform me how you are, how your affairs and those of your people are, and whether there is hope that the troubled matters can be happily resolved. Otherwise, I have nothing to write to you about at present. I wrote to you 3 days ago, namely on the 14th of March; I sent the letter to our special friend, Mr. Johannes Müller from Graubünden, and I hope it has already been delivered to you. Therefore, I bid you farewell, along with all your people, indeed I pray to the Lord that He may grant you and yours to be well and to be freed from the snares of the plotters.</p>
      <p>Zürich, 17th of March, 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet all our friends and acquaintances in order, whom you know; and all of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
