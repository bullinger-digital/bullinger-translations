    <p xml:id="regest1">For a long time, Bullinger has been waiting in vain for a letter from Rümlang. He can give the reliable messenger [...] a response to Bullinger's previous letter [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Yesterday, Gerhard thom Camph from Emden sent the enclosed letter from East Frisia, addressed to the pastors of Bern. Thom Camph teaches that the sacrament should not be [separately] distributed to the sick; a stance that is openly evident, yet the letter is sealed!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Surely Rümlang knows about Luther's burial in the Wittenberg Castle [Church]. On his [deathbed], Luther said nothing that would contribute to the preservation of pure doctrine, mutual forgiveness, the unity of the church, or the abolition of moral grievances at the University of Wittenberg. However, he called upon Christ, who will surely forgive him his errors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The dissolution of the [Second] Regensburg [Religious] Colloquy occurred due to the unjust regulations of Emperor [Charles V.] towards the [Protestant] colloquists, which prompted [Elector John Frederick of] Saxony to call for departure.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Enclosed is a description from Augsburg of the fratricide committed in Neuburg an der Donau. Rümlang should send it back with the same messenger. The incident was attested in letters by both [former mayor Hans Welser [No. 2409] and the Augsburg city clerk Georg Frölich [No. 2405].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- On the way to Regensburg, [Charles V.] came to Donauwörth, where the Augsburg [former mayors] Welser and [Jakob] Herbrot, who had been sent there, invited him to Augsburg. [Charles V.] promised a visit for the time after the [Regensburg] Diet, provided his affairs allowed it. With flattery and promises, he aims at dissolving the Schmalkaldic League. He met with [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse, [Elector Frederick II of the] Palatinate, and also with Duke [Ulrich of] Württemberg. Now only God can prevent this Spaniard from realizing his intended plans in Germany!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- A boy [Peter Zeller] is said to have written a defamatory song against the "enthusiasts," i.e., against the Zurichers, in the Bernese Barfüßerkloster. This [naturally] also brings the Bernese Disputation [of 1528] into disrepute. The [Bernese] should consider this well, especially since the Zurichers, as their allies, are still ready to defend the agreement of their disputation with God's word. Rümlang should convey this, among others, to the treasurer [Sulpitius] Haller and the banneret Peter Im Haag.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings to the mayors [Hans Franz Nägeli and Hans Jakob Wattenwyl], to [Sulpitius Haller], [Peter] Im Haag, [Johannes] Wäber, and to the other pastors.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my dearest Eberhard. For a long time now, I have been eagerly awaiting your letters, my most delightful friend, but I have received none at all. Therefore, I remind you of your duty. You can respond to my previous letters through this messenger. He is faithful and will faithfully deliver your letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Yesterday, I received these enclosed letters from East Frisia, addressed to your preachers. They were sent by Gerhard thom Camph from Emden, a pious and learned man, and a dear friend of mine. He argues with excellent reasoning that the sacrament should not be brought to the sick, etc. These matters are clear; the letters are sealed.</p>

      <p>You are surely aware that Dr. Luther has passed away and has been buried among the mausoleums of the Saxon princes in the Wittenberg Castle. He died a natural death. He did not speak about preserving the purity of doctrine, forgiving errors, how easy it is to err, peace and safety of the churches, or correcting the very corrupt morals of the University of Wittenberg. However, he invoked the name of Christ and passed away peacefully. He died rather suddenly. His companions did not think he would die yet, nor did he seriously think it was time for him to die; nevertheless, he passed away. The Lord undoubtedly forgave him his errors, sins, and ignorance out of mercy.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The colloquy at Regensburg has dissolved. For the emperor pressed our colloquists or those of our party with unjust prescriptions, and therefore the Saxon ordered them to return to their own.</p>

      <p>The fratricide committed at Neuburg on the Danube, as I received from Augsburg, is here; but you should return it as an example of writing through this messenger. There is no doubt about its truth. For both Mr. Hans Welser, the consul, and Mr. Georg Frölich, the chief scribe of Augsburg, described it in letters sent to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>On April 6, the emperor came to Donauwörth on the Danube, on his way to Regensburg. He was greeted there by the Augsburg consuls, Mr. Welser and Mr. Herbrot, and was invited to Augsburg, to which he promised to come most amicably after the diet, provided his affairs allow it. The emperor is entirely focused on hindering and eventually dissolving the Schmalkaldic League with flattery and promises. For this reason, he called Hesse and the Palatinate to a colloquy and discussed many things with them; about which in due time. He also visited the Duke of Württemberg. The emperor is Spanish, and he will accomplish his affairs in Germany with Spanish methods, unless God graciously averts it.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother, it has come to our attention here that a song against the enthusiasts, indeed against us and ours, is said to have been made by a boy in your Barfüßerkloster, in which we and our doctrine are called heretical, deceitful, and those adhering to our doctrine, the churches, are badly insulted, and therefore your own disputation is said to be mocked, etc. Be aware of this, is my earnest admonition, and handle it with seriousness! We are your dear brothers, friends, benefactors, and confederates, and are still willing to uphold your disputation with God's word. But if we are to be so fiercely scolded in your city and by your people, you can well imagine what displeasure might follow, etc. And we ask that you report all this in my name to my lords, the treasurer Haller and the banneret Im Haag, etc., to see if there is anything to be handled accordingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I could not write more now. Farewell with all the pious and your entire family. May the most distinguished men, the consuls, the treasurer, the banneret Hagius, and the others, especially Weber and the other pious ministers, be well. Zurich, April 27, 1546. All the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his most esteemed Eberhard of Rümlang.</p>
