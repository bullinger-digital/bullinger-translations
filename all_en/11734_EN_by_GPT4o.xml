    <p xml:id="regest1">Together with Richard Hilles, [John Butler] received a letter from J[ohn] Burcher, who reported on Bullinger's efforts for Burcher's plan to acquire wood for the production of bows from the Zurich council - according to Burcher, this type of wood is found in large quantities in the forest of the Zurich lords, from whom Burcher hopes to obtain permission to select suitable trees with Bullinger's support -; [Butler and Hilles] thank and ask for further support for the sincere and pious Burcher, whom they probably do not need to particularly recommend to the very busy Bullinger; thank Bullinger and his colleagues Megander, Pellikan, and Erasmus [Schmid] for their efforts during their stay in Zurich; greetings from [Anna Hilles] to all the women [of those mentioned] and thanks to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] for her letter in German, which she intends to answer soon in the same language. Bullinger certainly wishes for news from Germany as well as from England; in Germany, there is more fear of war than is good for the welfare of the state; Bullinger has surely already heard that large parts of the Duchy of Jülich have been devastated by the imperial troops; in Hungary, a Strasbourg ensign with his soldiers and another, who is said to be from Ulm, have fallen, which allegedly prompted the retreat; England has threatened Scotland with war if Scotland does not submit to the following peace conditions: abolition of the papacy, dissolution of the monasteries, and prohibition of the veneration of saints; [Henry VIII.] himself, however, maintains all this in [England] - apart from the dissolution of the monasteries - with tyrannical severity; a bloody war threatens, on land and at sea, 120,000 bloodthirsty English and Irish soldiers have already gathered. [Richard Hilles] and his wife [Anna] are well; Butler himself has been suffering from quartan fever for 14 months; due to the damp winter in Strasbourg, a change of climate was recommended to him, so he will spend the winter in Basel, but remains at Bullinger's disposal. Greetings, especially to Bibliander.</p>

      <p>Peace and every blessing from God our Father through Jesus Christ our Lord!</p>
      <p>Recently, our brother J. Burcher wrote a joint letter to my brother Richard Hilles and me, in which he conveyed your kindness towards him. He mentioned how diligent you were, dearest Lord Bullinger, with the Zurich magistrate to promote his efforts in acquiring wood for making bows. He asserted that this type of wood is abundantly available in a certain forest owned by the Zurich lords, from whom, with the support of your kindness, he hoped to obtain permission to select trees suitable for his purpose. Therefore, we express and hold eternal thanks to your kindness, most loving Lord Bullinger, for this service and effort towards our compatriot; and we further beseech and implore you through our Lord to continue assisting him as you have begun. He is indeed a good young man in our view, devoted to piety, and most loyal to you in the name of our religion. Hence, there is no doubt that you would otherwise assist him of your own accord, even if we had not written to you on his behalf regarding this matter. We have done this more to stir your zeal, so that amidst the waves of your labors, which we know well enough keep you constantly overwhelmed due to your duties, you would remember him, rather than because we doubted your integrity would not consider him of its own accord, whenever you have leisure from your affairs. Therefore, we will refrain from discussing this matter with you at length. What need is there for many words? Or how can we respond to the kindness of you and your colleagues, recently shown to us when we were in Zurich? We truly do not know, unless it seems we have fulfilled our duty in this, that our will is always ready, and will be (with God's guidance), whatever our ability may be, to return like for like. We therefore ask your gravity to thank your assistants, namely D. Megander, D. Pellikan, D. Erasmus, and all others, on behalf of all of us. Furthermore, my brother's wife sends many greetings to all your wives. She also thanks you for the letter your wife wrote to her so kindly in German; and she says she will reply in German as soon as she conveniently can.</p>
      <p>You may perhaps wish to be informed about the disturbances in Germany and England. As for Germany, it is more than evident to everyone that affairs are disturbed here and there by the excessive fear of war: no one is ignorant of how this affects the public welfare. Nor do we think it escapes your notice that almost the entire Duchy of Jülich has been plundered and devastated by fire and spoils by the imperial troops (miserable to say!). In Hungary, a Strasbourg ensign with his soldiers, and another leader, reportedly from Ulm, perished completely in the assault at Pest, whose death has so disheartened the rest (as the rumor goes) that they have retreated. Furthermore, the English have declared a war of extermination against the Scots (with what spirit, I leave to your judgment), unless they accept these conditions of peace: the expulsion of the pope from their kingdom, the complete demolition of monasteries, and the prohibition of the veneration of saints: yet Proteus himself, apart from the monasteries, retains all these with more than tyrannical severity in his own empire to this day. In short, peace is with the Scots if they accept our conditions: otherwise, a terrible war is at the door, with an army thirsty for blood, both in land and naval warfare, of one hundred and twenty thousand English and Irish.</p>
      <p>If you wish to know about our condition, it is as follows: my brother and his wife are well. As for me, to confess frankly, I am much better than I deserve; however, it is now the fourteenth month that I have been suffering from quartan fever quite severely (if it had seemed otherwise to God), not without great detriment to our affairs. Now, however, it has been advised by some that I change the climate, because the Strasbourg air this winter is very hostile to me due to its humidity: reason also dictates this to me, since the paroxysm affects me more there than anywhere else. For this reason, I have decided to winter in Basel, with God's favor: where, if I can do anything to your advantage, you will always find me most ready, as I hope.</p>
      <p>I beg you, my Lord Bullinger, to greet my godfather and teacher, Lord Theodor Bibliander, most dutifully in my words, and I wish your wife and your whole family well. Farewell, most excellent one. May Christ preserve you with us for as long as possible, to propagate His glory. Basel, November 10, 1542.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, J. BUTLER, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant bishop of the city of Zurich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his friend and most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
