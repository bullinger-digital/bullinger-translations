      <p>Greetings. Here I send, most learned Bullinger, the propositions of Schwenckfeld, which I recently transcribed from his autograph that secretly came into my hands. Finally, the slippery serpent reveals his poisons, which he has cunningly imposed with this single hypocrisy on those who sleep securely and are not very observant, who do not delight in simple truth but in such winding quibbles. In the first article, he openly and explicitly denies either the true humanity in Christ or makes the infinite substance of God subject to mortality and corruption. If he plainly confuses and calls into question the matter of our redemption, which he accomplished on the cross according to true humanity, he denies the article of faith by which we truly believe Christ was born of the Virgin Mary and is confessed in the universal church, and he also denies the end of all the miseries of God's elect, namely the future resurrection of bodies and the transformation of our humble bodies to be made conformable to his glorious body. Alas, how many loads of errors does the front of this writing carry with it! What horrendous things might you not fear to erupt from the more hidden recess? Furthermore, if he makes the infinite substance of God subject to mortality and corruption (for in the third article he affirms that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was crucified according to both natures, which our contrary opinion, which he appended, more fully confirms), he now plainly abolishes God, who according to substance in Christ is infinite, immortal, and incorruptible. For if Christ according to human nature is the natural Son of God and the humanity of Christ took its beginning in time and truly Christ according to that nature is mortal and subject to all the calumnies of nature except sin, made in all things like his brothers as the apostle testifies, God moreover "not acting in the flesh from a distance or speaking as in the prophets retained the humanity joined to him, through which receiving flesh similar to ours he drew all humanity to himself," says Basil, Bishop of Caesarea, now God according to his nature has suffered mortal and corruptible, he is not eternal Alpha and Omega, in whom then, I ask, is our hope safely to be placed? Ah, good God, what evils overwhelm your church anxiously prepared by the blood of Christ! These are the revelations and visions, by which he sells himself as great to the inert people and simple common folk, truly that ever-changing and thrice miserable man with full cheeks. These horrendous monsters are only greatly pleasing to those to whom dangerous novelty is dear and who have not yet tasted a morsel of the juice of Christian religion.</p>
      <p>But indeed by God's judgment, it is necessary for those who are disgusted by simple truth to be ensnared by lies fabricated and colored with the appearance of truth. May the Lord grant us the fervor of his spirit and indeed much boldness in asserting the truth fearlessly. Against such great plagues of the churches, I too will bring forth from the talent entrusted to me.</p>
      <p>I have read most diligently (as I am accustomed to do with all your works) those things which you have published here and there in your commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew and John against this most horrendous error, which are indeed most pleasing to me not only in your name but much more in the name of truth, whose sole nature is to strengthen consciences and render them tranquil. May the Lord grant that you may be able to benefit the church of Christ and us for as long as possible. I am collecting on this matter the opinions of all the fathers, whom I either have in my library or can gather from elsewhere. I diligently peruse their writings according to my limited ability. Hence, I daily see more clearly that most impious hypocrite imposing unheard-of and infinite errors on the already afflicted church; but the Lord will finally make the imposture of the perverse man manifest. You can send these errors of Schwenckfeld to Vadian if you think they have not yet been seen by him.</p>
      <p>About Cochläus, the Sorbonne monster, my Frecht wrote to me a few days ago in these words: "Cochläus has also published something against our Bullinger worthy indeed of Rotzlefflio" etc.</p>
      <p>The Emperor came to hold a diet in Speyer on January 19. Some among us whisper that the evangelical Swiss Confederates also wish to support the Turk-bashing Frenchman as spring approaches. The Pope is entirely focused on creating new cardinals; for he had prepared red hats in France a few years ago. Now he begins to sell them quite openly. Thus, the Antichrist more closely binds his slaves to himself. While I write this, the Emperor is gathering troops here in Memmingen.</p>
      <p>I have tasted the wine sold to our consul Funk from your stock. I give thanks along with my wife for your gift to me, my dearest brother. I am well with my children and my warming wife through the Lord. We wish from the heart that you may be well with your rib and your whole family. My brothers in the ministry greet you, especially Bartholomeus Bertlinus, along with Consul Funk. Write back with the present messenger, my Bullinger, and farewell, and love your Gervasius as you are accustomed to do.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, January 31, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius Scholasticus.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zurich, singular friend and dearest brother, etc.</p>
