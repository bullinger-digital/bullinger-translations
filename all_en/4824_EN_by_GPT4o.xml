      <p>Greetings. It has been a long time since I received any letters from you.</p>
      <p>What has been done here regarding the controversy between Savoy and Bern, you will understand better from the arbitrator than I can explain in writing; in short, everything has been postponed to another time, like the matter of the council. The king was crowned on the 15th of this month and is now at Villecscelerem, a day's journey from Paris. I am sending you a true likeness of the king.</p>
      <p>Many have high hopes for him; may the Lord bless him. If I did not think you had seen the response of the Strasbourg republic to the papal legate's demands, I would have sent it to you. Please convey my greetings to the esteemed council and all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, the last day of May.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
