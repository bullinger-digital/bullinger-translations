      <p>Most illustrious man, singular patron, from the letters of Huser, who, while my father of blessed memory was still among the living, and even after his death lived at our table for a time, I understood that your humanity received great sorrow from the death of my father in Christ. From this, I could judge your singular love for my father, as you grieve the death of him whom you loved while he lived.</p>
      <p>Indeed, this is the most certain proof of your benevolence towards us on account of our father, that we heard you interceded with our most illustrious prince on behalf of our mother and us, so that he would take care of us and be our patron. For this benefit, I give you immense thanks in the name of all of us, praying perpetually to the most good and great God, that what is denied to my abilities to repay, He Himself may fulfill for your kindness.</p>
      <p>However, although, because of my age, singular man, I have for some time refrained from greeting you by letter as a boy and unlearned, yet, since it pleased my mother and I hoped that you would also consider my infancy favorably, which Huser also promised in your name, on account of the old friendship with my father, I obeyed my mother's will, hoping that my letters would be pleasing to your humanity.</p>
      <p>But I did not wish to be burdensome to you, as the haste of the courier also seemed to forbid it. I commend you with your whole family and the Swiss churches to God.</p>
      <p>My mother and all my sisters also send you many greetings, along with your son, Mr. Johann Rudolf Bullinger, and his wife, and they pray with me to God, that He may grant all happiness to you and yours. Given at Marburg, June 18.</p>
      <p>Laurentius Hyperius, wholly devoted to you. To the most illustrious and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the word of God in the Zürich church, his lord and patron, to be honored with utmost faith and gratitude perpetually, etc.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
