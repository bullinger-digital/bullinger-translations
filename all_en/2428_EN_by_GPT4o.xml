      <p> My willing service and friendly greetings with the offering of all honors, love, and goods beforehand, venerable, well-learned, especially gracious, dear lord and good friend, as I have news to report to you, I did not want to fail to inform you, as my special good friend and patron, that my journey home, along with all my people, went happily and well, thanks and praise be to the Lord. As for recent news, one hears nothing at all about the war, except that in recent days a letter from Burgundy was sent to my cousin von Bonstetten, the bailiff of Neuch√¢tel, stating that the Emperor's troops are supposed to have sent 6000 cavalry to the king; but there is no belief in it; for it is now rumored to be otherwise; from Piedmont, my cousin Christoph von Diesbach has come in recent days, bringing no news, except that they have withdrawn on both sides. </p>
      <p> In recent days, the bailiff of Lenzburg was sent to you by the bailiff because of some rumors and talks, which he was informed of from Lucerne, who would again like to cause some disturbance along with their allies. The lord wants to proceed with his grace and keep us (if it is his will) in good peace; for it is to be feared, if it should come to more war, it would lead to an expedition and destruction of a praiseworthy Confederation. Therefore, it is necessary that you and your other allies counteract such evil harm with your wisdom and prudence in time and help extinguish it before it gains the upper hand; for it seems to me that much depends on you and your peers in this case. </p>
      <p> The people of Grandson have appeared before my lords in recent days with their message and also desire to promote the gospel, good hope, the mass will also be abolished. </p>
      <p> Once again, some displeasure and disputes have arisen between some preachers of the newly won land and Calvin of Geneva, for which the people of Geneva have sent their message here; it is bad enough. One needs to be united in this adverse time. I think Mr. Haller will inform you of the matter in detail. </p>
      <p> My wife sends you and your honorable wife very friendly greetings and many good wishes. Greet Mr. Walther, Mr. Frys, and your son-in-law for me and tell him I am still waiting for his decision. Herewith, I commend you faithfully to God the Lord. Dated from Bern, 13th October, in the year... </p>
      <p> Your entirely well-wishing friend and patron, Nikolaus von Diesbach. </p>
      <p> To the pious, venerable, well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, my special good friend and dear lord. </p>
