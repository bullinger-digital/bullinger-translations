      <p>Reverend men, most esteemed lords, and dearest brothers in the Lord. May the Lord Jesus bless you and keep you from all evil!</p>
      <p>The more we favor you, reverend lords and dearest brothers, the more we grieve deeply that you are at odds with some brothers, learned men, in England who have been cast down from their rank. And therefore, you will grant to our sincere affection that we more frequently trouble your ears about the same matter. We have seen and received your excuse in this cause: meanwhile, English exiles come to us, who affirm that the doctors of the London church, as well as those of other churches in England, men whose faith and diligence preserved the Anglican churches in those most savage storms during the Marian persecution, are now being expelled; and not only expelled, but also oppressed by severe persecution, and even thrown into dark prisons.</p>
      <p>They add that there are many ministers of churches in Ireland who do not think or act differently than those who endure persecution in England; but they, by the favor of their bishops and the intervention with the royal majesty, act in utmost tranquility. From this, they conclude that if the bishops in England would also intercede with the royal majesty, they would be able to retain and govern the churches committed to them in peace: and, what is most important in this cause, the bishops do not deny that the afflicted and deposed have a better cause: for they acknowledge that the church is more rightly constituted and governed without those ceremonies, rites, and institutions, than with them; so much so that if they themselves were offered a choice, they would prefer to choose a church for themselves without them, rather than to be given one burdened with them. This is also most manifestly evident from the fact that in the assemblies of the kingdom, the bishops have not once petitioned the royal majesty to remove those, and to make the church purer and more adorned or at least less burdened, etc.</p>
      <p>Since these things are so, reverend lords and dearest brothers, your own piety will undoubtedly incite you to consult on how it may be done conveniently and promptly, that those afflicted brothers may be assisted, and not be oppressed by such severe persecution; but rather that they may be tolerated in the kingdom by the clemency of the royal majesty, and that the useful gifts in them may not be extinguished by abdication. However, there is no need for us to urge you, otherwise most skilled in all piety and equity, with many reasons or examples: we only pray this through the Lord, that if you can either lessen or completely remove the affliction of the afflicted with the royal majesty, you may extend all your faithful efforts to them for Christian charity; and that you may consider this our brotherly admonition kindly and continue to pursue us, who love you most dearly, with your usual love. Farewell, honorable lords.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 26 August 1567.</p>
      <p>Bullinger and Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the bishops of London, Winchester, and Norwich in England.</p>
