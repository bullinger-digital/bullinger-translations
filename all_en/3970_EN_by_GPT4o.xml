      <p>S. D. I am surprised that I have not received any letters from you for several weeks now.</p>
      <p>However, I attribute this to your affairs, or because, lacking a subject, you did not want to disturb my studies with trivial matters. From the Diet of Augsburg, I receive absolutely nothing; from England, through Strasbourg, we have news that religious matters are proceeding successfully in Parliament, that the exiles have been restored, and many other happy things, about which, as I expect more detailed letters, I thought it sufficient to note these things at present. In Basel, Georg David, who died two years ago, was exhumed and burned on the 20th of May.</p>
      <p>He spread horrendous doctrines and hid in Basel; his children, sons-in-law, and relatives were detained in prison for a long time, and although they denied and repeatedly denied having joined in the abominable doctrines, they were released, though not without certain conditions, etc. The Bernese summoned Mr. Hyperius from Marburg to Lausanne for the sake of teaching; however, the messenger returned with the matter unresolved; for the prince did not want to release him, but also decreed a generous stipend for him. He also wants him to reform the school in Marburg, promising many things; otherwise, Hyperius would not have stayed.</p>
      <p>The enthusiasm of the Saxons is astonishing; the Landgrave is indignant at the barbarism, and so is Philipp Melanchthon. Various plans are being considered; what will happen, the Lord knows, and perhaps we will hear if we live. Our affairs, by the grace of God, are quite well.</p>
      <p>May you also be well with all yours. May the Lord bless you.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Philipp, Mr. Tscharner, and Ambrosius, Mr. Pontasella, and our friends.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 25th of May, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet the most distinguished man, the royal legate, in my name most kindly and commend me to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur in Rhaetia, his dearest and most esteemed godfather and brother. Chur.</p>
