      <p>Reverend Fathers and Brothers, although we have never doubted our mutual connection, we cannot but give the highest thanks to God and our Father and also testify to you our greatest joy, that recently He has united us with such close bonds, namely through a common confession in all things, and this all the more because we clearly see that this whole matter has been managed by divine providence rather than by any human counsel. We therefore hope and fully trust that the author of this great matter will grant us this, that the fragrance of our holy agreement will spread far and wide to foreign nations with the greatest benefit. It remains for us to support this great good with mutual services and the most ardent brotherhood in the Lord as much as we can. Indeed, in this matter, we hope to diligently ensure that you have no reason to justly complain about us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, fathers and brothers, most esteemed in the Lord. May the Lord Jesus be pleased to keep you all and to bless your holy labors more and more.</p>
      <p>Geneva, March 26, 1566.</p>
      <p>Theodor Beza, in the name of all the pastors and professors of the Geneva church, most devoted to your piety.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servants of Christ, the most esteemed fathers and lords, the pastors and doctors of the Zurich church. In Zurich.</p>
