      <p>S. D. Your letters were all the more welcome to me, dear Calvin, honorable lord and dearest brother, as I was more tormented by the anxiety arising from the greatest danger to the most holy church of Geneva and to you as well.</p>
      <p>You have refreshed my spirit. Therefore, I give thanks to God, the sole author of all good, and I acknowledge that I owe you much.</p>
      <p>Continue to be faithful in the business of Christ our Lord. This benefit also came from you, that you sent me the disputation I so greatly desired the day before through a certain man from Zürich, along with the blasphemous book of the most impious man Servetus.</p>
      <p>For I am determined to read this entirely and to overcome this distaste. I had read in the example sent by your most distinguished magistrate what you had recorded, but I also read many things then: but I intend to examine each thing more deeply. You will be doing a most useful and almost necessary thing if you publish the summary of the history. However, I beg you not to make any mention of the people of Basel. I know well that there are some curious minds there, and also pestilent ones: but you understand that the fault of a few should not be attributed to all. Basel, as you know, has many pious and learned men, very favorable to piety and to you.</p>
      <p>Nor do I think the perverse are worthy of the honor of being immortalized by you. Meanwhile, you can handle the matter in such a way that they are also censured for their merits. May the Lord grant you the strength to sustain that burden which is placed upon your shoulders. God willing, I will write more to you shortly.</p>
      <p>Our Germany is miserably torn apart by internal wars and pays the penalty for open rebellion against God. Let us pray for the suffering brothers both in Germany and in England, about which I have nothing to write, since Mr. Bernardino is with you.</p>
      <p>I hear that Mr. Peter Martyr has come to Strasbourg. Farewell forever and continue to love me in Christ. Greet your most esteemed colleagues. All of ours greet you. Zürich, November 28, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>When you begin to write about the matters of Servetus, do not forget to demonstrate that blasphemers and all who are like Servetus are rightly subjected to the ultimate punishment.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
