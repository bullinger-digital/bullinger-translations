    <p xml:id="regest1">Has only now received Bucer's letter from Basel dated October 2, but nevertheless includes his own letter from October 6 [No. 1053] unchanged and justifies once again the behavior of Benedikt Euander, who neither stole Bucer's letter to Luther nor sent it to opponents; Bullinger also only made it accessible to colleagues who were affected by it. Writes in the enclosed letter what displeased him about it, and assures that he does not want to be ungrateful. Does not want to comment again on Bucer's "Retractations" and his ["Report from the Holy Scripture"] as well as on the publication of the letters of Zwingli and Oecolampadius and welcomes his call for restrained judgment and brotherly interaction with one another. No longer complains about the Württemberg churches and about Schnepf after the abolition of images by [Duke Ulrich]. Requests a recommendation to Luther.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I had written the rather lengthy letter you see here before I received yours from Basel. Since yours was written on October 2, it was only delivered on the 14th of the same month. However, seeing what you wrote about Benedikt Euander, I did not want to change anything in my letter written on October 6. I hear that he denies and strongly denies that he secretly took your letters from anyone. Certainly, dear brother in the Lord, you seem to me to exaggerate the cause of a man who is not evil. Even if he did take them by stealth, should he be subject to a capital sentence? After all, he did not send them to enemies, but to friends of both you and himself, nor did he send them with a malicious intent to harm you. Therefore, we ask you again to let go of your conceived anger. Now, while we cannot deny that we did not even mention to you the letters written to Doctor Luther, we must not deny that I sent yours to other brothers as well. For it seemed that this matter concerned all the ministers of the word who were in Basel. However, I acted with neither a gladiatorial nor a treacherous spirit. God is my witness. I sought peace, not turmoil, no matter how others interpret my action. But I have given some thoughts on these matters elsewhere.</p>
      <p>As for what I desire in your letters written to Doctor Luther, in which you think there is nothing that has not already been discussed and acted upon between us, I have briefly explained in other letters of mine. Meanwhile, I do not wish to be ungrateful. As far as my part is concerned and what I can promise from myself, you will find me not an ungrateful man, whenever I have the opportunity to do well by you and your labors and your favor towards me.</p>
      <p>Regarding your "Retractations," which I suggested some things about in Basel, I will now say nothing. And concerning your book "Ad Monasterienses" and my letter to you about it, and again about the published letters of Zwingli and Oecolampadius, all of which you briefly mentioned in your letter, I have also responded in a few words in previous letters. As for your final exhortation, that we strive to perform acts of charity towards one another until the Lord grants that we all think, judge, and speak the same in all things, if perhaps we do not fully understand some things at present, you indeed advise rightly, and in this matter, you can expect from us what you would from people who cultivate the love of God. Therefore, neither the present matters nor others that we write to you should be understood as if we wish to provoke you or to start a new thread of discord, but so that, with all animosity expelled, we may act freely as brothers should with a brother.</p>
      <p>There is no longer anything to complain about regarding the Württemberg churches and Schnepf. I hear that through the piety of the prince, all idols have been removed from the temples of God and the saints. Meanwhile, you cannot be unaware of what happened on September 16 in Urach.</p>
      <p>Do, I beseech you, what you promise to do: Commend to Doctor Luther and his people our faith and diligence in the kingdom of Christ. For with God's help, we will conduct ourselves in such a way that you will never regret your recommendation.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>October 15, 1537.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
