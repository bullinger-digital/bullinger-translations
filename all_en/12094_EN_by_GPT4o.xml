    <p xml:id="regest1">Musculus thanks for Bullinger's letter; he would have replied earlier if he had not been occupied with his refutation of Cochläus’ writing [„Sacerdotii ac sacrificii novae legis defensio“]; he encloses the result [„Anticochlaeus primus“] with a request for a candid judgment; such is to be expected in a friendship, so Bullinger need not have apologized for the criticism expressed regarding Musculus’ doctrine of the Lord's Supper. Before entering into friendship with Bullinger, Musculus already knew that they were not entirely of the same opinion; however, everyone may express what they think; the [Church] Fathers did this as well; accordingly, Musculus expressed his views on the Lord's Supper in his commentary on Matthew according to his faith and not his friendships, even when he wrote there that the [Zurichers] did not follow the intention of Christ in this matter, as their opinion was insufficient, though not wrong; for his part, Bullinger does not agree with Musculus on this question and furthermore considers his view to be in agreement with that of the Church Fathers; yet Musculus knows their writings like hardly anyone else and knows that they, as in other matters, are not of a unified opinion; Musculus would like Bullinger to think the same as he does about the word „exhibitio“; this corresponds to the intention of Christ, who with the signs of bread and wine not only indicates something but also offers something; this is also evident from the quote from Chrysostom cited by Musculus, even if the latter does not use the word „exhibitio“ but „tradere“. The use of the word „exhibitio“ could silence those who expect nothing good from [the Zurichers]; however, Musculus does not want to prescribe anything to anyone; he only wants to preserve the friendship of those who trust in the Lord in true faith; neither for Luther nor [the Zurichers] will he despise anyone who is of a different opinion; he wants to serve Christ and His truth alone and regard anyone who shows something of Christ in themselves as a brother; Bullinger will be able to observe for himself how Musculus [accordingly] responded to Cochläus regarding the agreement with Luther [of 1536]. Musculus regrets Luther's [„Kurtz bekentnis“], which does not serve the edification of the Church; but greater than Luther and Zwingli is Christ, who may bring an end to this quarrel; may the [Zurichers] remain modest in their response, so that harmony remains possible later; Philipp [Melanchthon] also thinks that stubborn silence would be the best response to these insults. He asks Bullinger to kindly accept this letter, written in great haste and agitation; the snail [Cochläus], with whose slime both have to deal, has agitated Musculus’ mind; furthermore, he would like to receive Mussenilen [Cochläus]; he does not intend to write more than a second „Anticochlaeus“. Greetings, especially to Gwalther.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received the letter you sent me on October 10th, dearest Bullinger, on November 5th. I would have responded immediately, if the insolence of Cochläus had not detained me, as I was diverted elsewhere at that time, and I was compelled to respond to him, though not without annoyance. I am sending you what I replied to him, on the condition that if anything offends, you will candidly let me know. You know these are the laws of friendship, that we freely correct the errors of our friends; if you do this, it will be most gratifying in the name of friendship, even if it is not an error, but seems to be.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it was not necessary to ask so much that I take kindly what you wrote about my opinion on the matter of the Lord's Supper. Believe me, my Bullinger, if you did not do this, I would not recognize you as a friend.</p>
      <p>For although I already knew before that we do not agree in every way in the formulas of speaking and explaining in this matter, I have most eagerly entered into friendship with you in Christ, which I will still strive to maintain most steadfastly and unblemished through His grace. I do not oppose you speaking and writing as you feel. For with the same freedom that the holy fathers used in the church, I also wish to use in handling the holy scriptures. Why should I not permit others the same freedom? Therefore, what I wrote in Matthew, I wrote for my faith, not for friendship, which I owe to all brothers in Christ. Your exposition - although it is not to be rejected in every way, as I also remember in that place you bring up (for there it is expressly stated, although it is not alien to the truth) - in my judgment, does not reach the aim of Christ's words; it does not reach, I say - I do not say it opposes or contradicts - that is, it does not sufficiently follow, it does not express clearly enough, as I noted in those commentaries. You say something, but less than is fitting and the spirit of Christ's words demands. But you cannot prove our opinion and depart from your exposition, which you say is that of all the fathers, who thought so up to the times of the antichrist. I know, my Bullinger, what almost all the fathers wrote. For if there is anyone whom this controversy has tormented and compelled to turn to the writings of each one, I think I have been such a one, of which I can give clear evidence. As in other matters, so also in this cause, they speak variously. Regarding the word "exhibitio," which you avoid as new, I wish you would feel what we are compelled to feel by the authority of truth itself, not of any man. It has nothing crude, corporeal, or carnal in it, but is used for this one purpose, to express the aim of Christ's words, who by no means only wanted to indicate to the disciples what the bread He gave signified, but also to explain what He gave them with these symbols, bread and wine, namely Himself, His body and blood. And similar things that I added sufficiently show that this exposition does not savor of papism, which Chrysostom also clearly set forth, although he did not use the word "exhibitio," but "tradendi" (to hand over).</p>
      <p>I think it could be possible that if you accepted this exposition, an end to the contention would finally be made, which in your opinion is most difficult to hope for. But whatever it may be, as far as I am concerned, I do not demand from anyone to speak otherwise than as they feel, nor will I, aided by the grace of the Lord, say or write anything against what I feel for the sake of anyone's favor. Meanwhile, with those who confess our Lord Jesus Christ with pure faith, I will maintain Christian friendship as far as I can. Nor will I adhere to Luther in such a way that I will immediately despise those whom he condemns. Nor will I be your friend in such a way that I will reject what is approved in Luther or anyone else because of this friendship of ours. In the cause of the faith of Christ alone and His truth, I want to be; in Christian brotherly love, I desire to be most familiar with all who breathe something of Christ. How I responded to Cochläus about the agreement with Luther, you can read in Biij. Nor do I think he will have what he cunningly sought. As for Luther's booklet, what can I say? May the Lord grant His ministers the spirit of sobriety and modesty and grant that they serve more for the edification of the churches than for private passions. Great is Luther, great is Zwingli, but the Church of Christ is greater than either. May the Lord break this cord of contention with the spirit of His peace. It is said that Luther, in his manner, mixes heaven and earth. I beseech you, in responding, maintain Christian modesty and do not make what is already too exacerbated more exacerbated with sharper and unnecessary words. Keep the doors of concord open for future times. It is not true everywhere that: "He who is not today, will be less apt tomorrow." I hope that sometime those who now contend more ineptly and impotently will approach concord more aptly than they appear now. I would approve of Philipp's opinion, who thinks that these offenses cannot be better met than with stubborn silence. But perhaps there are those who think otherwise, both with you and elsewhere. But a mind somewhat freer from the disturbance of affections easily sees what conduces to fostering peace and removing the offenses of dissensions.</p>
      <p>But forgive me, my Bullinger, for responding to your most learned and friendly letters with this hurried writing. That snail, with whose impure slime we both fight, has somewhat disturbed the tranquility and state of mind. I wish to see what you have replied to the Replica of the inept old man. I have decided, after the second Anticochlaeus, to respond to him no more. The boastful little man seeks with zeal those with whom he can quarrel.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest of brothers and friends. Greet the brothers, especially Gwalther.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, December 9, 1544.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, his lord and brother, most dear by far.</p>
