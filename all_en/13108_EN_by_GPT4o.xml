    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer thanks for the two charming letters [from the 24th (not received) and the 25th of October (No. 3053)].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The authorities of Konstanz are well aware of the dangers [of a reconciliation with Emperor Charles V.] pointed out by Bullinger. They would prefer to have nothing to do with it. However, given the dangerous situation, they have no choice but to seek honest and Christian means without violating their conscience and God's honor or giving up their trust in God. They are very touched by the concern of the people of Zurich. May God preserve peace for them and protect them from similar danger!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Blarer's cousin Konrad Zwick will write to the people of Zurich and respond to their friendly offer to facilitate a letter [from the Confederates] to the Emperor in favor of Konstanz. The cousin has considered everything well and believes that they should wait until the Bishop of Konstanz [Johann von Weeze] also becomes insistent. Hopefully, the other Confederates will then agree to draft such a letter!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Likewise, Blarer would like to thank Bullinger for his touching offer [to provide refuge to him and his family in case of emergency] and will gladly take it up if necessary, especially since one never knows what might happen. However, he is determined to endure in Konstanz until death, unless the Emperor orders his extradition or that of his relatives and the city authorities ask him to leave the city. May God turn everything for the best!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Georg Frölich is in Konstanz on behalf of Augsburg to negotiate with Sebastian Schertlin. He sends his regards. He has only reported from Augsburg that King Ferdinand has now also arrived there and that a decision will soon be made on where and how the council is to be held. There will be bloody persecutions of those who do not submit to it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Blarer wants to quickly copy a document for [the people of Zurich], which, according to a unanimous decision (thank God!) of the Great and Small Council yesterday, is to be sent with Hans Jakob von Landau. It was decided not to commit or set conditions in the reconciliation request, especially since it is clear that they would not engage in anything that violates God's honor. However, if the people of Konstanz are confronted with such demands, they have no intention of agreeing to them and will know how to justify their stance accordingly. Bullinger should fervently pray for the people of Konstanz!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Blarer did not give his cousin Bullinger's letter [No. 3053] to read, as he might have concluded that Bullinger's warning about possible secret supporters of the Emperor in Konstanz was directed at him. But such a suspicion would be completely inappropriate! The cousin is indeed ready to die for the freedom of his homeland!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] He would have preferred to instruct Blarer to respond [to the aforementioned offer from the people of Zurich], especially since they have already misunderstood some of his previous letters. However, Blarer was able to persuade him to write himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The cousin was particularly pleased that Bullinger offers shelter not only to Blarer but also to his relatives. He has been thinking for a long time about what he should do if he (who would be in more danger than anyone else in an emergency) were to fail and could no longer stay in Konstanz; and he has long hoped that he would then be allowed to retreat to Zurich or Bern!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Blarer was able to gather from his conversation with Frölich yesterday that he knows something about the war machine invented by Zwick and would like to discuss it with him. However, Blarer first wants to investigate Frölich's motives and intentions. This war machine should only benefit Konstanz or the Confederates. This is also Zwick's view.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The [aforementioned] letter [that Hans Jakob von Landau is to take] was unexpectedly requested back by Blarer, so he could no longer copy it. The cousin thinks that Blarer need not be worried about this, as he plans to summarize the content of this letter in his letter [to the people of Zurich] anyway.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Just now a letter arrives from Augsburg. It contains nothing new, except that King Ferdinand has arrived and that the Emperor has forbidden a preacher [Johannes Weiß] of Duke Moritz of Saxony to preach due to his exuberant, candid speeches. Everything will get even worse!</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Grace and peace with all good things through Christ from God to you, my dear, especially trusted, most faithful brother. I have received your two letters with special thanks, as they are full of faithfulness and love. May the Lord be your eternal reward.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As far as your faithful, Christian warning is concerned, my lords can well recognize all of this; and if they could be above the matter, it would be most pleasing to them. But how else can or should one act? The necessity and danger drive and compel us to seek honest and Christian means, and whatever is possible should be undertaken without violating the honor of God and conscience, and thereafter let the faithful God rule and entrust the matter to Him. Your lords' faithful compassion is received by us with all gratitude. May the faithful God keep you in peace and all good things eternally and never let you fall into similar danger!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding the other matter you write about, whether one should write to the Emperor on our behalf, you will receive advice from my dear cousin, who still thinks it is too early; he would prefer that it be postponed until the bishop also becomes insistent. And I truly think it is well considered by him. Otherwise, we are truly heartily and exceedingly glad, more than well, that we learn from your letter that some good lords of yours have such faithful thoughts on our behalf and are inclined to be helpful to us, as we hope they should have the support of the others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>So I thank you most highly and faithfully as possible for your entirely Christian offer and brotherly provision of refuge, which I should rightly recognize as a great good deed (I also intend to do so with you, for no one knows how things might still turn out), although I am determined to leave my life and living with mine with the help of God's grace, as is right, unless I or mine are particularly targeted and sought, and thus asked by our own to leave. May the faithful Father in heaven arrange everything in such a way that we may have protection and shelter under the shadow of His wings for a longer time and use the same to His praise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The good, pious Letus is here. He is to negotiate with Schärtle on behalf of those from Augsburg. He entrusts me to write to you many, many services, also all love and good on his behalf. He says nothing new from Augsburg, except that the king has also arrived and that a decision will soon be made regarding the council, where and how it is to be held. Oh God, then fear, distress, persecution, and bloodshed will first be instigated against all those who do not want to show themselves obedient in this matter! God have mercy on His church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I want to quickly copy for you the document, which was unanimously approved yesterday by the small and large councils to be sent to Landau. It is, thank God, entirely unanimous. And it is considered best not to articulate or negotiate anything in the reconciliation, for what is against God and honor negotiates itself out, and if it should be demanded of us afterward, we are now once again of the will not to agree to it in any way, and we have better justification against everyone. God grant grace! Praying heartily and with all faithfulness for us, that we may not stumble, but always be led and guided on the right path by His Holy Spirit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I did not let my dear cousin Conraten Zwick read your letter, as I feared he might suspect you meant him with what you wrote, that there might be some among us who might be more imperial, etc.; but such a suspicion would be completely unjust, for he could, I know well, die to save the liberty of the homeland and its welfare!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>He would have instructed me to write to you what he writes, as he is somewhat burdened with writing, especially since some of his previous letters have not been understood as he meant them. But I have moved him to write himself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>He is particularly pleased that you offer not only me but also my relatives refuge, for he has long considered these future events and how he wants to arrange his affairs in case things do not turn out here as they should. I have always known that his heart and mind were with you and Bern, and he desires to move there when his position would no longer allow him to remain here, as he truly has more danger to withstand than anyone else here, should it come to a rough, hard way out.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I have noticed from Letus yesterday, among other words, that he also carries some knowledge and intention about the cousin's matter and war machine and wants to talk to him about it. I do not know for what reason or where he comes with it. I want to ask more about it later. I sincerely desire that this matter benefits no one but the fatherland or a Confederation or some of the same in case of need. I also know that he would not wish it otherwise for anyone else.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The document I wanted to copy for you was unexpectedly requested back from me, and I was too short. The cousin, however, has been with me in the meantime and said I should not let it worry me: He wants to write you a summary of it himself. Given in haste, on the 28th of October 1547.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Now I have a letter from Augsburg, but nothing new, except that the king has also arrived and the emperor has forbidden Duke Moritz's preacher to preach due to his excessive candor. But worse things will follow.</p>
