      <p>Greetings. I have received your letters and I believe you have also received mine in the meantime.</p>
      <p>I did not send the Neuchâtel diary or itinerary; I saw the French version, which was quite lengthy and contained almost nothing of importance. In the meantime, I have sent the letters I received from Neuchâtel and Geneva. Now I have nothing, except that everything resounds with news of peace being made. But I affirm nothing for certain yet; for I have not yet heard under what conditions it was concluded. The consul of Fribourg, Praroman, has returned from the camp, and I hear he will be here today; perhaps he will bring some certain news. Whatever I learn, I will write to you. You will learn about my health and that of our people from my brother's letters. I cannot write more now because I am being called away to public affairs by the messenger who is in a hurry.</p>
      <p>Therefore, farewell; may the Lord keep you safe for a very long time! Greet all your people in my name; ours also send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 2, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
