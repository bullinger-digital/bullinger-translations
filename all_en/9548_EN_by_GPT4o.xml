      <p>Greetings. I, in turn, also wish you the most fortunate things and hope that this year, along with many others, will be prosperous for you. As for me, I am received more kindly by this winter than the previous one, and I seem to be in good health, as long as I can perform my duties in any manner. May the Lord strengthen me in this!</p>
      <p>If He sees anything else concerning me, behold, all my things are in His hand; may He use them as a father for His glory and my salvation. I know we have nothing here.</p>
      <p>It was reported that Middelburg was captured by the forces of the Prince of Orange; now we hear differently. A meeting is being held in Gex, which is the main town among those returned to the Duke of Savoy by our people.</p>
      <p>There, they are discussing making peace with the Genevans of the Allobroges; many suspect deceit. For they say that Alba is coming to Dole in Burgundy. What this portends, people interpret differently. To this meeting, both consuls and both treasurers have been sent; perhaps they will bring back some news. From France, a certain nobleman recently came to Andelot and the Colignys, but he reports nothing special, except that Mombrun is still in arms and that nobles everywhere are again holding their assemblies; that a levy has also been held and leaders, captains, and standard-bearers have been designated for the Huguenots, so that if any greater force is directed against them, they can again take up arms. The king wants to hold such a meeting of the orders and estates of the kingdom, with four thousand equipped horsemen with him. No one wants to come to such a meeting; now this place, now that place is designated; but everything is full of treachery and deceit.</p>
      <p>Steiger is not sending you any wine this year because the wine yield in those places was small; moreover, what grew is so harsh that he is ashamed to honor anyone with it, especially since he knows you have an abundance of old and good wine. Therefore, he asked me before his departure to excuse him to you.</p>
      <p>However, he will send you some selected cheeses from those considered the noblest among us.</p>
      <p>Diesbach is acting as consul and sends you warm greetings, as do Hagenbuch, Zehender, Frisching, Witenbach, my father-in-law, and all our family. Greet all yours in my name. In Bern on my birthday, namely January 18, on which I complete the fifty-first year of my life and enter the fifty-second.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, a certain friend of mine from the Margraviate sent me a copy of your letters, which you wrote to me almost two years ago; but to whom you entrusted them, I do not know. I do not know where or by whom they were opened; however, I suspect it was done in that Swiss academy, from where the copied version reached him. I send this to you, not to wound your spirit, but to show you what kind of friends we have and what the faith of many is, and how necessary it is for us to be cautious in the letters we send to each other here and there.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
