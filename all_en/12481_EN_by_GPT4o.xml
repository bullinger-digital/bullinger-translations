    <p xml:id="regest1">Comander keeps it brief, as the meritorious messenger [Johannes Blasius] can tell everything himself. However, he asked for a recommendation for himself and his son [Paulus], even though it is quite strange that an unknown person like Comander recommends a more well-known person.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Blasius] brings his only son, who is talented and of integrity, to study in Zurich and asks Bullinger to find accommodation for him with a pious and learned man. Bullinger's mediation is not desired to reduce costs, but because it is important that [Paulus] finds a place in a boarding house that is conducive to his studies and does not lead him into bad company.</p>

      <p>Having found such a suitable messenger, I decided to address you with very few words, as it seemed unnecessary, since he himself could better recount everything in person. However, he asks that I provide letters of recommendation for himself and the boy. What? Can an unknown person recommend someone more well-known? But if I can be of any help to the boy with my letters, I will gladly do so. He is bringing his only dear son to you for the sake of study, wishing to place him, with your help, with some pious and learned man for an annual fee, not because he wishes to spare the expense, but so that, as far as study and integrity of character are concerned, he is well provided for. The boy is of good character, upright, calm, and studious, truly deserving of careful provision, so that he may continue in his begun education and not be corrupted by the influence of depraved people.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most courteous man. From the court of Rhaetia, on the fifth day before the Kalends of May, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and primary friend.</p>
