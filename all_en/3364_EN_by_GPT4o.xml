      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ our Savior.</p>
      <p>Although we received your letter, most candid and learned Bullinger, later than you thought, we nonetheless received it along with the literary gift, which was especially pleasing because we had long awaited it with great desire, so that it might be shared with the Church of Christ, hoping that it will be published with great benefit. You wish me to decide whether to reserve it for myself or for our library.</p>
      <p>In this, I truly feel how much you love me, and I wish that a just and convenient opportunity would present itself even once to declare my goodwill towards you; you would certainly understand that I am not among the last of those who uniquely respect you. But may the Lord repay you, for what I cannot provide, on that day.</p>
      <p>The Apocalypse will be placed among the primary and classical authors in our library, and because the book will be common to all of us, I have been ordered in the name of all my fellow students to thank you as accurately as possible, offering their own respect towards you. I will reserve that Christian Adam for myself and thank you separately in that regard.</p>
      <p>The news that is spread among us is uncertain and for this reason not easily disseminated. A nobleman from Hegau, not the least among them, reported to one of our citizens that Ferdinand had recaptured Buda by force and was threatening Pest with 4000 black cuirassiers, through whom he also routed several thousand Turks, destroying 7000 and capturing Guasco along with many nobles. Bolwiler, having overturned two small towns in Lorraine, is about to besiege Dijon.</p>
      <p>With a jest, he also asked when our people would finally return from Naples; from there he perhaps gathered that all... were cut off by Dion.</p>
      <p>See the misery.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen is still about to send a banner after those four previous ones to France, so that the French understand that we are risking ourselves in their name not only for the soldier but also for the homeland itself. See the madness.</p>
      <p>They do not accept our admonitions, whether private or public, indeed, unless they understood that the matter of all of us hangs on the edge of a razor, they would have already tried to shut our mouths by the example of the people of Basel. You understand how much the hunger for French gold can do among us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I commend both us and the churches entrusted to us to your prayers, so that our Lord may have mercy on us and restore us to the right path. Concerning the WÃ¼rttembergian, etc., I hear such absurd things that I am reluctant to write them.</p>
      <p>I am sending you herewith my handwritten letter to Jergen Bachofen regarding Hans Adam Schad; wishing to deliver it to him so that he may be satisfied. Farewell, most humane Bullinger, and love me as you are accustomed.</p>
      <p>I would have written sooner; however, due to business, I could not. Schaffhausen, in the year 1557, October 14.</p>
      <p>I gave both the letters and the money to Ludwig today, which you gave to him. He thanks you and is preparing to return to Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Ludwig Kolmar lent my Hans Rodolff in Strasbourg 2 florins; I sent and paid them to him.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, lord and brother in Christ to be respected. In Zurich.</p>
