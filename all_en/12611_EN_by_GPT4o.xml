    <p xml:id="regest1">To Haller's question [in letter no. 2548], about who from the city of Zurich [went to war], Bullinger can only say that there are more than 150 men, among whom he particularly recommends Wolfgang Lavater, the son of the mayor [Hans Rudolf], to Haller and Georg Frölich. If necessary, a few more thousand men [from Zurich] could be mustered. However, since many are currently returning, the others remain at home.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- If the Dutch army under [Maximilian von Egmont, Count of] Buren, and [Martin von] Rossem crosses the Rhine, it will have dire consequences for Hesse!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger has already written to Frölich [not received] through [Hans] Vogler [the Elder] and now again [not received] about the Confederates. The [Protestant city cantons] can do nothing about the reluctance of the Five Places, just as the German Protestants can do nothing about that of the Nurembergers. What more should they do? Had they enlisted with [King Francis I of] France, they would have demanded much more money for the mercenary service! In fact, the [Protestant Confederates] have done more than most other cities of the [Schmalkaldic League]. Even 1000 [Confederate] mercenaries have returned because they were not accepted! The people of Zurich cannot give money. Had they and the Bernese really done nothing, the [Schmalkaldic] would have noticed the difference!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- A discussion about the correct order of communion [in Augsburg] is not appropriate in the current [war] turmoil. However, it would be good if the authorities ensured that the churchgoer is not forced to unlearn what he was taught in a year! Haller should take care of this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger thanks for sending the "Declaration of Protest," with which the [Schmalkaldic] renounced peace with Emperor [Charles V.]. He would also like to see the emperor's ban letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Regarding Haller's second letter from the 28th [correct: 26th] of August [No. 2551]: Bullinger is not at all pleased about the crossing of the Rhine by the southern Dutch army. God obviously does not want to fulfill all the wishes of His own, and this is probably for their good. However, they have every reason to be ashamed. If they had been vigilant, such a thing could not have happened!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- If what is stated in the published booklet about the disaster in Mechelen is true, the emperor and his Brabant have every reason to fear these omens!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- If the [imperial] and the [Schmalkaldic] armies are indeed so close to each other near Ingolstadt, there must have already been a skirmish, hopefully in favor of the [Schmalkaldic]. Haller should report in detail!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- On the coming Sunday, September 8 [correct: September 19], a new Diet will take place, undoubtedly with new results. The [city cantons] met on August 30 in Aarau to discuss the agenda for the upcoming day in Baden.</p>

      <p>S. D. You ask who has left the city of Zurich! More than 150! But how could I list them all by name for you? The son of the mayor, Wolfgang Lavater, has also left, whom I particularly commend to you and Mr. Laetus, at least for his father's sake. Many other good men have left, and if they understood it was necessary, a few thousand more would come. Many have returned these days; this is the reason why the rest remain at home.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>If the Dutch army under the leaders Buren and Rossem crosses the Rhine into Gelderland, it will have dire consequences for Hesse.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have written to Mr. Laetus about the Swiss, indeed some time ago through Vogler and now again. I do not know what more could be done if what is being done is not enough. The French would have given us one or two tons of gold if we acted against them as we do against the empire. I say nothing of the Five Places, but of us. What can we do about their reluctance? What can you do about Nuremberg's reluctance? We have done more in our alliance than any single city in the empire, with few exceptions. A thousand men have returned home because they were not accepted. That we could give money at this time is not possible for us. If the people of Zurich and Bern did not do their duty as good men, you would soon see whether we help in any way or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In these turmoils, a debate about the form of communion does not seem appropriate. However, I wish the leaders would ensure that what the simple people have learned is not unlearned after a year. Whatever you can do here, accomplish it with good advice.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I have received the letters from your people, in which they renounce peace with the emperor, and I thank you. However, I would also like to see the emperor's hostile letters, the real letter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Now to the other letters, written on August 28. I did not gladly read what you wrote about the Dutch army crossing the Rhine. But God may not grant us all favorable things, and this is for our good. There is certainly a great reason for our shame at our negligence, for they allowed the crossing, which they could have easily prevented if they had only been vigilant.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>A booklet has been published about the unfortunate event in the city of Mechelen, which, if it reports the truth, gives the emperor and his Brabant every reason to fear these omens. May God turn this to our good!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I have understood what happened at Ingolstadt; and if the armies, both ours and the enemy's, are so close, I believe there has already been a battle, either successfully or unsuccessfully - which God forbid. Therefore, I eagerly await what you will say, what you will write; and I require diligence and faithfulness from you here!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>On the following Sunday, September 8, a new Diet will be held. From this, new things will undoubtedly arise, etc. A Diet was held on August 30 in Aarau by our people, in which it was discussed what to propose in the future at Baden, etc. Our people are consistently steadfast and well-disposed towards the common good cause.</p>

      <p>Now no more. Farewell with your wife and children.</p>
