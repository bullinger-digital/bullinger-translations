    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller does not write much this time, as he recently [with No. 2894] reported in detail about the lamentable defeat of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and the threatening situation of the [Protestants].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] With increasing danger, the church is shrinking. This trial by fire shows what each person's work is worth! The prophet [David] rightly said that salvation should not be expected from humans. How much envy, hatred, and cunning there is among them! Haller has never seen anything like it! He can no longer rely on anyone! Men who appeared like invincible, iron walls have melted away like wax in the heat of tribulation. Yet Christ foretold this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Haller is less appalled by the insolence of the enemies than by the fickleness of the Augsburg authorities. Now they lean towards the teachings of the Anabaptists and claim that the Gospel should not be defended with the sword! Certainly, God is its sole defender, but he uses not only his spirit but also the sword. Why else would he have granted the authorities the power of the sword, if not for the protection of good and justice? However, the councilors are not capable of admitting the true cause of the whole misery, namely misdeeds and lack of repentance. Haller bluntly told them: "You do not want to defend the truth with the sword entrusted to you by God; you think that would be fatal. But you believe that through flattery and yielding behavior in matters that displease God, you can preserve the Gospel, and this without pangs of conscience! But in this way, you will lose God's kingdom!" However, they do not take this into account at all. Even among the pastors, there are not a few who approve of everything, even ready to put on the church vestments again! What is to be done?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Regarding the other dangers (including those posed by Colonel Bernhard von Schaumburg), Haller does not want to dwell here. Whenever he makes clear to the authorities what should be done in view of the dire developments, he receives the response that the wicked people should be endured and overcome with patience and gentleness. They also do not want the opponents of the Gospel to be taught better! When the preachers cautiously criticize the papist abuses, they are accused of inciting rebellion! But if they remain silent (as many among them do), they are rightly called "mute dogs" by the people. Therefore, it is clear that this government must perish. Meanwhile, the devil reigns with usury, blasphemies, drinking bouts, etc. Everything is allowed to everyone! That hurts the most. Haller takes everything else less seriously, especially since the godly can only experience what God allows. Meanwhile, he has no choice but to [weep] by the rivers of Babylon!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings to Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, Anna [n√©e Adlischwyler], and all the children. Greetings from Wolfgang Musculus, Sixt Birck, and Thoman Ruman, who will also write.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Since Haller's last letter, nothing new has come from Saxony. It is said that the canons are arranging the evacuation of the houses [in which they lived before the introduction of the Reformation in Augsburg]. The devil is thus returning, and more powerful than before!</p>

      <p>Salvation from God the Father through our Savior Jesus Christ. I wrote a few days ago in more detail about the lamentable defeat of the Elector and the dangerous state of our affairs; therefore, I write more sparingly now.</p>

      <p>Dangers are increasing; the church is decreasing. This fire reveals what each person has built so far. In summary: The prophet rightly said: There is no salvation in the sons of men. I have never seen such enmities, hatreds, intrigues, and schemes! Nowhere is faith safe! Those whom I thought to be bronze walls become softer than wax under the burning sun of tribulation. So where should I turn or where should I go, except to Him who said: "The world will rejoice, but you will be sorrowful; but your sorrow will be turned into joy," and "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted."</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am not so much offended by the insolence of the enemies as by the inconsistency of our leaders. They are now leaning towards that Anabaptist doctrine, that the Gospel should not be defended with the sword. Indeed, God alone defends it, but through the ministry not only of His spirit but also of the external sword. For why else do they have the sword from the Lord, if not to protect what is good and just? But those miserable men prefer to invent such things against God rather than admit the true cause of our misfortune, crimes, and impenitence. I openly told them: "You do not want to defend the truth with the sword entrusted to you by God, and you think this is a sin; but meanwhile, by flattering and conniving in all impiety, which God has severely forbidden us, you think you will preserve the Gospel and do not prick your conscience for those deeds. Therefore, I fear that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you!" But what do they care about us? And, what is worst, they have not a few from our number who can connive at everything, ready to put on the vestments again if ordered. This gives me much trouble! But what should I do?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I ignore other dangers (which are not small due to the plots of the supreme captain). If I inform our people what is happening, against what should be done, they command to overcome everything with patience, that the wicked must be endured with gentleness. Meanwhile, however, they do not want even those who resist to be educated. If we very modestly criticize papal abuses, they call us seditious! If we remain silent, as many do, we are rightly called mute dogs by the people! Hence, I do not see how this kingdom can stand. Meanwhile, Satan reigns powerfully with usury, blasphemies, drunkenness, and other works of the flesh, without fear, without the compunction of consciences. Anyone can do anything! These are the main things that torment my mind. I make little of the rest: If they rage against us, they cannot twist even a single hair against the will of Him whom we serve. Thus we sit by the rivers of Babylon. May the Lord deliver us and preserve us into His heavenly kingdom! To Him alone be glory.</p>

      <p>No news has yet come from Saxony. It is said here that the canons are clearing their houses. It is a sign that the devil wants to return with seven worse spirits. God be lamented!</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, his lord and venerable father. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
