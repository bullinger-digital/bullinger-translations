    <p xml:id="regest1">The phrase [Pliny the Elder] "always something new out of Africa" [Adagia, 3, 7, 10 (LB II 886)] applies very well to Wittenberg, as hardly a day passes without bringing new news or unexpected encounters; recently, by chance, a paper came into his hands [in which Urbanus Rhegius speaks negatively about the works of the Swiss and Upper German reformers (see Reinerth, Hentius 189)], which explains why the works of Bullinger and his colleagues are not allowed to be sold in Wittenberg; suggests Bullinger to write a response, without wanting to pressure him. Furthermore, sends the "Responsio" of Philipp Melanchthon ["Responsio... ad scriptum quorundam delectorum ...", VD 16 M 4134-4139], which fully informs about the Cologne [Reformation attempt] and should be forwarded along with the paper [by Rhegius] to Oswald Myconius after reading; he would have also sent a copy to Myconius, to whom he has written, if he had not been prevented by a lack of money; for the same reason, Bullinger should apologize to Otto Werdmüller on his behalf for not sending him a promised copy of Melanchthon's "Catechesis puerilis" [VD 16 M 2629]; however, he has asked Christoph Froschauer to take care of it. Greetings, especially to [Konrad] Pellikan and [Theodor] Bibliander. Hopes for lively correspondence and asks for the enclosed letter to be forwarded to his compatriot Thomas Siebenbürger from Hermannstadt to Stein [am Rhein] and to convey greetings to Laurenz Siebenbürger, if he is still in Zurich; he is a furrier and has stayed with Bullinger's brother [Johannes].</p>

      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his venerable superior in the Lord, and most beloved brother, in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Although countless labors and various occupations have been an impediment to my writing to you, nevertheless, having set aside all these, since a most just occasion for writing to you has presented itself to me, I have decided to converse with you briefly. It is often said in the common and well-worn proverb, "Always something new out of Africa." This indeed can be most aptly applied to Wittenberg, as rarely or never does a day pass without my hearing or even unexpectedly seeing something new. Thus, it happened some time ago, by chance, that I came across a certain paper, which, as soon as I saw it, I immediately decided to send to you, especially for the reason that you might know for certain why your writings and those of others mentioned therein are so detested that they are even publicly forbidden to be sold. Therefore, most learned man, I would wish most greatly for you to be freed from this suspicion, by publishing some writing on this matter, not only for the sake of protecting your reputation but also especially for the sake of those who, at my persuasion, have now first resolved not only to assent to your writings but indeed to engage in constant meditation on them. However, I do not wish, most noble man, to act as your teacher in this matter, as it is said, and to prescribe a certain course of action, but I leave everything to your judgment and to those like you, and I ask for forgiveness if anything has been exceeded in this matter, which I doubt not you and all your colleagues will willingly grant. Here you also have the Response of Lord Philipp Melanchthon, from which the whole Cologne affair will become known. And when you and your fellow workers have read it, I ask that you send it along with the paper to Lord Oswald Myconius. I would indeed have sent it to him separately along with the letters I have now also given to him, if my purse, now gravely ailing, had not been an impediment, for which reason I also wish to be excused through you to Master Otto Werdmüller for not having kept my promises, for he asked me to send the Catechism of Philipp Melanchthon, which I believe will be brought by Lord Christoph Froschauer, for I have also given him letters, in which, among other things I wished to be expedited through him, I also asked for this to be taken care of. Farewell, most loving man, and bid all those singularly dear to me to be well. Especially, however, Lord Pellican, the most esteemed parent, then Lord Bibliander, etc. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given in Wittenberg, the day after St. Bartholomew's, in the year of salvation 1543. Martin Hentius Transylvanus, most devoted to you. After the letters were entirely to be sealed, I deemed it necessary to add this: First, to ask you, whenever the occasion to send letters to me is offered to you, not to neglect it, as you will find me doing the same. Secondly, I ask that these German letters be forwarded to my compatriot Thomas Siebenbürger from Hermannstadt to Stein am Rhein. Thirdly, I ask that Laurenz Siebenbürger, if he is still with you, be greeted most warmly. He is a furrier and has sometimes stayed with your brother. Farewell to you in turn.</p>
