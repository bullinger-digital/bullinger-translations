      <p>Greetings. I would have written to you (reverend father) at greater length, if indeed I had been given the opportunity to meet with the envoys. Now, since the matter has been delayed until evening, you will have to be content with these few words.</p>
      <p>The envoy affirms, and indeed most steadfastly, that peace has been concluded between his king and Philip. He had already told me this in the same sense that you wrote, but he says that on Saturday evening he was informed by the court about the peace, although the conditions have not yet been written to him. Mr. Valentinus adds that the envoy has with him a copy of the letters which the king sent to the Parisian senate; in these very letters, it is also written that peace has already been concluded. The envoy gave a certain papal bull to be read, which, however, could not be sent to you intact. The title is as follows:</p>
      <p>Bull of our most holy lord, Lord Paul, by divine providence Pope the Fourth, Against those aspiring to the papacy.</p>
      <p>The summary or status of the writing is this: that no one should aspire to the pontificate while the pontiff is alive, which Paul IV affirms has been done and is being done while he is alive. For he adds that this practice not only fights against the authority of sacred councils but also opposes civil laws; for there has been no well-established republic that has not guarded against the crime of ambition with certain laws. This is also made more disgraceful by the fact that it is almost like wishing for another's death. To all these things is added that there is a spiritual marriage between the pontiff and the church, which is much stronger than a carnal one, and those who presume to deal with another spouse while the spouse is alive incur the gravest penalties. To all these, he adds the penalty of excommunication and eternal damnation, which he threatens to all of any order and dignity who act against this, whether openly or secretly, and he subjects to this damnation and penalty not only bishops and cardinals but also kings, queens, and emperors; those, however, who have incurred this crime can only be absolved by the Roman pontiff and indeed only at the very end of their life.</p>
      <p>He adds many more thunderbolts for papal authority. He also promises impunity and apostolic grace to the authors and associates of such a council if they make a disclosure, etc. All these things were done in the assembly of cardinals, who also subscribed in the number of 30, among whom Johannes Bellaius, bishop of Ostia, occupies the first place. This is the summary of the writing, which I have extracted from a barbarous heap.</p>
      <p>A certain brief also came out in Rome in the year 1558, on December 21, which is now being sent for the first time, I do not know if you have seen it. The title is as follows:</p>
      <p>Brief of the revocation of all licenses and faculties to hold and read heretical books or those suspected of heresy granted to any persons so far, etc. The beginning is as follows: Pope Paul IV: To the memory of the future.</p>
      <p>Because in the events of the future, human judgment is so fallible that what seemed useful by probable conjecture appears harmful with the progress of time, sometimes the Roman pontiff revokes what seemed to have been established with deliberation more deliberately, etc. It has indeed become known to us that various secular clerics and regulars of various orders as well as laymen, who presumed they could resist the Lutherans and other heretics of this age and refute their errors and false opinions and for this extorted from the apostolic see the faculty of reading the books of these heretics, have so devoted themselves to the reading of such books that, relying on their own prudence and straying from the right path, they have remained ensnared by the fallacies and superstitious and false inventions of these heretics, and those who rashly thought they could recall others from errors have themselves fallen into the pit: we considering that the spirit breathes where it wills and that without its divine will no good comes, etc.</p>
      <p>These things so far verbatim; having laid this as a foundation, he forbids all our books, etc. The envoy also gave a copy of the speech which the bishop of Vienna, who on behalf of the king of France performs the legation to the orders of the empire, delivered. This speech, as I could conjecture from a few things, is very Latin; but because it was written in French characters, many things escaped me while reading; it had to be read quickly. However, the summary is this: he congratulates the emperor on this new honor and the princes of the kingdom on such an emperor. After this, he extensively recalls the studies of the king of France towards Germany, as usual, boasts of the same origins of both nations, etc.</p>
      <p>He says that the king will always send his envoys to the imperial diets according to the old custom.</p>
      <p>He also brings reasons for this, and complains that they had been excluded before, but hopes that the king can be induced to forget old injuries. Finally, he concludes with these words: But to finally shorten the speech, if no friend ever had enough, if armies, if wealth, if all the ornaments of human affairs that can happen to men are inferior to friends, it follows that you should persuade yourselves that the friendship of the most Christian king of all kings should be most dear to you, etc. I say of the king, who never had your cause separated from his own head, who never turned his mind to new friendships so that in the meantime he would depart from yours, who always considered it glorious to deposit treasures with friends, so he judged it disgraceful to keep them closed in the treasury when the cause of friends demands otherwise, finally, with him safe and intact, nothing can be taken away from the dignity of your empire, nothing from your right. For either you must stand or he must fall with you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, whether you are thinking about averting the enemies of the Roman Empire or about matters that concern the peace of Germany, the tranquility of Europe, the salvation of the Christian world, if anything is to be done, provided, hastened, you have the most Christian king, who if he has any influence with foreigners, if he can help with counsel and resources, he solemnly promises to contribute all this to the republic and promises to give his efforts so that you may judge that he lacked the means rather than the will. And lest the use of friendship languish or become sluggish, whenever the most illustrious and most famous men will hold assemblies to consult about public affairs according to the custom of the ancestors, the most Christian king is accustomed to send to you ambassadors and envoys experienced in many matters, who will reveal the royal mind and counsels friendly to your cause and, as we trust, not to be spurned, etc. These and some other few things which I could not read.</p>
      <p>From these, however, you can see and gather what the summary of this speech was, what the argument, etc. Our envoy does not know a single German word.</p>
      <p>Last month, when at a banquet some of us were saying that the French and Italians learn to swear before they learn to pray in German, etc., and then we asked the envoy if he knew what the name of God was among the Germans, he replied: by gott. He knows so much in the German language that, having often heard this oath sung to him, he thought these two words together meant God, etc. This is what I have and barely this.</p>
      <p>I will communicate everything to Mr. Friderich von Salis as soon as I have found a messenger.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their greetings to you; you will also greet your wife, the most honorable matron, your numerous offspring, and all your sons-in-law with other good men, my most reverend fathers and patrons. From Chur.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his ever-to-be-honored lord and patron.</p>
