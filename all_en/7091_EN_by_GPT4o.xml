      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and Jesus Christ, our Jehovah, we pray.</p>
      <p>It has been a long time since we, reverend lords and most esteemed brothers in Christ, have sent you any letters, for which there have been several reasons; but the main one is that, with matters in our religious affairs being so disturbed by so many impious opinions and storms rising against the light of the gospel, we could hardly conjecture what could be established and hoped for with certainty and clarity. Therefore, there was nothing we could write to you, most pious men and most loving of our progress, except something very bitter and most troublesome, as everything was confused and turned upside down.</p>
      <p>Now, however, with some of the most severe storm showing signs, if not of complete tranquility, which is not to be expected even in the flourishing kingdom of Satan, but at least of some calmer commotion, which brings us some hope, it seemed to us to be our duty and piety and respect towards you to inform you of our state, to greet you all with these letters, in which we will also be briefer, as Lord Ch.</p>
      <p>Thretius, who will deliver these letters of ours to you, is the one who will speak with you more copiously and also more pleasantly in his speech and conversation and will explain everything more fully in person. For no one would be more suitable and apt than he. For he not only witnessed these our tumults and conflicts that arose, but also dealt with and presided over them. Therefore, from him, whatever disturbances there are, by what authors and with what mental illness they were stirred up, will be explained more clearly, what our disturbances are, what conflicts, what the inconstancy of many nobles, what the itch for new opinions, especially in ministers, what the obstinacy in contending, what monstrous opinions they stubbornly defend, how boldly they fight. It is amazing how persistently they resist the truth due to their mental perversity. In these troubles, since your piety has shown us your inclination of charity and your ardent zeal to help both with doctrine and counsel, we cannot but give great thanks and at least testify with words from the heart our gratitude and in the future ask that you deign to love us, your brothers in Christ, united by one confession (which was published in the most illustrious city of Zürich two years ago in the name of many of your churches and approved by the French, English, Flemish orthodox churches and the University of Heidelberg, which we not only approve but also subscribe to again and again to your confession) and to provide advice and assistance to our turbulent churches, by which these disturbances may be somewhat suppressed and calmed. We know your zeal, labors, and fruits in the edification of the church of Christ, even in our kingdom now most afflicted, concerning which Lord Christopher Thretius, our dearest brother, will diligently ask you on our behalf, will carefully explain in our words. For he is the most devoted to your name and the most ardent supporter of promoting the kingdom of Christ. He is eagerly and also cheerfully setting out to visit you, led by the illustrious and magnificent Lord Palatine of Kraków, the patron of these churches, so that with your counsels combined, we may be stronger and also more prepared in overcoming these troublemakers here, who cause much trouble for all the pious.</p>
      <p>For that love which is in you, consider it kindly and embrace us with sincere and mutual affection. Farewell in Christ, reverend and uniquely esteemed brothers. Given in Oświęcim on the calends of May in the year of our Lord 1567.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Paul Gilowski, superintendent of the Reformed churches in the Duchy of Zator and Oświęcim, in his own name and in the name of the elders and ministers.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and most illustrious men Lord Heinrich Bullinger the elder, Rudolf Gwalther, Johann Wolf, Josias Simler, and the other ministers of the church of Zürich, servants of Jesus Christ, lords and brothers to be respected in Christ.</p>
