      <p>Greetings. Since the bearer of this letter, our friend, was about to set out for Zürich, most kind Bullinger, I thought it my duty to burden him with this letter, even though I had no other subject to write about. I considered it most important that you recognize my devotion towards you and that you might have the opportunity to share with us something from the treasury of your studies and about religion, if there is anything new. Our church in Zuoz, thanks to God, has been freed from papist leaven and has fully embraced the evangelical reformation. We have a minister who is not yet 23 years old, but for the time he is learned, pious, well-mannered, and a young man of great promise from among our own; his name is Johannes Contius. I also, as much as my burdensome old age allows, am always at his side for the sake of advice, and I support him with occasional sermons, so that he may more easily serve the entire parish. The people are eager to listen to the sermon and accommodate themselves with attentive ears, although in the meantime the mortification of the flesh is still excluded from us. May the Lord build upon this foundation with gold, silver, and gems, amen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have been informed that the people of Schwyz have persuaded the Glarus people in such a way that they allow mass to be celebrated throughout their jurisdiction, and that they have achieved this more by threats than by prayers, with many good and pious people protesting. I do not believe this report; I beg you to inform me about it. If the people of Glarus endure such an imposition, they would not possess complete freedom. From Italy, we have news of new events: the Antichrist is under a vigorous siege, suffering from a severe shortage of supplies by the Duke of Alba. The Pope has an army against the Duke of Alba, but it is weaker in strength. The Emperor has increased his army with several units in the Tyrolean region and neighboring places, who have taken their journey through Italy. The King of France has assembled an army of 25 units from our Rhaetians and Swiss, who are setting out towards Piedmont. Many from our Rhaetians are heading to Milan to the imperial camp, and thus confused movements have arisen. May the gods turn it to good.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live well, and I beg you to retain the memory of me. From Zuoz, December 8, 1556.</p>
      <p>From the heart, your friend and brother, Johannes Travers.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant shepherd of Christ's flock among the people of Zürich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a learned and pious man, his most esteemed friend and brother.</p>
