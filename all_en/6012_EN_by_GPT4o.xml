      <p>Greetings. I wrote 8 days ago, but found no one to deliver it to; therefore, I have now included those letters as well. Meanwhile, yours have arrived along with the letters of the illustrious Martinengo, which are very welcome to me, and I confess that I owe you much, through whose efforts I have come into his friendship, for which I give the greatest thanks to your kindness. I respond to him briefly; please, take care of the letters.</p>
      <p>I hear not a word more about Bernardino. There are those here who say that Camillo and Dario have gone to Constance to hide there; I do not know what is true; I know that we must be vigilant against them. For what you sent about the council received from the bishop, I give great thanks; I eagerly await the decrees themselves.</p>
      <p>While reading the curses and blessings of the flesh from Lotherbubingen, the prophet's words come to mind: I will curse our blessings, and it will fall back on him, what the wicked has hurled at the innocent. Mr. Martinengo thinks that due to the Calabrian tumult and the fear of the Turk appearing in Italy, our adversaries will now consult in vain about execution. May the Lord scatter their plans!</p>
      <p>Some of the Five Cantons seem and are said to be newly raging against the people of Glarus, and what will be the end? Lord God, deliver those who call upon your name. What I have from Mr. Haller in Bern about the treason against Geneva, you have here described. The plague is raging very harshly along the Rhine below Strasbourg, and it is beginning to spread in the city itself. The brothers in Heidelberg ask that we pray to the Lord for their safety; Count Valentin of Erbach has been killed by the plague in the Palatinate. Let us pray to the Lord to be with us always.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 7, 1564.</p>
      <p>I greet the consuls, my lords, Gallicius, Pontasel, and our other friends. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
