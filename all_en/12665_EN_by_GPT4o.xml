    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He hopes that the guild master [Hans...] from Isny has delivered the six guilders owed by [Konrad] Hofherr to [Hans] Meefuss residing in Zurich. Hofherr had lent the money to his brother-in-law [Fridle...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Enclosed, Blarer sends a letter received the previous day from [Georg] Frölich. The report from the [Konstanz council] to the [Zurich council] about the last skirmish, in which [Prince Albrecht of Brunswick-Grubenhagen] was severely wounded, will be sent with the same post [to Zurich] and will surely come to Bullinger's attention.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blarer briefly visited Konrad Zwick, who returned the previous night [from Füssen], and confirmed the earlier report [in No. 2610] about the indecent behavior of the [Swiss mercenaries in the Schmalkaldic army]. Especially the St. Gallers, led by their captains Christian Vogel, [Hans] Blum, and [Konrad] Glintz, have a bad reputation. Zwick thinks that the St. Gallers should punish these captains and return their looted goods to the estates. Although they would hardly accept it, the reputation of the Swiss would be restored. Zwick sends his regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Konstanz [merchant] Niklaus Kröl reported after his return from Venice that on his way home he counted about 3000 [imperial mercenaries] returning to Italy, all very happy about their return and unwilling to return to Germany at any cost. May they never come back with God's help and now recognize God!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [The Swiss] should repel [a possible incursion of the Bernese into] Burgundy with all their might, as such would only bring disadvantages.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Blarer is also very critical of [the negotiations of the Schmalkaldic League with] France and England.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The matter [of the Schmalkaldic League] must really be approached differently, otherwise it will be unsuccessful. But the Lord will stand by His own.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] We should pray for each other. In haste.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace with all good things. Especially trusted, dear lord and brother, I have received your letter with great thanks. In response:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Firstly, I hope you have received the 6 guilders owed to Meefuss from the guild master of Isny. Curio had lent them to his brother-in-law. He has now paid them.</p>

      <p>I am sending you again a letter from Leto. It came to me yesterday. What further news comes to my lords regarding the last skirmish, in which a duke of Lüneburg was stabbed (as feared, he may not survive, they write to yours by this post), remains undisclosed to you.</p>
    </div>

      <p>My dear cousin Konrad Zwick came late last night. I have only been with him for a short while, as he had much to do. However, he confirmed with great sorrow what I have previously reported to you about yours. He says it is not credible how much noise there is about them. They are behaving extremely badly and are excessively unruly, especially the St. Gallers, particularly their captains, Christian Vogel, Blum, and Glintz. He thinks the people of St. Gallen should punish these captains and return all their looted goods and money to the estates, so that it is seen that they do not approve of it. He believes the money would not be accepted, but would be sent back to them. However, this would restore the reputation of the Swiss. He sends you many, many services and greetings.</p>

      <p>Also, a citizen from here, Niklaus Kröl, a very pious, honest man, returned from Venice on Friday. He says he encountered many Italians on his way; he estimates about 3000. They are very relieved and happy to be returning home. They say the situation has turned out in such a way that if each had left an eye in Germany, he would not turn back to retrieve it. May God grant that they never return and learn to see rightly and recognize God at home with both eyes!</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>With Burgundy, as strong as they are, it would be a bad thing and would have a scandalous appearance, etc. May God grant to act uprightly and honestly in everything!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>With France and England, I am entirely with you, and have always been of the opinion that we must have nothing but all troubles from these fortune-seekers if we get involved with them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>And truly, the matter must be approached differently or our cause will be nothing, although the Lord will fatherly preserve us and all His own through all the turmoil of this world. To Him be praise forever!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Pray for us with all faithfulness. We do the same. Dated October 10, Sunday, early morning. I truly have no time to write. Therefore, take it as good.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich. To Master Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
