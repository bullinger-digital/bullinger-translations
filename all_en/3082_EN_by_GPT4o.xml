      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Johannes Adam Schad, your fellow countryman and my fellow citizen, visited me these days, indicating that he, being pressed by poverty and stripped of his goods, was reduced to the point where he was forced to seek other means to support himself than before. He asked me to lend him a certain sum of money so that he could buy goods there, with which he hopes to live easily and profitably. Since I did not have money in cash and did not want to completely reject a friend in need, I hoped to address his necessity in this way: by being a guarantor for ten guilders, as they call them, towards Johannes Rempf, who sells such goods, so that if he does not repay the creditor within a year, I would satisfy him without any harm to him. He liked the arrangement; however, he fears, since I am not even known to him by face, that he might not accept my guarantee. Therefore, I would like you to ask on my behalf, not to guarantee for me, but only to inform him that my affairs are not so diminished that I could not still be accountable for this sum. You would do a great favor to both of us; for I pity the poor friend and cannot assist him in any other way. I have nothing new to write. Therefore, farewell and live long in Christ and with us in safety. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, his dearest lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
