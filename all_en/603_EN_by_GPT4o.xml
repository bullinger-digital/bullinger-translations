      <p>Greetings and Peace. Do not be disheartened or ashamed to endure much in that most just cause of the oath; for it concerns the matter of our most holy religion and touches the head of religion, the true invocation of the name of God and confession, who indeed is the highest, or rather our supreme good, who helps, who punishes. If we join saints to God, we deny the true God, our only refuge. If we confess, He will also confess us in return. The form of the oath is explicit: "So help me God and His saints." I know what your people understand by saints; but those to whom the oath is made do not understand it that way.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, God has prescribed a certain formula for us to swear by, which we are not allowed to violate. They will bear their judgment, those who flatter the magistrate and refuse to gather with us. You persevere in what you have begun. In Baden, the four cities have agreed to let the article on the oath rest, so far and not to introduce it into the other places; but soon after, it was enforced in your area, as it was a serious command.</p>
      <p>But since not everyone wanted to swear in one form, the matter is best arranged that they should be left to rest and the alliances, since they have sworn before, should be kept faithfully. I wish your people would not revive this matter of dispute; for I hear (how true it is, I do not know) that some Swiss cantons and republics will send a delegation to Uri, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and Zurich to demand that they also agree to the French alliance. Here I fear, because your people continually urge the renewal of alliances, that they may also revive disputes; for our people, the Bernese and some others, as they will not accept the French alliance, the very servitude and plague of Swiss liberty, so they will never swear by saints with God's help.</p>
      <p>May the Lord break the efforts of the wicked.</p>
      <p>There is no need for you to wonder about my volumes; I have planned to publish three, only the first has been published; I am now working on the second. Each will be completed in two decades, so that in total there will be six decades. If you had read them, you could have inferred this from the series or coherence. They will serve as a substitute for commonplaces. May the Lord grant strength, so that I may complete what I have begun.</p>
      <p>For those new things of yours, I give great thanks. From the established Spanish Inquisition among the Belgians, the miserable people of Strasbourg, if they were not insane, would understand what clemency they could expect from the Emperor. But these things are hidden from their eyes, because the Lord has decided to afflict and test them. May the Lord grant us all eyes and ears. Let us pray for the afflicted brothers and for ourselves, who will also be afflicted at some point, perhaps sooner than we think. From England, I hear that the matter of religion is proceeding not so sluggishly, but the Scottish and French war is raging more pestilently than seems to be in the interest of the English, especially since they admit the Emperor's troops; for you cannot fail to see the hidden danger from afar. Let us also pray to the Lord for them, that He may keep them from evil. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 25, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, most vigilant bishop of the church of Basel, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
