      <p>Your letters have been delivered to me; but now I cannot, as I would gladly wish, due to bodily illness. Therefore, content with brevity, take this: It is very true that Condé has revived; for he left behind a son, a vigorous young man of 20 years, a companion of the King of Navarre, who succeeded his father and conducts himself excellently. However, the parent was killed.</p>
      <p>You will understand the whole matter from the enclosed letters; use them prudently, as I always advise, so that they do not become a fraud and detriment to others. I believe these more than all others so far.</p>
      <p>A messenger from Bern has come to Dole in Burgundy, intending to travel to the camp of Zweibrücken, but received notice in Dole to return home. Then it was announced to him that the Duke, with all his might, had already come far into France over the Arar; that in Aumale he would have liked to advance the way, but could not and still does not.</p>
      <p>So there is talk that the king's brother is advancing with all his might against the Duke, and Condé and the admiral are with the king's brother. If this is true, it will unfortunately cause trouble.</p>
      <p>May God send it for good!</p>
      <p>In Bern, these are the news, and that an Italian papal force is moving through Piedmont to the king, etc.</p>
      <p>In the Bernbiet at Lützelflüh, a great, unheard-of murder has occurred; for a son stole a sum of money from his father, then murdered him and hanged him on a rope, as if he had taken his own life. But when the matter was discovered, the son, the parricide, was duly punished on May 3rd.</p>
      <p>The meeting in Baden began on Monday and Tuesday and ended on Wednesday. The envoys returned home yesterday, and the Confederates are well satisfied with each other and have agreed to send a friendly embassy to the Burgundians for their good, if necessary. Otherwise, there is nothing there; indeed, some complaints have also come from Basel, too long to write about. Nothing specific has been received from France and the Confederates in Baden, which is unsatisfactory.</p>
      <p>The Lord be with you! I can write no more. Zurich, May 13, in the year of our salvation 1569.</p>
      <p>Greet the councilors, Karl, Bonett, Pontisella, Ganthner, etc., all.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger the Elder.</p>
