      <p>I am overwhelmed by such waves of business, my Bullinger, that I am forced to be briefer than I would like. Therefore, I briefly respond to your letters, and in order.</p>
      <p>I will gladly do a favor for Burcher, both for his sake and also for yours. If only Burcher's character matched Burcher's! But this is for you alone.</p>
      <p>Gwalther has disappointed my expectations, writing nothing to me now. I was in Abel's house when a bundle of letters was brought: yet at that time I received none except yours and Julius's letters; which I was very surprised about. Regarding the state of the kingdom in religion, consider this.</p>
      <p>Many pious people are pleased with everything, but a few things still displease me: but I hope for better. In a few months, the Scots have made more progress in the true religion than we have in many years.</p>
      <p>Among the Scots, the French, and us, (with the town of Leith surrendered) peace has been established: Abel has written the terms to you. Calais has not been recovered by us; indeed, nothing of the sort has been attempted.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name your excellent wife, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, and all learned men and my friends. I wish all the best for your city, and indeed for the entire dominion of the Zurichers. My wife has instructed me to send many greetings to all of you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>London, 23 August 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours, John Parkhurst.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
