    <p xml:id="regest1">Was encouraged by Celio Secondo [Curione] to write to him, and expresses his admiration for Bullinger; together with the other religious refugees, he knows himself to be connected with him in the Christian spirit. Thanks God that the truth has also found its way into Italy; in persecution, the community with others and the power of the [Holy] Spirit comforts them. God has saved him from prison and death, and he now wants to serve Him alone. Asks Bullinger to support the Italian refugees so that soon all of Italy may join the Swiss Confederates and Germans in faith, and requests mediation of his correspondence with Celio [Secondo Curione]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Christian Bishop, Camillo Renato sends greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Since I am aware of how much I value you and how much I have always most willingly attributed to your name and piety, and how much I would wish, when it is not possible to do so in person due to the distance of places, to declare to you through letters whatever there is of my goodwill towards you, I did not hesitate to write these things to you, a man most distinguished in doctrine and learning, and especially in piety, though I am a man not very skilled, albeit a Christian. Our Coelius Secundus, who is most closely connected to me not so much by familiarity as by religion, has led me to hope that my letters would not be displeasing to you, as he himself most liberally promised to deliver them to you and to adorn them with words according to his faith and humanity. Therefore, you will consider not the kind of letters, but with what goodwill and piety I ought to pursue you. For who would not be bound to you forever by your works published for the truth, which is the one gospel? Who among the travelers for the cause of the now long-flourishing gospel would not be invited by your charity, kindness, ability, grace, and singular zeal towards the pious to love, respect, and honor you greatly? I myself certainly know how much I value you, and how much I ought to value you, both you and all Christian men know. Indeed, I think there is nothing, nor will there ever be, that binds and obliges the minds of men placed in the most remote places more closely and firmly than that Christian spirit, than which nothing, alas, was more desirable before, nothing is more pleasing and delightful at present, and nothing has existed more powerful to lead us to the pursuit of true virtue, to the knowledge of the true God, to the sense of true happiness, to the most certain and true understanding of immortal life. It was not at all the virtue of the ancient philosophers, which many once boasted they had attained, but a deception and human invention that would eventually perish by its own nature; it was not the doctrine of the earlier theologians, which almost until these times has so unhappily settled in our minds, but a certain heavenly imposture introduced by that ancient deceiver, which had driven us wretched ones through the almost Jewish order of the Roman priests to such impiety that we seem to have scarcely recovered at last. We give the greatest, though inadequate, thanks to God, our Father, since we cannot repay, that in these last times the truth of the Christian gospel has also shone upon many Italians, so that it is not so unpleasant to remember what we were, as it is most delightful to have finally attained what we are. The impiety of the Romans persecutes us; we are separated far from our own, enclosed, tormented, and sometimes dragged into extreme danger of life. We confess this indeed; but the cruelties of the most wicked men seem to us sometimes milder and even more desirable, in that we have found many outside who share in our misfortune, and inside we often feel and are so affected by the power of the sacred spirit that not only do the evils we suffer become sweetened by that comforter, but we are also prepared to endure even the gravest ones with Jesus Christ set before our eyes, who, as the head of our miseries, is also the author of our happiness. And to speak of myself, who not very long ago recognized and believed in the true God and His Son Jesus Christ, than I fell into the suspicions of Satan, threats, snares, prisons, disgraces, tortures, and the greatest calamities of that kind: nothing was more certain to await me by the command of the Antichrist than either to be consumed in extreme solitude and starvation while living perpetually in prison or, which God would have permitted! to be secretly dragged to an untimely death. But yet that most provident God and our Lord Jesus Christ, as certainly the Father of us all, took care of our weakness and perhaps also for the benefit of others, as I hope and wish, and delivered us from dangers, so that He might make us stronger in discipline and duty and turn all this life we live to the benefit of our neighbors to the very end. For this reason, we often pray and strive in faith, and we also ask you again and again to pray, that we may not serve ourselves or please ourselves in anything hereafter, unless this very thing, which we do for others, is also for our own benefit, but forgetting all our own advantages and desires, which is the greatest part of our self-denial, since we seem to have attained not by our own merits towards God or any virtue, but by the singular will and zeal of God in Christ Jesus towards us, and we most joyfully feel it in our minds, we may diligently and eagerly share all this with other men, wherever and however it may be given. For we clearly understand that this will result both in the glory of God, our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the salvation of our neighbors. - What we have written above is aimed at making you easily understand what feelings we have towards you and your kind, and for what reasons we are driven out of Italy to these extreme solitudes of places. What remains pertains to asking: first, unless you disdain, which I cannot think, besides which I should not even do, the common calamities of the Italians for the cause of the gospel, whoever escapes from here to you most Christian men, treat them so liberally and humanely and make an effort that as soon as possible all of Italy may fly to the Swiss and Germans with minds converted to Christ and imitate your piety, which is the greatest, so that here, where Satan and the Antichrist seem to flourish for a while, no monument of old impiety may remain through you. The second is that, when you wish to send some letters from here to our Coelius, who, as he himself confesses, is especially dear and pleasant to you, you also perform your duty for us, so that our letters may be safely and diligently delivered to him and his to us in return. I earnestly ask you again and again to do this willingly. Farewell. Greet the brothers in the Lord. November 9, 1542. Tirano.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most Christian Bishop of Zurich.</p>
