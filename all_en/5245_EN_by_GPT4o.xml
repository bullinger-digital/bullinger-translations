      <p>Greetings. I have received all and each of your letters that you sent, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, up until the arrival of Scipio Cal., and for these I give you the greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord that, having mercy on France and all of us, He may deliver her and us from the jaws of the lion, and may He strengthen His saints so that they remain steadfast and sincere. In the meantime, the noble Ludwig von Bar has arrived, who was heading directly to Lord Hartmann von Hallwyl, and from there he was sent by our princes to some of the German princes. I fear he may not have found the princes gathered.</p>
      <p>For the Duke of Württemberg had summoned the more important ones to Brussels above Speyer. I wish he has not pleaded the cause of the Guises with them.</p>
      <p>Ludwig hastened there.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lord Coignet also arrived, to whom Admiral had written about this very matter.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Coignet called him from Hallwyl to Zürich. He came.</p>
      <p>He dealt with him.</p>
      <p>Hallwyl indicated that the spirits of some had cooled when they heard that the King of Navarre had defected from the truth, and after the Guises were heard by the Duke of Württemberg at the Alsatian taverns.</p>
      <p>However, after they understood that other princes remained sincere and steadfast, their spirits grew again. Therefore, having heard from Ludwig von Bar, Hallwyl is, as if anew, soliciting some of them, from whom he expects a response to be given in these days. This will be reported to Coignet, and then also through me and you to Lord Beza and the princes.</p>
      <p>Hallwyl is very hopeful, although he does not doubt that the spirits have been somewhat disturbed and hindered by that Alsatian action. May the Lord scatter the plans of the impious.</p>
      <p>The good in France will be vigilant and will pray to the Lord that the Guises do not cause great harm, aided, of course, by the work of the Spaniard and the pope and some other enemies of the gospel.</p>
