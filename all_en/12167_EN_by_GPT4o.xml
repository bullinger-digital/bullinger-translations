    <p xml:id="regest1">Hardenberg would have liked to write to each individual and thank each one, but this is not possible for him due to lack of time. - He is still working with the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied]. The efforts of the clerics and the chapter have forced him to halt his reform, which has weakened Hardenberg's strength and zeal, as he does not know to what extent further courses of action are open to him. - Old and new heresies are spreading daily, and the dispute over the Lord's Supper has flared up again. If only they would agree that the Lord's Supper is granted to all the pious through participation and not solely through [theological] views! - Zwingli's writings are probably already printed. Hardenberg was tasked with asking the [Zurichers] not to respond to Luther's [“Short Confession”], but Hardenberg supports an investigation of this matter by the church and not suppression. - Johannes a Lasco is also suspected regarding the Lord's Supper, but he proves steadfast in this regard. In December [1544], Hardenberg sent a Lasco's “Epitome” to the Zurichers and would like them to read it. He could provide them with a purer copy of it. Regarding the Lord's Supper, the Zurichers and [a Lasco] probably teach similarly. However, Hardenberg would like to know the opinion of the Zurichers on a Lasco's teachings about original sin, the death and punishment of Adam, death and purgatory, the one-time and permanent forgiveness of sins, the children of non-believers, and other complicated questions. A Lasco distinguishes between Adam's sin and mortal sin, eternal death and purgatory. Through sin, Adam did not make himself hateful to God; also, thanks to the promise [of Gen 3:15], he was not irrevocably condemned to purgatory. Furthermore, the children of all nations are redeemed. In all these questions, a Lasco wants to submit to the judgment of the church. The Zurichers should communicate their opinion, if not directly to a Lasco, then at least to Hardenberg, who will gladly pass it on to him. Like Philipp [Melanchthon], for a Lasco [God's] providence is contingent. If the Zurichers do not possess this [section of a Lasco's writing dedicated to this topic], Hardenberg will send it to them. - A Lasco visited [Hermann von Wied] with Hardenberg. He liked listening to a Lasco, hardly wanted to let him go after a month, and decided that the Reformation should be carried out under his supervision, God willing; Hardenberg also supports this. - If a Lasco's teachings have shortcomings, these must be eliminated to prevent stubborn people from causing [a new split]. - A Lasco has published against Menno [Simons], the leader of the Anabaptists, the [“Defense of the True Doctrine”] on the incarnation of Christ the Lord, which Hardenberg sends along. However, this book also gives rise to criticism, as a Lasco believes that the body of Christ could have sinned. [The writing against Simons] had two more parts, which were not published on Hardenberg's advice. The Zurichers should also judge this [new] writing enclosed with the letter. - [A Lasco] is eagerly awaiting a letter from the Zurichers during this [spring] fair. If there is anything to criticize about his teachings, he would change them immediately. The hair-splitting of the Anabaptists led him to his teachings, and he has reconciled the inconsistencies with the entire Holy Scripture. If the Zurichers cannot derive a Lasco's teachings from the [“Epitome”], Hardenberg will send them his “Erotemata.” - If a Lasco returns to the [Worms] Diet, Hardenberg will introduce him to Bucer and others, who would like him to attribute more [effectiveness] to the sacraments. However, he will only be guided by the Holy Scripture. - If Bullinger, Theodor [Bibliander], [Kaspar] Megander, [Konrad] Pellikan, and [Rudolf] Gwalther have anything to criticize, they should express it openly. - A Lasco is striving to establish a church in East Frisia, whose church discipline is probably surpassed by none other. Consequently, he has made himself hated by many who unjustly brand him as a Sacramentarian, Anabaptist, and Davidian. Therefore, the judgment of the Zurichers on a Lasco's teachings is all the more important. The Lutherans are courting a Lasco, but since he sent his “Epitome” to Duke [Albrecht] of Prussia, he is controversial among the Wittenbergers. - The sectarians are now being persecuted in Friesland, according to the decree issued against them in Brabant. Innocents also fall victim to this as soon as they are disloyal to the Pope. East Frisia is also affected. [The Emperor] thinks that his neighbor, [Count Johann I. Cirksena], must also fight the heretics. Now Friesland is also adjacent to [imperial territories] through [the acquisition of funds], and since it was legally allowed for a ruler to occupy adjacent territory if it provides refuge to heretics, and since all those who do not submit [to the Pope] are classified as heretics, Westphalia and then Saxony will soon be neighbors [of the Emperor]. And if Brabant gains control, souls will finally be redeemed! When Hardenberg stayed in his native Friesland, he was considered a heretic, had to flee [back] over the Ems, and could not even visit his mother [... Noetvelt/Noetvild?]. Thus, the Netherlands are being cleansed by the Lord. Daily, poor people flee, losing everything and not always able to escape because the borders of Brabant, Flanders, Artois, and Hainaut are guarded. Such a state, after so many diets, meetings, and consultations! And what a growth of the sectarians! Together with their devil's martyrs, believers are dying, just as Christ did between the two robbers! But Bullinger will have already heard this from refugees. - Hardenberg recommends himself to the Zurichers. A Lasco, in turn, requests the [new] publications of the Zurichers or at least a list of them. He has seen Bibliander's [“Relatio fidelis”] and fully agrees with this writing. All [of Bibliander's works] should be published!</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>I had intended to write to each of you, esteemed fathers in the Lord, but certain matters, which are pressing me greatly at this time, did not allow it; therefore, I wanted to do what I could, to greet you and to give thanks for your greatest benefits, which I will certainly always hold in my memory as long as I live.</p>
      <p>My affairs are still in the same state as they were when I was with you. I am working with the Archbishop of Cologne, a truly pious old man; but due to the efforts of the clergy and the chapter, the best prince is forced to suspend his reformation, and while my work is suspended, my vigor and diligence also perish. However, I have plenty to do, but I do not know if these things are in accordance with my duty. May God govern His church to His eternal glory.</p>
      <p>New heresies arise daily, and the old ones are resurrected from the dead. The cause of the Lord's Supper is very fervent. If only they would finally agree on what should be known and most common to all the pious!</p>
      <p>I think the works of Zwingli have already been printed with you; which I hope will be useful to many. And yet they also have their adversaries. Some have encouraged me to ask you not to respond to Luther's writing. But I said the cause should be examined; if it is good, it should not be suppressed. If anything is desired, it is better to propose it to the judgment of the church.</p>
      <p>Johannes a Lasco has also begun to be not well heard because of this cause, but he endures and perseveres. I sent his Epitome to you in December, which I would very much like you to read. I could not then have a more corrected copy.</p>
      <p>If you have not read it, I will take care to have another written. In the Eucharist, I assume you teach the same; but there are certain sharp points about original sin, the death and punishment of Adam, death and Gehenna, the unique perpetual remission of sin, the infants of unbelievers, and similar matters, about which I greatly desire to know your opinion. He distinguishes between Adam's sin and mortal sin, between eternal death and Gehenna. He says Adam did not incur God's hatred from sin, nor was the death of Gehenna intended for him, which nevertheless could and should have followed if they had not been restored by the promise. He thinks the infants of all nations reach salvation, although he mitigates this, so he asserts nothing rashly except to the judgment of the church. There is also a great complaint and lament that he does not teach sufficiently fully about the sacraments.</p>
      <p>I pray, brothers, by the name of the Lord Jesus, that if you do not wish to write to him about these matters, you would at least indicate your opinion to me. I will gladly inform him; thus, everything is free with him for me, which is honest. And indeed, the kind of doctrine is not disapproved by me, yet, since it seems to depart somewhat from the usual manner of the churches, I advised him to keep the received form as much as possible. He follows Philipp on providence and establishes a loose contingency. I do not know if these are in the writing I sent to you; if it is not there, I will send it to you.</p>
      <p>He came with me now to my prince of Cologne, who gladly heard the excellent man and hardly let him go after a whole month; and this with the hope that, if God wills the reformation of this church to proceed, it will be done under his auspices and work. Which I also urge greatly because of this man's authority, piety, prudence, and skill.</p>
      <p>However, if there are any blemishes in the doctrine, I would wish them to be eradicated first, so that we do not give occasion to headstrong men.</p>
      <p>He published here a booklet against the Anabaptist bishop Menno of Friesland on the incarnation of the Lord Jesus, of which I send you a copy, so that you may see the man's learned piety and pious learning. However, this booklet also endured the bite of some, because it seems to attribute to Christ a flesh subject to sin, that is, which could sin; which nevertheless seems to me to have nothing inconvenient, provided a candid interpreter is present. He had the remaining two parts on vocation and baptism, but on my advice, he published only this one now, to make a trial. I, both for the opinion of the highest man and especially for the safety of the churches, again and again ask you to judge the kind of writing and write back to us.</p>
      <p>He anxiously expects letters from you at this fair, and I fully hope you have written to him, or if your labors have not allowed this so far, then I pray that you write to him as soon as possible. If indeed any criticism could fall on his doctrine, he will change it immediately, as he will be instructed by you. The furious subtleties of the Anabaptists have driven him to such a kind of doctrine, which reconciles all scripture! And he hopes to have achieved this, namely, to have such a middle of doctrine, which no conflicting texts can shake. And indeed, I consider this kind of doctrine to be the safest, if only we rightly attain it. In this matter, what he has accomplished, he submits to you, brothers. If you do not derive the kind of doctrine from the compendium, I will send you his Erotemata on the whole doctrine, which have open doctrine.</p>
      <p>I hope he will come to the diet; if that happens, I will bring him to Bucer and others, who would like him to attribute more to the sacraments. Perhaps they also desire some other things in him; but he wishes to be fought with scriptures, indeed he desires no fight, but wishes to be instructed even by the least child.</p>
      <p>You, my father Bullinger, you, Theodor, you, Megander, you, Pellican, you, most learned Walther, if you think anything should be changed, indicate it freely; for there is a need for a consenting doctrine to stand out.</p>
      <p>He has established a church in East Frisia, such as I have hardly seen elsewhere so far. And indeed, the gravity of the discipline offends many; but he is moved by nothing, neither by threats nor by flatteries. He spares no one who gives his name in the church. He has this very badly: Most lawless men - whose gospel has hitherto been nothing but luxury and wantonness -, among these the best man is heard as a Sacramentarian, heretic, seditious, Anabaptist, Davidian, and what not, while in the meantime, no mortal is further from all these.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you again and again, if you think anything can be rightly criticized, to indicate it before anything else is printed. He believes and trusts you from the heart.</p>
      <p>You do not doubt that I do the same. Therefore, we ask that you do not conceal anything; for the matter is not about the shadow of an ass, as it is said, but about the cause of eternal salvation and perdition. The Lutherans are courting him. He had sent the Epitome to the Duke of Prussia, who had called him to the institution of his church. But as soon as his doctrine was seen and heard, it began to be disputed by the Wittenbergers. In Friesland, now according to the mandate of the Brabant court, the sectarians are being expelled; but this matter also extended to the innocent, while he was with me at Cologne. Therefore, he returned there to come to the aid of the innocent. The Emperor is vehemently raging against all who have defected from the Pope in any way.</p>
      <p>For there is no selection. He also extends his threats to East Frisia. He thinks the neighboring prince should purge the regions occupied by heretics. Now that Frisia is adjacent to us. Our lambs are greatly stained by those wolves. You understand the care of souls. Certainly, it is greatest at that court, which does not want any man to perish, that is, not to be subject. And it is granted by laws for a neighboring prince to occupy the neighboring land if it harbors heretics.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, the neighbors will be Westphalia and thus Saxony. Thus, souls will finally be saved if Brabant obtains the monarchy! When I reached my Friesland, I was considered a heretic. Therefore, I was forced to consult myself by crossing the Ems without even speaking to my mother. Thus, the threshing floor of Lower Germany is being cleansed by the Lord's winnowing fan. May God have mercy on us. Daily, miserable people flee from that slaughter to us, leaving all things behind, to take care of their lives.</p>
      <p>But not all are so fortunate as to find a place of escape. For now, at all the borders of Brabant, Flanders, Artois, and Hainaut, guards and traps are set, so that no one escapes. To this, all our diets, meetings, and consultations have led! Meanwhile, oh God, what a growth of the most monstrous sectarians! And indeed, Satan also gives some of his martyrs into the midst, so that with them the faithful may perish. Thus, Christ is seen crucified in the midst of robbers. I suppose some have also reached you from this flight, so I do not need to say more about these; otherwise, a whole volume would be required, and who can remember these miseries without the greatest pain?</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will make an end, if I first commend myself and my studies to you as diligently as possible. Lord a Lasco asks, if anything has now been published by you, that he may have it or at least that you write an index, so that he may obtain it from the nearest fairs. He saw my Theodore's meditations on the Apocalypse and greatly approved them; he would like both those and all his other works to be published. He thinks it unworthy for such great treasures to be suppressed any longer.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ the Savior.</p>
      <p>Bonn, March 23, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours devotedly from the heart, A. H.</p>
