    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the copies of the letters from Luther and the princes [Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Philipp of Hesse]. The writings that still make Luther suspicious, according to Bucer's statement, are those already mentioned at the [Zurich] meeting. In view of the letter from the princes as well as the statement of a [Saxon] envoy at the Diet in Eisenach, mutual suspicions should finally be abandoned, as they quickly destroy any friendship, as he himself experienced with [Megander]. The booklet, which Bullinger inquired about translating, could not be translated due to the impatience of the messenger [Niklaus Appenzeller]. Whatever the outcome of the Concord negotiations, God's judgment is to be expected in any case. What Ägidius Gunther writes about a boy is true.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I would have been shameless and certainly would not have considered your labors if I had imposed so much burden on you by asking you to transcribe both Luther's and the princes' letters for my sake. I thank you for your readiness towards me, as much as I can; for in this way, you have benefited both me and others.</p>
      <p>Regarding Luther's letters, I indeed feel the same as about the previous response he gave. However, I have been wondering until now what writings they are, because of which he still suspects some things even worse. Now I am not surprised; for Bucer explained that they are those he spoke about publicly at our last synod; I do not doubt that you still remember.</p>
      <p>The letter from the princes is such that, if Luther has offended in any way, we should consider everything in a good light. For the spirit they expressed in them was beautifully confirmed at the Diet held in Eisenach. For the envoy of the elector is said to have magnificently proclaimed that they had sent a very Christian and friendly letter to our prince and Luther, which greatly delighted them both. Therefore, since such a spirit is in the princes and now undoubtedly also in the remaining members of the Schmalkaldic League, it seems we should be careful not to do anything by our fault that would offend those who think so highly of us. Almost no one does not suspect our harshness; let us act, therefore, so that people understand how much the Lord has softened our minds and morals through His gospel. Let us cast aside suspicions about good men, and let us wait with patience until we clearly see that we have been deceived. Until then, there is no danger that cannot be easily overcome. For it is strange how unbecoming it is for ministers of Christ to be suspicious; it is against charity, to which we ought to be so devoted that among men we should study nothing more.</p>
      <p>If they deceive us, they have certainly deceived themselves, even without our inconvenience, except as it pertains to labors and a little money. But what would such a small loss be compared to the caution we would learn from this, of great importance and use in the future? I am silent now about how unjustly they bear it, and not without reason, who, while acting well and faithfully, are forced to hear ill from suspicions. I do not know if there is anything that breaks friendships more quickly. There is someone among you who, because of the most vain suspicions, has long since withdrawn his trust from me. As often as it now comes to mind: "I should write to him," immediately it occurs: "He will not trust; why then should you write?" Hence I am compelled to do what I do unwillingly, and I am wonderfully, indeed miserably, disturbed because of it. A friendship has ended, which I thought was very close, indeed indissoluble.</p>
      <p>Let us be careful, therefore, that we are not said to be subject to such a foul disgrace. For there are some so leaky that, whatever they have conceived ill of others, they immediately pour out, so that no one does not understand what their mind is towards those whom it would be more beneficial even for them to love, against whom suspicion has been poured out. It has already been objected to us so many times, why you suspect Luther and Bucer in such a way without cause, that I cannot wonder enough where such a thing has spread among men. I could answer nothing else but that I would be very sorry if there is anything in the matter. You, for your prudence and grace, be careful not to be counted among the rest here.</p>
      <p>The booklet, which you think I have translated into Latin, I only saw in passing. I hurried for it to be translated because I knew it had to be returned shortly; but because the ungrateful messenger took it away before it was properly begun, it happened that I neither read it nor have it. Therefore, I can render nothing to your judgment.</p>
      <p>The enemies of our blood rage wherever they can, whether we agree or not. And God's judgment hangs over our heads; we do not know when it will be borne. Let us therefore walk in the truth of the word, so that we may receive the Lord with joy whenever He comes.</p>
      <p>What Ägidius Gunther writes about the boy left by a relative, he writes truly. Farewell with yours and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 27, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a very faithful minister of Christ, his venerable lord in Christ. Zurich.</p>
