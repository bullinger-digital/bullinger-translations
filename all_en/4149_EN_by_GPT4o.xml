      <p>Greetings. If I did not respond earlier to your letter dated November 20th, most illustrious man, do not believe it was due to negligence or forgetfulness, but because I had nothing new to report, or at least nothing worthy of your eminence. However, we now understand from Venice that an unexpected deluge occurred there over a twelve-hour period, with seawater overflowing from its channels due to opposing westerly winds, flooding the entire city to a height of one cubit, filling almost all the wells and cisterns (which are used everywhere instead of wells), a truly memorable portent, from which may God avert any sinister meaning from the pious. No pope has yet been elected in Rome, and there is great hope for our Cardinal of Tournon or the Mantuan. I have given to Mr. Fabrizio what I received from Rome regarding this matter and the doubts involved, and he promised to send it to your eminence. From this, the ways, revelations, and inspirations of the Holy Spirit in such a holy assembly are clearly apparent; however, the creation of a new pope was not expected throughout this entire month.</p>
      <p>The Turkish fleet returned to Constantinople, giving hope and opportunity to our people for the recovery of Tripoli and encouraging them for this expedition. However, the Turk was planning great military preparations by land and sea for the following year, both against the Christians (as was rumored) and also against the Persian, who had received Bayezid, a fugitive from his father. In Spain, there were great disturbances due to religion, and more than 60 were executed, with as many around Valladolid (as they call the place, according to those who write) soon to be executed, among whom were many men of great authority. There, however, the subjects and leaders were preparing to meet their queen (our king's sister), who was expected there shortly, and in Lyon, everything was also being prepared for the arrival of the Duchess of Savoy, who was heading from there to Savoy. Some write to me from Valtellina that the emperor asked the Venetians to allow his army, which indeed consists of fifteen thousand men, to pass into Italy through their borders; but he did not succeed, and the purpose of such an army is unknown. However, I do not have certain and verified information about these matters; when I learn more, I will communicate it to your eminence, whom I wish to be healthy and well, especially at this time and during frequent colds, when many are troubled by colds and catarrhs, and I greet you sincerely.</p>
      <p>From Haldenstein, December 6, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your eminence's most devoted, Jean Jacques de Cambray.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the Church of Zurich and honorable friend. From Zurich.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
