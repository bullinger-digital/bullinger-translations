      <p>Greetings. In what state the affairs of the French church are, reverend father, you may have perhaps heard too soon, and you will also hear from the present Frenchman, whom the Lord has preserved unharmed. Therefore, I do not wish to detain you with more; he himself is also hastening his departure, so I cannot be longer. We do not doubt here that the very pitiable fate of the admiral has struck you all; without a doubt, the Lord will raise up other good men; for He will not abandon His work unfinished. What he has done with the lords of Bern, you will learn from him. The French envoys are wonderfully selling smoke and trying to clear their king, who has stained himself with such great blemishes that they cannot be said to be eternal. Let him trust, who will, henceforth in the faith of the French. They say the king rages and raves against the faithful like Nero, whose five-year period he has completed. I am sending back through him those things which you sent to me in the Acts; also, if possible, please send the rest to me; for I think he will soon return. He left with me his weak wife and little daughter. Mr. Consul Wittembach sends you many greetings and wishes to know from you what hope remains. They say a meeting of the Evangelicals will be held in Aarau. May the Lord assist His church struggling in extreme cases and bring help to the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Biel, 17th of September, 1572.</p>
      <p>May Christ keep you safe with us for a long time. I also give you great thanks for the booklets you gave me; if only I could repay you in some way someday.</p>
      <p>The sky often flashes with fires here; the price of grain is becoming dearer again; a measure of new wine is sold for a batz. The Bernese have forbidden their people to sell grain in the market unless they have first satisfied the magistrate for tithes and annual taxes; therefore, I hardly hope for a great cheapness of grain, especially since the summer crops have not turned out very successfully. Also, farewell and may you deign to keep me and mine in your commendation, etc.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] w[holly] J[osua] V[inslerus] of Z[urich].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, his lord and father, to be greatly revered.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Zurich.</p>
