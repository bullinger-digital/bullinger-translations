      <p>Greetings. Today I received your letters through that young man who was accompanying Vergerius there. I am sending here to him those which I received in the meantime directed to him from Viret. Tell him that I will diligently take care of what he entrusted to me through letters, and that Apiarius is proceeding beyond all our expectations. We are expecting the brothers from Augsburg today.</p>
      <p>By God, what will be the end of the council, when it has such beginnings? I fear that this bean will also be ground in us at last. May the Lord have mercy on us and finally scatter those Neronian efforts!</p>
      <p>As for the movement of our Frenchmen and the cause of Maurice, I want you to know that both he and his noble French adversaries are already here in the city. Today their case was presented before the senate, and it was sent to the consistory along with all the ministers and professors. It will be heard on Wednesday. I greatly fear that it will also give birth to discord among us, just as the cause of Zebedee once did among our predecessors. For I hardly think that the name of the pope is as hateful to Jodocus as that of Calvin, as you easily understood from my neighbors. He returned yesterday from Geneva.</p>
      <p>I do not know yet whether he has spoken with Calvin or not. Indeed, Calvin wrote to us on behalf of those noble adversaries of Maurice, one of whom is a cousin of the Bishop of Neuchâtel, another a relative of Lord Jacob of Burgundy, Lord of Fallais, etc., the third a nephew from the brother of Lazarus Baïf, a very learned man. But I fear that those letters will be more harmful than helpful to them among many. Nevertheless, we will work diligently as much as we can so that everything is settled in peace.</p>
      <p>The plague is still raging in Lausanne and is becoming more and more severe. Rodolphus Wonlichius is still troubled by his quartan fever, which he brought with him from Zürich, and so much so that never before, nor does the way of living of the French suit him. He would wish from you that he might be allowed to return to Zürich for a time until he recovers again. Which I also pray for him, and therefore I send to you the letters in which he expresses his pain to me, not for you to read, since you are occupied with other things, but to hand them over to others to read and to assist with your advice, so that as soon as the money he has long awaited is received, he may be recalled. If it pleases to add another to Notzius, I would advise that Vinslerus, who is already alone here, be sent there, who could also more easily adapt to the customs of the French. These things to you, since I do not have time to write to Lord Ammianus now. Let these be common to him with you. You will also take care to deliver these to my brother. May the Lord be with you and with all yours. Musculus greets you with all his; mine also greet you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 7, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Musculus sends you a copy of his dialogues on the council.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, lord and esteemed compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
