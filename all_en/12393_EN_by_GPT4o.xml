    <p xml:id="regest1">Wäber had neglected his studies and seemed to have forfeited the goodwill of Bullinger and his father [Johannes Wäber] as well as the opportunity to be further supported. However, he attributes his negligence to his youthful age. Since then, he has developed well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Wäber traveled to Bern at Christmas [1545] to visit his parents, and while he was staying with his father for a few days, the Bernese citizen Andreas Rappenstein brought a letter in which Bullinger had freely expressed his opinion about [Johannes Wäber's] "Apology." The letter also included Johannes a Lasco's writing on the Lord's Supper and the table of contents for Bullinger's book "De sacramentis." In his letter, Bullinger offered Johannes Wäber to have the entire book copied for him if he was interested. Consequently, [Johannes Wäber] instructed his [son David] upon his departure to ask Bullinger in writing to either have the book copied for him in Zurich or to send it to [David] so that he could copy it; unless Bullinger intended to have it printed soon. The scholars would indeed be grateful for such a print, and there is no need to worry about the slanderers!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger should convince the spirits of contradiction through the word of the Lord.</p>

      <p>Not so much the modesty of my fortunes as the greatness of your authority has been the reason why I have not written to you until now, most learned man. I confess that I have been somewhat negligent in my studies, as it would seem that I have lost both your favor towards me and the benevolence of my father, as well as the opportunity to be further supported. However, I attribute whatever was lacking to my youth, since, with the Lord's favor, I have made quite satisfactory progress, if I may say so without envy. Therefore, the first thing I ask, which I hope you will hear earnestly, is that you may deign to have me recommended to you for the sake of my parent, since I am aware that I have never been able to do anything to be received into your patronage by my own merit. But if I have not been able to prove myself to you until now, I will strive diligently to do so in the future.</p>

      <p>But lest I delay your mind, occupied with serious matters, by my long-windedness, I will not remain silent about what I wish. Know, venerable lord, that around the festive celebration of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, I traveled to Bern to visit my parents. While I was staying with my father for a few days, letters were brought to him by Andreas Rappenstein, a citizen of Bern, from you, which were quite generous. In these letters, you clearly expressed your opinion about my father's "Apology," and in the meantime, you sent a certain letter from Johannes a Lasco about the Lord's Supper and the summary chapters of your recently written book on the sacraments of Christ and the church. You also voluntarily promised to arrange for this book to be copied for my father if he thought it would be useful to him. Therefore, my father entrusted me, upon my departure, to write to you about this matter and to request, in his name, that you either have your book on the sacraments copied in Zurich or send it to me so that I may copy it quickly, unless you think it more convenient to have it printed soon. I know that you will gain great favor among the good if you have it printed. Let the evil slanderers fade away, whom we do not care about! For just as a bird flies to the heights and a sparrow goes wherever it pleases, so a curse uttered in vain will not come upon anyone.</p>

      <p>It remains, esteemed Bullinger, that you continue to be who you have begun to be in the Lord, convincing those who contradict with the sound and sincere word of God. May the Lord of all, rich in mercy to all who call upon Him, grant this grace.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ. Given in Suhr, on the seventh day before the Ides of February in the year of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ 1546.</p>
      <p>David Wäber, deacon of Aarau, always most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and upright man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed patron. Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
