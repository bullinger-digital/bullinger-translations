    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger will likely have received Wolfgang Musculus' letter [HBBW XV, No. 2287] through Huldrych Zwingli the Younger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Since Johannes Haller has adapted to the [conditions] of the Church [of Augsburg] and also agrees with the [Augsburg Church Service Order] on the issue of the Lord's Supper, Musculus is much more satisfied with Haller than those who do not consider peace in the church might assume. Musculus has long been fed up with these restless spirits (whose audacity is not immediately apparent). Therefore, he often considered leaving [Augsburg]. However, there are many good people there with whom Haller could associate.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The great attendance at his sermons already sufficiently demonstrates how much Haller is appreciated. He is also welcomed by the councilors, as will likely be evident from their writings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- There is nothing certain to report about the [Second Regensburg Religious Discussion]. The [Schmalkaldic League] in Frankfurt is said to stand firm and united against the Antichrist.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings to [Rudolf] Gwalther and others.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. The letters I sent through the son of the blessed memory of Zwingli, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, I do not doubt that you have received.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the calling of our beloved brother Johannes Haller, after he adapted himself to our church and agreed with the concord in the article of the Lord's Supper as understood in a pious sense, I am more content than some here, who care little for ecclesiastical peace, might think. Therefore, I want to assure you that Haller will be more commendable to me than ill-advised people predict. This city of ours has some remarkable and restless spirits, which have long caused me great weariness and often lead me to think about moving; their audacity is not apparent at first glance, but a long experience is needed to recognize it. There are many good men here, with whom Haller can safely associate.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>How well he is received by our church is sufficiently demonstrated by the great attendance at his sermons. And how pleasing he is to the councilors, you could recognize from clear arguments. I do not doubt that you will easily understand this from their letters. The fellow ministers have promised him all humanity and brotherly love (Bruderliebe). It remains that the Lord grants grace to this calling, making it fruitful for His glory and this church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Moreover, I have heard nothing certain about the Regensburg Colloquy. The Protestant assembly, which is now held in Frankfurt, is said to be unanimous and concordant in resisting the efforts of the Antichrist. It will be your duty there to pray with us in Christian unity that the Lord may destroy those machinations of the Antichristian faction with the arm of His power.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest Bullinger. I beseech you to greet Rudolf Gwalther and the other brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, January 4, 1546.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, dearest lord and brother.</p>
