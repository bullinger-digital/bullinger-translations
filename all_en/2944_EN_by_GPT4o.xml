      <p>S. Here is a brief account of what happened at the fair. The monk, about whom I wrote to your reverence, was supposed to be here at this market to dispute, but he did not come; instead, he went away, and we do not know where. The most prominent people from Valtellina have come here and negotiated on his behalf before our lords of the Three Leagues, to whom we have also given a proper response. They have constantly insisted that the monk should dispute in Valtellina; however, we have maintained that he should come here. Thus, our aforementioned lords have decided that he should come here to Chur by St. John's Day, and the authorities should seize him and bring him here; if he does not come in time, he will be banned from the land of the Leagues and should not be found in the Three Leagues; if he is found in our territories, he should be arrested and brought here to Chur. Those who spoke for him have requested safe conduct for him and other doctors he might bring from Italy. We have also approached the lords and earnestly requested that they promise him safe conduct. However, our lords have decided and responded: as he has offered to dispute, he should come, and whoever wishes to dispute with him. They want no violence or injustice to occur; they hold and ensure that he should be satisfied with such a promise. We do not know whether he will come or not; we must wait until St. John's Day. I cannot believe that he will come; for they say he is otherwise more ignorant than a monk, but exceedingly bold and shameless, as a monk should be. After that, the wealthiest in Valtellina have repeatedly negotiated before the lords to expel the Italian preachers from Valtellina; however, we have defended the matter and achieved that they may still remain. See how the devil deceives himself! He has tried everything to remove the evangelical preachers from Valtellina, and yet, as I hope, no monk will come to Valtellina anymore.</p>
      <p>I cannot refrain from writing to you about this, as respectable people told me yesterday, in such a way that you should believe it. In Valtellina, there is a sect almost like the Anabaptists; yet they are papists. They are called the Flagellants because they whip and beat themselves. Among them, they have this rule that they should confess everything to each other that they do and think, and what they would like to do. Their prior is a doctor of law, otherwise a foolish man, as I have often found in conversation with him. This superior and prior has heard their confession; thus, his servant, whom he has in the house with him, also came to him and confessed, for he is also of the faith and order. As he confessed, the confessor said to him: "You have confessed and only said what you have done with your deeds; you must also say what you think and would like to do." The servant, however, strongly resisted this and begged him to let him off.</p>
      <p>The confessor swore him by God and their rule that he should say. Then this one, as one who wanted to keep the rule well, said: "Reverend father and lord, I often think how I would like to lie with your wife." Then the confessor was displeased and expelled the servant from the house that day.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, your reverence, for discussing such matters with you; yet one must know, quomodo menciatur inquitas sibi (how iniquity speaks to itself).</p>
      <p>Also, note this: the Five Places have written a letter to our lords, to all Three Leagues, and requested that they should not allow any Locarnese to live in the Leagues; if they wish to do so, we should let them know when a diet is held; they wish to come themselves before all Three Leagues and make that request.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing else to write at this time. May God preserve your reverence, all learned and pious men with you and your lords and territory, and give them heart and courage in his son Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
      <p>From Chur, the 8th of June 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
