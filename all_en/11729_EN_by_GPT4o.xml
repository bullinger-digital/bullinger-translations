    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends his commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew, the Acts of the Apostles, and the apostolic letters as thanks for the generosity shown by Hilles; he forgot that Hilles wished for Bullinger's writings "De scripturae sanctae authoritate" and "De origine erroris" bound as one book; if Hilles desires these writings, Bullinger will send them, especially since their reading will not be unfruitful. He will now address Hilles' question about which Church Fathers and historians he should read: Of the numerous excellent works of Tertullian, whose difficult style might overwhelm Hilles, he particularly recommends "De praescriptione haereticorum," "Adversus Praxean," "De carne Christi," and "De resurrectione mortuorum"; Tertullian's writings are unsurpassed, Bullinger himself reads them repeatedly. What Athanasius writes in many books about the Trinity, Tertullian already expressed 150 years earlier in a concise form, yet Athanasius' "Epistula ad Epictetum" and "Oratio contra gentes/de incarnatione verbi" are also recommendable. Of the many works of Cyprian, only a few have survived, among which his sermons and treatises are particularly recommended. Irenaeus' work "Contra haereses" is not recommended for Hilles due to its difficult style. Lactantius explains in his "Institutiones" how important faith and an innocent life are, which is why he rejects idolatry and sacrifice except for works of mercy; in "De opificio dei," Lactantius expounds on the wisdom, power, and goodness of God, which is why this work is particularly recommended, the others can be read superficially. Jerome's interpretations of the prophets and the entire scripture are recommended, his polemical works are often exaggerated; his praise of virginity and monastic life has done more harm than good, although if he lived today, he would not agree with those who rely on him. Bullinger cannot give advice on the works of Ambrose; he is the only Church Father from whom he has read only a few works, namely "De officiis ministrorum," "Hexameron," and "De incarnationis dominicae sacramento," from which he gained much and therefore Hilles should also read them; the "Commentarius in 13 epistulas Paulinas" is also learned, Bullinger himself has used it a lot. Augustine is most familiar to Bullinger and none is more useful than he, a true treasure for the Church; particularly recommended are "De doctrina christiana," "De fide et symbolo," "De vera religione," "De agone christiano," "De spiritu et littera," "Tractatus in Iohannis evangelium," "De civitate dei," and the "Epistulae." Augustine also dealt with the sects of his time: Against the Manichaeans, he wrote works on the truth of the Holy Scripture and the origin of good and evil, against the Arians he wrote about the Trinity and the divine nature of Christ; he defended the unity of the Church and the nature of baptism against the Donatists, and in conflict with the Pelagians, he discussed the doctrine of grace, free will, and justification by works; Hilles should also read "Contra Iulianum," "De praedestinatione sanctorum," and "De haeresibus." Finally, regarding the particularly valuable historiography, which has produced so many works that even the lifespan of Nestor would not suffice to know them all: Bullinger assumes that Hilles desires a compendium and therefore recommends the "Enneads" by Marcus Antonius Sabellicus as well as the "Historiae adversus paganos" by Paulus Orosius; Publius Annius Florus' "Epitome" will be known to him, and reading Flavius Josephus will not harm; further reading suggestions will be found in these works.

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The books you see, Richard, dearest and most esteemed brother in the Lord, namely my commentaries on Matthew, the Acts of the Apostles, and the letters of all the apostles bound in two volumes, I pray you to accept as a gift. For great are the benefits you have bestowed upon me, and great is the favor with which you pursue me, undeserving as I am. May the Lord repay you for all your goodness. I certainly think of presenting you with some token of gratitude. However, I have forgotten what you desired, that my little books "On the Authority of Scripture" and "On the Office of Bishops" and "On the Origin of Error" be prepared for you and bound into one book. If that is your wish, let me know, and it will be beautifully arranged.</p>
      <p>I believe, however, that the reading of those books will not be entirely unfruitful. Now, to answer your question about which ecclesiastical writers you might profitably read, and which historians I would recommend for you to explore, here is a brief account. The very ancient Tertullian wrote many excellent works, but due to the difficulty of his style, I do not know how pleasing and useful his reading might be to you. However, if you wish to know something of his, read first the "Prescriptions against Heretics." Then the book published against Praxeas on the mystery of the Holy Trinity. Afterwards, his book on the flesh of Christ and on the resurrection of the flesh. No one can briefly explain how much benefit can be derived from these most learned and holy books. I have never ceased to marvel at the exceptional purity and erudition of these books, nor do I cease even today to be frequent in them. What the most holy Athanasius scattered through many books about the Trinity, this earlier one condensed into a very brief compendium, preceding Athanasius by more than 150 years. However, he wrote a letter to Epictetus, bishop of the Corinthians, against all heresies on the sacrament of the Lord's incarnation, which you should certainly read. Cyprian the martyr wrote many things, but few of his works survive. Among these, his sermons hold the first place, and then his treatises, which you will recognize not without great fruit of piety. Irenaeus, who greatly surpasses these three in age or time, disputed against the Valentinians, but with such obscurity of style and perplexity of sentences, whether due to age, the carelessness of scribes, or the negligence of the translator (if he wrote in Greek), that I do not believe his reading will be either necessary or useful to you. Lactantius wrote seven books against the pagans, which he titled "Institutions." In these, it is especially commendable that he impresses everywhere with such force and eloquence that God is delighted and appeased by faith and innocence of life. Hence, he rightly rejects all kinds of idols and external sacrifices except for mercy. Moreover, the book "On the Workmanship of God" wonderfully extols God's wisdom, power, and goodness. I consider this to be read first, and his other books only to be skimmed. In the works of Jerome, those he wrote on the prophets and on the whole of the holy scriptures are rightly commended. The rest, published against adversaries, have always seemed quite harsh even to the best of men. His diligent and laborious commendation and praise of virginity and monastic life have harmed more than they have benefited many. Although I do not doubt that he wrote what he wrote with good zeal, nor would he approve, if he lived today, of what those who rely on his authority design. I cannot advise on the works of Ambrose. He alone among the ancients has been read less by me. The books I have read, "On the Duties of Ministers," "On the Work of Six Days," "On the Sacrament of the Lord's Incarnation," I can never sufficiently admire and approve. I therefore advise you to know them as well. The commentaries on Paul are learned, and many things from them have been transferred into my own. Furthermore, no one is more familiar to me than Saint Augustine, and no writer seems more useful to me than he. If the church lacked him, it would lack a great treasure. He wrote many things, and all usefully. Among these, however, you will usefully read these books first: "On Christian Doctrine," although in these he also instructs the preacher, "On Faith and the Creed," "On True Religion," "On the Christian Combat," "On the Spirit and the Letter." The treatises on the Gospel of John are truly golden and most holy. The books "On the City of God" are most elegant and delightful, and filled with manifold doctrine. Among his letters are included very useful little books. Whoever reads through all his letters and the little books included under the titles of letters will derive much fruit. This author disputed against the sacrilegious sects of the Manichaeans, Arians, Donatists, and Pelagians. Disputing against the Manichaeans, he discusses much about the truth of scripture, the true origin of good and evil, and just reason. Against the Arians, he defends the sacrament of the Holy Trinity and the true divinity of the Son of God. Against the Donatists, he defends the unity of the church and deals with the matter of baptism. Moreover, against the Pelagians, he defends grace, discusses free will and merits. And I think these books should be known, but prudently read what he disputes about predestination against Julian and on the predestination of the saints. It is also worthwhile to read the Catalogue of Heresies diligently compiled by him to "Quod Vult Deus," at least so that we may avoid foreign opinions known to be contrary to the orthodox church. These are what I had to say about the most common doctors of the church. There are many others distinguished by learning and piety; however, I think this is enough for you at present.</p>
      <p>I come to history, than which nothing is more useful, nothing more elegant, nothing more delightful. Certainly, because of its excellence, innumerable historians have written history, so much so that the age of Nestor would scarcely suffice to know them all. You at least desire a compendium. I therefore advise you to obtain for yourself the "Enneads" of Marcus Antonius Sabellicus, which lead the series of history from the beginning of the world to the years of Emperor Maximilian. This man collected whatever exists among Greek and Latin historians about all kingdoms and memorable things in the world. Paulus Orosius also wrote about outstanding deeds from the founding of the world to the age of Augustine, that is, Theodosius the Great, who is pleasing above others for this reason, that he beautifully applies, as it is said, present things and teaches religion in the works of God. You are familiar with what Florus wrote in his "Epitome" and his four books. If you join the reading of Josephus to these, you will not err. Moreover, from these you will gather whom to read, if you have time to read more.</p>
      <p>These brief and rough notes to your questions, poured out in the turmoil of business within an hour, I ask you to take in good part. Live and farewell together with your most chaste and holy wife, whom my wife, along with the children and the whole family, greets with many salutations. May the Lord Jesus be with you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 30th October in the year 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
