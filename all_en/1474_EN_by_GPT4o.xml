      <p>God's grace, etc. I have nothing to write this time, except that the envoys to Baden have been arranged, Schultheiß Nägeli and Venner Tilger; they have orders to negotiate separately with the three cities. The letter from Zürich has brought much good and has been received with great goodwill. Regarding the alliance, my lords will not yield. Some well-meaning people suggest that Zürich should, for a time, give the cantons the oath in their manner and on their holy days, and would like them to reconsider this at this meeting. I have been instructed to write to you and my lord Lavater about this, but without naming anyone; you know how to handle it well.</p>
      <p>Meissenburg is to be tolerated; thus informs me Mr. Hartmann von Hallwyl, who was with the Duke in Wittenberg and heard it from his mouth. However, the Duke still has some doubts about the conditions and has not given a thorough report; he has indeed made the following statements: 1. That they give the Emperor 50,000 florins; 2. Duke Moritz is to take a number of people into the city; 3. 12 cannons with all accessories are to be given to the Emperor, while maintaining their imperial and city freedoms, as well as religion. Whether they have agreed to this form, he cannot know. If you have any certainty, let us know.</p>
      <p>With this, God is entrusted to you and all yours. My lord Treasurer Haller, Venner im Hag, Musculus, and others greet you. Dated Bern, November 18, 1551. Your willing Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
