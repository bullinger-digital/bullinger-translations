      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. Your Fabritius will be in place of a living letter, so that it is not necessary for us to write everything with a pen, most learned and dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>He will report, if I am not mistaken, both what he has seen and heard. My health is mediocre, as soon as I was freed from a paroxysm and a unique swelling by the benefit of divine power, I carry around this living corpse, which had almost one foot in Charon's boat.</p>
      <p>I go out in public, but not much further, leaning on my staff or cane like a limping man; for I am not strong enough, and unless the Lord grants strength to my still oppressed old age, I do not know what I will be able to do for the church of God in the future. May the will of the Lord be done, by whose command I live and die, whom I also pray unceasingly, that he may wish to appoint a better, more pious man of calm disposition and not quarrelsome, who in life and manners corresponds to the teachings of Christ, to succeed me. I would prefer to devote my efforts to some small church in the countryside and spend the rest of my life there. The prince passed through last week and sought the duchy. I did not see him. He will provide for the place of his absent relative, who has undertaken a long journey.</p>
      <p>Our church is neglected by the absence of certain nobles, the republic is ruined by luxury and the immodesty of all things, sins are committed with impunity, and while we cry out in vain, they despise the ministry and think that what we say from the pulpit is nonsense. We have never been able to obtain sumptuary laws from our people; at weddings, dedications, as they call them, social gatherings and meetings, not to mention sumptuous attire, and the more we thrive on the word of God, the less they do. Let them see to it. I wrote to you recently, if I remember correctly, asking that the German sermons given to your church and transcribed separately onto several sheets be printed by the printer into one book, in what they call quarto format.</p>
      <p>They will surely be for sale and will be distributed by many. Farewell, and commend us in your holy prayers to your church and brothers, so that in such great malignity of all things, we may not be ensnared by the wiles of Satan and lose heart, which God forbid. Our people, especially that King, also greet you and your family with all the fellow ministers, especially Mr. Pellican, who is no less Macrobius than I am, Mr. Gwalther, Mr. Bibliander, and the others. May the Lord keep you as long as possible, so that you may be able to write and teach to propagate the glory of God and his son Jesus Christ. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, September 17, 1554.</p>
      <p>Old Erb.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the distinguished Antistes of the renowned city of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed brother in Christ, etc.</p>
