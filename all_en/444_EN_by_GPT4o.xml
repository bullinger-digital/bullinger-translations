      <p>The pious Bufler from Isny writes to me that at the emperor's court, as well as from Antwerp, the merchants in Augsburg and Memmingen are being told that it should be certain that there has recently been a great uprising in England; for the clergy have made a great following of the common people, and the matter has come to the point that they have finally taken to the field against the king, and otherwise still have a crowd, etc. But the king with his men has prevailed, having slain up to 4000, among them probably 300 priests, and also completely scattered the other crowd. What will follow, we will soon be warned. It is believed that it is because of the great taxation that the king has imposed on the kingdom, especially on the clergy, to support the war against Scotland, namely, the priests are to give 1.5 florins from every 5 florins of income, making 300 florins from 1000, and from the others always 1 florin from 50 florins of capital for three years. It is seriously said that the Frenchman wants to send all the soldiers he can get from the Confederates to the Scots against England. If the soldiers are now granted and given, I truly worry that they will fall into great misfortune and bear the bitter fruits of the new alliance, from which, according to the agreement, the soldiers are left to the Frenchman, and since the rogue has broken into lands in many places, as you know, it is to be feared that they will carry the same with them to the crowd and cause a great death. But the world seeks and finds misfortune, neither turning nor holding back, wants to have its way; one must let it and yet recognize God's just judgment over them as just.</p>
      <p>A letter is being carried back and forth, saying that the emperor has declared war on the Frenchman; I cannot find any basis; yet much is made of it. I consider it a pure fabricated story and fable, which is being inflated for other reasons.</p>
      <p>Recently, Duke Ulrich in Urach had a blind alarm made by night, and it was thought that the Spaniards were before the city, so that he could see how the citizens and the country folk would behave; but the citizens have bravely armed themselves, and the country folk have drawn together handily.</p>
      <p>The pious godly nuns in both convents in Constance, at St. Peter and Zofingen, have all left the city with great distress and heartfelt gratitude to God, although some were not given a single heller for sustenance and otherwise nothing at all. They had to leave with completely empty hands. The others were given, but everything they had brought in was greatly cut. Two, who remained in one convent and were never involved with the gospel, are now quite at odds with each other. Two strong, healthy people have died there in three or four days; it is said they died of the plague.</p>
      <p>Doctor Veltin is so completely nonsensical at the pulpit that fewer and fewer people attend his sermons. He always lies one and hundreds in one breath. God have mercy on him and punish him for improvement, etc. He recently, in a sermon where he admonished the authorities to root out the shameful, rebellious, blasphemous heretics, shouted three times loudly from the pulpit to the authorities: "Defend it, defend it, defend it," which caused great laughter in the church.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, they write to me that entire wagons full of monks are being brought in, and the bishop is also there, having much to do, and last August the bishop, the devout cardinal, himself preached in the cathedral.</p>
      <p>But the community is very active; the churches are very full where the word of God is preached, and no one is forced to attend. Also, at least ten lords of the daily council, which the emperor has newly appointed, do not attend mass, but go to the preaching of the gospel; some among them go neither to mass nor to the preaching, but few to mass.</p>
      <p>The pious woman Sabina Sch√∂nerin asks me in her letter to greet you very friendly and Christianly on her behalf, with the offering of her loyalty and love. She laments her great, heavy cross that she has because of her brother, by whom she was recently in Friedberg near Augsburg, and earnestly asks that you commend her to him as you can. His daughter is now with her and the other sister, having taken a husband long ago, but has not yet had a wedding; they are first dealing with the relatives. I cannot tell if it is the daughter who suffered the misfortune with you, or another. She also does not let on what has happened to the brother and what cross he has suffered, except that she reports how he is being wronged. I have written to her what I have heard and what the rumor is, and advised her to write to the brother, if he knows himself to be innocent, that he should then return to Zurich and not let the dishonorable accusation lie upon him, so that it may not always be a burden and disadvantage to him and his children. I think, if the daughter took a husband long ago, perhaps the same has impregnated her; I do not trust the good old man; he is otherwise quite fearful and previously left Augsburg without need; otherwise, his case would never have become so bad. May the dear God have mercy on him and on all of us, amen.</p>
      <p>I would like to know if the other children are still with you.</p>
