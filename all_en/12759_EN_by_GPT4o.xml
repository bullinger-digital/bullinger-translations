    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller recommends the young, repentant [Johannes] Huser, who is now returning to Zurich. It was not easy to persuade him to do so. He wants to make up for his running away through obedience. After many misfortunes, he now knows how beautiful it is to live in his homeland, even under the supervision of a tutor. When he came to Haller, he was completely run down and desperate. If Haller had not taken him in, who knows what would have become of him! The people of Zurich should now receive him well for Haller's sake, so that he does not fall into bad thoughts again. Soldiers reported that he behaved decently during the war. This gives hope.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] As it turns out now, most of the news that Haller reported three days ago [in No. 2706] is false. Since yesterday, it has been certain that Emperor [Charles V] is in Rothenburg ob der Tauber and is recruiting new mercenaries from the troops dismissed by the [Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Unfortunately, it is said that the people of Ulm are trying to reconcile with the Emperor. If they were to become enemies now, it would be the end for the [Augsburgers and the other Protestant imperial cities]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] A significant personality [Hans Welser?] reports that the Emperor intends to call upon all citizens and other inhabitants of Augsburg who own goods or merchandise in imperial territories to leave the city shortly in order to regain their confiscated property. If this is true, dire consequences are to be expected! For almost all citizens, even the poorest, have invested money in the Augsburg trading houses and receive interest from it, which they in turn invest elsewhere. If these returns are no longer paid to the citizens, the whole city would fall into extreme poverty! Everyone is highly alarmed. No one wants to leave anything behind, but no one wants to lose anything either. There is also fear that the priests will return to the city. Then it would also be over for all the pastors! May the Lord, who has triumphed over the world, avert this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] News from Venice reports that the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] is wintering with a large army at Adrianople. This is an unmistakable sign of a future campaign against [Christendom].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Bullinger and his family are commended to Christ. All colleagues send their regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Huser is returning to you, whom I have finally persuaded to do so. I commend him to you. He is indeed a young man who is not bad. What he did wrong by leaving, he will make up for by obeying in the future. He has learned through many misfortunes how pleasant it is to live in his homeland under the yoke of a tutor. He has endured extreme poverty and hunger, and was almost overcome by cold, and bitten by lice. If I had not kept him with me and cared for him, I do not know where the poor desperate man would have gone. He promised to return, relying on my recommendation. I therefore ask that you receive the repentant student and not reject him, forcing him to contemplate worse things. He lived, as all the soldiers testify, soberly and honestly, and in the very school of impiety, he kept himself pious, which is an infallible sign of good hope for him. Therefore, I ask you to deal with him in such a way that I may feel that my prayers have had some effect with you.</p>

      <p>Three days ago, I wrote about some rumors that were flying around with us, most of which I now find to be false. For it was certainly reported to us yesterday that the Emperor is acting in Rothenburg ob der Tauber and is gathering new troops from those soldiers whom our people have dismissed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It is also said, alas, that the people of Ulm are wavering towards the Emperor's side and seeking his friendship; if they become enemies, it will be over for us!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I also heard about a certain great man that the Emperor is going to send a mandate to Augsburg, ordering all citizens and residents who have wealth or merchandise in his majesty's domain, whether they are from those Augsburg societies or from citizens or residents who have deposited their goods in the commerce of those societies, to leave the city quickly; then all their goods are to be returned to them. But for those who remain, their goods are to be confiscated. If this happens, good God, what a commotion there will be! For almost all citizens, even the poorest, have their investments with these societies. If any citizen had even 100 or only 50 florins, he contributed to some society, from which he received annual interest. They invested it elsewhere. Hence, if nothing is returned to them, the entire city will be reduced to extreme poverty. Therefore, we are all here in great care and anxiety. No one wants to leave their possessions; no one wants to lose them. I fear that the priests will have to be received back into the city. If this happens, it will be over for all of us. However, I hope the Lord will graciously avert this evil.</p>

      <p>From Venice, we have news that the Turk is wintering with a large army at Adrianople, a sure sign of a future expedition against us. May the Lord Jesus, who has conquered the world, protect us! Amen.</p>

      <p>I commend you to Him with all the brothers and your family. All our brothers send their greetings. Augsburg, December 10, 1546. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable lord and father. Zurich.</p>
