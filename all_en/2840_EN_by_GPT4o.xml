      <p> Greetings. While I am writing this, the council has not yet adjourned; however, I believe that the envoys of the three cities will soon depart after lunch. You will learn from them what has been decided. I would have wished for them to have gone to Geneva; for it seemed that the situation absolutely required it, and many wise men would have wanted this; but, as far as I understand from them, they will not do so, but will deal with the Genevans through letters. I am concerned that my lords' response will be understood differently (than they intended), because my lords' disposition is good. I can understand my lords in no other way than that they mean well; however, they do not like to be swayed by the Genevans, and they fear that Geneva will break off this negotiation and not give their envoys any recommendation, neither to articulate nor to anything else. My lords do not know what they are dealing with them, and do not want to commit themselves, since Geneva previously rejected the negotiation. However, if it could still be negotiated with the Genevans, that they would abandon some articles and leave the rest to mediation, I believe there would be no need here. My lords do not want the articles at all, 1. that they may also ally with others, 2. that the citizenship should be eternal. The article about imprisonment might perhaps be mediated. My lords have good reasons why it is not possible for them to accept the remaining articles. I hope to God that it will still turn out well when the Genevans see what they are dealing with; they are mistaken in many points. But why do I speak of these things, since you will learn everything fully from the envoys themselves. I give you great thanks for the book you sent me; I inspected it briefly, as much as I could, and saw that it is a most useful work, and one that will undoubtedly be received everywhere with much favor. I see it is an epitome of your Decades, except that in those most learned disputations you attack and refute the adversaries of this simple truth. May the Lord preserve and increase His gifts in you more and more to the glory of His holy name, amen. All of ours greet you and thank you greatly for those booklets, as the messenger who delivered them to you, as you instructed, will report to you. Please convey my greetings to your wife and entire family from me and my wife, I pray. Farewell. </p>
      <p> Hastily, February 27, 1556. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Haller. </p>
