    <p xml:id="regest1">Albert [Hardenberg] was here; Blarer should ask his brother [Thomas] to strengthen Hardenberg in the correct doctrine of the Lord's Supper; he will likely be strengthened in everything by [Ambrosius] Blarer - whose faith Bullinger does not doubt; he is said to have received several calls from princes and cities; may he spread the Kingdom of Christ! A peace is said to have been concluded in France; may it be true, so that the people may find relief in the coming winter!</p>

      <p> Greetings. Now comes the most excellent man, Mr. Dr. Albert, a theologian from Leuven, indeed a Christian teacher. He thinks rightly and piously about all the articles of our religion. Ask your brother, the most illustrious and worthy consul, to confirm him in the true and orthodox doctrine of the Lord's Supper. I have no doubt about your faith; I know you will confirm him in everything most diligently. He has many calls from many princes and cities. I hope he will vigorously propagate the Kingdom of Christ. May the Lord be with you! A peace is said to have been made in France. Oh, would God that the poor people might have some relief and not be so miserably burned and ravaged in the winter! ZÃ¼rich, 28th September 1544. Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
      <p> Greet all your people most faithfully. </p>
