      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus Balbanus, our dearest brother and elder of the church, is going to request something from you in the name of all of us, which we indeed most earnestly desire to obtain and greatly need. We ask you, in your kindness, to listen to the man graciously and to give him your full trust. Farewell, most excellent and upright men.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ be with you, may He increase and enrich you and your church more and more each day with His divine blessings, and may He make your labor in it fruitful. Geneva, on the first day of September, 1557.</p>
      <p>Those who honor you with the highest respect, the elders and deacons and the entire Italian church, who are in Geneva. To the venerable fathers and faithful ministers of Christ, the pastors of the ZÃ¼rich church, whom we honor with the highest respect in the Lord.</p>
