      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, I write now because the opportunity of a good messenger presented itself to me, who came to Chur and can easily bring this to you. I earnestly request, write to me what you hear about the military preparations being made in Germany against the Pope. For everywhere there is a rumor of something of this kind.</p>
      <p>It is indeed of great interest to me to know what this is. For (to speak openly to you) I would immediately fly to those princes and would not be useless, since I was educated in Italy and have there the support and goodwill of many.</p>
      <p>We also have poets among us who have played with Magdeburg and Metz, Niger in a tetrastich, another, a good friend of the Pope, in a hendecasyllable. Farewell and be well. In Chiavenna, on the Ides of March 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
