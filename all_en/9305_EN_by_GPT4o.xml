      <p>Greetings. I have just received your letters through this minister of Peter Sprecher, along with the documentation of the proceedings from the judges, as much as you could obtain. I thank you, and I have no doubt that you have received the two letters sent to you via our public courier and through Lumagas. You understood what I requested in the letters sent via the public courier. In the meantime, I have received nothing more from them, except what I have written on the paper enclosed here. The letters written in Augsburg were delayed on the journey; therefore, they were returned to me later. If anything is brought from either Germany or France, I will share it.</p>
      <p>You diligently inquire into Italian affairs, especially now that Swiss signs have been placed on the cities of the Venetians, what is happening there; whether a war is about to break out between the Venetians, the Pope, and the Spanish; and what is being reported about Turkish matters.</p>
      <p>We still have no certain information about the Emperor, whether he is dead or alive; rumors had spread that he was dead, especially since Ferdinand descended to Vienna dressed in mourning with the entire court. Now he has returned and is now passing through Constance, Schaffhausen into Alsace, where they are said to fear him more than frost and snow, which have destroyed the vineyards and brought poverty upon us as well. Many and severe calamities are afflicting the world, which has become almost insensible. May the Lord have mercy on us!</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your family and fellow ministers, brothers, and all friends, whom you will greet in order.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 1, 1573.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin, my dear sir, etc., in Chur.</p>
