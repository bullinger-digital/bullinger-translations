    <p xml:id="regest1">Von Meggen thanks Bullinger for his detailed letter [not received]. This letter and the time Bullinger dedicated to reading his small writing ["Peregrinatio Hierosolymitana"] show the good disposition Bullinger has towards him. According to Bullinger's advice, von Meggen will revise the entire [writing].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger should forward the enclosed letter to Mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater] and the Zurich Council. In it, von Meggen writes about the golden chain that has been demanded back from him. However, he hopes that they will refrain from doing so, and that Bullinger, who is familiar with the matter, will intercede for him with the council and those tasked with it (including [Leonhard] Holzhalb, whom he sends greetings to).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Recently, Meinrad Schreiber was with him. As a token of his appreciation, he gave him a work of Homer as a gift for Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I received your letter with the greatest joy and read it; the longer it was, the more it pleased me, as from it and especially from the efforts you have deemed worthy to spend on my trifles, I can gather an uncommon love for me, which I have long known, but now I have learned more certainly. Therefore, I am not undeservedly most grateful to you, and I will repay this gratitude if the opportunity arises.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Moreover, intending to follow your advice, I will review everything when I have leisure, perhaps to be polished again by your utmost refinement (for your kindness seems to promise me such things).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I also beg you to deliver the enclosed letters to the consul and the senate, in which I respond about the golden chain they have requested from me; however, I hope they will abandon their intention. Therefore, since you are familiar with the matter, ensure that I feel your friendship through your intercessions both with the senate and those selected for this matter, one of whom is Mr. Holzhalb, whom you will greet by name along with the others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Recently, Meinrad Schreiber was with me. I entrusted him with a work of Homer to bring to you, which I send as a gift, a small token indeed; yet it will be a pledge of great love. I would write more, but my unskilled style and the brevity of time prevent me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, farewell and understand the rest as you know how to act. In Lucerne, on the 30th of March, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your intimate friend, Jost von Meggen.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, rector of the Zurich church, his friend.</p>
