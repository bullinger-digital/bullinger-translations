      <p>Grace and peace from God, along with my willing services beforehand, dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Since you recently asked me to write to you if there were any certain new developments regarding the imperial majesty's military actions, nothing else has come to us since then, other than what you have heard from young Thomas. However, just this past Sunday, letters arrived, among which Lord Christoph Truchsess, Baron of Waldburg, writes to his father, of which I hereby send you a copy. Subsequently, letters arrived again in August and were sent to Herr Völker von Knöringen and delivered at the shooting festival held in Konstanz these days, which agree with this. And in addition, it is written to him that the castle and city of Tunis have been won, and each soldier is given three months' pay for the plundering, and the imperial majesty also intends to advance on Constantinople. May God grant him grace and strength!</p>
      <p>Tell your wife that she should not let you be in want; the apron will come out of the dye house by next Friday, and as soon as it is ready, I will send it to you.</p>
      <p>With that, always entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>Dated in Konstanz, August 10, 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours always willing, Gregor Mangolt.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, pious, and highly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the gospel of the church in Zurich, to his kind dear lord, to his own hands.</p>
