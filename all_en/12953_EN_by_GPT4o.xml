    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Hilles received the letter written by Bullinger two months ago [not received]. He is touched that Bullinger always thinks of him and encourages him to the constant reading of the Holy Scripture and thus to a righteous life. Even if there is nothing to answer in the letter, he still wants to thank him for the German book that was enclosed with the letter, as well as for the information about the mission of the French envoy [Guillaume du Plessis, sieur de Lyancourt] in the Confederation. He asks for understanding for the late reply. He cannot respond to all letters immediately.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In Strasbourg, the capture of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony by the troops of Emperor Charles V is considered certain, especially since the various reports agree. However, Hilles learned from a letter from Cologne that through a messenger [...] that news about the Elector was spread throughout Hesse, but Landgrave Philipp of Hesse conducted investigations and subsequently declared the rumor to be false. The messenger, who claimed to have participated in the battle, was then reportedly deservedly physically punished in Marburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The same letter also contained the following: From Erfurt, on May 1st, a message was sent to a Cologne resident named Johann Pelmgen at Rheinberg [on Rimberg] about a surprise attack by the Imperial forces on April 24th against the Elector's army. According to this report, 2000 foot soldiers and 150 horsemen of the Prince fell, while his son [...] was able to flee severely wounded (but he is not in life-threatening danger). The Elector is also said to have fallen, but to the joy of his army, he was found uninjured on the ground. Furthermore, on April 25th, a man named Wilm Thomas with several thousand men from Bohemia attacked the Imperial troops and recovered 15 cannons that had been taken from the Elector's forces. They are also said to have seized a wagon loaded with silver. In the attack, 5000 Imperial soldiers reportedly fell. The Emperor was thus forced to retreat to Eger. The news of this letter from Cologne is hardly credible!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] There is nothing new from England, except what Hilles communicated to John Burcher about a month ago in a letter. Greetings, also to the colleagues and to Anna [n√©e Adlischwyler].</p>

      <p>Praise be to God! Strasbourg, 19th day of May 1547. Greetings and peace in the Lord Jesus, our Savior. I wish you to know, my most esteemed lord, that I received your most welcome letters sent to me two months ago, and I am immensely grateful to your piety for keeping me in your memory and for constantly encouraging me to the study of innocence, justice, and the unceasing reading of the Holy Scriptures. But since in your letters I do not see anything that necessarily requires a response, except that I should have thanked you for the German book, which I received along with the letters, and also for not disdaining to write to me about the matters that the envoy of the King of France desired from you, I have delayed until now and I beg you not to take this amiss; for I scarcely have the leisure to respond to all letters immediately without great inconvenience to myself.</p>

      <p>Here it is said for certain that the Elector of Saxony has been captured by the Emperor's forces, and the reports of those who say and report this agree so much that it is very likely and believed by all to be true. However, I recently received a letter from Cologne (but I do not certainly believe these things to be true) stating that such news was spread everywhere in Hesse by a messenger, but the Landgrave investigated and found the news about the capture of the Duke to be false, and therefore the messenger, who first reported this (the messenger said he was present at the battle when the Elector was captured), was treated badly (as he deserved) in Marburg.</p>

      <p>In the same letter, it was written to me from Erfurt on May 1st to a certain Cologne resident named Johann Pelmke zum Rheinberg in these words: "To inform you of our news, dearest, know that on April 24th, the Emperor's forces unexpectedly and hastily attacked the army of the Duke of Saxony and from the Duke's infantry 2000 fell, and 150 horsemen, while the Elector's son was struck with a severe wound, but fled without danger of death. Also, at that time, there was a rumor everywhere that the Duke himself had fallen, but he was found uninjured on the ground, which was a great joy to his entire army. Furthermore, on April 25th, a certain lord named Wilm Thomas came into the Emperor's forces with several thousand from Bohemia and forcibly took 15 cannons along with wagons loaded with silver, which had been lost by the Duke of Saxony's forces before, and killed 5000 men of the Emperor's forces, so that the Emperor himself was forced to retreat towards Eger," etc. But I consider all these things to be fables.</p>

      <p>I have no news from England except what I wrote to John Burcher about a month ago. Farewell and have us commended to all your pious colleagues along with your faithful wife.</p>
      <p>Yours, Richard Hilles.</p>
      <p>To the most learned theologian, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the Church of Zurich, and especially to be respected by me, let letters be given. In Zurich.</p>
