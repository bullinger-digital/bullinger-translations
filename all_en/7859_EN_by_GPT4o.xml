      <p>S. Brother d. d. Cellarius, the most excellent man, came to us for the sake of his affairs, to whom I did not want to be lacking as much as I could. After lunch, Mr. Consul Ambrosius very often sought me out, Mr. Franciscus Bonettus was about to report some news from Italy that arrived today; I will note the summary of them: Clavenna, April 14, Signor Castelberti from Modena sent a certain letter pertaining to the Basel resident Francisco Betti, opened to our Mr. Francisco Bonetto, so that he may read it and then send it sealed to Basel, in Italian: 1. The Bishop of Cremona, son of Cardinal Sfondrati, has died. 2. Likewise, the senior Cardinal of Ferrara has perished. 3. Philip of Spain has rejected all wives offered to him so far and has openly declared that he does not want a legitimate wife. Guise, in the name of the King of France, suffered rejection; likewise, the Emperor's envoy (who wished to marry the Emperor's daughter to the Spaniard) was rejected. 4. King Philip has given the Archduke of Austria 400,000 crowns and instructed him where he should take and have them. 5. The discord in Betica or the Kingdom of Granada is partly concealed and will be further concealed. 6. Some merchants, who come with horses, one from Pergamon, some from Milan, say that the war between Sweden and Denmark is flaring up again. 7. The Emperor is said to have sent an envoy to the King in France, telling him to lie and to withdraw from the German borders; if not, he would re-enter; whereupon the King left Metz and returned to Paris. 8. The English were supposed to take two cities through treachery, namely Dieppe and Avranches; however, this was discovered in time, and after the revelation, the traitors were captured. 9. The Pope has in preparation 8,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 horsemen, some say more, some less; however, everyone agrees that they are raising the money with great difficulty. Their leader is Count Sforza de Sant Fior; over the cavalry are the two brothers Mario and Paolo Fiore, brothers of the aforementioned leader. Count Palavicino and Laurentius Lenci(?), Bishop of Fermo in the March of Ancona, are envoys and lieutenants; the muster place will be at Casale Monferrato. 10. In recent days, a great noise was made in Rome, and many believers were abjured, and among others, 2 Counts of Herculaneum were condemned, one to eternal galley service, the other to eternal imprisonment; one, however, who did not want to recant, was burned alive. 11. The Duke of Bavaria requested that his son, who was a canon, be elected as a cardinal (as was promised to him). 12. The Pope expelled all Jews from his land, only in Rome and Ancona do they still have a place. 13. The Emperor, in the long-standing salt dispute, offered the Pope to be satisfied with the lords of Ferrara regarding the salt; for he says they owe about 5,000 crowns. 14. The Cardinal of Trento is now in Rome and is vigorously accusing the Archduke of Austria, who is attacking his land. 15. The old Shah is said to be dead, and his son, a very warlike man, is to succeed his father. 16. The Rhaetian commissioners, who are now appointed to Valtellina for the annual account, have ordered the poor Cellarius's wife for 12 years to take 30 guilders every year, which she takes from the monastic cloisters of Morbegno, Chiavenna, and Tirano, 10 guilders from each. And yet nothing happened to them, the monks, for it is said they have a lot of oil and chrism. - March 30, the customs officer of Chiavenna was in Venice with the ambassador of the King of France, and when asked how things stood in France with the Lord Prince of Condé, he replied that it had never been better for Condé than now, and in those skirmishes, 2,000 had fallen, namely 500 of ours and 1,500 of the enemy. - All these things, my most esteemed Mr. Father Bullinger, I have hastily compiled here from the Italian recitation.</p>
