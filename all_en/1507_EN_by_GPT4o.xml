      <p>For the booklets recently sent to me, which were not only pleasing to me but also to others, it is evidence that I could never recover them after lending them to friends. I am very grateful and would have already responded in writing if the lack of couriers had not hindered me. Magdeburg was more truly liberated from siege than received back into its former grace by surrender or redemption; for the difficulty of conquest, the lack of pay, the overwhelming burden of affairs and wars arising elsewhere, and the constant courage and fortitude of the Magdeburgers brought them peace. And as we hear, not everything is yet calm among the Saxons; for the soldiers, both those outside and those inside the city, wanting to serve under new pay from Duke Georg of Mecklenburg, who was almost captured in the city during the entire siege, are being recruited, but for what purpose, we do not yet know for certain. Duke Heinrich of Brunswick is also in arms against them. Some say that the brother of the King of Denmark has been elected bishop of the dioceses of Bremen and Hildesheim, but that the Duke of Brunswick has long held a good part of the Hildesheim bishopric by force, which the newly appointed bishop is attempting to recover. Others suspect that there is not enough agreement between Maurice and King Ferdinand; for they say that Ferdinand is demanding from Maurice those cities where the royal mines are, as belonging to the crown of Bohemia, the surrender of which the other absolutely refuses. The county of Katzenelnbogen, recently adjudicated to Nassau by the Emperor's delegates, being taken into trust by Maurice in the name of the Landgrave's children and the taking of oaths of loyalty, is either a sign of remarkable rashness or a new confederation. This winter, pregnant with military preparations, may perhaps bring forth fire and sword by the coming summer.</p>
      <p>I suspect that the actions of the council are better known to you than to us. The Saxons seem to be delaying by claiming the mission of their theologians. Maurice, as well as the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, insist that the council be resumed anew and that the prejudices of a few Romans not be a detriment to our cause and doctrine due to our absence, which the assembly of Cercopes will by no means allow. But from the military actions, it is now openly clear that there is little regard for the council at the moment. What we hear about the military disturbances, you can see in the attached schedule.</p>
      <p>From England, good men write such things against the Duke of Somerset, which I could never believe could have entered the mind of such a great man; if they are true, I pity him, and they are lamentable signs of human inconstancy and frailty.</p>
      <p>But the outcome of the question will teach this; I hope for better things. The most serene king, with the entire kingdom, otherwise acts prosperously and peacefully; may God preserve him for us. I wish to know what is happening with you. Attribute the delay in response to the lack of couriers and the inconvenience of winter. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Commend me to your family, to Bibliander, and to others. Given in Strasbourg on December 20, 1551. Commend me to Mr. Hab.</p>
      <p>In the Tridentine reed bed, the fathers sit, who, for their own pleasure and the delight and sweetness of their ears, fashion and join pipes; but since they dared to call the gods to a musical contest, God has aroused trumpeters and loud-sounding horn players to compete with them.]</p>

      <p>To the pious and learned Mr. Bullinger, most esteemed friend. Zurich.</p>
      <p>The conditions of peace for the Magdeburgers are said to be these: That the city pays the emperor 50,000 at certain and fixed times until the entire sum is completed.</p>
      <p>They shall give him six cannons.</p>
      <p>They shall restore to the chapter the castles occupied for some time.</p>
      <p>They shall beg pardon on bended knee before the elector and Schwendi for any fault they may have committed.</p>
      <p>Our prince will have this reward and advantage from the completed war, that the Magdeburgers will receive him as burgrave, under whose protection and guardianship they will safely enjoy in the future; thus a firm and eternal peace has been made between the Saxon house and the city, useful to both parties.</p>
      <p>As for the chapter members, if they had any rights in it until now, all of that is now taken from them and transferred to our side.</p>
      <p>By the next week, the elector will consider how many cities and castles in the bishopric he will choose as compensation for the expenses incurred, which amount to several hundred thousand.</p>
      <p>The warlike priests are now becoming a laughingstock to all and, having drawn upon themselves the hatred of everyone, they waste away in sadness of spirit.</p>
