    <p xml:id="regest1">In Bullinger's last letter, he was especially pleased with two good pieces of news: 1. that he will receive Bullinger's scholia on the Gospels for a while for use - Megander and his assistant are to bring them, but sealed, so that the content remains unknown; and 2. that he can expect Bullinger's imminent visit, as confirmed by Matthäus Hiltbrand. For the discussion of the reformed places on the unification of marriage legislation, Bern has appointed not only Megander but also Crispin Fischer to Zurich; it is hoped that Myconius from Basel and Vadian from St. Gallen will participate. Franz Kolb has traveled for a spa treatment; his friendship with Haller has cooled. Greetings. Bullinger should definitely stay with Haller in Bern.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>There are two main things, dearest Heinrich, that have delighted me in your last letters and have made me more certain of you than ever: First, that you so kindly, yet with a certain messenger, promise, indeed offer, your Gospel commentary. You have a certain messenger, Megander and his servant, provided they do not know what they are bringing. Let the book be sealed, if possible, with your seal. For I wish your thoughts on sacred matters to remain as private with me as the innermost secrets of my heart. I have entrusted both of them and have provided a leather bag for this purpose, so that they may conveniently bring what you have given. I beseech you, therefore, not to deprive me of this immense joy. I know how much you gratify me in this regard, and I do not believe there are many to whom you would permit this. Set a deadline for its return. I will spend the sun and oil to see each detail. For this I owe to God alone, who through you, His instrument above all others, makes me more understanding of His word in many ways.</p>
      <p>The second thing is that you advise me not to despair of your coming to us. For you will be present when I least expected it. O how happy and thrice blessed I am, if only once I could enjoy, not to say be satisfied with, which I do not believe possible, your conversation. Our Matthäus from Brugg promised the same from your mouth, and although I would not dare to distrust him, I did not want to believe it entirely, and I will cease to doubt when I have joined your right hand.</p>
      <p>Our senate is sending a very wise man, Crispin Fischer, already, even before I received your letters, as an envoy. He will do whatever seems best. We also hope that Myconius will come to you, indeed also Vadian. If only the same rites and laws could be observed in matrimonial cases in our cities. We learn many wonderful things daily through experience, which Megander will easily discuss with you, as he is no small part of our censorial judgment. He brings what we have discussed, he brings the laws of Basel, Strasbourg, Constance, Ulm, Esslingen, so that from all these you may gather what you believe will benefit our country.</p>
      <p>I am now alone at home. Franz is at the spa. Our friendship is now closer than it once was. I am ashamed and regret that we have been so overwhelmed by emotions. I am ashamed to have troubled you so often with mine. But you will easily forgive, knowing that I am human.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellicanus. Urge him not to abandon the work he has begun, but to continue with the same success as hitherto. Greet all the others, Leo, Carolstadt, Theodor. Send and write what I eagerly await. Megander will handle all the rest. Do not reveal your coming to us to any mortal except your companion. You know, of course, my house, which I once inhabited at the time of our disputation. If you do not go directly there, you will offend me greatly. Do not go to Symler or to an inn: Let me be your host. Write how Megander has fared with you.</p>
      <p>June 8, in the year 33.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>Commend the little boy Madian to me.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
