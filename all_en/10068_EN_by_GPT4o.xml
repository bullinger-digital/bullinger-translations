      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father, etc.</p>
      <p>Revered and especially favorable, etc. Know that we are still doing well so far, though with unrest due to the current circumstances. I hope God will soon bring it to an end. I write to you out of special trust, which I always have in you. For you might also well know, as we are sitting on the border and in worry, and therefore our lords write to me from time to time to have concern and watchfulness about what our enemies are planning. I have now done this faithfully many times, and now I have sent a good, pious fellow, who is known to you and me, the bearer of this letter, to Lucerne; he has learned one thing and another, and brings something that, in my opinion, may be disadvantageous to the city of Bremgarten. And therefore I have sent him to you in good faith, so that you may bring him before the mayor in the presence of this letter, and he will tell you verbally what it is; you should believe him, so that you can protect yourself from future harm.</p>
      <p>I ask that you kindly receive this my writing and sending in the best way. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given at Kappel, on the Tuesday after Michaelmas 1531.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang, Abbot of the Monastery at Kappel.</p>
      <p>To the revered, highly learned, etc. Heinrich Bullinger, now preacher of the city of Bremgarten.</p>
