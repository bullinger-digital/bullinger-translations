      <p>When it first seemed to my Lord Jesus Christ to call me from Babylon to His kingdom, I had already intended to go straight to Z端rich. For I was invited by many things that a Christian man might desire among you, but most of all by your, Bullinger, excellent fame, which was very well known to me both through your most serious writings, which I had read with great pleasure, and through the judgments of good men, which I heard were being made throughout all of Italy. However, when I first came to the Rhaetians (Graub端nden), I encountered many things that hindered this plan and desire of mine. Yet, when I had somehow disentangled myself from these, so that I might finally fly to your meeting and embrace, behold, other obstacles arose on the journey itself, which led me off the path to St. Gallen. Thus, even then, I was not able to see you, to embrace you, and to converse with you about those things that pertain to the glory of God, which I greatly desired. But God knows how I always dwell with you in spirit. If I have not yet sent you any letters, it was because of the hope that daily flattered me and promised that I would soon see you and enjoy your most delightful presence. However, when I noticed that this desire of mine was being prolonged, I could bear it no longer, but wished to greet you with this letter of mine and to express my mind to you. I love you sincerely, I admire your excellent virtues, and I regard you and the gifts of God that shine in you for the glory of God and the benefit of the church.</p>
      <p>In return, I invite you to love me back, as a small member of the body of Christ, our Lord, because of whose name I endure this exile and the curses of the Antichrist; of which, however, I am neither regretful nor ashamed. For I know whom I have believed, as he said.</p>
      <p>I have thought of wintering here (if it seems good to the Lord) both because of the company of learned men who are here, and also because of the convenience of the printers, which I use for the benefit of my brothers who are in Italy, if only I can do something worthy of my person; for I know well how small my strengths are. And yet, as far as it is possible, I strive to adorn this ministry entrusted to me by Christ; whom I ask you, my brother Bullinger, to pray that what has begun through me may be brought to completion. As for the rest, I have good hope for the progress of the gospel. For you will see that the death of this pope will bring new things and those useful to the church. I have known all his thoughts; for I was one (alas for me) of his ministers. Nothing was more serious or troublesome to him than a general and free council, as he showed in reality. For as long as he lived, a free council was never to be hoped for, which now, whoever is created pope, I hope for; for both the emperors and kings are now weary. Therefore, they themselves greatly desire to see that council so long and so greatly sought by the whole race of mortals, so that some way and form of settling the dissensions of religion may be found, if not for the sake of religion itself, then at least for their own private advantages. Hence, I say again, that I have good hope.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my best brother, and greet for me those most excellent and learned men, Mr. Pellicanus, Mr. Gualtherus, Mr. Bibliander, Gesner, the most skilled physician, and Frisius and others, whom I ask again and again to remember me in their prayers to the Lord. The same does Coelius, my host in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, 13th day before the calends of January 1549.</p>
      <p>Pier Paolo Vergerio.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Z端rich, best brother. In Z端rich.</p>
      <p>Pier Paolo Vergerio, Bishop of Capodistria.</p>
