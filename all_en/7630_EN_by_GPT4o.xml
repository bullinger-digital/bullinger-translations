      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, most reverend sir, which you last sent to me, and from them I was partly filled with sorrow and partly with joy, and thus, disturbed and affected in various ways, I began my response.</p>
      <p>However, I was glad for this one reason, that from your letters I learned you are moderately strong, although in the meantime I am not unaware of how much you are tormented both in mind and body, being burdened with the various affairs of the whole world. May the Lord Jesus, whose cause you advocate, whose glory you uniquely seek, support you to the eternal honor of His name and preserve you unharmed for as long as possible. Amen, amen, amen. We all wonder where the prodigious insolence of these men will finally fall, who ought not to reject even the Turk, let alone a Christian envoy; but they rush to a more serious downfall, etc. You rightly advise not to trust this advisor too much; for listen, please, to what he has done. Twice since that time he has approached me and finally listed the names of some on a schedule, from whom I should also beware here as if they were plotters against my safety.</p>
      <p>While I do not completely disregard such things, I do not have faith in many; yet I know that many of those listed will rejoice in our destruction. Leaving that warning aside, he hinted that he would soon leave the royal fortress; for he could no longer endure the daily and nightly revelries by which the envoy and his household are corrupted. Moreover, he could no longer bear to hear the plots and schemes they devise against the faithful; therefore, he would soon depart. But listen to how he fled: On the eighth of this month, while in the fortress, he exchanged some words about religious matters with the stable master or master of the stables during dinner, and both were gravely offended and engaged in a fight, one seizing a trident fork, the other a dagger; but with the intervention of others, they both withdrew from arms. When everything seemed settled and the envoy had already gone to bed, that domestic fight miserably flared up again. With weapons taken up anew, the stable master was struck by that John of Besse with a dagger and expired. A witness told me he had never seen anyone more miserably wounded. The dagger, seeking a path from the right shoulder, exited through the left side; the sign was: repeat. After committing the murder, he fled from the fortress and escaped to an unknown place. They also affirm that before this murderer came here, he had stained himself with a more serious murder in Italy, having pierced his host and master and thrown his body into a sewer or secret place, and it is not far from the truth, as I have often gathered from his words, what great crimes he committed when he flourished, and with what ingenuity and skills, which he boasts of, he can achieve both in peace and war. He is also of a warlike stature and has a brazen forehead, and unless his great age and gray beard were an impediment, he might not lack even greater things. Since I remember that fugitive often wanted to know how long the most honorable envoy of Condé would stay in Zurich, when he would hasten his return to France, and once he instructed me to inquire this from you, I certainly (if he had fled to you) greatly fear that he might join with the envoy in some places and plot some evil against him. He wants to appear very loving and favorable to Condé; but I do not see what trust can be placed in robbers and murderers. The envoy recently promised that he would seek a soldier in due order (if the king commanded); but I hear nothing is being kept. For he sent his interpreter to the Upper League to solicit and incite; therefore, our consuls and senate today sent letters to Davos to warn them not to fail in restraining the envoy's petulance and rashness. You do not know how arrogantly the Upper allies, as neighbors and connected in place and spirit to the Urians and the Five Pagans, conduct themselves; for the highest judge in that League administers everything according to his own will and does not want to be advised by our people in any matter according to the old custom. The miserable common people are deluded and deceived; otherwise, it would not be allowed for those so fierce to exist.</p>
      <p>The same person imperiously delays the case of the Cellarius and does not allow anything to be decided in it before St. Martin's Day. But where the wretched Cellarius now wanders and what the most depraved monks devise daily, gather from the letters of our Lentulus, which I send under the condition that they be returned at a convenient time along with others I sent not long ago. However, among many, the situation has come to the point that now it is not about defeating the monks, but about expelling and deposing the ministers.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus shame those enemies of the fatherland and direct their own evils perpendicularly onto their heads. - Yesterday evening, Duke Herdlius returned from Salices to Bada, where he had long hidden and was said to have enlisted soldiers wherever he could.</p>
      <p>Since he is a citizen of Chur, it will happen that he will be prohibited from departure or will suffer the loss of the rights of the city. Unless they restrain him to terrify others, who does not see that our affairs are brought to imminent danger?</p>
      <p>Chur, 1568, October 12.</p>
      <p>Before I sealed these letters, I was summoned outside the walls. There, the envoy with his bodyguards, who returned from the Upper League, where contrary to the lords' decision he sought soldiers and now perhaps arranged for them to be led out; for they are in a hurry.</p>
      <p>The murder of John Besse was committed in Chur by the master of the stables of the royal envoy, October 1568.</p>
