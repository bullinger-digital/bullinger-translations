      <p>S. D. There are many reasons why I have not responded to your letter, most esteemed man and dearest brother in Christ, for such a long time, and why I have not even now decided to respond more diligently: especially because the conclusion of your letter was so bitter and combative that I could not see how (as I have long feared) I would have to engage with you if I proceeded to respond to it as it was written by you. However, I do not wish to contend with you: just as you finally incline to say: I prefer to bear you as a judge than to quarrel with you.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I do not even wish to be a judge: I leave the judgment to minds purged of stronger emotions and to our agreement, and I continue to love you in Christ. Other reasons also came into play.</p>
      <p>For I was writing my books against the Anabaptists when your letter was delivered to me, to which I was attached and adhered to around the middle of March. Then various ecclesiastical matters and many sermons to be delivered by me for that time followed. Then came the scholastic examination, from which we have not yet fully extricated ourselves.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I heard that you were struggling more dangerously with a chest illness, for which reason I also wanted to spare you. Meanwhile, I also wanted to observe what our antagonists were saying or doing, from which I might gather what fruit could be hoped for from a conversation, if indeed any fair one were to be instituted. But the longer I wait and examine everything, the less hope shines forth.</p>
      <p>For everywhere the Lutherans, both learned and common, rage against us and our doctrine, and indeed against you more vehemently than against the papists themselves, nor have they been able to appease them with so many writings. Pious and learned men testify, who write letters to us from many places in Germany, that they have long since abandoned all hope of concord, especially at this time, nor do they see what can be done conveniently, except that the matter be committed to the Lord, and that we persist in prayer and assert the truth without insult, taunts, and disputes, and await another opportunity which the Lord may provide, etc.</p>
      <p>This opinion is not disapproved by me, yet I fear that the Lord will show Himself to us at some time as He once showed Himself to the pastors of the church under the emperors Diocletian and Maximian, which Eusebius elaborates on at the beginning of book 8 of the Ecclesiastical History.</p>
      <p>In Friesland, after the death of the excellent man Martin Micronius, the Lutherans invaded the church of Norden and also some others, and they strive to reform them to their plainly crude Saxon rite, having abolished the holy and moderate rites which those churches have hitherto used not without fruit. They recently did the same in the dominion of Rychenville, where the venerable old man Matthias Erbius teaches, the prince of W端rttemberg, Zweibr端cken, and Hanau. The excellent prince of blessed memory, George, had commanded that nothing be changed in those churches; but now they are compelled to adopt the W端rttemberg or Brentian rite, which they wish to impose even on the unwilling people, despite the protests of most pastors. A booklet has been published by them, in which they urge not a few absurdities, and they specifically condemn the Zwinglians. The prince of W端rttemberg is otherwise fervent in this matter, whom almost all others respect and follow. Not long ago, he dismissed the very learned man Thomas Neageorgus because a poem about the supper was attached to his antichristian kingdom; however, I do not know whether he has received him back into favor again; for he has written nothing more within a month. The prince's preacher, Johannes Andreae, recently published a German book in which he refutes the calendar of a certain rascal, etc. In it, he explicitly admits that he holds to Luther's doctrine of the supper and that no concord can be hoped for unless we simply believe in the omnipotent word of God and, omitting interpretations, accept "This is my body." Some things have indeed been done with the Zwinglians concerning concord, but with the hope that they should concede to the Lutherans.</p>
      <p>These and other things have now been written by one who is numbered among the best, and about whom some have expected something, I do not know what. In Augsburg, the ubiquity of the body of Christ is contended for so impotently that it cannot be more vehemently even in the very cities of Saxony, which are most crude, and even against Philip himself. Those who contradict them and wish to preserve the properties of the natures are called heretics, who, with Nestorius, divide and tear apart the person of Christ.</p>
      <p>In Heidelberg, the prince dismissed Wilhelm Klebizius of Brandenburg because he had come into contention with Tilmann Hesshus, who you will understand from this booklet, which I have taken care to translate from German into Latin for your sake, what kind of confession he has published or made public concerning this sacramental matter. What kind of man this Tilmann is, such are all the other Lutherans, and I wish some were not cruder and more vehement. Since Tilmann was also dismissed by the prince, not indeed because of his inept doctrine of the supper but because of the man's bitterness, etc., envoys are now being sent to the prince, who beseech him in the name of the other Protestant princes to beware of the new Zwinglian and Calvinian doctrine, etc. Nor do I know if the noble counts of Erbach promise themselves as much as they once did when the matter was not more closely inspected. For as the learned Lutherans plainly rage and yield no place to fair reasoning, so most princes insist that peace will be if the Augsburg Confession is retained, but Zwinglianism and Calvinism are avoided, which the emperor with other orders of the empire cannot even bear to hear, etc. What was done before, I have previously explained: all of which have moved and move me not to think that any fair conversation should be given, or if any is given, that little fruit will return to us from it, but much inconvenience and harm. For the outcome of things and the innumerable things that have been done and are being done compel me to fear.</p>
      <p>Therefore, take it in good part, my Calvin, if I freely write what I and others also feel and express it to you as a friend. You indeed promise yourself and us very much, which, however, those who know the antagonists better believe we wish for rather than achieve, etc.</p>
      <p>You now also propose some points on which you hope concord can be established between us: which I indeed fear will not be accepted by them at all. Among them are some about which we have long warned that they are of such a kind that they cannot be accepted by us at all. Of this kind is that incomprehensible mode, the miracle in the supper, and what pertains to the word substantially. You indeed explain them so that they seem tolerable: but it is more expedient if we omit new words in composing controversies, so that there is no need for a more laborious explanation. You also rightly write: Guilt is not ascribed to reception, nor is it read anywhere, nor is it reasonable that it should lead to damnation for anyone to receive Christ, but those who reject him are damned, etc. However, you will not persuade the cruder Lutherans of this so that even Jacob Andreae, whose modesty seems remarkable to many, will not accept it. For he contends that Christ is truly received by the impious but to judgment, etc.</p>
      <p>Which he has now repeated again in his German book, which I mentioned a little earlier. I have never simply rejected all conversations, which you will understand if you more correctly weigh what I have written to you both now and in the past. I beg you, my brother, let us not contend about things that are nowhere yet and do not seem likely to be for the wise. But let us love each other mutually and continue in that in which we have rightly agreed, awaiting the Lord's help, who will never forsake those who call upon Him and walk rightly. Very sad reports are coming from France about the sedition that has arisen and the horrible persecution of the faithful. We pray the Lord to have mercy on His church.</p>
      <p>Indeed, you or our Beza would do a most pleasing thing if you would write to us briefly about the truth and the whole matter as it stands, so that we can respond to those who turn everything and twist it to the envy of the gospel. There are those who openly assert that those seditious plans were born in Geneva.</p>
      <p>But I contend that a clear injustice is being done to the preachers. For you wrote once and again that there are those who bear tyranny more impatiently, but you advise that nothing be attempted with armed force, etc. Our Beza also wrote the same, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest brother, and commend us to God in your prayers. All the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet all the fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 28, 1560. I write nothing about English and Scottish affairs, as I know you are more accurately informed about all those things. Your Bullinger.</p>
