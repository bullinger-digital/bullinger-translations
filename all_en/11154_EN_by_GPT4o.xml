    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter and shared it, as well as Pellican's, with his fellow believers; thanks for Zwingli's [Fidei expositio]. Appreciates Bullinger's work for the cause of the Reformation, especially the publications, among which he knows and loves the booklet "De prophetae officio," the commentary on the Acts of the Apostles, the work "De testamento seu foedere...," the epistle commentaries, and the "Assertio utriusque in Christo naturae." Dares to write so unpolished only because he has learned of the kindness [of the people of Zurich] from their writings. Wishes to read the work of Zwingli on the providence of God mentioned by Bibliander in the preface to the edition of the letters of Oecolampadius and Zwingli; already owns several works of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Regrets that his letter sent to Bucer did not reach Zurich; will look for a reliable connection. The letters of Bullinger and Pellican, as well as the [Fidei expositio], were delivered to him from Wittenberg by his brother-in-law [Tobias Engler]. This letter will be brought via Nuremberg to Frankfurt; Froschauer is to deliver it to Bullinger. Greetings from the fellow believers in Bohemia, Silesia, and Lusatia.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocent life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, dearest brother, last October, written in Zurich on the first of September of the previous year, in which you say that I have shown you a sincere heart and reported such things about the Bohemian brothers that greatly delighted your spirit. I do not wish to act as a herald of our joy, which we were filled with upon reading your letters. Through my scribe, I shared it and the letter of Mr. Konrad Pellican with many brothers.</p>
      <p>I do the same with the confession of Ulrich Zwingli, a man of holy memory, sent to me as a gift, for which I give many thanks.</p>
      <p>I clearly recognize from this letter your truly vigilant, sincere, fervent, and tireless spirit in promoting the glory of Christ. Indeed, I perceive it more deeply from your most pious commentaries, which you have issued for the benefit of the Christian republic, not without heavenly revelation. I first became acquainted with your name from the booklet "On the Office of the Prophet," and soon you sent me as a gift the Commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles. I have truly obtained your golden booklet "On the Testament or the Sole and Eternal Covenant of God," as well as commentaries on the Epistles to the Romans, both to the Corinthians, to the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, to the Thessalonians, Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, to the Hebrews, on the Epistles of Saint Peter, and also your Orthodox Assertion of both natures in Christ, both divine and human, etc. All these will not leave this little house as long as I breathe. I give immortal thanks to our God, who has deigned to make His most sacred scripture clear to us through your labors.</p>
      <p>I do not think it necessary to respond to all the points in your letter, and I would certainly be very hesitant to send my unpolished and utterly barbaric letters to such great men, were it not for your utmost piety, which I have known for several years from your writings, dispelling this fear of writing to you.</p>
      <p>There is mention of a certain booklet on the providence of God by Ulrich Zwingli in the preface, which Theodor Bibliander prefixed to four books, in which are contained the truly divine letters of Johannes Oecolampadius and Ulrich Zwingli, which I wish I could read. I have many other works written by those most learned men, the booklet "On the Genuine Interpretation of the Words of the Lord: This is My Body," one and another to Pirckheimer, on Job, and many others, the Friendly Exegesis, On True and False Religion, moreover on Isaiah, Jeremiah, the Bern Disputation, the response to Luther's confession in German.</p>
      <p>It troubles me that my letters, which I sent to Martin Bucer, did not reach you. We will think about a way for a reliable messenger to come to Zurich, for it is not safe to entrust letters to uncertain people in such a distant region.</p>
      <p>Your letter and Pellican's, along with the confession, were sent to me by my brother-in-law, who is now in Wittenberg, without any added letters. Everything, however, was beautifully sealed. I have already written twice to my relative, asking him to at least indicate from whom he received the letters, as a response is needed. I could obtain nothing. I handed these letters to one of our brothers here, to be carried to Nuremberg, who promised in good faith to ensure that they reach Frankfurt through his father-in-law; for this brother, a surgeon of this city, married a wife in Nuremberg, although he was born here. I also wrote in German to Christoph Froschauer, to deliver the letters to you. I beg you, forgive my rusticity.</p>
      <p>The pious brothers from Bohemia, Silesia, and Lusatia greet you. We earnestly ask to be counted among your brothers. Pray to God for us. Farewell in Christ Jesus, the Savior of all, with all your churches. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Zittau, on the 12th day of the month of March in the year 1538. Yours in the Lord, Oswald Pergener, scribe, etc., and of the brothers.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, at Zurich, the esteemed ecclesiastic and dearest brother.</p>
