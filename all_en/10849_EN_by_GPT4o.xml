    <p xml:id="regest1">As the matter concerning the nine exiled individuals from Solothurn will be discussed again in Büren, the envoys of the reformed regions should coordinate to ensure that the admission of the evangelical faith is achieved in Solothurn, as was promised to the Reformed [after the uprising in November 1533] in Wiedlisbach. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother, as for the matter of the nine men against those of Solothurn, I think you are well aware of it. However, since people will come together again in Büren regarding this matter, it will be necessary not to neglect God's cause and His holy word and not to act solely for temporal matters (as some are inclined), for such could have been accomplished two years ago. For we know that if the envoys agree, especially Zurich as the leading place, and insist firmly, something will be achieved, although the matter may seem difficult: we must persevere. The matter of the nine men is not only theirs but of all those who love God, who then, over fifteen hundred women and men, await with great desire the liberation from Babylonian captivity and the joyful, gracious message of the gospel. We may (are allowed to) burden ourselves with God in matters of faith; for this was promised to the pious people in the presence of the envoys in Wiedlisbach, to act in faith. What would be accomplished if nothing but temporal matters were negotiated? I would not desire the reward that the Lord would give us for it if we were to neglect His matters. And even if nothing could be achieved in matters of faith, it would still be better for us before God and all the pious to make an effort in this matter and commend it to the Lord. Dear lord, I ask you, as you are also inclined, to have the matters in true command and to expect the reward from our dear God, to whom I commend you from the heart.</p>
      <p>Greet for me Master Löwen, Pellicanus, Theodorus, and my lords of Wettingen and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, the 29th of April in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Jacob Meyer.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my dear lord and brotherly friend.</p>
