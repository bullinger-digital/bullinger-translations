      <p>Dearest lord and brother, with a troubled heart and great pain, I inform you of the great and terrifying fall that has befallen my poor people of Constance. To avoid writing too much, I am sending you herewith the letters of my dear Funckli, which he sent to me on Friday evening. From these, you can well understand how all matters stand. May God have mercy on the great misery and preserve a remnant and us under the same.</p>
      <p>I write in the utmost haste; for I have much to write now, especially to Constance and Strasbourg, from where Bucer has written to me; if I have time, I will copy and send it to you.</p>
      <p>I kindly and brotherly ask you, if possible, to let me have a correct and complete copy of the response that the emperor sent to the Confederates concerning Constance; it should be read by no one but my dear brother; they are requested.</p>
      <p>So you know in the highest trust that exists between us, that the [abbot of Kreuzlingen] advised my lords not to delay too long with the Confederates' envoys, but to conclude, as Weingarten and Mainau (for he was with them in Mainau), and they should also send to the Confederates or offer them that they want to do so, with a request that they want to handle it amicably after the conclusion. Therefore, on this advice, my lords have sent to your lords. Whether the [abbot] does this with the advice of some of the Confederates or on his own, I cannot know; but it seems to me that much depends on him.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he has consistently advised that all articles be accepted and approved, and not to rely too much on the Confederates' actions; there is an old saying: whoever the Confederates have ever helped, is better off beforehand.</p>
      <p>What may be understood from this, I leave to you and others to judge. Furthermore, my lords now need a negotiator; he has ridden to [Weingarten] with the [decision] and [instruction]. What kind of practices these are will eventually come to light. All the Confederates (or at least the evangelical ones) should well see that they are looking out for themselves. It seems to me great and dangerous things, of which I am credibly informed by pious people who come to me, whom I can well trust.</p>
      <p>Dear, let me know exactly what Sophoy has recruited, also what is being negotiated on this day; for I should know and experience it exactly and send it to a good friend in WÃ¼rttemberg by a special messenger, namely to Hans Caspar von Anwyl; he has asked me very much.</p>
      <p>I do not know what to do or write, so full of discontent am I, that everything stands very badly and dangerously with us; I remember how sincerely good some people meant the matters years ago, who undoubtedly foresaw the misery and would have gladly acted through all kinds of means to prevent such and maintain good neighborliness, but then one did not want to believe or adapt to it, but placed great mistrust in some. Now, unfortunately, it has come to the point that I hear, in the city, hardly anyone dares to speak a good word about the Confederates.</p>
      <p>The gate towards Thurgau has been strongly occupied, and the fishermen and some with them have been offered the council, they want to have this, have also gone around it, have inspected it, whether it is secured in this way.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Schertlin's servant, when he let it be known that there was still help available, had to be put in the tower. Likewise, another has also come; he was also quickly dismissed.</p>
      <p>In summary: all those who are happy about the Interim and the priests are the worst Confederates. Thus the Confederates receive the reward; they have moved the common man to approve the Interim and the priests' income; now they become their greatest enemies. Some in Constance now do not want any fair at all, have wanted to close the gates to everything, so that I truly worry that the people, who are all very contrary, will still insist on bringing in foreign people. May God protect poor Thurgau and give others the grace to become sensible! Oh my lord and dearest brother, praying to God especially with trust for my dear brother and cousin Conrad Zwick, that they do not stay too long, but that the dear God may lead them out at the right time; they are truly in great danger, especially also the dear cousin concerning [military equipment], of which you know.</p>
      <p>I admonish them both daily not to delay too long. So my dear brother, while he is now a sworn bailiff of the empire, should not leave his office until he can come out with better fortune. So my dear cousin worries, if he goes out in the current ban, before Constance comes out of the ban, he will be safe nowhere; therefore I am extremely anxious for both of them.</p>
      <p>I firmly believe that they will not be included in the first treaty, especially not the cousin, so that they remain; but then they will be stretched. For when the bishop of Aris comforted my dear brother, he only mentioned me and not the cousin at all; undoubtedly, in my opinion, so that he does not foresee special disgrace and can be caught all the better, which would truly be a great common harm and particularly a heartfelt sorrow for me. Therefore, praying to God truly, that he may reveal his will to them, so that they may be preserved for his praise and for the good of many others. Sending your house many good wishes from me for all good and greet all good lords and brothers. My heart-beloved sister sends you many good wishes and greetings, desiring your prayers.</p>
      <p>Given in utmost haste at Griesenberg, 16th September 1548.</p>
      <p>You know me well.</p>
      <p>I am very surprised, since the pope has such a displeasure with the Interim, that his dear children, the 7 places, have encouraged my lords to approve it.</p>
      <p>Send back other letters.</p>
      <p>Greet our Butler and Hopper, truly angelic Englishmen, very respectfully in my words.</p>
      <p>Write back, I beg you, through this same messenger, if you can, unless perhaps it is necessary for him to return directly to Constance quickly by your command.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
