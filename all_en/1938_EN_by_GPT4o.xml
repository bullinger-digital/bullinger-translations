      <p>God protect us from all evil, on the 23rd of July in the year 1553, in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>My friendly greetings, venerable, highly and well-learned sir. After I was with you on the 20th of July, you instructed me to deliver a letter to the abbot. Therefore, wise sir, know that I met the Zurich messenger before Rickenbach, had a conversation and a meal with him, and he, the messenger, delivered the letter that belonged to me. So, on the 21st of July, I went to the monastery in St. Gallen, to the compline (evening prayer), as they call it, and wanted to see for myself if the abbot was present. When I saw him, I waited for him and went to him, bowed and knelt: I might have fallen over. So, when he understood me, I had to go with him to his room, and no one was present except his chamberlain. The abbot then closed the room and received me very well, I had to sit down with him and drink wine and water; in short, I was with him for about an hour and a half before he read the letter thoroughly; he did not want to let me leave. He wanted to give me an answer to your writing; because I told him I was from Zurich; you instructed me to give him the letter myself. Now, to be brief, when he had read the letter very carefully (as I believe, he read it twice), the abbot instructed me to write to you, he is always of the opinion and for a long time, that everyone should remain in their faith, and it would have been good if such a letter had been sent to him 3 years ago, when the 6 places (cantons) were in St. Gallen; but now it is too late. The abbot also said, you sent him a nice letter, and yet among other things, he said to me: the abbot believes, if those from Zurich knew that you were sending him such a letter, those from Zurich would not appreciate it. That is the worst thing he said to me. Therefore, wise sir, you can take from this what you consider good insight; in this I have followed your command in every way. But I believe, the abbot has ears and hears nothing and eyes and sees nothing; with that, I leave it. But when I come to you, I want to speak with you orally about how I spoke with him about other things. But as I wrote last, I fear it is all lost. May God Almighty come to the aid of the pious and good-hearted, if you want anything further that I should accomplish, you will find me willing in every way. My dear wife sends her greetings to you and your dear spouse. Greet Mr. Hans Friesen for me.</p>
      <p>With that, may God the Lord be entrusted forever. Amen. Your own servant Caspar HÃ¼sseli.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dear lord in Zurich.</p>
      <p>"Truth is invincible, therefore do not fear."</p>
