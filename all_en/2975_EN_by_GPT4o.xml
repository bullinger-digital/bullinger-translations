      <p>S. P. The reason I have written to you less frequently until now is that my affairs, which have been tossed by a remarkable storm, have been an impediment. At last, I have returned home safely, but my affairs are in such a precarious state that they worsen by the day. The advice and authority of pious and learned men like you are presently a useful and welcome familiarity, and now, in your absence, the memory of it is most delightful. Consider me, who has been affected by your many kindnesses, to be someone who may one day appear grateful to you, and let us not be deprived of mutual consolation and assistance in the meantime. For the weaker we are in what we greatly desire (namely, the freedom of evangelical worship), the stronger we are in preserving what you have long maintained, even at the risk of your life, so that you rightly apply stronger remedies to the weaker. I know with what ardor truth is defended by you. I pray that you never cease. I never fail to mention you in my prayers, and I ask that the same be done for us. I visited the Church of East Frisia. It is being propagated more and more each day by the grace of the Lord, and you will soon learn from a published writing what struggles it has faced and with what shame they have retreated.</p>
      <p>These are the news: the delegations of all the cities of the Lower Germany of the Emperor have convened in Brussels, and there is talk of appointing Maximilian as the governor of the Belgian Gaul in the name of King Philip of Spain, whom they affirm has been called to England to be crowned king. Meanwhile, the Countess of East Frisia, the Countess of Retburg, is causing some trouble; the controversy is about the boundaries of the fields. The Countess of Retburg has not used any force against people, but she has taken the usufruct by force.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant peace to His church and preserve you unharmed. Please convey my warmest greetings to your son-in-law, my old host, Theodor, Gwalter, and all the lords and brothers who know me. I will write more shortly, God willing.</p>
      <p>In Groningen, Frisia, in the year of salvation 1556, on the 4th day before the nones of August. Nikolaus von Starkenburg, yours.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
