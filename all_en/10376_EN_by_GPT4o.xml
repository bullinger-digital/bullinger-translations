    <p xml:id="regest1">He has already written about the prospects of restoring the "Secret Council" in Zurich. What he learned from the envoy of Basel, he shared with some Zurich councilors, who immediately sent out scouts; for until now, they had received no news about troop movements in Italy. The Abbot of Einsiedeln wants to expel Pastor Hans Keller of Weiningen for slandering the Mass and the peace of the land. The rest will be reported by a (?) "Scholasticus." On the question of whether Peter was in Rome or not, Bullinger relies more on the Church Fathers than on the conclusions of Ulricus Velenus; he did not want to commit himself in his commentary on the Epistles of Peter and does not consider the question important. Greetings. In prison, two suspects of treason, Hans Leemann and Jakob Graf, are being interrogated.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Regarding the establishment of a secret council here, I have already informed you in previous letters through Christoph Froschauer, having discussed more in person with the most modest and pious man you sent. I communicated his instructions to some of the leading figures of our city. They immediately sent scouts, including Uria and others, to inquire about the Italian army. For neither the people of St. Gallen nor others, who are daily involved with Italian goods and customs, have given any hint of this kind. In the meantime, we do not disregard friendly advice; indeed, we are grateful and further request that you point out other matters of this kind. We will do the same if there seems to be anything worth advising.</p>
      <p>The Abbot of Einsiedeln is now attacking Pastor Hans Keller of Weiningen, seeking to expel him because he seems to have spoken too harshly against the Mass and the recent peace agreement. The people are Gerold Meyer's children, the blood bailiff of Baden, the fief, and the lower court of the abbot. This perhaps began with the advice of some, namely the people of Schwyz, so that they might more conveniently harass us with war or legal action. The rest will be reported by a "Scholasticus."</p>
      <p>The matter of whether Peter saw Rome or not, I have treated without prejudice to anyone, but as a doubtful matter in which there is little utility if we consider the essence of piety, I have left it doubtful, so that each may hold their own opinion. Even today, I would trust the ancient monuments of the Church Fathers more, if I had to lean one way, than the conjectures of Ulricus Velenus; nor will anyone compel me to swear by Velenus's words in this trivial matter. But why do I bother you with this? Read what I have written, and you will find that I have written nothing to the prejudice of others.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother, together with our most beloved father, to whom good men give many thanks for his remarkable diligence on our behalf.</p>
      <p>Last day of March 1534.</p>
      <p>We have two birds in prison for treason. We still do not know what they will sing; today they have been thoroughly interrogated, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, dearest brother and most esteemed lord.</p>
