      <p>Greetings. The favorable reports you recently recited about the royal power being handed over to the King of Navarre, I fear, may not be true. This I know for certain: the magnates of France are entirely committed to overthrowing the gospel.</p>
      <p>In this matter, envoys have been sent to the Pope, to the Spaniard, and to the Emperor. There is consultation about holding a council with the aim of oppressing the good under the pretext of it, and there are those who say that Constance should be the place for the council. But why? So that the Swiss may be engaged, and with them defeated, they think it will be easy to suppress some of the German princes, and thereafter, the faithful enclosed in France can be oppressed without any trouble, so that thereafter even England may be subdued... There is no doubt that our allies are in disem spyl das obermänly sin. Therefore, I would not want disturbances to be stirred up among you now, lest on this occasion an embassy be sent to you by them, like the one sent to the [Valois], not to settle disputes, but to pour cold water, and since they secretly handle and introduce plans everywhere, it would not be new if they were to practice among you as well.</p>
      <p>May the Lord turn and avert all things for the good, lest the greed of the evangelicals restore the papacy.</p>
      <p>But it is wretched for evangelicals to be cast out by evangelicals.</p>
      <p>Zürich, 22nd August 1560.</p>
