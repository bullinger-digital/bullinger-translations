      <p>Revered, highly learned, especially gracious, dear sir, you and all yours are my diligent, friendly, and willing service at all times ready beforehand. I have received your letter along with the package of several letters belonging to Poland some time ago, and have delivered them to Mr. former mayor Caspar Schlumpf with a request, since he has a brother residing in Nuremberg and trading in Krakow and Poland, that he would send the mentioned package to his brother and ensure that it is delivered in Poland, and if the gentlemen there wish to respond or otherwise write to you or those with you, to serve you, that they would do so under the name of his brother Gallus Schlumpf, who is recognized everywhere; he would then send it to Mr. former mayor or to me. Mr. former mayor has accepted this with special gracious and inclined will and has offered to carry out this matter according to your request as faithfully as possible.</p>
      <p>And indeed, I should have long since informed you of what I have handled on your behalf (to whom I am eager and obliged to serve in more ways, if I could), if I had not been waiting for a response from Nuremberg and, indeed, had not known who was traveling to you at this time. Therefore, I kindly ask you to understand this delay in the best way; for I am so burdened with special and common affairs that it is not possible for me to accomplish everything I would like, especially since for some time I have not been strong and have been unable to manage my service properly.</p>
      <p>However, Mr. former mayor has informed me that his aforementioned brother has written to him. That he has certainly delivered the letters in Poland and they have been answered there, and whenever he receives writing or anything else, he is entirely willing to send it and serve you in such a manner. Therefore, you should be without doubt that whatever you send to this man or he receives on your behalf, he will handle it with all diligence and faithfulness.</p>
      <p>Therefore, gracious sir, my dear father and I have each received the little book you wrote against Mr. Brentz, each signed with your own hand. For which we both thank you most diligently and offer our humble abilities in return. And although the gift from you has greatly delighted me, I regret that in these dangerous and more than restless and troubled times, such disputes, which have been unknown to many until now, indeed undoubtedly, should stir up even more unrest among us and among our adversaries, suspicious of conflicting doctrines, which could well have been spared (unless otherwise the vile obstinacy and the constant attacks of the wretched Satan, the lord of all discord, possess such haughty hearts). But offenses must come and heresies be among us, so that the truth and the faithful may be tested.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God graciously abolish such and other erroneous doctrines and destroy them with the spirit of peace and unity, and preserve His church and the faithful in pure doctrine and peaceful mind through Jesus Christ, His dear Son, the Prince of Peace, to eternal rest. Amen. May He fatherly protect you and yours, who are with you in the service of Christ, for His praise and the increase and improvement of His church, and keep you in good health.</p>
      <p>And I ask you to convey my friendly greetings and service to your fellow workers and other learned and known gentlemen and friends on my behalf, whom I hereby commend to the grace of God. Dated Wednesday, the 1st of April, in the year 1562.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Josua Ke√üler.</p>
