    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enclosed is a quickly transcribed news dispatch. Why does Myconius not let anything be heard from him anymore? Bullinger would expect more frequent letters from him, especially since he himself writes to him very often!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The letter submitted by Emperor Charles V for the Baden Diet [to all places on December 27, 1546] can be viewed by the people of Basel at their city clerk [Heinrich Ryhiner]. Despite its flattering content, this letter is not to be believed!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] There is now a dispute because the Five Places demand the punishment of Rudolf Gwalther for his "Endtchrist".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] King Francis I of France has stationed 8,000 Italians in Piedmont and 14,000 Frenchmen in Gascony on the Spanish border. Before March 1, he wants to have 8,000 to 15,000 Swiss in armor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings to Francisco de Enzinas. Has Johannes Gast received the money for the wool? The content of the present letter is also intended for Enzinas and Gast. Greetings to Nikolaus Episcopius and Johannes Herwagen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Myconius is to deliver the enclosed letter along with the ten crowns to Josias Simler.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [Enclosure:] News [from the Constance Council], January 9: The Constance envoy [Ludwig Kürnstaller] has returned from Ulm. The Ulm council deputies explained to him and all other envoys of the [upperland] cities why they decided to make peace with the Emperor and under what conditions this happened.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The people of Ulm were ordered to denounce the Schmalkaldic League and not to join any alliance in which the Emperor and King Ferdinand I are not also involved.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] They were also obliged to return their war booty.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] From now on, they have to submit to the Imperial Chamber Court.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] They must also dismiss the mercenaries they had recruited.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Finally, they were imposed a due but moderate fine.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] When their envoys [Georg Besserer and Jos Weickmann] wanted to ask the Emperor to retain their rights and religion, the imperial councilors said that they did not need to mention the religious question before the Emperor, as the war had not been fought for that reason. The Emperor would leave them, like Duke Maurice of Saxony, the Margraves of Brandenburg, Duke Eric of Brunswick, and others, with their religion, privileges, and customs. He had indeed changed his mind. However, the people of Ulm could not obtain a written guarantee in this regard. The imperial councilors (not the Emperor) declared themselves willing to confirm the reconciliation of the city with an official document.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] The people of Ulm claim that in their reconciliation with the Emperor, they were careful not to give up their religion, but they were also not forced to submit to the Emperor, to make a submission, and to acknowledge that they had unlawfully gone to war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] In Ulm, [Ludwig Kürnstaller] did not commit to anything but took the points he learned for discussion in the Great Council and the citizenry back to Constance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] The envoys from Lindau, Ravensburg, and Isny did the same. However, Memmingen, Biberach, and Kempten had authorized their envoys to submit to the Emperor like Ulm. In the meantime, this has probably already happened.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] This is, in short, what the envoys in Ulm were able to learn about the reconciliation of this city with the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] News [from Georg Frölich] from Augsburg, January 9: The people of Ulm not only left the [Schmalkaldic] League without being forced to do so, but they are now also seducing other cities to take this step to stand better themselves. They even claim that the people of Augsburg had incited them to do so, which is really not true!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] Georg Frölich learned by letter from the people of Memmingen that they already regret their submission.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">[20] Landgrave Philip of Hesse has fortified his fortresses for the war. He wrote that he had heard that Augsburg also wanted to reconcile with the Emperor. The people of Augsburg replied to him that, on the contrary, they intended to remain loyal. The people of Strasbourg admonished the people of Augsburg by letter to remain steadfast as long as they can defend themselves in an emergency.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">[21] It is repeatedly claimed that the Emperor is dead and his councilors are playing theater with his corpse.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">[22] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony has recaptured his land and driven Duke Maurice of Saxony to Bohemia. The Elector has occupied Leipzig and other cities. He has besieged Langensalza.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest23">[23] News [from Ambrosius Blarer] from Constance, January 17: It is repeatedly told that the Emperor is dead and that his councilors are deceiving people with an image of his corpse. The envoys of the cities that have surrendered never saw the Emperor personally. Others spoke in his place. The envoys were only shown a curtain behind which he was supposed to be. However, no sound was heard from there!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest24">[24] Duke Ulrich of Württemberg has also defected. Under what conditions is unknown. It is certain that [Fernando Álvarez de Toledo], Duke of Alba, even after the peace agreement, has occupied several localities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest25">[25] Ravensburg, Lindau, and Constance are urgently being pushed towards peace. Otherwise, the Emperor, who will soon come to Ulm, will march against them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest26">[26] Submission to the Imperial Chamber Court is problematic because it reintroduces idolatry and a swarm of priests.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest27">[27] The small towns, especially Isny in the Allgäu, would have liked to act differently. However, they are still always ready to sacrifice their lives if something is undertaken against God's word.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest28">[28] Allegedly, Duke Ulrich already regrets his hasty peace with the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest29">[29] [Addition by Bullinger's hand:] The submission of Ulm to the Emperor was absolutely voluntary, as can be seen from the present enclosure.</p>

      <p>Dear Sir. What I have, I have had transcribed for you in the utmost haste. I cannot wonder enough that you do not write to me at all. I must say that you are not as eager as I would like to see, and I thought you should do so, since I write to you so often, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>On the day in Baden, the Emperor submitted a letter. You can obtain it from your city clerk. It is smooth, but I do not trust the matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Five Places demand that my lord Gwalther be punished because of the "Endtchrist". It will be a fuss, but let it be.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The French have stationed 8,000 Italians in Piedmont, 14,000 of their people in Spain in Gascony. They demand armor from 8,000 to 15,000 Swiss before March 1.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Greetings to Dryander. I wonder if Gast has received the money for the wool that I sent him. This is shared with them. Greetings to Episcopius, Hervagius, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Deliver these 10 crowns and the letter to Josias Simler for me. Dated January 18, 1547, after 3 in the afternoon.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>January 9 from Constance: Our envoy has returned home. Together with other envoys from the cities, the appointed ones from the council in Ulm explained what caused them to make peace and with what decision they reconciled with the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>They were to renounce the Schmalkaldic League and not enter into any alliance in which the Emperor and King were not also included.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Everything taken in war and still present should be returned to those from whom it was taken.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>They should remain with the Imperial Chamber Court, which might be established in the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>They should dismiss the soldiers stationed with them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>They should pay a reasonable, gracious fine.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>When the envoys from Ulm asked the Emperor to remain with their rights and religion as they currently have, the imperial councilors told them with explicit words that they should not think of the Emperor's religion, as the war was not started because of it. However, the imperial councilors assured them that the Emperor would graciously allow them to remain with their current religion, like Duke Maurice, the Margraves of Brandenburg, Duke Eric of Brunswick, and others of the same kind, and would not drive them away with force, as His Majesty is of a different mind than before. When the envoys from Ulm requested assurance of this agreement, it was denied to them, but they were granted a notification and absolution and mandates, but only from the councilors.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Although the people of Ulm were careful to establish the homage on some articles of religion and other matters, they nevertheless submitted themselves absolutely freely to the Emperor's grace, made the footfall, and acknowledged that they had acted unlawfully with the war preparations and had been partly misled and erred, with the most humble request that His Majesty would graciously reconcile them, let them remain with their rights, be their gracious lord, and take them under his gracious protection and shield.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Our envoy did not commit further but took the articles to bring back to us so that we could deliberate with our great council and the community.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>The envoys from Lindau, Ravensburg, and Isny acted similarly. However, Memmingen, Biberach, and Kempten instructed their envoys to submit to the Emperor like Ulm, which, as to be expected, has now happened.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>This is, in summary, the report of the proceedings that the envoys of the cities received and made on the day in Ulm regarding the reconciliation of Ulm with the Emperor, which we did not want to leave unreported to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>From Augsburg, January 9: The people of Ulm are not satisfied with having left the league without necessity, but they are now also persuading other cities with vain persuasions to join their side to beautify themselves. They also speak of us, as if we were guilty of the separation, which cannot be found in eternity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>From Memmingen, I have written, from which I understand well that they regret the jest. For they would have gladly turned their envoys back if it were not too late.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>The Landgrave has occupied his strong places. He hopes to keep them. He has also written to Augsburg, saying he has been informed that they also want to reconcile, etc. To which they replied that they intend to remain loyal and true. Strasbourg has also written and admonished to remain and not to submit, as long as one can in case of need.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21">
      <p>It is repeatedly held that the Emperor is dead, and his councilors are playing the monkey game with the corpse. Much is wagered on it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>The Elector has recaptured his land and driven Duke Maurice out of his own into Bohemia. He has Leipzig and other cities. He has won Salza, the city, with the storm.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div23" corresp="regest23">
      <p>From Constance, January 17: It is repeatedly said to be certain that the Emperor is dead, and his lords are conducting their adventure with the simulacrum. The envoys of the cities have never seen him when they paid homage. But they were shown a curtain behind which he was supposed to be. But no one heard anything. Others spoke in the Emperor's name.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div24" corresp="regest24">
      <p>Württemberg is over. He has also accepted a peace. We do not know the conditions. Even after he kept the peace, Duke de Alba has demanded several places and towns.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div25" corresp="regest25">
      <p>Ravensburg, Lindau, and Constance are being strongly urged and warned to seek peace, or the Emperor will come to Ulm and then move against them. I do not know what will be done.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div26" corresp="regest26">
      <p>It is very difficult to submit to the Imperial Chamber Court, which will restore all idolatry and priestly swarms, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div27" corresp="regest27">
      <p>The small towns, especially Isny in the Allgäu, would have gladly done their best. They are still determined, if anything is demanded against God's word, to lose their lives over it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div28" corresp="regest28">
      <p>Württemberg is also said to wish he had not accepted peace so hastily. May God send it well!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div29" corresp="regest29">
      <p>Ulm has submitted absolutely freely to the Emperor, according to the following letter enclosed. January 19.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius or Mr. Johannes Gast, preachers in Basel.</p>
