    <p xml:id="regest1">Herbrot did not receive Bullinger's letter through Johannes Haller. In it, Bullinger thanked Herbrot for the kindness he showed to Haller and asked him to continue to care for Haller. Herbrot will gladly do this for Bullinger's sake alone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Herbrot was very pleased with Bullinger's letter and would also like to maintain this contact.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- In view of the annoying misunderstandings between the Zwinglians and Lutherans, Luther's death now gives hope for improvement.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Since Melanchthon, who had to suffer a lot under Luther, is a peace-loving person, it would be good if Bullinger and Ambrosius Blarer addressed a brotherly letter to him. Herbrot will also approach Blarer in this regard. It is expected that such letters will be beneficial to the church. As soon as Bullinger and Blarer have agreed on this, they should send their letters to Herbrot for forwarding.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- At the very beginning of their friendship, Herbrot wanted to share this wish, which arose from his zeal for the cause of God, with Bullinger. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Venerable, highly learned, whatever I can honor, love, and do good, is always at your service. Especially, kind sir and friend, I have received your letter, sent to me through my dear lord Johann Haller, in which you inform me that the aforementioned lord Haller has praised the kindness I have shown him, so that you thank me and desire that I continue to hold him in favor as before. I have read all the contents. Therefore, I kindly inform you, my gracious lord, that I have not shown much special friendship to the aforementioned lord Haller; it is also not worthy of thanks. However, he shall remain in my good favor, especially for your sake. You, my lord, should not doubt this.</p>

      <p>Especially, kind sir, I was very pleased with your letter, that you intend to make such an acquaintance with me without deserving it. I thank you kindly for this and am no less inclined to maintain good will with you, my lord, in the future.</p>

      <p>And since there have been various misunderstandings between our churches for some time, which have caused great offense not only among the opponents but also among our own, but since Martin Luther has been called by God from this time, I hope to God that matters will be directed towards a peaceful resolution. I would be mindful of making a start on this for your, my lord's, improvement.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Since Philipp Melanchthon is a dear and peace-loving man, who had to suffer much with Martin, and is truly inclined to promote the welfare of the church, would it not be good if you, together with lord Ambrosius Blarer, approached him with a brotherly letter, as you both, my lords, know how to do, I have no doubt. It would be beneficial for the common cause. I will also inform my lord and friend, Blarer, of this. I also hope he will not object to undertaking this with you, my lords, for I finally consider that through such a means many misunderstandings could be resolved and the church of God enriched. If you, both my lords, agree to this (which God with His grace will grant in one way or another), you can send me the letters; I will then ensure they reach the appropriate place.</p>

      <p>I should not have concealed this from your honor, my gracious lord, at the beginning of our friendship. For nothing should hinder me from promoting what I know to be God's cause. And I offer myself entirely to your, my lord's, service. The grace of the Lord be with us all.</p>
      <p>Acted in Augsburg, the 24th day of March, in the year 1546. Your honor's willing servant</p>
      <p>Jakob Herbrot, former mayor.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, etc., my especially trusted dear lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
