      <p>Holy Father Comander, being very busy, has now instructed me to write these few things. We heard with great sorrow from Tscherner that you have been seized by some fever or considerable pain; because of this, we did not want to be a burden to you. But when we learned that you have fully recovered, which we hope, we will write more, God willing, for there is much to write. Please do not be angry with our Pontisella for not coming to you as he said he would.</p>
      <p>For the commissioners and the school prefects prevailed upon him with their requests; indeed, relying on your kindness, we also advised him to stay here; we are in greater need of learned men than you are there. May the merciful God, through His Son, grant you to us and to the world, so that we may have you here for a long time as a teacher and father. Amen. Meanwhile, farewell in the Lord Jesus. From Chur, on the second day of January in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Comander and Philippus Gallicius. To the most illustrious man in piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
