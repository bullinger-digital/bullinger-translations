      <p>Greetings. I was not going to write to you this time, dearest brother, except that just now, at evening, letters were delivered to me from Beza in this sense: "On the evening of October 10th, I received letters from Mr. Admiral, which indicated that the conspiracy of the Guise family had been uncovered, who hoped to capture the king in Paris, whom they had not intended to release until they had accomplished everything according to their own will.</p>
      <p>Their plan was thwarted by the queen's health and the king's return from the city.</p>
      <p>It is added that even with the conspiracy uncovered, they do not desist; but there is good hope that they will achieve nothing but their own ruin.</p>
      <p>The Admiral himself is gathering his forces in turn and commends himself to the prayers of the churches, and indeed he is worthy, whom all the pious should commend to God in their prayers.</p>
      <p>Whatever we hear, I will immediately write to you.</p>
      <p>I wrote this in great haste, as the courier was in a hurry." These are Beza's words verbatim.</p>
      <p>However, I would like you to keep these things to yourself for now, do not spread them, until we hear more certain news.</p>
      <p>I am very anxious, as I hear from Wallis that in Sion a certain captain's attempt was also uncovered, who wanted to introduce foreign musketeers into the valley, with whom the malevolent would have joined, you understand, in what situation the affairs of the faithful would have been.</p>
      <p>With the crime uncovered, the captain escaped by flight; the others are indignant.</p>
      <p>It is to be feared that someone might be moved to action from there. Let us pray to the Lord, that He may watch over us and keep us from evil.</p>
      <p>I write this in haste as well.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Today and this week I have received nothing from you. Again and again, farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, at evening, October 22, 1563. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my most esteemed and dearest lord.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
