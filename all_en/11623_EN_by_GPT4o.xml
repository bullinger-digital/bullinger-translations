    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter [No. 1577] in difficult times; the plague is raging more fiercely and claiming more victims daily. [Ruprecht von Mosham] spoke out [in Strasbourg] against Zwingli, especially against his doctrine of the Lord's Supper; may Christ free him from the power of Satan. Sends documents of the Regensburg Diet from Martin Bucer with a request for return; Bucer has only sent part of another publication. Wolfgang Capito seems to be succumbing to the plague soon. Blarer asks for intercession in the face of the danger of death; greetings; his sister Margaretha is exemplary as an archdeaconess in the community and cares for the sick.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>I received your letters with great longing, my always venerable Bullinger, especially in these calamitous times, when we are being informed of the deaths of others one after another. For now, more than ever before, I am concerned about the well-being of my friends, or rather the pillars of Christ's church, lest they be taken from us at an inopportune time. By an inopportune time, I mean not their own, but ours and the church's, which now most needs their work. May the Lord open some hope for us from somewhere of better fruit for us and our posterity!</p>
      <p>Here, the plague is no less severe than it was recently, but it appears even more aggravated. In the past week, we lost 13 adults and as many children; the week before that, 15 children and six adults; and tomorrow morning, the number will be reported to me, which, however, is conjectured to surpass the previous ones. Some of the best brothers and sisters are being taken away, whose presence beautifully adorns the heavens, and whose absence miserably darkens this church on earth; for they wonderfully illuminated it like shining stars, so that if the Lord wishes to continue in this way, it would be pointless to live, but rather it would be desirable to be immediately clothed with that robe of blessed immortality of heavenly joys with them.</p>
      <p>Regarding our dean of Passau, I will add nothing to what I said before, except that I have received from trustworthy sources that he spoke very harshly against Zwingli somewhere, especially on the matter of the Eucharist, and yet he seems to relent somewhat from these blasphemies among those whom he understands to be somewhat less favorable to Luther.</p>
      <p>Let us diligently pray to the Lord for him and all others of such distinguished talents, who are led by unhealthy passions, as much as we can, so that they may timely return to the path and not bring certain danger to themselves or their brothers with this insolence. This man is truly detained, as much as he is not devoid of the fear of God, by Satan, since nothing is more serious and more characteristic of Satan's work than to so horrendously blaspheme the doctrine of Christ, whom may he free as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>I am sending to you the acts of the Regensburg Diet, which I have now received from Bucer, which, however, as soon as you have found a messenger, after you have read them hastily, you will return in good faith. No one here has seen them yet, and I have not yet read them all; for I wanted to gladly gratify you in this matter. Bucer also sent 12 gatherings of conciliatory and non-conciliatory articles, an incomplete work, intending to send the remaining part soon, which is still sweating under the press. You will also receive them when they have been fully given to me; they are all very poorly printed, which Bucer himself complains about greatly.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, Capito is also so horrendously afflicted with this disease that he is not thought to be able to overcome it, a man besides singular learning, plainly sincere and pious.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my esteemed and most delightful brother in the Lord. See to it that you make the most fervent prayers for me and mine, and indeed for the cause of our entire church, so that, perfectly confirmed in him and secure in all things, we may happily fly from here to the heavens. Those who endure death among us with such constancy of faith in the Lord's will certainly make it so that all who are somewhat more sensible wish to follow them as soon as possible and are thoroughly encouraged to a better life, which I also gratefully understood from your letters about yours. May Christ the Savior preserve you all, the most faithful ministers of his gospel, with robust bodies and cheerful spirits for as long as possible. In him, farewell again and again, my heart. Commend me to the best and most illustrious men Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Megander, and the rest of your ministers, to whom diligently add your consul, the excellent man RÃ¶sti. My brother, with both Zwickys and my wife, along with Margaretha, my excellent sister, who now acts as the archdeaconess of our church, send you the most abundant greetings; she is so much in danger of her life and everything. She visits daily those public houses where those common servants and maids and such people afflicted with the plague are cared for, and she does so with a truly brave and noble spirit, and she now has at home a girl, whom she has cared for for about ten years, who is almost at the point of death from this poison. Pray, I beseech you, to the Lord, that he does not take her from us, who is our only solace. My dear wife sends her most diligent greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>5th of November.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
