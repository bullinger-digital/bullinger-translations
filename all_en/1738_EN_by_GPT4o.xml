      <p>The man from Constance, whom Dean Staine recommended to you, delivered your letter to me. However, he went directly to Bern from there before coming here. I would indeed like to help him and very much wish to do so; however, there is nothing at present that I see could assist him at this time. Nevertheless, I have given letters of recommendation to some leading men in Memmingen, in case he might be able to obtain some position with their help or advice.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt that you have now received my letters, and that on the same day, if I am not mistaken, on which you sent yours; for I easily conclude this with myself, considering the time elapsed.</p>
      <p>I wrote through the shoemaker, the son-in-law of Mr. Peter, who serves as a faithful minister of the church in Pieterlin, which is a village in our region.</p>
      <p>I am very grateful to you for the sermon of Gwalther, our esteemed friend, which you sent to me, and here I fully recognize your constant goodwill towards me, which I will acknowledge even more fully when I see that you have not hesitated to grant what I recently asked of you in my letters. I beseech and implore you, by whatever means you can be swayed, not to fail me in this, which I most solemnly swear to you will be done without any harm to anyone.</p>
      <p>You are not unaware of what the Emperor is attempting against the French. Mr. Mirabilis affirms that the Emperor has gathered an army of 15,000 Germans and 25,000 Spanish soldiers. It is considered that all the mercenaries, who were supposedly hired to be used against the Turks, have gathered together. Margrave Albrecht is said to have sent 15,000 good soldiers from his troops to the French with a very earnest promise that he will faithfully keep everything he has promised to him, etc. There is a French lord, whose name escapes me, who previously also caused great damage to the Emperor; if he had not been there, a great, entirely ruinous disaster would have occurred on the French side, which one might not have expected due to such poor care. The king is said to have gathered all his nobility together and to have encamped on his own land (the name of which also escapes me), all to await the Emperor there.</p>
      <p>Mirabilis thinks he will deliver a battle to the Emperor; others think he will not fight at all for many reasons, etc.</p>
      <p>The Margrave Albrecht has recently slain 5,000 soldiers of Martin von Rossa, the captain of Queen Maria.</p>
      <p>It is truly a terrifying, cruel storm, and who knows where it will settle, while no one wants to be better, and we also do not become better, but everything everywhere and by everyone is getting worse and worse.</p>
      <p>Ah, let us pray to the heavenly Father through Jesus Christ, that having mercy on us, he may calm and settle these horrendous movements and frequent, but increasingly atrocious changes of affairs through the Prince of Peace, and so entirely moderate them that, however this die may fall, it may fall without our ruin and may the outcome of these sad events be most joyful. I commend myself diligently to your sacred conversations with the Lord. May your household be well.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers and friends reverently, especially the fellow ministers, and among them particularly our Gwalther; I wish to be diligently assisted by the sacred prayers of all before the Lord.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has said that the God who previously delivered the French into his hands will deliver them into his hands again. Well, it is up to God. If He wishes to punish all kingdoms through this Nebuchadnezzar, no one will be able to resist Him. These are indeed very astonishing things, but in the meantime, we must adore the judgments of God, who, however, when we have seriously turned to Him, will convert this entire state of affairs into better things. Farewell, my soul. October 6, 1552.</p>
      <p>My Funclius greets you and wishes to be commended to you in every way.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother, teaching the Gospel of Christ most purely in Zurich.</p>
