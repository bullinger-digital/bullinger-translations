      <p>Greetings. These excellent men were forced to wait for three days for the arrival of the most honorable Lord Consul (for he was in the field when they came).</p>
      <p>Today, finally, one of them, Mr. Charles de Jonville, called by me, presented letters, and I added what seemed necessary to this matter. However, what Charles heard and what response he received, he will report better than I could write. Yet, to add something for them, in my zeal for you, consider this.</p>
      <p>Delegates from your exiles were sent to Baden to the Swiss diet, among whom, if I understood correctly, was also Perrin. They were admitted and heard according to custom. They pleaded their case with many words. The essence of their argument, as far as my modesty can comprehend, appears to be this: They recounted that they were descended from more distinguished ancestors, possessed moderate means, and that some of them, even when in office, always acted and sought what was for the common safety. And for this reason, they were more aggrieved when they saw a large crowd of French not only flocking to Geneva but also being received. They feared that among these, men of bad faith might be received, who might someday be a ruin to the republic, or at least that the citizens would be expelled by the overpowering French. Since they could not conceal this, they incurred the hatred of the French and especially of Calvin for their loyalty to their country. And so the matter finally came to the point that they were forced to consult their safety by flight.</p>
      <p>For while, with a tumult having been stirred up by some, certain individuals were thrown into chains and tortured to force them to confess that the exiles were the authors or participants and accomplices of the sedition, unless they too wanted to be led into prisons and plead their case under torture, they were driven to flight. Therefore, they fled from violence, not from a just trial: and through the most honorable Lords of Bern, many attempts were made to be heard as accused or reconciled, but with no success.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, they themselves remain exiles, all their goods taken from them, held in the hands and by the right of the magistrate. And indeed, driven by utmost necessity, they come to complain about these things to the most honorable Swiss orders. And since for many times Switzerland has been considered an asylum for the wretched and a house of justice, into which those oppressed by injuries have been received and finally freed, they now appear in the sight of the delegates, and implore that they not be unjustly lacking to the wretched and oppressed, but rather wish to help and ensure that their case is legitimately examined, and that access to and departure from Geneva be open, until their innocence becomes known to all.</p>
      <p>This proposal seemed to most of the delegates to contain nothing unjust, but only to seek a just examination of the case and to demand a fair judgment, they wanted the proposals to be written down in their recesses and reported home, so that each republic might consult on what needs to be done. However, the exiles, understanding this delay, indicated that it would be grievous to them, since most are destitute, and have been deprived of their affairs longer than is fair, and are forced to burden themselves with debt: therefore, they ask that this matter be expedited.</p>
      <p>Thus, out of compassion, it seemed to most that as soon as the delegates returned home, they should propose this matter to the magistrates, and that they immediately, if they wish, send delegates and plead their case before the most honorable senate of Geneva, and indeed signify this by letters written to Bern. However, I do not know what has been written to Bern. I suspect, however, that most will agree to send a delegation. Hence, it will be necessary for you to consider, if this happens, what you might conveniently respond to the Swiss delegates.</p>
      <p>Perhaps this would give you the opportunity to narrate the matter as it was conducted and to excuse yourselves and to demonstrate the actions of those men.</p>
      <p>However, since nothing certain is established about sending delegates and the diet is certainly to be celebrated again in Baden on September 20th, it would be better if your excuse were sent earlier to be read by each canton, written in this or a better form: You hear that the exiles complained in Baden as if their case had never been justly examined, and that they were expelled against the laws and justice: this rightly moves you, so that you may also set forth what has been done by them and in turn by you. I advise, however, that you do not write a lengthy history, but as brief as possible, which nevertheless encompasses the matter conducted. It would also seem worthwhile if the French who are in Geneva also composed a brief writing to excuse themselves, that they are not men of bad faith and pernicious to the republic, as they are accused by the exiles. If indeed it also pleased the most honorable magistrate of Geneva to send a delegate to the diet in Baden, it would not seem useless or indecorous if an honest man of first authority from the French joined the senatorial delegate. In preparing the writings, it is necessary to hasten. It is also fair that, if they hear from the recesses what is like an accusation of the exiles against the magistrate, they in turn read your excuse. It seems almost useless to the more prudent to want to excuse through a delegate only at the diet on September 20th, when from the previous diets the complaints of the adversaries have already reached each magistrate. Moreover, the delegates often vary and change, so that the previous ones do not come, etc.</p>
      <p>I have written these things more copiously for your sake, most excellent man, most honorable lord and most cherished brother. You will learn the rest from the excellent man Charles. Afterwards, he was caught and recognized, he fled immediately, otherwise he would have been beheaded. You will learn more about this from my relative and brother Gualther. Pray to the Lord for us continually. I think Martyr himself writes copiously.</p>
      <p>All the brothers greet you. Greet all the fellow ministers and brothers. May the Lord Jesus keep you and deliver us from all evil, grant peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 5, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my most honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
