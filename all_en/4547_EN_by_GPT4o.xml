      <p>The farewell has been sent to ours through a special city messenger.</p>
      <p>I have not heard a single person, and yet I have heard many distinguished people talk about it, who liked it. When he was dismissed before our council, some wanted to leave the guard; yet they all spat upon it. Our consul excused himself (for the people of Glarus say that he conducted himself excellently in Baden) by saying he was ordered to observe the envoys of Zurich, which he did. Thus the first shall be last, and the last shall be first.</p>
      <p>What will happen, I do not know; yet the matter is bitterly thrust into my nose. For one cannot expect (I use the words that seem most appropriate to me) that a city like Zurich or its envoys would lie so blatantly and present themselves so submissively to the Five Cantons, thereby not only shortening the people of Glarus but also giving the Five Cantons so much room that they might still make necessary preparations. In all this, I act as a loyal citizen and suggest that in such matters one should not be too hasty and that the envoys of the city of Zurich should act as the wise, whose patience and endurance will later have more grace. To this, I am answered: none of these things were done for which the day was proclaimed; for it was always intended to show the Five Cantons the law. Since they now reject all law, another counsel should have been taken in Baden. And when I asked a distinguished man again whether our envoys would be sent back to Baden on the day of the Three Kings, he answered me: "If one wants to give everything to the Five Cantons in advance, then one can well save costs and effort; for what else was achieved in Baden than measuring water this time? Is not the matter now worse than before? For it has always been insisted among us to dispatch our envoys with full authority and to receive a final answer from the Five Cantons. Thus, the pious people of Glarus and our true faith have been mocked and scorned, and the Five Cantons are carried around on hands." This is the greatest among me; but all these things are openly said among the magnates, who rightly understand religion. What can I do now? I am too insignificant to judge these matters; yet it has happened as I feared and also wrote to you before. Our people are a fierce, rough people, doing things in a yoke; but when they sense that one hesitates and does not take the matter in hand as they think (for they have the most experienced soldiers), then the spirits become weary and fail.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the land is poor, and one is not accustomed to the daily and unnecessary costs. Much is said here and there about the matter, more than I would like to hear or write. Yet everyone is of the opinion that the Five Cantons see that they should not be touched, therefore they proceed with their practices, give good words until they see their advantage and fill our heads with blows (this is said everywhere among the nobles); for they will not accept the articles set by the arbitrators; this can be well felt by their defiance. So it is to be feared that on the day of the Three Kings, more will be clattered and yet not know how to appease the Five Cantons enough. With this, they have good reason; they proceed with their defiance and yet come at last, when they have sufficiently mocked our faith, to a good deed. This is on everyone's lips.</p>
      <p>Now I, as an unknowing person, also want to express my humble opinion. If one wants to achieve something with ours in the future, one must, before the day of the Three Kings (as has happened before), take counsel, summon ours for the day, with the intention that a final answer should be received there and know "yes or no," and if the Five Cantons reject the law, how one wants to proceed with the matter, etc. You understand me, as I hope.</p>
      <p>So I tell you by my faith: if you prolong the matter and on the day of the Three Kings, if the Five Cantons give a delayed answer, the matter would be postponed further, I do not believe that much could be achieved with ours later, especially if a foreign army should be seen at Lake Lucerne. I write this in all good, also asking you to understand it no other way; for the matter is of great concern to me and other pious people. Otherwise, I am well aware that I should not instruct or teach you and our gracious lords; I am too simple and ignorant for that, and have not been asked for it either.</p>
      <p>Yet I write this for the good of the matter and act as a loyal citizen, to whom the welfare of a city like Zurich and the entire confederation, as well as these lands, is of heartfelt concern. With this, I commend you to God, who may graciously keep you and us all in His fatherly protection. Given in Chur, the 18th of November, in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Bullinger.</p>
