      <p>Grace and peace from God. Dear godfather.</p>
      <p>Considering all circumstances, it seems to me that the friendly words given by the Five Cantons to my lords, and the friendly proposal to avoid litigation, are merely a postponement until they are sufficiently prepared to attack us unexpectedly and unprepared. For yesterday, a confidant from the Five Cantons informed me that the four forest cantons are unanimous in not accepting what has now been agreed upon, but rather not to deviate from the mandate article, for which reason he expects nothing other than a quick outbreak. This is also supported by the circumstances, namely the armament in Milan, the Müsser's preparations, and Reichmuth's journey (as they say) to the Pope. For their claim that they are concerned about their lands beyond the Gotthard is a deception, as they have the papal, imperial, and ducal Milanese envoys in the country. Now, I have no doubt that my lords are fully informed of these matters, and you as well, nevertheless, I write this to you so that if a message comes from Einsiedeln that litigation must proceed, you may write and advise me on how I should conduct myself, whether I should remove anything; for I am at a loss, I do not wish to cause a commotion, yet I do not wish to abandon my lords, whom I have brought together with great expense, effort, and labor. With that, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Dated at Kappel, Tuesday after Judica in 1533.</p>
      <p>Your willing Peter Simler.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear godfather.</p>
