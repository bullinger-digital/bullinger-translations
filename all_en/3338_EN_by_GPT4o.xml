      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Venerable father, we have received the exceptional gift that you sent us out of your singular love for our church, along with your most gracious letters, and it was most welcome to all of us for various reasons, but especially because we have observed that your unique dedication to this little church of ours is increasing more and more every day. This matter has indeed been of great consolation to us, as we are convinced that the spirit, which has shown itself so inclined towards us, will never cease to remember us before the Lord our God.</p>
      <p>We earnestly ask that you continue to do this perpetually with your associates and colleagues, the most religious and upright men, especially in these miserable times, in which wars and discord, the works of the devil, are sown in the church so cruelly that the forces, which ought to have made a united attack against the common enemy, the Roman Antichrist, with joined spirits and one mind, now, having been set against each other, present a spectacle pitiable to both God and men. May our Lord Jesus Christ, the God of peace and concord, obtain from his Father his Holy Spirit and impart it for the reconciliation of the churches, and may he continue to provide his protection to you and your most flourishing and blessed church, as he has done until now. Most illustrious and venerable father, farewell and be well, and honorably greet on our behalf Master P. Martyr, once the brightest light and ornament of our church. Given in Straßburg on the 4th day before the calends of October in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Petrus Alexander, minister of the church, Loquetus, deacon of the French church, (Poquetus?) Franc. Hotomanus, your obedient servant...</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church and most deserving of all Christian churches, our most venerable father. In Zürich.</p>
