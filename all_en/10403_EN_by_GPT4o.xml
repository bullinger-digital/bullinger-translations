    <p xml:id="regest1">The monks Wolfgang Huber, Sebastian Hegner, and Rudolf Spänli, who remained after the dissolution of the Rüti Monastery, give cause for complaints through their behavior and lifestyle: 1. Sebastian Hegner accused the Wetzikon chapter of partiality in conversation with other pastors at the spring synod of 1533; 2. The three monks refuse to assist the pastor at Rüti during the communion service; 3. They disrupt the preaching service with inconsiderate behavior; 4. Wolfgang Huber is violent and quarrelsome in his dealings with people; 5. The three like to associate with the passing Einsiedeln pilgrims in Rüti, especially with priests and monks, but behave dismissively towards the Reformed; 6. Their behavior towards the pastor of Wald, Martin Manhart, whom they could withhold and spoil the tithe of hay unpunished, arouses the people's displeasure; 7. The presence of prostitutes, with whom even married monastery servants engage, causes much harm; particularly offensive is the case of Marx Walder and Margaret Guggenbüchlin; 8. The monks' lavish, coarse, and immoral lifestyle is not fitting for people who are maintained from church properties; 9. The servants follow the bad example and drink, curse, slander (for example, they slandered the steward at Bubikon, protected by their masters) and insult Reformed pastors; 10. The feeding of numerous dogs with good food in the presence of waiting alms recipients and the great expense for hunting cannot be justified; 11. Because of the monks, but against the will of the working people, the morning service takes place so late that they can go straight to the table afterwards. They, the pastors of the Wetzikon chapter, ask the synod for advice and help.</p>

      <p>To the honorable, pious, serious, prudent, esteemed, wise lords mayors, the appointed and the servants of the word of God assembled in the synod of Zürich, our gracious lords and dear brothers in God, we, the proclaimers of the gospel of the chapter of Wetzikon in the office of Grüningen, offer grace and peace from God along with dutiful obedience most humbly beforehand.</p>
      <p>Gracious lords and brothers, after in many past synods various complaints about the conventuals of Rüti were brought forward and yet the following gracious and brotherly warnings had little effect, we, a year ago, with the presentation of some of their disorderly actions, humbly requested your esteemed wisdom and love to graciously arrange with the aforementioned lords to conduct themselves in their life and behavior (considering how graciously and richly they are provided for by our gracious lords from the church's goods with benefices) somewhat more appropriately, decently, and restrainedly, and to set a good example for the church of God with decent conduct, and especially that they show themselves somewhat more friendly, brotherly, and benevolent towards us, the servants of the word of God (who have always desired nothing but their friendship and goodwill), in the hope that then also those who daily make them dependent on them with gifts, soups, rolls, game, and other donations and friendships, would be somewhat more steadfast in the truth, more diligent in preaching, adherents of our lords' mandates, and also towards us and our teaching with less backward scolding and slandering (which then confuses the people not a little and incites them against us) than has been the case for some time. But our divine desire and the gracious admonition, also the fatherly warning of our gracious lords and the synod through Lord Mayor Waldern and Master Heinrich Bullinger, unfortunately, had no more effect than that very little improvement is felt on the part of the aforementioned lords of Rüti, but it has in every way (throughout) the form, as follows.</p>
      <p>1. Firstly, Bastion Hegnower, at the aforementioned synod, a year ago, complained against some brothers in such a way, as if we were inclined to complain only against them and to spare others their misconduct, which is particularly painful for us to bear. Therefore, desiring that he and the others be required to give testimony of their knowledge, in the hope that it would be appropriate for them to do so for the sake of their honor and reputation.</p>
      <p>2. And as a year ago it was pointed out by the aforementioned lords that they never assisted their preacher at the times of the communion of Christ as deacons or helpers, so that the aforementioned preacher was forced to present the bread and drink to the people in person along with the caretaker, whereas in our opinion such service against the church should be more appropriately assigned to them, as they are maintained by the church, and they should rightly rejoice in it, since they otherwise bring no benefit to the church. However, this has never been found in them before and after until this day.</p>
      <p>3. Furthermore, noticeable negligence is felt in their church attendance, in that they always come late after the beginning, sometimes even only halfway through the sermon, and then hold themselves along with some of their dependents behind the pulpit, beyond the walls in the choir, sometimes otherwise during the sermon running in and out with coughing, clearing their throats, and shuffling with their feet, sometimes even leaving the church before the end of the sermon. Such negligence causes great offense to the common people; therefore, some respectable people complain that through the resonance and the noise of their dangerous throat clearing, coughing, running back and forth, the speech of the preacher is disturbed and made incomprehensible, and thereby their edification is taken away.</p>
      <p>4. Lord Wolff Huber, cellarer at Rüti, openly uses violence with frequent physical assaults on people, whom he beats and strikes for trivial matters. He has also sometimes come into conflict with pious, honest people and neighbors because of the sermon, which is all inappropriate for him as a servant of a Christian authority and a spiritual scholar, who is nourished with the sweat of the poor from the church's goods. And since no penance or punishment has followed for all his offenses and assaults so far, some of the laity say: The cellarer has a good time beating people, it doesn't harm him. If I had the freedom, I would also beat many, etc. We remain silent here about how inclined the lords are to overlook and secretly settle such penances and offenses, also committed by other dependents of theirs.</p>
      <p>5. The aforementioned lords also frequently engage with the wandering pilgrims (pilgrims) who are traveling on the road to Einsiedeln, and especially with some mass priests and monks, who are neither favorable to a praiseworthy city of Zürich nor to their faith. However, how many poor exiles they have hosted for the sake of God's word or how friendly they show themselves towards the proclaimers of the word of God and those who undertake to carry out the Christian mandates and ordinances of the city of Zürich, we do not hear much praise. One does feel not only great displeasure among them when some preachers travel to Rüti, but also that the household, which is favorable to the aforementioned preachers, must suffer for it.</p>
      <p>6. How the aforementioned lords treated the pastor of Wald last year regarding the tithe on Scheidegg is evident. However, since some officials have been punished for misappropriation of the tithe at the instigation of the aforementioned lords, and yet they are not further sought or required for it, the rumor persists among the common people (who are otherwise unwilling about the tithe) that they say: If that is the right tithe, then I also know well how I should conduct myself in the future.</p>
      <p>7. All the foundations of the papacy and idolatry have been reformed and improved by our gracious lords of Zürich at Rüti, except for the scandalous accommodation of the common whores, who at times gather there in good numbers, sometimes staying there for a long time, of which the monastery is rarely or never empty, who are also fed, housed, and accommodated much more richly, better, and longer than any poor (who should rightly take precedence over the lascivious in the enjoyment of alms according to the order of our gracious lords), which whores are also sometimes misused by the servants and others who have wives, and publicly (not without causing great offense to our honest church members) lead them through the villages to the churchyards and into the taverns. Also, an unmarried woman, named Margret Guggenbüchlin, had a child by a married man in Dürthen, then attached herself to a servant in Rüti, Marx Walder (who also had a wife), was later expelled for her shameless life and moved to Rapperswil, yet secretly maintained access to the current, finally after the departure of the aforementioned servant, returned to Rüti (by what permission we do not know), accepted as a workwoman, also, although she was once released by the caretaker, yet so much was done that one must see her and other dishonorable and disgraceful persons in the service and work of our gracious lords. How now such examples may serve us against those whom we must punish in our parishes for similar misconduct according to our gracious lords' mandates by our oaths and loss of benefices, so our gracious lords' officials with such people household, we leave to all understanding to consider. If we are to cry out without ceasing over the scandalous vices by God's command in Isaiah 58[1], punish and defend them, to whom then shall we give the blame here in such manifold accommodation of such frivolous people?</p>
      <p>8. Whether then the aforementioned lords conduct their lives decently, without offense, in purity, is greatly doubted by all decency, since all the aforementioned arrogance in the monastery of Rüti is in full swing, moreover, all secret entrances and whoring are no less than before in the papacy, but more and somewhat more comically arranged, also they have the keys to all doors, stairs, ways, and entrances in their hands and power. Some foolish persons, who lie with them, cannot be hidden by themselves. Besides, some of them are more invisible in their conduct than such honorable people, who are maintained from spiritual and church goods, would be well suited with shameful dancing, kissing, touching, and embracing of women, in which they sometimes do not spare even those who are watching, which would be abominable even in women's houses, let alone in God's houses. Whether they also praise God more, boast and give thanks at the table or talk more about impure things, all those who eat and drink with them know. So now all unchastity is found there and the good lords, young, strong, and well-fed, also the monastery is constantly not only loaded with dissolute workwomen, but also with whores, and yet those who are well-disposed towards the gospel and justice and ill-disposed towards all indecency, are so openly hated for it. Thus, a great offense and scandal is given to the pious and obedient country people and God-fearing Christians with amazement, how such Sodom can flourish and prosper under the administration of such a praiseworthy and Christian authority for so long.</p>
      <p>9. So now the household generally looks more to the lords than to anyone else, it follows that very little discipline is felt among the servants, for some of them sometimes get drunk, then run over honest people in their own with blaspheming, mocking, and slandering, as has been done to the pious steward at Bubikon and others. And when this has been complained of by them, they have been held before and given support by the lords, not to mention that they have sometimes taunted and shouted at some preachers without cause in front of their houses, where some of the aforementioned lords have been present.</p>
      <p>10. The poor common people feel great displeasure, not with little hindrance, that they not only keep a large number of dogs there during these harsh and long-lasting times, but also feed them for a long time with good cooked, seasoned (tasty, fatty) food and bread from the kitchen richly from the poor, of which the poor have sometimes had to lack when it had to be obtained. Although this is supposed to be changed shortly by the cellarer, so that the poor are to be given, one must still cook so much that the dogs must also have food and bread. But with this, the poor and honest country people are driven to lament, complaint, displeasure, and (as to be feared) to blasphemy of the gospel and hindrance of a Christian authority (which is undoubtedly not informed of this and bears no blame), as they see the expensive food and bread being wasted on dogs. We remain silent about the cost that goes to the appointed and hired hunters with food and other expenses. Although now such hunting is not inappropriate for our gracious lords of Zürich as the regular authority to maintain there for their pleasure through their official, little benefit is found therein on the part of our gracious lords, than that the honest people's goods, fences, and fruits are thereby trampled and the caught game is sometimes distributed outside our gracious lords' territory, to those who are neither favorable to our faith nor to a praiseworthy city of Zürich.</p>
      <p>11. The honest people, who go to church in Rüti according to the order of our gracious lords, complain that the bell is rung for the sermon much too late and that because of the lords, who according to old custom let it be rung afterwards, so that they sit at the table immediately after the sermon, which is too difficult for the working people, who are accustomed to having breakfast early and then must go home over the field after the sermon. Therefore, some have sometimes gone away without a sermon and could not wait, which gives the honest people a suspicion, as it dangerously happens, to reduce the church attendance and to cause the church members to go to other more inconvenient places and to bring the preaching (as one doubts) into decline.</p>
      <p>So now, gracious lords and dear brothers, we, especially in the office of Grüningen, have a stumbling block against those who, without displeasure, are seated and resident against our teaching, preaching, and faith, and especially have a contentious people, and yet the aforementioned scandalous affairs are in full swing, the people incited against us, daily new stories and news detrimental to our faith are spread in the monastery of Rüti. If then such disorder should remain uncorrected and increase, we can hope to expect nothing better from it than a powder keg of the papacy and all disorder, which also these people with their retinue and household constantly spin and work on the thread with which they may tie our mouths. Therefore, it is our most humble request to your esteemed wisdom and love for God's sake and his holy word, to graciously consider all danger and scandal that may arise for the church of God and us from this and to fatherly advise us (if we are to look on such harmful disorder without protection or to whom we should give the blame herein). As we then against your esteemed wisdom and love, which the almighty God may maintain to his honor and the good of the church in constant Christian and happy governance, also in the confession of his holy word at all times according to his will, comfort ourselves with this and as obedient people will always strive to deserve humbly.</p>
