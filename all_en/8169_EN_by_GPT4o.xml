      <p>Most illustrious man, as an honorable father. I will write a few things in this letter to you about my goodwill and rather my respect towards you, about my enthusiasm in reading your books, and finally about the great mercy of God towards me and my family, my most esteemed father, both because of your bodily infirmity, which our excellent physician Pigafetta, who, as I hope, will deliver this letter of mine, will abundantly and happily inform you of all these things. I will only say at present that I owe you very much and will always be indebted, and if you ever wish to use my services, you will do me a most pleasing favor. May the best and greatest God keep you safe for a long time for the consolation of friends and the benefit of all good people. Farewell, love me, and do not forget me in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Heidelberg, February 7, 1570. Yours as a son, Odoardus Thyenäus, Count of Ciconia.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the Church of Zürich, as an honorable father.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
