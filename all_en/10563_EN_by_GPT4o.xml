    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer probably did not comment on the Zurich [Communion] Confession [No. 482] because Luther places special emphasis on the statement that with the visible signs, the body of Christ is presented and received. Although this is not incorrect in the sense of the "unio sacramentalis," similar to the statement that the Communion is a sacrifice, the dispute over such figurative expressions is idle. If Bucer and Philipp [Melanchthon] hold on to their view regarding an agreement with the Pope and the bishops, new divisions are imminent; other people in Konstanz share this opinion. He asks for Bullinger's opinion for Chelius [No. 514]. Thanks for the cheese and inquires about the toys he sent to Bullinger's children.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Recently, I indicated to you, dearest brother, what I suspect might be the reason why Bucer has perhaps not yet responded to your confession, as far as I can conjecture, namely that you do not seem to express sufficiently to Luther the presentation or tradition of the body of Christ in the matter of the supper. For since Christ says so clearly: "Take" [Mt 26, 26 par], Luther, and finally Bucer, think that these words must be emphasized greatly. Hence, it may be true, as others have informed you, that Luther insists on saying, "that the true body and the true blood of Christ are given into the hand and into the mouth, and what happens to the bread, that should happen to the body of Christ." He wants this solely so that the word "take," that is the handing over of the body, is well expressed here through and with the visible signs.</p>
      <p>This, if I am not mistaken, is Luther's intention. Although it can be said this way because of the sacramental union and the ancients spoke thus, it is true, as you write, that the words are stumbling blocks. And Luther is quite cunning; for although it can be said this way, we know that in reality it is not so. The supper is truly called a sacrifice, namely for the memory of the sacrifice. However, if you insist again and again that it is a sacrifice, I will consistently assert that it can be said so, but in reality, it cannot be. But Luther does not urge such expressions in the supper for any other reason than, as I have already said, because of the sacramental union. Yet it is a troublesome thing; for thus I would like to answer the entire "Pange lingua." It is indeed a great plague that you learned men have so much work and must trouble yourselves so, although I fear it is not yet at an end.</p>
      <p>But if Bucer and Philipp [Melanchthon] persist in their opinion about reaching an agreement with the Pope and the bishops, we will encourage the sects, create new ones, brothers will be divided among themselves, the people will be stirred up, and then they would be doing us justice if they struck us all dead. I pour these thoughts into your and the dearest Pellican's bosom, and all those among us who are sensible share my sentiments. May Jesus Christ, the most holy and divine head and foundation of his church, not abandon us. Amen.</p>
      <p>February 12.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick. Make sure to let me know what response you have given to Gallo or Chelius.</p>
      <p>It is now a good joke, because I asked you if such cheese is available with you. You understood it as if I wanted to beg more from you. But that was not my intention, yet I thank you very sincerely. It is too much; the first piece would have been more than enough. I have sent some toys to your children recently; I do not know if they have reached you or not. If your mother has not been able to make good use of them, I will send you more. Greet your mother and wife most sincerely for me, and may God protect you with all that is dear to you.</p>
