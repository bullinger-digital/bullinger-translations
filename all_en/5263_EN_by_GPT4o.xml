      <p>S. D. There was no leisure for writing.</p>
      <p>Since Peter Bontinus, a pharmacist and a very pious young man, was about to set out to you, I did not want to let him go without my letters, in which I at least inform you that I have received yours, in which you explain the main points of the mission of Rambouillet and Hotman. I see and experience that among the princes, hardly any are more unjust to us than the Count Palatine of Zweibrücken and the Duke of Württemberg; I hear that the latter has forbidden Beza's speech, held at the Possiac colloquy, in his domain, but I do not report this for certain. They say that a new assembly has been established at those Alsatian taverns.</p>
      <p>I have heard what Guise has planned and attempted; I hope his attempt has been thwarted by the Lord, and I eagerly await from you what you will write about this matter. What I sent about the Council of Trent and the conditions of a free council, if you please, you will send to France; they did not displease our people. If the decree of the first session has not yet been brought to you, I will send it to you.</p>
      <p>In Bremen, Saxony, I hear a great tumult has been stirred up, and Musaeus has been expelled from there, and a restraint has been imposed on the other Lutherans. They say that Paul Eber, frightened by Hesshusen's book, has reconciled himself with the enemies.</p>
      <p>The Hermetschwil assembly is not proceeding; for one of the judges in the Claron case, the notary of Uri, has died, and therefore another judge must be appointed in his place. Threats are heard everywhere, with what ferocity the papists want to attack the evangelicals after the council is over and bring them into order, indeed to slaughter them all to the last one. Therefore, the Lord must be prayed to, that he may protect those who call upon his name and convert or overthrow those who persecute the truth, etc. Farewell excellently, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, together with colleagues, brothers, and friends. Greet the old friend, Mr. Jonville.</p>
      <p>What Mr. Budaeus communicated, I soon sent to Coignet, etc. Zurich, April 5, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I did not reread.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
