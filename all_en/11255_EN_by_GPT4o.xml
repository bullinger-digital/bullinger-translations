      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>I have no other reason to write, dearest Bullinger, except for this one: that Jakob, who recently revealed his misery to you, has anxiously asked to be recommended by me to you. He is certainly a good man, worthy of your assistance, if you can help him in any way. Some furious individuals are pursuing him to the point of destruction. Recently, a certain scoundrel, unknown to anyone, attacked him and tried to wound him while he was down, but his hat, which was notably damaged, protected him. He understands that he cannot remain here much longer without risking his life, and such is the public justice in Thurgau, namely that a good man is not safe. May the Lord eventually look after His own. Amen.</p>
      <p>You might know that Capito is soon going to travel to Bern; however, I do not know the reason. Farewell, along with Pellican and all good people.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, January 7, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my esteemed brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
