      <p>S. D. I cannot help but greatly admire you, venerable lord father, who, being such a great man, deign to honor me, such a small insignificant man, with such excellent letters, written with such modesty of spirit, indeed almost with a lowering of yourself. And first of all, there was no need for you to excuse yourself so anxiously for having delayed writing to me for so long. For this humanity, which you have long practiced towards me, I can never give you thanks enough, especially because you share with me so familiarly those matters concerning France and Belgium and discuss with me matters of such great weight and importance so seriously and with such diligence. Where indeed, I know well, you are not so much considering my person as the cause we have in common, and because the situation necessarily requires it, you do not cease anywhere, but everywhere perform your duty, admonishing everyone as much as you can, even in this your great age. Hence, I too will not act as a slacker here, but as soon as possible will admonish all the brotherly colleagues, as much as is allowed, of their duty and exhort the churches to faithfully pour out prayers to the Lord, indeed with your name added, as you enjoin, and to those you command, with greetings. Which I have already partly done, having been admonished by the letters of the beloved brother in Christ, Mr. Tobias, concerning most of those about whom you write. And as for the soldier, whom you say should be sought, as no one from our Engadin, especially the Lower Engadin, has yet gone into that so impious military service, so I hope it can easily be obtained that none will go into it now, which all abhor, and that our communities or the leaders of the communities will not connive at such great impiety, especially since they are warned by the example of those who have set out, if they are wise and not of a foolish mind, of whom many tracks of those entering (as the little fox said to the lion) are seen, but none or certainly very few of those returning, etc. But also those who have hitherto gone from Rhaetia into that war, most have set out, although it was forbidden and prohibited by the magistrate in appearance indeed and openly, but perhaps secretly granted or connived at by those who, corrupted by gold (to which all things today, alas, submit), are indebted and bound to the king for the accursed pension. But let this suffice concerning these matters. But this must not be overlooked by us, namely that we all should congratulate ourselves and give the greatest thanks to God for the health restored to you so far and further pray earnestly that He may fully restore it to you, whom He may deign to preserve for a very long time as a survivor and in good health for His church. This lastly I will add, encouraged by your usual humanity towards me, which I especially experienced in that little book of mine, namely that I may further make use of it, I earnestly pray that you may have this bearer of the present letters, a young man of no small hope and indeed of noble parents, but suffering from domestic poverty and overwhelmed by a large family, commended to you, namely Melchior Saluz, whom you may commend to those most ample and illustrious lords and be an advocate with the authority you possess, that he may be promoted to a somewhat larger stipend, from which he may be more comfortably supported, since he is deprived of those things which are necessarily required for studies, however noble the family he is born from. You understand what I wish, if it can be done conveniently.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily and in my name and in the name of my colleagues, greet the distinguished men there in doctrine and piety, I pray.</p>
      <p>Given in Süs, Engadin, on the 26th day of August in the year of our Lord 1569. Yours as much as he is, Hudrich Campell.</p>
      <p>To the most holy and in every way most adorned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my most venerable lord and father, and to be observed with perpetual faith.</p>
