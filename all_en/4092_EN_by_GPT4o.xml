      <p>Many greetings.</p>
      <p>Although it was neither my intention nor plan, most learned Bullinger, to publish the books of Canterbury translated by me on the matter of the Eucharist at this time, especially since I see everything is inflamed by the tumults of opinions and judgments no less than by arms, yet because your Christopher here voluntarily promises his faith and effort in this matter so candidly, I have begun again to apply myself to the task, which was interrupted and almost despaired of. For I would not want any delays to rest on me here, if only the matter seems to you or to him to be such that my duty would be required for the use of the church.</p>
      <p>And I have already indicated this matter to you in previous letters. Now, having finally consulted with Froschauer, it seemed necessary to both of us, and especially to me, not to begin anything of this business without first consulting and obtaining your approval. Therefore, I ask you, most learned Bullinger, to apply your diligent judgment in understanding this matter. For I have decided, God willing, to send some part to you soon according to Froschauer's advice; which I would have done now, but the work requires a slightly more accurate description, so that it may be more easily read by you. For until now, I am so occupied with translating the councils of the Greeks with a double commentary, and in compiling the history of our martyrs and other things, that almost no free time remains for writing. Therefore, you should not be surprised if I have written these letters to you now with less diligence.</p>
      <p>I wish you to fare well, most learned man.</p>
      <p>Basel, 26 September.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, J. Foxe.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
