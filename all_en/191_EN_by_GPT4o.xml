      <p>God's grace be with you! Dear godfather, your two letters about the shocking deceit of the Swabian cities trouble me and all good-hearted Christians greatly.</p>
      <p>God have mercy, that it comes to this, that the pious people must leave their churches and go into misery, and all idolatry is so powerfully entrenched. We constantly pray to God that He may graciously preserve all those who trust in His sole help, opposing lies and deceit.</p>
      <p>As you have written earnestly about the exiled brothers, especially concerning Musculus, that we should do our best and let you know our good response, I will write to you in detail about what I have done and how things stand.</p>
      <p>Upon your letter, I gathered all the brothers together, consulted with them, especially concerning Musculus, about what to do, since he not only has such a testimony from me but also from you as our common father; they were also asked to recommend him, showing how he has always behaved towards me. They have now considered this, and they would gladly wish and do all good for Musculus; however, since they are newly out of the tension and Musculus's books are available and especially esteemed by the opposition as great and holy, this might easily rekindle the tension or at least give the opposition a reason to raise their heads again, fearing also that the adversaries from the citizenry would cling to him, which would soon cause another discord, unless he openly declared in print how his writings are to be understood and what his current opinion is, which they also did not consider honorable if he recanted so much. Therefore, their opinion is to remain completely silent; for it would cause no small unrest.</p>
      <p>Since this has enough weight, I could not oppose it, yet they asked me, since I do not doubt, also based on your testimony, that he is upright, I will write to you about all our concerns, to await your advice and decision, which would not displease them either.</p>
      <p>On the same day, after we had dealt with this, the other letter arrived along with that of Mr. Nägeli. I immediately called them all together, informed them of your urgent request due to the common need and especially again concerning Musculus, found some willing, but not all, who thought we should not burden ourselves with any Swabians; nothing good has ever come from them, and if we accept them, the course would follow, etc., with similar more. I urged them to consider that in the common need, neither Swiss nor Swabians should be considered, but what is the duty of Christians, what is mercy, what pleases God and what He demands of us. I would have liked them all to go with me to the council and help as Christian brothers to plead for the poor in urgent need. But I could not achieve it; they did not want to impose a burden on my lords. I write this to you confidentially, so you see how bitter the minds here are against all those who now come here, how they are inclined, so that I do not count it too harshly against them, as those who have long heated the disputes. I wish they were more gentle and would now let the milk flow. I told them I would insist with my lords, as you instructed me, so that you might receive a good answer, as you desire. I then went to Mr. Schultheiss Nägeli, brought him the letter, also showed him concerning Musculus, how the matter stood, what you wrote to me both times; asked him to have it recommended to him and others. He also gave me his letter to read, offered much good; yet he wanted to let the matter rest with my lords. On Thursday, he brought it before the council; my lords decided that I should be sent, since I had knowledge of Musculus, to inform them of his character. This happened today, Friday. In the meantime, many of my gracious lords have privately asked me about Musculus and his books; for already among them all, the rumor was that he had written against our disputation, therefore nothing should be done, that he should be called. I informed them privately as well as today publicly before the council, what acquaintance, friendship, and unity I have had with him, how he preaches, what his teaching and life are, also taught, and that you also gave him no other testimony than I have done so far. After that, I did not want to withhold from them how he was also led into the Lutheran concord by Butzer and thus hoped that everything would be peaceful; he also arranged everything according to the form of this concord and agreement, that he let go out in his commentaries, also catechism about the sacrament, so that he endeavored to write in such a way that he did not anger either party; yet he did not name anyone, write or specifically attack. Thereby I also indicated how this brought us some concern, who serve in the gospel, since we must fear that it might cause unrest because of the opposition; therefore, I wanted to report this to their graces. At the same time, I presented the common matter, asked to open some comfort and hope for us in this. Thereupon my lords made this decision: since the matter is difficult and worrying, and yet we testify good of Musculus, although his books sound different, they did not want to make any final decision, but have instructed me to consult with you further and inform you of our concerns, which we had about it; what I then found advisable and good, I should let them know again. Concerning the common matter, they cannot promise too much, since the influx might be too great; but if honorable people, and those who do not denounce the sacrament or are caught in erroneous opinion, they do not want to refuse their help and loyalty to anyone; for they are inclined to show themselves as Christians towards the pious. This I also want to let you know.</p>
      <p>Thus stands the whole matter. Hereupon, dear godfather, I ask you to help and advise. Concerning Musculus, I worry that it will fail here; for Mr. Joß and especially Textorius are vehement. So I would not like to cause displeasure, although I would like to share with Musculus the heart in the body for his teaching and piety. Therefore, I want to ask you for God's sake, even if he is not accepted here, you should not let him go from Zurich. He can also be completely free from all suspicion with you, especially if he gives a written explanation of his opinion. If that happens, he might come here in time, when the time is now granted; for I would truly not like to let him go from my hands, especially since he has his refuge with us. You have examined his commentaries with judgment, also written your judgment on it; I would gladly suffer if you informed us of your opinion.</p>
      <p>Concerning the other brothers, who are not denounced, we would take them from you all the more. Gervasius has also spilled the broth with ours. Raßdorffer is known to Mr. Joß, and he also does not like him very much. I have always heard him praised. I suspect nothing of Naogeorgus but the Saxon language. If Xystus came, the land would be ours. I have written all the dealings to Musculus in a friendly manner, asking him to consider the great evil that has long plagued this church, and not to be angry, even if he sees that people act cautiously and prudently; I have sent the letter to Mr. Ott Heinrich, captain in Basel, since I think he is now there. He sends you many greetings; he is in a purchase with young lord Hartman von Halwyl concerning a seat in Aarau; I do not yet know how it stands.</p>
      <p>Concerning the new news, I thank you sincerely for letting us know all things so diligently. Asking you to continue doing so; for we otherwise hear something late here. So we will also strive to always write what is with us.</p>
      <p>The Lausanne matter is still pending, as I wrote in the last letters; the scholastic matter will be resolved shortly. What the Zurichers have conceded in the impious formula of the oath to be presented to the impious, I now know to be true. For Hagius, who was a delegate in Baden, reported to me. Today it was concluded and decreed among the diacosios that they want to admit no other form than the divine one of the oath. The adversaries insist that the same form be retained everywhere. With their insistence, Zurich could easily explain itself again, and I wish it! For how great the sin is and where we fall, if we swear by creatures or give others the occasion, everyone recognizes. It is no wonder if we abandon His name in such sacred religion, the Lord will also abandon us and His name will be destitute of help.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I read that, for which I found nothing more absurd, most wicked! How the malicious demon evades in the matter of justification, and unless you consider the claws and ears, that is, those that follow, you would think it not a donkey, but truly a lion. Some friends are still reading that.</p>
      <p>I promised Peter of Arburg that I would also send it to him through his prefect; he will bring it to you again within eight days; for he said he was going to Zurich.</p>
      <p>All the brothers greet you, D. Iodocus, Textorius, Eberhardus, Nicolaus. My lord Schultheiss Nägeli also especially greets you, in whose name I write for the most part; for he instructed me to write in his name and to thank you for your friendly writing; he is ready to serve you wherever he can; he himself has not much to write, to which he is reluctant to write and comes in haste. However, since you write not without the advice of both my gracious lords, the mayors, I should also answer in his name.</p>
      <p>He also especially instructs me to greet both my lords, the mayors, again. That you will convey on my behalf and also greet them in my name. With this, may God be with you! Also greet all the brothers for me, D. Pelicanus, Theodorus, Gualtherus, and my dear Hopper, to whom, if more leisure permits, I will reply. Also your family in the name of me and my family.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 13, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours always most devoted, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father, to be honored forever. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
