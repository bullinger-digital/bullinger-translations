      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Our Leo, most esteemed brother in the Lord, passed away peacefully to the Lord on the 19th of this month shortly after one o'clock in the afternoon, to the great sorrow of all good people. Indeed, our church has lost an immeasurable treasure in this man. Truly, a good part of my life departed with the death of my most beloved brother, and if it were not for the hope of future life and the resurrection of the dead to console me, I could not bear it. The very learned and pious man, Dr. Theodor Bibliander, is also lying seriously ill with tertian fever. May the Lord restore him to us and not add sorrow to sorrow. You, with yours, pray to the Lord for our church. - In recent letters, I requested to be informed about affairs in France, Italy, Germany, Hungary, and Venice, which we would like to know; our Röist requests the same. We know that no one can report these matters more accurately, and this is due to the association with merchants and friendship with foreigners. Again and again, we ask you to share with us what you consider certain, and it would not be unwelcome if you wrote about such matters in German or, if you deem it worthwhile, sent a messenger or courier at our expense. You know what matters to us in these things, especially concerning our homeland. Therefore, make known to us through your good friends abroad, so that we may always have warning. Your prudence understands what I mean and what would be in our interest. Farewell and write more frequently, I ask, than you have done in several months. You cannot believe how much your letters affect me and how much I long for them. Zürich, 23rd June 1542.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, my most esteemed lord.</p>
