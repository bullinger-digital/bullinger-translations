    <p xml:id="regest1">The letter from Bullinger [No. 1793] was not delivered to him by the [recommended] young man [Hans] Wilpert Zoller, but by the priest from Bennweier, who had received it from Hans [Jakob] Löw, pastor in Riehen; Erb immediately forwarded the received letters, but due to the absence of Amandus [Hans Henman] Truchsess [von Rheinfelden] as well as the prince [Georg von Württemberg] and his chancellor [Sigismund Stier], no response has yet been made. Löw had already shown Erb letters in September in Beblenheim, in which Bullinger recommended Zoller to a Basel nobleman, but since Bullinger considered the initially targeted court of the Lords of Mörsberg morally questionable, Löw asked Erb to make an inquiry with Count [Georg]; since no suitable position was available, Löw has probably now kept Zoller in Riehen. The Reichstag is being prepared in Speyer; the rise in wine prices indicates what can be expected from this day. Greetings. Still hopes, as an old man, to be able to visit the churches of Zurich and Bern. [Postscript:] Has just received a letter from Bucer [dated October 21], in which he calls for intercession for the bishops of Cologne and Münster [Hermann von Wied and Franz von Waldeck]; they are under severe pressure, as are the believers in Metz - these by Emperor [Charles V.] -, but [Hermann von Wied] would rather die than give up the work he has begun. [Enclosure: Letter from Beatus Rhenanus to Erb dated July 29, 1543, about the history of Horburg/Argentuaria; with a postscript from Erb:] Had Rhenanus' letter, with which he wanted to counter the disparagement of Horburg at the court [of Georg von Württemberg], copied at the urging of Quirinus von Leiden.</p>

      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you, etc.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, most learned man, on the 21st of October, not from the young man Wilpert Zoller, but from the dean, the priest in Bennweier, who said he had received it from Hans Jakob Löw, the pastor in Riehen. Furthermore, I immediately delivered the remaining letters attached to yours to everyone individually. Amandus Truchsess was absent; the prince, along with the chancellor and knights, were preparing to go to Strasbourg. Hence, there has been no response from either party.</p>
      <p>As for why the young man himself did not come to us, I understand the reason, unless my opinion deceives me, which is as follows. Hans Jakob Löw spent several days in September in Beblenheim, gathering this year's short grape harvest. I met him for the sake of greeting, and he immediately presented two letters that you had written to a nobleman from Basel, of the family, if I am not mistaken, of Ryschach, to whom you had recommended the young man, so that he might join the court of the Lords of Mörsberg. But since their manners displeased you, you wanted him to be provided with a more honorable position. This task was entrusted to Hans Jakob Löw from Riehen, who, as I said, showed me the letters sent to the nobleman, asking me to diligently report everything to the prince.</p>
      <p>Upon returning home, I carefully attended to this and read the letters to the prince, in which you praised both his manners and his honorable family. At that time, there was a suitable position available for the young man, either as a secretary or a letter writer. I thought I still had the opportunity to do a favor for the brothers in Zurich, but my expectation was disappointed. For another person, coming from Stuttgart two days earlier, had succeeded, who only yesterday took the oath in the record office. Furthermore, there is currently no vacant position suitable for the young man; the prince has nobles who are in charge of food and drink, but they are noble by blood. If he could be joined to them for a while, until another position is assigned to him, it would be well; for I promoted the young man Hertenstein from Lucerne, the nephew of Hartmann von Hallwil from his sister. These are the matters, dearest Bullinger, which I did not want to keep hidden from you any longer in the name of this young man, etc. Indeed, I think that on this occasion the young man was retained by Hans in Riehen, which is why he visited us less, etc. I will give you the prince's response shortly, unless something else intervenes.</p>
      <p>Nothing new is reported among us except the lies of the common people and vain rumors. The Reichstag is being prepared in Speyer with great pomp. They are selling wine at a high price among us, so we can easily guess what kind of assembly it will be, namely of those who do not seek the glory of Christ and the good of the republic, but their own luxury and tyranny. Pray to the Lord for us with your brothers, that He may deliver us from all evil and preserve our church in the confession of Christ and pious purity, as it was established.</p>
      <p>Greet your family in my name, Bibliander, my Megander, Erasmus, the chief apostle of our church. All our brothers greet you in Christ, especially Nicolaus Regius.</p>
      <p>In haste, in Riquewihr, October 24.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>I have not yet given up hope, if the Lord favors with His usual mercy, that Erb, an old man with his gray hair, will see the churches of Zurich and Bern before he descends into the grave, so that I may receive consolation from you, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, my dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Greetings again. When I had sealed your letters, a letter from Bucer was given, the appendix of which contained this; it pleased me, therefore, to insert it into yours, etc.: “I commend to your prayers, my Erb, the bishops of Cologne and Münster and their churches; for they ensure that the gospel is purely taught, as I recently wrote to you, and the sacraments are administered according to it, suffering admirable and dreadful persecution from their own for this reason. In this matter, those enemies of Christ have a strong ally in the emperor, who has now driven the word of God from Metz and is trying to stir up great persecution there against the saints. Thus we prepare ourselves for the Turks. The old man of Cologne has often testified that he would rather die, let alone lose his principality, than abandon the work of the Lord he has begun. Therefore, you will pray for him and the entire church, which is threatened with many evils today. The Papists are very ferocious, etc.”</p>
      <p>Greetings to Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Quirinus reluctantly obtained from me a description of Rhenanus' letter; for he had given it to me to respond to the barbarians of the court, who mock the antiquity and ruins of Strasbourg. Quirinus said it was demanded by your people; by whom it was published, I do not know, unless Quirinus himself did it, who, while he is here, is not prevented from conversations with our people. Then perhaps it was read, etc. I entrust it to you in good faith to read with the rest, etc. Perhaps more about this matter at another time, etc.</p>
      <p>Erb.</p>
