      <p>S. You would not be wrong to call me impudent, reverend father in Christ, for I have not ceased to be a nuisance to you amidst your many occupations; I daily demand more from you, while I have nothing with which to repay you in return. I have received all your writings, but those against ubiquity, this evening, so I have not yet been able to inspect them, let alone read them. I pray to God to preserve you for us so that you may benefit the church for a long time.</p>
      <p>But you seem to be overworking yourself and neglecting your health in the meantime. If I were to say that you have people to whom you could delegate some of your labors, you would respond, I know well: that you wish to devote all that remains of your life to the Christian republic. Therefore, continue to both aid and illuminate the Christian world with your writings.</p>
      <p>May God strengthen you and confirm you in all good so that you may do this for a long time. Mr. Eglin came after I had sent my last letter; the road is very muddy, from which he could not free himself quickly. In addition to the recommendations of the Zurich council and yours, there were also ours, I mean the consul's and mine, as well as those of Paul Pul, the son of the treasurer, to his father.</p>
      <p>I hope he will experience the utmost humanity from people; if he continues to keep them in line with humanity and modesty, he will, I hope, have them as benevolent forever. They are indeed mountain people, more remote from the cultivation of men, but still manageable and not so fierce that they cannot become gentler day by day if a suitable teacher comes to them. I am expecting Eglin's return; for he gave me hope that he would return through me, and then I will send back all your writings; for I have given the response of the princes to be copied so that I can give it to the consuls to be read in the council, so that they too may be reminded of their duty. I do not know who has so alienated Eglin's mind from the people of Davos (but it seems Colmar has done it), so that the good man has convinced himself that he has been sent to the Cyclopes. I have worked hard to make him abandon that error.</p>
      <p>It seems to me a great thing to be among free men and in places where there is the utmost freedom of religion, and I know you share the same opinion with me. You will encourage Mr. Haller (but not as if I were advising you) to advise Eglin's wife not to present herself as so difficult, and if she has absorbed anything from Colmar, to keep it to herself and to conduct herself in such a way that she does not appear to be ill-disposed towards the people of Davos. These and other things you will understand with your prudence; for you know what I am referring to.</p>
      <p>If the people of Davos were to feel a noticeable displeasure among themselves, they would not have it any better. Tell her that there are also nobles in Davos, not just peasants; she should not act so disdainfully. Seriously, I do not see with what spirit or conscience someone could be so ill-disposed towards a divine calling. I hope Mr. Eglin will return to us from Davos much wiser and more cheerful than he went there. Certainly, it is impossible for him to measure the form of the Rhaetian republic by yours.</p>
      <p>You know what is lacking on both sides.</p>
      <p>Day by day and hour by hour, I open my eyes more and more and see that I must live as a man among men (unless I wish to leave the world), wherever that may be; nothing in this life is perfect and complete, nor are we better than the prophets and apostles; they too faced the same fate. But why do I say this to you, whose occupations hasten elsewhere?</p>
      <p>Farewell now, reverend father, and may God keep you safe so that you may remain healthy and with us for a long time. Chur, March 17, in the year of our Lord 1561</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. You indeed did well: you send French to a German man, just so that you may get rid of the troublesome man. I laughed when I came across the French writing; but finally, I found a man who could translate it into German. Not a word from Italy; this silence is suspicious to me.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his always to be respected lord.</p>
