      <p>My humble willing (or voluntary) service always beforehand. Gracious lord and brother, regarding the German schoolmaster, about whom I wrote to you and you wrote back to me, my lords have instructed me to write to you further; thus they ask and report: The community of God's house also wants to have a German school here in the city; they have appointed one in the Latin school (since there is no need for three, as there are no students in it) and have assigned the same salary to a German schoolmaster, namely fifty Rhenish guilders in cash. In addition, our lords of this city give him a house as nice and spacious as any in the entire city, especially with a very large room. If he is diligent and willing to be of service, he will also be able to earn something by writing.</p>
      <p>In addition to all this, our lords will also impose something on the students, so that they give him all the fasting days, so that he does not have to suffer here. If this pleases him, as it should, he should come up here without delay and present himself personally to our lords, show and offer his willingness and service; they will then sit down with him and make a decision that is beneficial and honorable for all. I have been instructed to write this to you and ask that you, as they trust you, act on our behalf. I also want to add this myself: if he is, as you write, pious and honorable and faithful and diligent and well-learned, he will find gracious lords when they recognize him as such. But if this Johannes Kleiner von Stein does not want to come, we ask you to find us another and let me know this time how the matter stands. This time I have nothing new.</p>
      <p>Today both mayors, Hans Tscherner and Ambrosi Marty, have instructed me to greet you warmly in their name and wish you much good. May God be with you, and may I commend you to Him. Father Comander also greets you.</p>
      <p>Given at Chur, on the 9th day of February 1556. Your willing Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the great man D. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord, most worthy of all honor. In Zurich.</p>
