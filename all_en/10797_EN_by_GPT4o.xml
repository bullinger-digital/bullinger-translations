    <p xml:id="regest1">[The pastors of Bern] have complained to the council about the appointment [of Sebastian Meyer] from Strasbourg without their knowledge; the council has promised not to appoint anyone without their consent, but reserves the right to search for suitable candidates themselves. Megander considers this to be the responsibility of the pastors and asks for a statement. Greetings. The remaining letters are to be burned.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Dearest brothers, today we approached our council, gravely complaining that the manner of appointing ministers has not been properly observed, as they have sent someone to Strasbourg without our consent and knowledge. We wish to know whether they intend to observe this custom, as it was established by the apostles and has long been maintained by the early and our church, in the future or not. They respond that they will not appoint anyone to any church without us, nor was their writing to Strasbourg done with the intention that it should be done in this way with us; indeed, they promise to maintain this custom. However, they are not prohibited by this church's constitution from inquiring about learned men suitable for our church. And so, to put it briefly, the matter has come to the point where they promise not to appoint anyone without us, but they are allowed, indeed more fitting, to work for learned men; which seems to us to be done in a completely reversed order. For what is ours, they usurp and claim for themselves. It is our duty to investigate learned men and, if we find any, to offer and introduce them to the church for approval. Therefore, I am still stuck in uncertainty. Please advise either through this or some other reliable messenger.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 6.</p>
      <p>Greet Theodor, Pellican, the custodian, and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>I earnestly request that the remaining letters be burned.</p>
      <p>Megander, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To his brothers in Zurich, Leo and Bullinger, dearest in the Lord.</p>
