      <p>Greetings. I sent my last letter through one of your diligent students, which I believe has been delivered to you. In the meantime, nothing particularly certain has been reported; for what has been indicated to us from elsewhere, I do not know how probable it is, let alone certain. But since nothing, however unjust or absurd, is unusual to happen sometimes, I did not want to hide this from you. Firstly, it is written that peace has been made between the Emperor (Kaiser) and the French (Gallus), and then that the same Emperor has reconciled with Ferdinand, openly declaring that he is so far from planning the succession of the empire for his son, that he will be an intercessor for it to be transferred to Maximilian, as he desires this above all things. However, regarding the reconciliation between Augustus and Albert, it is said to have been disrupted by the instigation of the same Emperor, because Augustus allegedly acted against duty by making a deal with an enemy whose hands are stained with his brother's blood. Nevertheless, the Emperor himself is said to be openly supporting Albert with subsidies to obtain what he demands from the bishops, as he now wants the request (which you know) to be ratified. He is said to be preparing a diet (assembly) and has already stationed several cohorts of Spaniards here and there, evidently to dictate the decision to the estates as usual and to remove the freedom of votes. If all these things are true, who will doubt that poor Germany, already more than half-enslaved, will be undermined and even betrayed by Spanish (Hispanic) intrigues? We must pray to the Lord to have mercy on His saints. Farewell in Christ Jesus with your fellow ministers and especially your wife and family. Basel, November 25, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
