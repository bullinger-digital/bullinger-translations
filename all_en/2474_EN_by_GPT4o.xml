      <p>The supplication, which you sent to me in your latest letter, most illustrious man, I immediately took care to have it delivered to the Christians of Locarno, written in Clavenna, through a personal messenger. They, in turn, sent their own orator with the supplication to the Swiss lords gathered in Baden, as you had indicated. In the meantime, they give thanks to God and to the Lord Jesus Christ, who chose you as a kind of intermediary to undertake this task, a man especially pious, diligent, and energetic. They further ask your kindness not to cease, as you have begun, especially with prayers to the Lord with the whole church of Zurich, from whom all things are preserved; to whom be eternal honor and glory. Farewell, my lord Heinrich, and do not forget your Antonio Mario, who wishes all happiness to you and your family. Chur, 5th day before the calends of December, November 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Antonio Mario Besozzi.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in piety, learning, and character, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>From Zurich.</p>
