      <p>Most illustrious man, the Bishop of Bayonne sends to you along with this my letter certain manuscripts, indeed mine (to immediately reveal the author), which I desire you to read and examine most diligently, and I hope that reading them will not be unpleasant to you; I know your intellect and judgment, and how you are not merely a pure theologian, but understand other matters that pertain to the administration of great civic affairs. You will easily judge to what end these were written; when the occasion of the diet (assembly) arises, we will print them translated into German.</p>
      <p>Here first I ask that you sincerely write what you think, and also add in your letters "I would have liked you to add this and this or to have omitted this and this." Then, after you have read them, send them with the enclosed letters of mine to Mr. Bassafontaneus, to whom I write, so that after reading them he may send them back to you. When you have received them, do not entrust them to anyone along with your critiques to be brought to me, whom you do not know to be most certain; but keep them with you until either a most certain messenger appears, or I send my own. The matter is not unworthy of your labor; therefore, there is no need for me to excuse myself, as if I am imposing such things on you in which you would waste good hours poorly. Our Duke, August Elector, the Elector Palatine, and the Landgrave and Otto Heinrich Palatine had sent a certain messenger earnestly requesting from the King of the French that it be permitted for Charles de Moulins to take his wife out of France and sell his goods; but they could obtain nothing, not even good words. No one doubts that this was denied out of hatred for our religion. May the Lord enlighten him.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well, and help me with your prayers and those of the church, as I am involved in no small envy and hatred, not so much because I am a foreigner (especially an Italian) as because I agree with you and openly criticize many things; thus it befits a Christian to depend on God, not on men. TÃ¼bingen, 23 February 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
