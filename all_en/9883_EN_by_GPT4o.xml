      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you, honorable lord and compater, yesterday at nightfall a few things that came to my mind in a tumultuous manner. Today, scarcely had that messenger departed when your courier arrived, bringing me your letters, from which I understand that you are in doubt about which writing of the Heidelbergers I understood this, which I recently wrote to my brother that they refer to that in the letters they wrote to us. I truly think they refer to both; for those letters seem to have been written by them in the middle of that time, when they wrote the earlier and later ones to you, or indeed at the very time when they wrote the later ones to you; our letters were brought to us by our courier, who was in Heidelberg. And indeed, it pains me that I do not have them at hand now, so that from the inscription or date, as they call it, I might see at what time they were written; for Musculus has them, who is away from the city these days.</p>
      <p>However, I think, if I remember correctly, that they were written on the 8th of January or thereabouts; whatever it is, this seems to matter little, nor is the matter perhaps placed in such a necessity of haste. Since, however, it seems to you that a special messenger should be sent for this matter and he is perhaps on the way, I cannot contradict your advice and we will gladly inspect everything and according to our mediocrity, we will confer what seems and is suggested. Meanwhile, so that I might not send this one back to you completely empty-handed, I wanted to send at least this beforehand and, if there is anything more, I will write through that one of yours, whom you will send.</p>
      <p>My brothers, friends, and all my household greet you and yours very much.</p>
      <p>Bern, on the calends of February 1575.</p>
      <p>I will remember your relative from Rüti and will help him when some opportunity presents itself.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>After I wrote this, Steiger sent me this note, which I wanted to include here for you to inspect.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord and relative, these letters are given.</p>
