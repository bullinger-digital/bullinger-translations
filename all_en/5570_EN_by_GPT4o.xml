      <p>If Johannes Utenhove from Ghent, an exile and poor man, comes to you, I ask you to do good to him for the sake of charity.</p>
      <p>I do not know for sure whether he is a relative of our Johannes Utenhove; he seems to be a good man, he spent two days with me.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
