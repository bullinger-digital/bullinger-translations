      <p>Greetings. You have Mr. Christoph Tretius as a living letter, who can tell you everything that is currently known here and in Geneva from France, especially about the second conflict that took place on the 7th of this month, in which it is reported that Guise was killed, although many still doubt this.</p>
      <p>There are others who say that he was stabbed by the constable's son.</p>
      <p>I do not yet believe either.</p>
      <p>Then about the defection of Adresi and his capture, and about Cond√©, where and how he is being held.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to add to this, except that Consul Steiger and all friends send you their greetings.</p>
      <p>Diesbach was about to write through Froschauer, if he had not left so quickly; now he sends these letters.</p>
      <p>My father-in-law, mother, and all the household also send you their greetings. Also, send greetings to all yours in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 21, 1563. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>[To the most illustrious man] Mr. Heinrich [Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the] Zurich [church, his] honorable [lord and dearest godfather].</p>
