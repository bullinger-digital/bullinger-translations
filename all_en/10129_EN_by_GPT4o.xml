      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ our Savior beforehand.</p>
      <p>Know, beloved Master Heinrich, as you recently wrote to me regarding our deacon, requesting from me (from me) as far as we might lack him, and his manners, conduct, pious nature, and other abilities (skills) might be found in him as an honorable preacher, to then send him to some of the mentioned deficient places to fulfill etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding this, I have nothing else to report than that he is right in all respects, along with all those I have inquired about, nothing else than that he is a preacher adorned with manners and customs, etc. And although we cannot well lack his particular diligence, which he has used here and around us so far, yet our minds are all the more inclined to promote further the fruit of the gospel in his unknown places; for it does not seem helpful to us or our benefit, which is now perhaps (presumably) withheld, to deny it at this time. However, with such complete confidence in you, he will be rewarded according to his merit, not neglected, etc. Hereby you should also be assured that your request and plea to take one indicated in his place will be honored to the best of my ability, etc.</p>
      <p>Now taking this brief report from me in haste, if necessary, to expect more, etc.</p>
      <p>Greeting all of us, who have greeted us, especially our faithful Leon, with the desire, always willing to look after our affairs, as you, our cousin, usually do, according to your loyal disposition, always adorn, etc.</p>
      <p>Given on the 1st of June in the year 32.</p>
      <p>Johannes Buchser, whom you know as yours.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, wise, especially learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his especially beloved lord and brother.</p>
