      <p>My willing service is always ready beforehand.</p>
      <p>Gracious lord, I have well understood your letter, given on the 21st day of January, and thank you most highly for your loyalty, willing effort, and earnestness, which you have shown and have towards us, etc. Therefore, my friendly request to you further is to always report to me everything you may learn that might serve and be good for us, and let no cost or effort hinder you from doing so, and send the same by a messenger if you have no other certainty; the messenger will be well rewarded. I also especially ask you, when your messengers return home from the day, to report their dealings to me. Everything that I learn for certain shall also always be shared with you without delay.</p>
      <p>Then know that my gracious lords are assembled today with theirs in Bern, in the name of God, setting out with great earnestness and force with a city banner and a shooters' banner. 6000 men have been summoned, with Hauptmann (Captain) Säckelmeister Nägeli, Lieutenant Banneret Wingarten, Banneret Leonhard Brenzikofer, and Shooters' Banneret the former Schultheiss (Mayor) of Burgdorf, Tillier. Furthermore, two free banners are appointed, one led by Hauptmann Jörg Hubelmann and Jakob May, the other by the leaders who have fought for them before, Jakob Wildermuth and Erhard Burger from Nidau, so that I believe they will be about ten thousand with the free servants. Additionally, they are bringing 16 cannons with them. May the Lord grant His grace and strength to free the poor captives and that this war may further God's honor and the true faith, as I also have undoubted hope.</p>
      <p>Herewith commended to God. Your cousin Götz is on the journey.</p>
      <p>Given on Saturday, the 22nd of January, in the year 36.</p>
      <p>Your ever gracious Sulpitius Haller, Obervogt (Chief Bailiff) of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word and the church in the greater Zurich, my gracious lord and benefactor.</p>
