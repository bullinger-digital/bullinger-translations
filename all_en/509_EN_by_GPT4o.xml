      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, brother and most esteemed colleague.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Since the brevity of time does not permit me to respond to your letters now, I wish to testify to you that hardly any letters have ever come from you that were more pleasing, as they have greatly helped to alleviate my domestic grief, which was greatly troubling me, having arisen shortly before from the death of my wife. For I rejoice greatly that there is hardly anything, or very little, left for us to agree upon in words as well. Certainly, if you think it expedient, I will not refuse to come there in person, so that you may have a better understanding of all the feelings of my mind. Nor will it ever be my fault if we do not unite in solid peace, so that we may all profess the same Christ with one voice.</p>
      <p>But now another reason has impelled me to write. You indicate in part what prevents you from the French alliance. Rightly, I confess, the pious are terrified by the example of Jehoshaphat, who entangled himself in the ill-fated association with the impious king to his own and the kingdom's ruin. However, I interpret that he did not suffer punishment merely because he made a treaty with the king of Israel, but rather because he undertook a bad and wicked cause to satisfy his ambition. He was driven by ambition to provoke the Syrians. Jehoshaphat complies and rashly takes up arms. Moreover, they stubbornly rush in, even though the Lord clearly forbade it through Micaiah. Therefore, this example does not hold so much weight with me that I consider any alliance with the impious to be illicit.</p>
      <p>For I see that Abraham is not hindered by any religious obligation from making a friendship with Abimelech. I see Isaac, David, and others doing the same, and no reproof or punishment followed. Thus, I indeed conclude: such alliances are not to be sought after, as they always contain great danger. However, if some just reason compels us, or even urges us, there is no reason to completely abhor them. As for this alliance in question, I fear it so much that I think it should be avoided, unless the current state of affairs compels me to the contrary.</p>
      <p>You are dealing with a professed enemy of Christ, who daily rages against our brothers. He deserves little trust, who would wish us to be destroyed along with Christ. It is absurd for us to form a friendship with him who wages a common war against all the servants of Christ, to embrace that hand as an ally which is stained with innocent blood.</p>
      <p>And certainly, I would not want anything to be transacted unless it was expressly and explicitly provided for the pious brothers. For his officers now rage everywhere with astonishing cruelty. There is also the suspicion of an English war. For I do not think it right to provide any assistance to attack a kingdom where Christ is worshiped. And the very injustice of the cause is another obstacle. But again, when I consider how afflicted our affairs are, how many calamities still hang over us, which almost threaten the devastation of the church, I greatly fear that if we neglect those aids which are now lawful, it may be attributed more to excessive security than to pious trust. Nor am I unaware that God is most present and powerfully assists us when all human resources fail us. I also know that nothing is more difficult than, when some shadow of Egypt presents itself, not to turn our eyes there, which, unless fixed on God alone, wander badly and disastrously. Therefore, these dangers must be diligently countered. Meanwhile, however, we must be careful not to refuse, in our great straits, those things which could have been a help without offending God, and later feel to our detriment that we were too secure.</p>
      <p>First, I fear that our Pharaoh, excluded from all hope of forming a friendship with you, will turn to Antiochus. Although they have serious reasons for discord, this latter is a marvelous artificer in devising pretexts. And those who rule in our court today will desire nothing more than to bend the mind of the inexperienced and not very wise young man to accept any conditions of peace. Certainly, unless he achieves something, he will soon throw himself away. Nor will there be a lack of those who will precipitate him. And I wish there were none among us who would sell themselves and us to Antiochus, if such an opportunity were given. Whatever he attempts, he will do it not only with the applause but with the assistance of that one, because he will think to avenge his rejection in this way. Meanwhile, cruelty will be inflamed everywhere in the kingdom itself. For, as women are wont to do, he will turn his fury elsewhere. We must not consider this place of little importance. If I wished to consult for my life or private interests, I would immediately go elsewhere.</p>
      <p>But while I consider how much this corner has to do with the propagation of Christ's kingdom, I am rightly concerned about its protection. And here also your advantage and some peace are partly involved. What will not despair drive a man imbued with evil counsels to do, when he has been alienated from you? Do you think we lack men, partly restless and eager for new things, partly hungry, who would extend a hand to him from afar? Especially, however, whenever I think of the wretched brothers who lie oppressed under that dire tyranny, my mind softens and inclines more to what will be more useful for their relief. It is easy to see where the tyrant's rage will break out, when he sees himself despised and rejected, how much greater license the wicked will have to harass the innocent. But if some alliance intervenes, while Pharaoh himself will be somewhat mitigated in the present, and the executioners will dare less, then indeed a way will be open in the future to extinguish the fires. Therefore, my dear Bullinger, I beg and beseech you, while there is time, to weigh all these things. If your people enter into any agreement, strive and ensure that they remember their brothers, whose condition is so miserable and harsh.</p>
      <p>For although I know that their safety is sufficiently commended to you, and I trust you will be willing to care for it when the occasion arises, I did not want to fail in my part. His ferocity is such that he will not at all endure a certain law being prescribed to him. Yet I hope it can be obtained that some moderation is applied.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man and brother, much esteemed in the Lord. Many greetings to Mr. Theodor, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gualter, Werduler, and the other colleagues.</p>
      <p>My colleagues also greet you, among others Gallasius. I pray the Lord Jesus to continue to guide you with His spirit, to be with you, and to bless your labors. I am very grateful to you for the volume of sermons sent in your name by Haller.</p>
      <p>On the Nones of May 1549.</p>
