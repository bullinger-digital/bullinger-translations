      <p>Greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ. I confess, most distinguished Bullinger, my slowness in writing, but this does not diminish my love and faith towards you. The reason I am writing this letter to you now is because of an Englishman, a man of exceptional piety, learning, and noble lineage, who, having left his homeland, wife, and children to travel to Italy, has decided to visit you, as is customary for great men passing through. I did not want him to come to you without this letter from me, from which you might understand the spirit in which Borrhaus regards both you and other distinguished men, and not to urge you to show your offices and studies full of humanity towards this man, which would be nothing other than encouraging a runner to run. Farewell, most illustrious man, and count Borrhaus among your friends. I wish all good men with you to be well in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel. Your Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his friend and brother in the Lord, to be respected.</p>
