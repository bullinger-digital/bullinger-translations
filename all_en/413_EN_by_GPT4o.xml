      <p>Strasbourg, January 22, 1549.</p>
      <p>Greetings. My close friend Gabriell has conveyed your greetings to me, most kind Bullinger, and also told me that you are eagerly awaiting my letters. However, since I previously had nothing worthy of writing, what would I achieve with trivial and frivolous remarks, causing you to waste your valuable time? But now that some opportunity, however small, has presented itself, I cannot remain silent.</p>
      <p>Mr. Richard, a dear friend of mine and a great admirer of yours, wrote to me that he has received letters, and asked me to inform you of this. He did not have the leisure to write; also (as you know) he does not willingly write in Latin. Nevertheless, he will respond shortly.</p>
      <p>The news he wrote is partly joyful and partly very sad: joyful, because there is hope for some reform in religion, although not perfect and complete. Meanwhile, however, under the guise of religion and freedom, they imitate carnal license, those who wish to be the most evangelical (so to speak); every kind of vice flourishes among them, alas, especially adultery and fornication, which sin (as he writes) they do not consider. Unless this evil is corrected, we are doomed.</p>
      <p>I would have written more; however, the courier does not allow it; he is pressing. Therefore, what remains, you will understand from these enclosed English letters translated by Hoper. I wrote to him about the victory of the English over the Scots, how they took the city; I hope he has shared it with you. Our Strasbourg remains as before, and the rumors about it and the bishop are false. Pray for us continually. Farewell and greet all the learned men.</p>
      <p>Please inform Mr. Butler that Richard has also received his letters. Farewell again. Yours, John Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in the Minster, my kind lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
