  <output>I, Ioachim Vad, send to you my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote in a sudden burst of enthusiasm when I noticed what hostility our pagan countrymen had towards the people of Zurich, in appearance at least, but actually against the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion we should rely on this, that those of us who have given our name to Christ in sincere understanding of His word, although we have been deprived of our alliances and afflicted in our fellowship, should nevertheless promote the faith that we have once received, understood and recognized with the most unanimous of wishes, despite our difficulties. Driven by this, I would rather bring nightingales to Athens, as they say, than to fail either in my duty or in charity, which is the teacher of all duty. Therefore, my dearest Bullinger brother, take special care to inflame and encourage your spirit in this, so that they do not let themselves be driven from their place of faith in Christ by evil arts. Only then will they be seen to embrace Christ, when, after so many hardships, they are no less ready to persist in His honour than they were to conquer, for I will not even mention that the truest victory and indeed the true profession of Christianity is that which is achieved by the uplifting of our spirits in our tribulations, not by strength, by confession not by arms, for the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of enemies.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote with a sudden heat when I saw what spirit was in our pagans against the people of Zurich, in appearance indeed, but in reality against the sanctity of our gospel. In this, in my opinion, we should insist, that those who have given the name of Christ from a sincere understanding of his word, although deprived of leagues and afflicted in society, yet with constant minds and with that love wherewith we have proposed the truth to be worshipped, should with the most hearty consent promote the faith once received and known and considered. Being thus induced, I chose rather to bear the "nightingales," as they are called, to Athens, than to be wanting either to my duty or to charity, which is the mistress of all duty. Take care, o Bullinger, my dearest brother, to inflame and encourage your souls in this, that they suffer not themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be thought to embrace Christ when, after so many afflictions, they shall be no less conquerors in maintaining this honour than they were before conquerors, that I may not speak of that most true and, as it were, proper victory of the Christian profession, by which in straits and tribulations, being raised in mind by spirit, and not by strength, by confession and not by arms, by the glory of Christ and not by the destruction of their enemies, they are all one. By this way it is profitable to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done contrary to the honour of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zuinglius loved it, not for revenge, but for the keeping and defending of truth. By this very thing, if those who fight perish, they conquer with great glory, having no greater use than to strive with Christ and not with the Aecians or the Britons.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my most loving Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote suddenly with a certain warmth, when I observed what was the intention of our pagans against the Zurich people, in appearance, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion this should be the basis, that we who have given to Christ a sincere name of understanding from His word, however stripped of our alliances and afflicted society, with resolute minds and with that love with which we have proposed to ourselves to venerate truth, may promote the faith, once received, understood and examined, with the most harmonious desires. Being induced by this, I chose rather to carry the night-owls, as it were, to Athens, than to fall short in duty or in charity, which is the mistress of all duty. Take particularly care, o Bullinger, my most loving brother, that you may inflame, and encourage your spirits in this, that they not suffer themselves to be cast down from their degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only shall they be seen embracing Christ, when, after so many afflictions, they shall be no less victorious in maintaining this honor, than they were while conquering, that I may not mention that the last and most true victory, and indeed proper to the Christian profession, is that in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in spirit, not in strength, in confession, not in arms, to the glory of Christ, not to the slaughter of their enemies. By this way, through the midst of Satan's troops, it is a pleasure to go with patience, provided that nothing be done contrary to the grace of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zuinglius loved, not for revenge, but for retaining and preserving truth. By this very thing, if those who fight, perish, they conquer with great glory, since they have no use more famous than that with which they contend with Christ, not with Achaians or Brutuses. They are eager, not for the shedding of blood, but for holding fast the Lord's word. But the Lord will give strength, both of arms and of forces, to those who trust, provided that our design be right, which we are endeavoring.</output>

For we love the use of arms, as Zuinglius did, not for revenge, but instituted for retaining and protecting the truth. By this, if those who fight perish, they overcome with great glory, since they have no more glorious use than that of striving, not with the Accii or Bruttii, but with Christ. They are eager, not to draw blood, but to retain the Lord's word. But the Lord will give strength, both of arms and of forces, to the faithful, provided that the purpose we are attempting be right. "I will not leave you nor forsake you," [Josh 1:5] said our God full of faith and truth to Joshua, when he was going against the enemies and undertaking a difficult province. Therefore, let no tyranny snatch us away.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote with sudden warmth when I observed what animosity our pagans had, in appearance towards the people of Zurich, but in reality towards the holiness of our Gospel. In this matter I believe that we should persist, that is, that we, who in sincerity of heart have given our name to Christ after understanding His word, impoverished and afflicted in our society, yet with steadfast minds and the same love with which we have set ourselves to honor truth, should, with the utmost harmony of wills, promote the faith once received, known and understood. Thus I have been induced to carry the night owls, as it is said, to Athens rather than to neglect either duty or charity, which is the mistress of all duties. Take care above all, o Bullinger, my dearest brother, to inflame and encourage your spirits in this, lest they should allow themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by vicious arts. Then only will they be seen to embrace Christ, when, after so many hardships, they shall have been found no less valiant in defending His honor, than they were when victorious, not to mention that the very truest victory and proper character of the Christian profession is that in which, in straits and tribulation, with raised spirits they are one in spirit, not in strength, in confession, not in arms, in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of their enemies. By this way, through the midst of Satan's troops, it is well to go with patience, provided nothing be done contrary to the decency of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but instituted for maintaining and defending truth. Thus, if those who fight perish, they conquer with great glory, since they have no more excellent use than to contend with Christ and not with the Achaeans or Brutus. They are eager not for drawing blood but for retaining the Lord's word. And the Lord will give courage, either of arms or of strength, to those who trust Him, provided their design is right, which we are endeavoring. «I will not leave you nor forsake you» [Jos 1:5], said God, full of faith and truth, to Joshua who was going to war with his enemies and undertaking a hard mission. Therefore it is not to be feared that any tyrants should snatch us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils and, being shaken like by storms, put no trust in the world but in Him who has conquered the world. Antonio has succeeded excellently, relying upon his own arts.</output>

  <output>I send to you, most beloved Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote down in a sudden burst of emotion when I noticed what attitude our pagans had taken against the people of Zurich, which was in appearance against them but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion we should rely on this: that we, who have taken the name of Christ from a sincere understanding of his word, although being deprived of agreements and distressed in our fellowship, yet with steadfast minds and with the love with which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be worshipped, should rather promote the faith that has been received, understood and perceived with the greatest possible harmony of desires. Being so prompted, I chose rather to bring night-ravens, as it is said, to Athens than to be absent from duty or from charity, which is the mistress of all duties. Take care, most beloved brother Bullinger, above all else, that you inflame and encourage your people in this, so that they do not let themselves be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then will they indeed be seen to embrace Christ when, after so many afflictions, they shall have been no less victorious in maintaining his honour than they were when they were conquerors, so that I need not mention that this is the very truest victory and indeed the proper profession of Christianity, in which they are exalted in spirit, not by strength, in confession, not by arms, in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of their enemies, in tribulations and straits. By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of the devil's throngs, provided nothing is committed against the comely piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zuinglius loved it, not for revenge, but instituted for the retaining and keeping of truth. So if those who fight perish, they gain great glory, for they have not a more glorious use than to contend with Christ and not with the Achaeans or the Britons. They are eager to retain the Lord's word, not to draw blood. But the Lord will also give strength, either of arms or power, to the faithful, provided the purpose is right which we are attempting. «I will not leave thee nor forsake thee» [Jos 1,5], said God full of faith and truth to Joshua when he was about to go forth to the enemies and to undertake a very difficult mission. Therefore there is no cause why any tyranny should snatch us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils and, being thus tossed about as by storms, should not put our trust in the world, but in Him who has conquered the world. Antonio of ours has succeeded well, depending on his own efforts. He has long hands and a fat purse. There are those who willingly plunge into this whirlpool, provided they can get their prey, though with the peril of their souls, which is what foolish fishes usually do.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote with a sudden warmth when I noticed what was in the hearts of our pagans against the Zurich people, in appearance indeed, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this, in my opinion, we must take our stand, that we who have given our name to Christ with a sincere understanding of his word, however deprived of alliances and oppressed in society, yet with steady minds and with that love with which we have proposed truth to be venerated by us, should promote the faith received, once and for all, and now known and seen, with the most harmonious desires. Being moved by this, I preferred to bring the owls, as it were, to Athens rather than to be wanting either in duty or in charity, which is the teacher of all duty. Take most care, o Bullinger, dearest brother, to inflame and encourage your spirits in this, that they should not allow themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by wicked artifices. Then only will they be seen to embrace Christ, when, after so many troubles, they will be no less resolute in retaining this honor than they were victorious, so that I need not mention that the victory is only truly their own and indeed proper to the Christian profession, whereby, in straits and tribulations, their minds are exalted, not with strength, but with confession, not with arms, but with the glory of Christ, not with the slaughter of the enemy. By this way, indeed, it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done contrary to the comely piety. For we love to use arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for vengeance, but instituted for the retaining and defending of truth. And thus, if those who fight perish, they win with great glory, since they have no more glorious use than to contend with Christ, not with the Achaeans or the Brutii. They are eager to retain, not the shedding of blood, but the word of the Lord. But the Lord will also give strength both of arms and of strength to the faithful, provided the purpose is right, which we are devising. For our God, full of faith and truth, said to Joshua, when about to go against the enemy and to undertake a difficult province, «I will not leave thee nor forsake thee» [Josh 1:5]. Consequently there is no need for us to be carried away by any tyrant. This is the spirit of our profession, that we be exercised by evils, and even when shaken, we trust not in the world, but in Him who has conquered the world. To our friend Antronius it has gone well, relying on his own arts. He has long hands and a fat flock. Into this net some plunge of their own accord, provided they get their bait, though with peril of their souls, which is what foolish fishes usually do. But oh, glory to God, who has made us conquerors through truth, though so much beset by evils!</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion I hastily wrote down with a sudden warmth, when I noticed what an ill feeling our pagans had against the people of Zurich, though in appearance rather than in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this I think we must base ourselves, that we who have given ourselves to Christ in a sincere understanding of his word, however stripped of our alliances and distressed in our society, yet with steadfast minds and the love with which we have proposed to honour the truth, may promote our once received, known and understood faith with the most harmonious desires. Being induced by this, I preferred to bear the night owls, as it's put, to Athens, rather than fail in duty or charity itself, which is the teacher of all duty. Take the greatest care about this, o Bullinger, dearest brother, to inflame and encourage your souls in this, lest they allow themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by wicked arts. Then only will they be seen to embrace Christ when, having been vanquished by so great afflictions, they shall be no less diligent in retaining this honour, than they were when victorious, that I may not mention that only the very truth of victory and even the very property of Christian profession is that by which, in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in spirit, not by strength, by confession, not by arms, for the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of enemies. By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, only let nothing be done against the decency of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved it, not for revenge, but instituted for retaining and defending the truth. By it they who fight indeed, if they perish, overcome with a great glory, having no more excellent use than to strive with Christ, not with the Accians or the Britons. They are eager not to drink blood but to retain the word of the Lord. The Lord also will give strength and courage to them that trust him, if their design be right, which we are attempting. "I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee," said our God to Joshua, going against his enemies and undergoing a most difficult province, full of faith and truth. Therefore let no tyrant carry us away with any sinister intentions. This is the genius of our profession, that we may be exercised by evils and even, being shaken as it were by storms, not trust in the world, but in him who has conquered the world. Antonio has prospered well, depending on his own arts. He has long hands and a large flock. Into this net there are some who fall voluntarily, provided they can feed, though with danger to their souls, which is usually the case with foolish fishes. But oh! Glory to God, who has made us victorious through truth, though oppressed by so many evils! He overcomes, but with art and fraud, that is, Satan. We overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, with which we may sprinkle our brows with honour.</output>

  <output>I send to you, dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I hastily composed in a certain heat when I noticed what bad feeling our pagans had against the people of Zurich, though not in appearance but in reality against the holiness of our gospel.In my opinion, we must stand on this: that we who have given our name to Christ in sincere understanding of his word, however stripped of treaties and afflicted by society, nevertheless with constant minds and with that love with which we have proposed the truth for us to worship, should promote the faith, once received, known, and understood, with the most harmonious desires.Being induced by this, I chose rather to bring my nocturnal owls, as it were, to Athens than to fail in duty or in love itself, which is the teacher of all duty.Take special care of this, dearest Bullinger, loving brother, that you inflame and encourage your spirits not to allow themselves to be cast down from the step of faith in Christ by evil arts.Then they will be seen to embrace Christ, when, after so many afflictions endured, they will be no less zealous in preserving this honor than when they were victorious, that I need not mention that this is the very truth of victory and properly the profession of Christianity, by which in narrow straits and tribulations, their minds being exalted, they conquer by spirit, not by strength, by confession, not by arms, the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of enemies.By this way it is delightful to pass through the midsts of the devil's troops, provided nothing be committed contrary to the decency of piety.We do indeed love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but to retain and defend the truth.By this means, if those who are fighting are destroyed, yet they do greatly conquer, since they have no more renowned use than to contend with Christ, not with the Achaeans or the Britons.They are eager not to draw blood, but to retain the word of the Lord.And the Lord will give strength and arms to those who trust, provided the undertaking be right, which we are attempting.«I will not leave thee nor forsake thee» [Josh 1:5], said the God of our faith and truth full of faith to Joshua, who was going forth against his enemies and undertaking a difficult province.Therefore it is not that any tyrant should snatch us away with sinister designs.This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils, and so, though shaken as by tempests, not trust the world but him who has conquered the world.Our Anthony has succeeded well, trusting in his own arts.He has long hands and a fat purse.Some willingly creep into this net, so long as they may be fed, though with danger to their souls, as fools' fish usually are.But o the glory to God, who has made us conquerors by truth, though beset by so many evils!He prevails, but by art and guile, that is, by the devil.We conquer in this, that we have the grace of God in our hand, by which we may overspread the face of this man with shame.Finally, that he may obtain the most, to fill up his foolishness, yet we are allowed to lead our lives safe from his lust, not only for ourselves but for our country and subjects.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote with a sudden warmth when I noticed what was in the hearts of our heathen against the inhabitants of Zurich, in appearance only, but in truth against the holiness of our Gospel.In my opinion, this is what we should rely on: that those of us who have given the name of Christians to ourselves according to an understanding of the word of Christ, though stripped of our alliances and afflicted society, yet with constant spirits and with that love with which we have proposed the truth to be worshipped, may promote the faith received, acknowledged and examined with the most harmonious wishes.Being induced by this, I preferred to bear the night-owls, as it were, to Athens, rather than to be wanting either in duty or in charity, which is the mistress of all duty.Take care of this above all, o Bullinger, dearest brother, that you inflame and encourage your own to let not the wiles of the wicked cause them to be cast down from their degree of faith in Christ.Then they shall be truly embraced by Christ when, after so many afflictions, they shall be no less victorious in retaining this honor, than they were when conquering, so that I need not mention that the true victory and even the proper profession of Christianity is that by which, in straits and tribulations, with elevated spirits and according to the spirit, not force, with confession, not arms, for the glory of Christ, not the slaughter of enemies, they are united.It is pleasant to go by this way through the middle of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done contrary to a becoming piety; for we love the use of arms, such as Zuinglius did love, not for revenge, but for the retaining and defending of the truth.By this very thing, if those who fight perish, they overcome with great glory, having no other use than that by which they contend with Christ, not with the Acchians or Brutians.They are eager to retain, not to draw blood, but the word of the Lord.And the Lord will give them strength of arms and strength of power, provided the enterprise be right which we undertake.For he said, full of faith and truth, to Joshua, who was about to go against his enemies and was undertaking a most difficult province: "I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee" [Josh 1:5].Therefore it is not that any tyrant should snatch us away by his wicked arts.This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils, and yet not trust the world, though shaken, but in Him who has conquered the world.Our Antronius has succeeded very well, trusting in his own arts.He has long hands and a fat purse.Into this net there are some who voluntarily plunge, provided they be feasted, though with the peril of their souls, which is usually the case with foolish water-fowl.But o the glory to God, who has made us, though beset with so many evils, victorious by truth!He overcomes, but by art and deceit, that is, by Satan.We overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may stain this forehead with shame.Moreover, that he may gain his full purpose, we are permitted to act contrary to his will, not only for ourselves, but also for the country and its subjects.For to them is left the free choice of the faith by the grace of the Lord, and they will not want ministers to be maintained with their own money.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I hastily wrote down in a certain warmth of feeling when I noticed what evil intention was in the minds of our heathen against the people of Zurich, although in appearance it was something else than an attack on the sanctity of our gospel.In my opinion, this is what we should hold to: that we, who in true understanding of His word have taken the name of Christ, should, although stripped of alliances and oppressed in our society, yet with constant mind and with that love with which we have proposed the truth to be revered, promote the faith, once received, known, and seen, with the most perfect agreement of our desires.Moved by this, I chose, as it were, to take the night-owls to Athens, rather than to fail in my duty or in charity itself, which is the mistress of all duty.Take care, my dearest brother Bullinger, that you inflame and encourage your minds in this, that they may not suffer themselves to be driven from the step of faith in Christ by the wicked arts of Satan.Then only will they be said to have embraced Christ, when, having been raised up in so many afflictions, they shall be no less victorious in maintaining His honour, than they were before in conquering, not to mention that this is indeed the most true and proper victory of the Christian profession, wherein, in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in spirit, not in strength, in confession, not in arms, to the glory of Christ, not to the slaughter of their enemies.It is a great pleasure to go this way through the midsts of Satan's troops, so long as nothing be done against the honour of piety.For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved it, not to revenge, but to maintain and keep the truth.Whereby, if those that fight perish, they overcome with great glory, having no greater use than to contend with Christ, not with Accius or Brutus.They are eager to retain, not to draw blood, but the word of the Lord.But the Lord will also give strength of arms and strength of power to the faithful, so long as their purpose be right, which we are attempting.For unto Joshua, going forth against his enemies and undertaking a difficult enterprise, the full of faith and truth, our God said, «I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee» [Jos 1,5].Therefore, there is no cause why any tyrants should carry us away.This is the genius of our profession, that we may be exercised with evils, and even when shaken, we may not trust in the world, but in Him that hath overcome the world.Our Antonio hath prospered well, trusting to his own arts.He hath long hands and a fat purse.Some willingly leap into this net, provided they have their bait, though with hazard of their souls, which is usually the case with foolish fishes.But to the glory of God, who hath set us victorious over all these evils by the truth!Satan overcomes indeed, but by art and guile; that is, by usury.We overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may sprinkle our forehead with honour.Finally, that he may the more fully accomplish his folly, yet may we, being safe, act contrary to his will, not only to ourselves, but to the country and people.For unto these is left the free choice of faith, by the grace of the Lord, who shall not want ministers to be maintained by their own means.So great is their love to Christ, who have truly believed.</output>

  <output>I send to you, most loving Bullinger, a suggestion which I hastily wrote down in a certain heat of feeling, when I had observed what was the temper of our heathen towards the Zurich people, in form indeed, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel.In this, in my opinion, we should persist, that those of us who have given the name of Christians to Christ, from a sincere apprehension of his word, however stripped of alliances and afflicted in their society, yet with steady minds, and with that love which we have proposed for the truth to be revered, should with the utmost concord of desires, promote the faith once received, known, and understood.Being influenced by this consideration, I chose rather to run the night-hazards, as they say, of Athens, than to be wanting either in my duty, or in that charity which is the mistress of all duties.Take care, o Bullinger, most loving brother, that you may kindle and encourage your spirits in this, that they suffer not themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ, by wicked arts.Then only will they be said to embrace Christ, when after so many hardships endured, they shall be no less steady in maintaining this honor, than they were victorious, in that I need not mention that victory is the truest, and indeed the proper victory of the Christian profession, when in straits and troubles their minds are elevated by the spirit, not by strength, by a confession, not by arms, with the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of enemies.By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done contrary to the decorum of piety.For we indeed approve of the use of arms, as Zuinglius did, not for revenge, but for the purpose of retaining and defending truth.And hence, if those who fight perish, they yet overcome with great glory, in that they have no more glorious use of them, than that in which they contend, not with the Achaeans or Bruti, but with Christ.They are eager, not to shed blood, but to retain the Lord's word.And the Lord will give courage and strength to the trusting, both of arms and of forces, provided the enterprise be right, which we are going about.For the Lord full of faith and truth said to Joshua, when he was about to go up against the enemies, and to undertake a difficult province, «I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee» [Josh. 1:5].Wherefore we shall not be carried away by any tyrants.This is the genius of our profession, that we may be exercised by evils, and so, though shaken as by storms, may not rely on the world, but on Him who has overcome the world.Our Antronius succeeded well, depending on his own arts.He has long hands and a fat purse.Into this net there are some who of their own accord jump, provided they be feasted, though with peril of their souls, which is usually the case with foolish fishes.But o the glory to God, who has made us conquerors through truth, though beset with so many evils!He overcomes indeed by craft and guile, that is, by Satan.We in this overcome, in that we have in our hands the grace of God, by which we may sprinkle our forehead with modesty.And thus, while he may be most successful in filling up his own folly, we may yet live safe from his lust, not only we ourselves, but also our country and our subjects.For unto them is left the free choice of faith, by the grace of the Lord; neither shall they want ministers to be maintained at their own charge.So great is the love to Christ in those who have truly believed.But we have suffered greater things.</output>

  <output>I send to you, most beloved Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote down with a sudden warmth when I had observed what kind of spirit our pagans had against the people of Zurich, which in appearance was against them, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this, in my opinion, it is necessary to rely upon, that we who have given Christ a sincere name from the understanding of His word, however stripped of alliances and distressed in society, yet with constant minds and with that love with which we have proposed to worship the truth once received, acknowledged and understood, should promote it with most concordant desires. Induced by this, I chose to bring, as it is said, “nightingales to Athens” rather than to be absent either in duty or love, which is the mistress of all duty. Take care, o Bullinger, most beloved brother, to inflame and encourage your minds in this, so they do not let themselves be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be seen as embracing Christ, when, after so many afflictions, they shall be no less victorious in retaining this honour than they were when victorious, not to mention that this is at last the very true victory and proper profession of Christianity, in which in straits and tribulations, with exalted spirits and in one spirit, not by strength, but by confession, not by arms, but by the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of the enemy, they will be victorious. By this way, it is pleasant to go through the troops of Satan with patience, provided nothing is committed against the decency of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but for retaining and defending the truth. By this very thing, if they perish that fight, they gain a great glory, since they have no use more famous than that with which they contend with Christ, and not with the Accians or the Britons. They are eager not for drawing blood, but for retaining the word of the Lord. And the Lord will give strength to the trusting, both of arms and of strength, provided the purpose is right, which we are pursuing. “I will not leave thee nor forsake thee” [Jos 1:5], the Lord full of faith and truth said to Joshua, going against the enemies and undertaking a difficult province. Therefore it is not that any tyrant should take us away with a sinister force. This is the spirit of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils and thus shaken, not trusting to the world, but to Him who has conquered the world. Antonio has succeeded very well, depending upon his own arts. He has long hands and a fat flock. There are those who willingly leap into this net, provided they may be fed with bait, though with the danger of their souls, as is usual with foolish creatures. But o glory to God, who has set us victorious through truth, though tried by so many evils! He conquers with art and fraud, that is to say, with Satan. We conquer in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may cover the shame of this. Finally, that he may be most fully accomplished in his folly, yet we may act lawfully against his lust, and not us only, but also our field and subjects. To these is left the free option of faith through the grace of the Lord, nor shall they lack ministers to be maintained with their own money. So great is the love in Christ of those who have truly believed. But we have suffered more grievous things. The Lord will give to these also an end.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I hastily wrote down when I noticed what sort of spirit our pagans had against the people of Zurich, though in appearance rather than in reality against the holiness of our gospel.In my opinion, it is necessary to rely on this, that we, who have given our name to Christ from a sincere understanding of His word, however stripped of treaties and afflicted by society, nevertheless with steadfast souls and with that love by which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be honoured, should promote the faith once received, known and examined with most harmonious desires.Moved by this, I would rather bring nightingales, as it is said, to Athens, than fail either in duty or in charity itself, which is the mistress of all duties.Take great care of this, o Bullinger, dearest brother, that you inflame and encourage your souls in this, lest they allow themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts.Only then will they seem to have embraced Christ, when, having been so greatly afflicted, they shall have been no less valiant in retaining His honour than they were in conquering, not to mention that this is the very true and proper victory of the Christian profession, by which they are exalted in mind not by strength, in confession not by arms, in the glory of Christ not by the slaughter of enemies.By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, so long as nothing is done contrary to the modesty of piety.For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for vengeance, but established to retain and defend the truth.By this very thing, those who fight, although they perish, are crowned with a great glory, since they have no greater use than to contend with Christ, not with Accius or Brutus.They are eager to retain not the shedding of blood, but the word of the Lord.But the Lord will also give strength of arms and of forces to those who are confident, so long as their purpose is right, which we are attempting.For our God, full of faith and truth, said to Joshua, when he was about to go against his enemies and was undertaking a most difficult province, "I will not leave thee nor forsake thee" [Josh 1.5].Therefore it is not right that any tyrant should snatch us away.This is the genius of our profession, that we are exercised by evils, and that we should not trust in the world, though shaken, but in Him who has overcome the world.Antronius has succeeded well, trusting in his own arts.He has long hands and a fat purse.Some plunge of their own accord into this net, so long as they may be fed, although with the danger of their souls, which is usually the portion of foolish creatures.But oh, glory to God, who has established us victorious over evils by truth!He overcomes, but by craft and guile, that is, by Satan.We overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may bedew our brow with this honour.Finally, that he may be most successful in fulfilling his folly, yet we may act with impunity against his inclination, not only to us, but to our country and subjects.For to these is left the free option of faith by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be nourished of their own money.Such is the love to Christ of those who have truly believed.But we have suffered greater things.The Lord will give an end to these also.Take care that the people of Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, moreover, their ministers, are admonished not to hold back their hands in defending the common cause.</output>

I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote in a sudden heat, when I had observed what was in the mind of our Pagans against the citizens of Zurich, in show, indeed, but in fact against the holiness of our Gospel. In this my opinion it is to be relied upon, that we, who, with a sincere mind, have given name to Christ, from a sense of His words, however deprived of alliances and afflicted in our society, yet with constant minds, and with that love with which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be worshipped, may promote the faith, once received, known, and surveyed, with the most harmonious desires. Led on by this, I chose rather to bear the owl, as it were, to Athens, than to be wanting either in my duty or in charity itself, which is the mistress of all duties. Take the utmost care of this, O my dearest Bullinger, my most loving brother, that you may inflame and encourage the minds of your people, that they suffer not themselves to be drawn from their standing in the faith towards Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be accounted to embrace Christ, when, after so many afflictions, they shall have been no less victorious in maintaining this honour than they were in obtaining it; not to mention that the last and truest victory, and indeed the peculiar one of the Christian profession, is, when, in straits and tribulations, their minds are exalted with one spirit, not with strength, with confession, not with arms, to the glory of Christ, not to the slaughter of their enemies. By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done to the dishonour of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zuinglius did, not to revenge, but to retain and defend the truth. By this very means they that fight are conquered with great glory, if they have no other use of it than to resist with Christ, and not with the Achaeans or the Britons. They are eager, not to shed blood, but to retain the word of the Lord. And the Lord will give strength, both of arms and of forces, to them that trust in Him, provided their design be right, which we are aiming at. For our God, full of faith and truth, said to Joshua, going to fight against his enemies, and undertaking a difficult province, «I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee» [Josh. 1:5]. Therefore there is no cause why any tyrant should snatch us away. This is the genius of our profession, that, though battered by evils, we trust not to the world, but to Him that hath overcome the world. Our friend Antonio hath succeeded well, trusting to his own arts; he hath a long arm, and a fat purse. Some gladly creep into this net, provided they may be fed, though with danger of their souls, as foolish fishes usually are. But O the glory be to God, who hath made us more than conquerors by the truth, though afflicted with so many evils! He overcometh, but by art and guile; that is, by Satan. We overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may sprinkle our forehead with honour. At last, that he may be most successful in filling his kingdom with folly, yet it is lawful for us to proceed, notwithstanding his pleasure, and not only for us, but for our country and our subjects. To them is left a free choice of faith, by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained at their own cost. So great is their love to Christ, who have truly believed. But we have suffered greater things. God will give them an end also. Take care that the inhabitants of Bern, Basle, and Schaffhausen, with their ministers, be admonished not to keep their hands from defending a common cause. Believe me, what an impression these arguments will make upon them that are filled with the dew of the spirit! What more? Doth not God work in their hearts too?</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a proposal which I wrote in a sudden burst of heat when I observed what an unfriendly feeling in our pagan hearts was directed, in appearance, against the citizens of Zurich, but in reality against the sanctity of our Gospel. In my opinion, this is the point to which we should adhere: that we, who have assumed the name of Christians in a sincere sense of the word of Christ, however plundered of our treaties and afflicted in society, yet with constant minds and with that love with which we have proposed to ourselves truth to be honored, may promote the faith once received, known, and understood, with the most harmonious wishes. Being thus influenced, I chose rather to send owls, as it were, to Athens than to be absent either from duty or from the charity itself, which is the mistress of all duties. Take care, my dearest brother Bullinger, that you inflame and animate your mind in this matter, that they may not suffer themselves to be cast from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be deemed as embracing Christ, when, after so many calamities endured, they shall be no less constant in retaining his honor than when victorious; so as not to mention that this is the only true victory, and therefore the proper one of the Christian profession, that, in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in mind, not by strength, in confession, not by arms, in the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of their enemies. By this way, through the midst of Satan's troops, it is pleasant to go with patience, only that nothing be committed contrary to the modesty of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zuinglius loved it, not for revenge, but instituted for the retaining and defending of truth. By this, if those who fight perish, they gain a great glory, since they have no use more excellent than that with which they contend with Christ, not with Achaeans or Britons. They are eager to retain, not the blood of man, but the word of the Lord. Moreover, the Lord will give strength both of arms and of fortitude to the confident, provided that their purpose is upright, which we are attempting. «I will not leave thee nor forsake thee» [Jos 1,5], said the God of truth and faithfulness to Joshua, going forth against his enemies and undertaking a very difficult undertaking. Therefore, there is no need for us to be carried away by any tyrant. This is the genius of our profession, that we may be exercised by evils, and so, being tossed as by storms, may not trust the world, but Him who has conquered the world. It has succeeded well to our Antronio, trusting in his own arts. He has long hands and a fat purse. To this net some willingly leap, provided they be feasted, though with the peril of their souls, as foolish aquatic creatures are wont to do. But O glory to God, who has made us victorious by truth, though persecuted by so many evils! He prevails indeed, but by craft and fraud, that is to say, by Satan. We overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, by which we may suffuse our face with modesty. Finally, that he may attain his greatest aim, to fill up his foolishness, we may yet act against his will, and not only we, but our country and subjects. For unto these is left the free choice of faith by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained at their own cost. Such is the love of those who have truly believed in Christ. But we have suffered greater things. God will give an end to these also. Take care that both the citizens of Berne and of Basel, and also the ministers of Schaffhausen, may be admonished, not to put their hands slothfully to the common cause of defence. You would not believe how these things would move those who are filled with the dew of the spirit. Meanwhile, the flesh acts after its own manner, and triumphs in a womanish way, not knowing how ridiculous it is to acknowledge any thing of which you cannot give any evident reason.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote down suddenly in the heat of emotion when I noticed what the intentions of our pagans were against the citizens of Zurich, though in appearance they were against the sanctity of our Gospel. In my opinion we must rely on this, that those of us who have dedicated our name to Christ with sincere understanding of his Word, however robbed of our alliances and afflicted in our society, shall with steadfast minds and that love with which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be worshipped, promote the faith received, understood and considered with the most harmonious desires. Induced by this, I preferred to bring the so-called nightingales to Athens than to be wanting in either duty or charity, which is the mistress of all duty. Take care of this above all, o Bullinger, dearest brother, to inflame and encourage your spirits in this matter, so that they do not let themselves be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by the evil arts. Then only shall they be seen to embrace Christ, when, after so many afflictions, they shall prove no less valiant in preserving this honour, than they were victorious, not to mention that this is the very truth of victory and the very property of the Christian profession, by which, in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in spirit, not by strength, by confession, not by arms, in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of the enemy. It is certainly pleasant to go by this way through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done against the honourable piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved it, not for revenge, but for maintaining and defending the truth. Hence, if they perish who fight, they gain a great glory, since they have no more excellent employment, than that with which they strive with Christ, not with the Romans or Britons. They are eager for maintaining, not shedding of blood, but the Lord's Word. The Lord will also give strength to those who trust him, both of arms and of strength, provided the undertaking be right, which we are aiming at. "I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee" [Jos 1,5], said the Lord full of faith and truth to Joshua, as he was about to go against the enemies and to undertake a hard task. Therefore it is not so that any tyrant take us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we are exercised with evils and so, though shaken as by tempests, we trust not the world, but Him that hath overcome the world. Antonio of ours has succeeded well, trusting to his own arts. He has a long reach and a plentiful revenue. Those who, for their part, are eager to plunge into this pool, so provided they be fed with bait, though at the peril of their souls, as foolish fishes are wont to do. But oh! the glory of God, who has made us conquerors of truth, though so tried with evils! He conquers by art and guile, that is, by Satan. We conquer in this, that we have in our hands the grace of God, to shed the blush of shame on his face. Lastly, that he may obtain the utmost of his desires, to fill up his folly, we may, nevertheless, walk safe, neither to us only, but also to the country and our subjects. For unto these is left the free choice of faith by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they be without ministers to be maintained at their own cost. Such is the love to Christ of those who have truly believed. But we have suffered greater things. The Lord will also give an end to these. Take care that the Bernese and Baselians, besides the Schaffhausen ministers, be admonished, not to lay their hands slack to the defending of the common cause. You would not believe how these engines, filled with the dew of the Spirit, are moved. Meanwhile, the flesh acts according to its own manner and triumphs womanishly, not knowing, indeed, how ridiculous it is to profess that for which you can give no evident reason. We have in our reckoning the Psalmist's saying: The counsels of the wicked shall perish.</output>

I am sending you, most beloved Bullinger, a suggestion that I wrote in a sudden burst of passion when I realized what a hostile attitude our pagans had towards the people of Zurich, in appearance at least, but in reality towards the holiness of our gospel.In this case, I think we should rely on this: those of us who have given ourselves the name of Christ in sincere understanding of his words, deprived as we are of alliances and afflicted in our society, nevertheless with constant spirits and with the love with which we have proposed to serve the truth, should promote the faith once received, known and understood with the most harmonious wishes.Induced by this, I preferred to carry night owls, as it were, to Athens rather than fail to fulfill my duty or charity, which is the mistress of all duties.Take special care, o Bullinger, most beloved brother, to inflame your souls in this, so that they do not allow themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts.Only then will they be seen to embrace Christ, when, having endured so many afflictions, they will be no less victorious in retaining this honor than they were victorious in obtaining it, so that I may not mention that this is the most true victory and indeed the proper profession of Christianity, by which, in distress and tribulation, they are exalted in spirit and not in strength, in confession and not in arms, in the glory of Christ and not in the slaughter of enemies.By this way, it is good to go through the midst of Satan's troops with patience, provided nothing be done that is contrary to the honor of piety.For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but for the keeping and defending of truth.Therefore, if those who fight perish, they have a great glory in conquering, since they have no better use than to contend with Christ, not with the Achaeans or the Bruti.They are eager to retain, not the blood, but the word of the Lord.But the Lord will also give strength, both of arms and of courage, to the faithful, provided the purpose we are striving for is right.” «I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee» [Jos 1.5], said the Lord our God full of faith and truth to Joshua on his way to the enemy and on undertaking a very difficult province.Therefore, it is not to be feared that any tyrant will carry us off to the left.This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils and, being shaken as it were by storms, trust not in the world, but in Him who has conquered the world.Antonius has prospered well, relying on his own arts.He has long hands and a large flock.Those who plunge into this net do so voluntarily, provided they are fed, though at the risk of their souls, which is usually the case with foolish swimming-fish.But oh glory to God, who has constituted us victorious in truth, though so attacked by evils!He conquers by craft and guile, that is, by Satan.We conquer in this, that we have the grace of God in our hand, whereby we may sprinkle the forehead of this with shame.Finally, that he may obtain most of all, to fill up his folly, yet we are allowed to act according to his pleasure in safety, not only for ourselves, but also for the country and the subjects.For to these the free choice of faith by the grace of the Lord is left, nor shall they want ministers to be fed with their own money.Such is the love for Christ of those who have truly believed.But we have suffered greater things.God will give them also an end.See to it that the Bernese and Baselians, as well as the ministers of Schaffhausen, be admonished not to lend their hands slothfully to the defense of the common cause.You would not believe how these artifices move them not at all, who are filled with the dew of the Spirit.Meanwhile, the flesh acts in its own way and triumphs in a womanly manner, not knowing how ridiculous it is to acknowledge a thing for which you can give no evident reason.We have in our account the psalmist's saying: The counsels of the wicked shall perish.Sela etc.</output>

  <output>I am sending to you, Bullinger, most beloved, a suggestion which I hastily wrote in a certain fervor when I realized what attitude our heathens had towards the people of Zurich, which was in outward appearance but in reality opposed to the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion, it is important that those of us who have honestly taken the name of Christ according to the understanding of his word, though robbed of covenants and afflicted in our society, nevertheless remain steadfast in spirit and with the same love with which we have proposed to honor the truth, promote the faith which we have once accepted, become aware of, and considered, with the most powerful and harmonious wishes. Led by this, I preferred to bring owls to Athens, as they say, rather than to fail in duty or charity, which is the teacher of all duty.

Take care of this, o Bullinger, most beloved brother, that you inflame and exhort your souls in this, so that they do not allow themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by wicked arts. Only then will they be seen to embrace Christ when, having endured so many afflictions, they have been no less victorious in retaining his honor than they were in conquering, not to mention that the true victory and thus the proper profession of Christianity is that, in distress and tribulations, they are united in one spirit, not in strength; in confession, not in arms; in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of enemies.

It is pleasant to go by this way through the midst of Satan's throngs, provided nothing is committed against the dignity of piety.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, most beloved brother, a suggestion which I have hastily written with a sudden warmth when I had observed what kind of spirit the pagans had against the people of Zurich, really contrary to the holiness of our gospel.In my opinion, we should rely on this; that we, who have given our names to Christ sincerely according to his understanding of the word, however stripped of alliances and afflicted in society, yet with resolute minds and with that love with which we have proposed to us to worship truth, once received and comprehended, we should promote faith with the most concordant vows.Induced by this, I preferred, as it is said, to bring owls to Athens than to fail either in duty or in charity, which is the mistress of all duty.Take care, o Bullinger, most beloved brother, to inflame and to encourage your souls in this, lest they should let themselves be dragged down from the state of faith in Christ by bad arts.Then only will they appear to embrace Christ when, after so many perplexities, they will be no less conquerors in retaining its honour than they were when conquering, so that I do not mention that the very true victory and proper profession of Christianity consists in being exalted in spirit, not in strength; in confession, not in arms; in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of enemies.With this way, it is pleasant to go through the middle of Satan's troops, provided that nothing be committed against the decency of piety.For we love the use of arms, such as Zwinglius loved it, not for revenge, but instituted for retaining and guarding the truth; by which very thing, if those who fight perish, they win with great glory, since they have no more honourable use than to contend with Christ, and not with the Achaeans or the Britons, who are eager not to shed blood, but to retain the word of the Lord.The Lord will give strength and power to the faithful, provided the undertaking is right which we are aiming at.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, my dearest brother, a suggestion which I wrote impulsively when I observed what kind of attitude our pagans had towards the people of Zurich, which in appearance was against them, but in reality was against the holiness of our gospel. In this, I believe, we should rely, that those of us who sincerely devoted their name to Christ, however deprived of treaties and afflicted by society, yet with constant minds and with the love with which we have proposed to honour the truth, will promote the faith received, known and seen with the greatest agreement of wishes. Moved by this, I preferred to send night owls, as they say, to Athens rather than to be absent from or neglect my duty or charity, which is the mistress of all duties. Take greatest care of this, o Bullinger, dearest brother, that you may inflame and encourage your own souls not to allow themselves to be cast from their degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be seen to embrace Christ, when, after so many afflictions, they will be no less victorious in preserving this honour than they were when they were conquerors. Not to mention that the very true and even proper victory of the Christian profession is that whereby, amid straits and tribulations, with exalted minds, they are united in one spirit, not in strength; by confession, not by arms; in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of their enemies. This, indeed, is a pleasant way through the midst of Satan's troops, provided that nothing be done contrary to the beauty of piety. For we love the use of arms such as Zwingli loved, instituted, not for revenge, but for the preservation and defence of the truth; so that if those who fight, perish, they gain a great glory, having no more illustrious use than when they contend, not with Accius or Brutus, but with Christ, who are to be eager, not to draw blood, but to retain the word of the Lord. And our Lord will give strength both of arms and of forces to those who trust in Him, provided that the enterprise which we are undertaking be right. "For I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee," said God our Lord, full of faith and truth, to Joshua, when about to go against his enemies and undertake a difficult province. Therefore, let no tyrant snatch us away.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, my dearest brother, a suggestion that I wrote in a sudden burst of passion when I noticed what our pagan people had in mind against the citizens of Zurich, although in reality it was against the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion we should rely on this: that those of us who have given our name to Christ in a sincere grasp of His word, although deprived of alliances and afflicted with a troubled society, nevertheless have steadfast minds and the love with which we have proposed to honor the truth, once received and comprehended, should be promoted with the most harmonious wishes. Guided by this, I preferred to bring owls to Athens, as they say, than to fail either in duty or in charity, which is the mistress of all duty. Take care, o Bullinger, my dearest brother, to inflame and encourage your spirit, so that they do not allow themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then they will be seen to embrace Christ, when, after so many sufferings, they shall be no less victorious in retaining His honour than in overcoming, not to mention that the very truest victory and, consequently, the proper profession of Christianity, is that in which, in straits and tribulations, with elevated minds, they are one in spirit, not in strength; by confession, not by arms; for the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of enemies. By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of the Satanic troops, provided nothing is committed to the prejudice of decorous piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but for the purpose of retaining and defending the truth; and by this even if those who fight perish, they win with great glory, since they have no more noble use than to contend with Christ, and not with the Achaeans or the Brutii, who are eager, not to draw blood, but to retain the Lord's Word. And the Lord will give strength, either of arms or of power, to those who trust in Him, provided the design we are undertaking be right. “I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee,” said our God full of faith and truth to Joshua when he was about to go against enemies and to undertake a very difficult mission. Therefore it is not right that any tyrant take us by surprise. This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils, and even when shaken, as by storms, not trust the world, but Him who has conquered the world. Our Antonio has succeeded well, being confident in his own arts.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger most beloved, a suggestion which I suddenly wrote with some heat, when I had observed what kind of mind our pagans had towards the people of Zurich, in appearance indeed, but in reality against the sanctity of our gospel. In this opinion I am of the judgement that we who have given the name of Christ sincerely according to the understanding of his word, however stripped of alliances and afflicted in society, yet with constant minds and the same love with which we proposed to ourselves to honor the truth, may promote the faith received, once known and comprehended, with most concordant vows. Being induced by this, I chose rather to bring owls to Athens, as they say, than to be wanting in service or charity, which is the mistress of all services. Take care of this, o Bullinger, most beloved brother, to inflame and encourage your minds in this, lest they suffer themselves to be cast from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they seem to embrace Christ, when they shall have been vanquished no less vigourous in retaining his honor, after so many calamities endured, than they were victorious, lest I should not remember that the very true victory and also proper to the christian profession, is that by which, in straits and tribulations, they being exalted in mind, are one in spirit, not in strength; in confession, not in arms; in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of enemies. By this way it is profitable to go through the middle of Satan's troops with patience, provided nothing be committed against the comeliness of piety. For we love the use of arms, as Zwinglius loved it, instituted, not for revenge, but for retaining and protecting the truth; by which, if they perish who fight, they obtain a great victory, that they have not a more glorious use than to contend with Christ, not with Accius or Brutus, who are greedy to retain, not to draw blood, but the word of the Lord. The Lord also will give strength of arms and of forces to the confident, provided the institution be right which we attempt. «I will not forsake thee, nor forsake thee», said our God full of faith and truth to Joshua going to enemies and undergoing a very difficult province. Therefore, there is no occasion that any tyranny should snatch us away on the left hand. This is the genius of our profession, that we may be exercised with evils and even shaken, like storms, not to trust the world, but Him who has conquered the world. To Antonius, our friend, it has happened well, relying upon his own arts. He has long hands and a rich flock. In this purse there are those who voluntarily plunge, provided they may be fed, though with hazard of their souls, which foolish fowls commonly do.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, most beloved, a suggestion which I hastily wrote down in a certain heat, when I observed what spirit was in our pagans towards the citizens of Zurich indeed in show, but in very truth against the holiness of our Gospel.In this, in my judgment, it is to be relied upon, that we who have given ourselves to Christ sincerely, according to the true sense of His Word, however stripped of leagues and afflicted in our society, yet with constant minds and with that love with which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be worshipped, may advance with the most unanimous desires the same faith which we have once received, and have seen and known.Being therefore induced thereto, I chose rather to bear the owl, as it were, to Athens, than to be wanting either in duty, or in charity itself, which is the mistress of all duty.Take care especially of this, o Bullinger, most beloved brother, that you may inflame and encourage your minds, that they suffer not themselves to be cast down from the degree of their faith in Christ by the crafty arts of men.Then only will they appear to embrace Christ, when they shall have been conquered, no less valiant, in defending the honor thereof, through so many oppressions, than they were conquerors, so that I need not mention, that the very last and true victory, and so proper to the Christian profession, is that whereby in straits and tribulations, with lifted up minds, they strive with one spirit, and not with strength; with confession, and not with arms; for the glory of Christ, and not for the slaughter of their enemies.In this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of the troops of Satan, provided we commit nothing against the comeliness of piety.For we love the use of arms, as did Zwinglius, not for revenge, but for the retaining and defending of truth, and therefore if those who fight perish, they overcome with a great glory, having no higher use than that whereby they contend with Christ, and not with the Achaeans or Bruti, who must be thirsting, not for blood, but for the retaining of the Lord's Word.But the Lord will also give strength, both of arms and of power, to them that trust Him, provided the design be right, whereunto we strive.For He said to Joshua, who was about to go against his enemies, and was going to undertake a difficult enterprise, full of faith and truth, "I will not leave thee nor forsake thee".Therefore there is no cause why any tyranny should snatch us away.This is the temper of our profession, that being exercised with evils, and even as it were tossed with storms, we trust not to the world, but to Him that hath conquered the world.Our friend Antonio succeeded well, trusting to his own arts.He has long hands and a fat purse: into this net there are some that swim of their own accord, provided they can have their feed, though with the danger of their souls, which is commonly the lot of foolish fishes.But oh the glory be to God, who hath set us victorious over so many evils by truth!</output>

  <output>I send to you, most beloved Bullinger, a proposal which I hastily composed in a sudden heat, when I noticed what malice our pagans had in show against the Zurichers, though in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this matter, in my opinion, we should stand firm, so that those of us who have sincerely taken the name of Christ in accordance with his word, however stripped of treaties and afflicted in society, yet with constant minds and that love by which we have proposed to worship the truth once received, accepted, and understood, may with the most harmonious desires promote that faith. Moved by this, I preferred to bring nightingales, as it is said, to Athens, rather than to be absent from either my duty or charity, which is the mistress of all duties. Take care, o most beloved Bullinger, to inflame and encourage your souls in this, so that they allow not themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be seen to embrace Christ, when, having been so severely tried, they shall be no less victorious in preserving this honor, than they were in acquiring it; not to mention that this is the very true and proper victory of the Christian profession, by which, in straits and tribulations, with elevated minds, they are one in spirit, not in strength; in confession, not in arms; in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of enemies. It is pleasant to go by this way through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be committed that is contrary to the decorum of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, instituted not for revenge, but for the preservation and defence of truth; by which very means, if those who take part in it perish, they overcome with great glory, having no more illustrious use than to contend, not with the Achaeans or the Bruti, but with Christ; not being eager to draw blood, but to retain the word of the Lord. The Lord will also give strength and courage to those who trust in him, provided the design which we pursue be right. «I will not leave thee nor forsake thee», said our God full of faith and truth to Joshua, when he was going against his enemies and undertaking a most difficult enterprise. Therefore, let no tyrant snatch us away by any treacherous means. This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils, and, even being tossed about as with storms, should not trust in the world, but in Him who has conquered the world. Antonio has succeeded well, trusting to his own arts. He has long arms and a fat purse. Into this net there are some who voluntarily jump, provided they may be fed, though with danger to their souls, which is usually the case with foolish fish. But oh, glory be to God, who has made us victorious over evils by truth! He conquers by art and guile, that is, by Satan; we conquer in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, by which we may fill our brow with honor.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, my dearest brother, a suggestion which I wrote with sudden heat when I perceived what malice our pagans had against the people of Zurich, though in appearance only, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion, it is to be relied upon, that we who have devoted ourselves to Christ with a sincere understanding of his word, though stripped of our alliances and afflicted in our society, yet with unconquerable spirits and with that love with which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be worshipped, may, with the greatest possible harmony of our intentions, promote the faith received, acknowledged, and known. Being induced hereunto, I chose rather to go to Athens, as the saying is, than to be wanting either in duty or in charity, which is the mistress of all duty. Take this matter in hand, o Bullinger, my dearest brother, and inflame and encourage the minds of your people, that they suffer not themselves to be thrown off their degree of faith in Christ by the wiles of evil men. Then only they will be accounted as embracing Christ, when, after so many afflictions, they shall be no way inferior in maintaining his honour, to what they were when they were conquerors; not to mention that the very truth of victory, and indeed that which is proper to the Christian profession, is that whereby, in straits and tribulations, their spirits being raised, they fight with one spirit, and not with strength; with confession and not with arms; for the glory of Christ, and not for the slaughter of their enemies. By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done contrary to the becomingness of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwinglius did, not for revenge, but for the keeping and defending of the truth; and so they are crowned with a great glory, who do, if they perish, fight with Christ, and not with Accius or Brutus, who are to be desirous of retaining the word of the Lord, and not of spilling blood. And the Lord will also give courage both of arms and forces to the trusty, provided the undertaking be upright, which we are going about. “I will not fail thee nor forsake thee,” said our God, full of faith and truth, to Joshua, going forth against his enemies and undertaking a very hard province. Therefore let no tyrant take us away with a sinister hand. This is the temper of our profession, that we be exercised with evils, and so shaken as with storms, yet let us not trust to the world, but to him who hath conquered the world. Antonio of ours hath succeeded well, trusting to his own means. He hath long hands and a fat flock of sheep. Some leap of their own accord into this net, provided they may have a bait, though with danger to their souls, as foolish fishes usually do. But o glory be to God, who hath made us conquerors by the truth, though so sore beset with evils! He overcometh indeed, but by art and deceit, that is, by Satan; we overcome in this, that we have God's grace in our hands, wherewith we may colour our face with a becoming shame. And at last, that he may be the most complete in his folly, yet may we live secure, not only for ourselves, but for the country and for our subjects also; for unto them is left the free choice of faith, by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained at their own charges.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, my dearest brother, a suggestion which I have written down in a sudden heat of emotion, when I observed what hostile feelings our heathens had towards the people of Zurich, in appearance indeed, but really against the sanctity of our gospel.It is my judgment that in this matter we should take our stand, that we who have given ourselves sincerely to Christ, according to the understanding of his word, however deprived of leagues and afflicted in our fellowship, yet with undaunted minds and the same love with which we have proposed to honour truth received once and known and seen, should with the most unanimous desires promote it.Being thus induced, I had rather carry owls to Athens, as it is said, than be wanting in either duty or charity, who is the guide of all duty.Take care then, O Bullinger, dearest brother, that you may inflame and encourage your companions, that they may not suffer themselves to be cast down from their degree of faith in Christ by wicked arts.Then only shall they be esteemed to embrace Christ, when, having triumphed over so many afflictions, they shall not be less zealous in maintaining this honour than they were victorious; not to mention that the only true and properly Christian victory is, that with exalted minds, in the spirit of unity, not of strength; with confession, not with arms; and the glory of Christ, not the slaughter of enemies.By this way it is good to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done contrary to the modesty of piety.For we love the use of arms, such as Zwinglius loved, not for revenge, but instituted to retain and defend truth; by which means, if they perish who fight, they gain a great glory; having no more honourable use than to contend, not with the Accians or Brutians, but with Christ; and that they should be greedy, not of shedding blood, but of retaining the word of the Lord.And the Lord will give fortitude, both of arms and of strength, to them that trust in him, provided the enterprise be right which we undertake.For our God, full of faith and truth, said to Joshua, when he was going to the enemies and undertaking a difficult enterprise, “I will not leave thee nor forsake thee.”Therefore there is no reason that any tyrant should snatch us away.This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils, and yet not trust in the world, though shaken by tempests, but in him who hath conquered the world.To Antronius hath succeeded, relying on his own arts; he hath long hands and a large stock of cattle.Into this net there are some that leap of their own accord, provided they be fed, though at the hazard of their souls, which usually foolish fishes do.But O the glory to God, who hath made us, though distressed with so many evils, victorious in truth!He conquereth indeed, but with art and guile, that is, with Satan; we conquer in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, by which we may sprinkle our forehead with modesty.And lastly, that he may effect his foolish purpose to the utmost, it is yet lawful for us to act contrary to his will, and not only for us, but for our country and our subjects; for to them the free choice of faith is left by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained at their own cost.So great is the love to Christ of them that have truly believed.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger most beloved, a suggestion which I wrote down suddenly with a certain fervor when I observed what the attitude of our pagans was towards the people of Zurich, in appearance friendly but in reality hostile to the holiness of our gospel. In my judgement, this is what should be held to: that those of us who have given ourselves to Christ sincerely, according to the understanding of his word, although deprived of alliances and afflicted in our fellowship, nevertheless, with steadfast minds and with that love with which we have proposed to ourselves the worship of the truth, should promote the faith which we have received, known and understood with the most united desires. Influenced by this, I preferred to bring nightingales, as it were, to Athens rather than to fail in either my duty or in charity itself, which is the mistress of all duties. Take care, o Bullinger, most beloved brother, to inflame and encourage our spirits, so that they do not allow themselves to be cast down from the step of the faith in Christ by evil arts. Then they will be seen to embrace Christ when, having been raised up in all these afflictions, they will have shown themselves no less resolute in maintaining this honor than they had been when victorious, not to mention that very truth is the victory and even the peculiar profession of Christianity, by which, in distresses and tribulations, having their spirits lifted up, they fight with one spirit and not with strength; with confession and not with arms; with the glory of Christ and not with the slaughter of the enemies. By this way, it is pleasing to go through the midst of the satanic troops, provided that nothing be committed against the modesty of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but for the purpose of maintaining and defending the truth; and thus, if those who fight perish, they win with great glory, since they have no greater use than to contend, not with the Achaeans or the Brutii, but with Christ, being zealous, not to draw blood, but to preserve the word of the Lord. And the Lord will give strength and courage to those who trust in him, provided that the undertaking be upright, which we are attempting. For to Joshua, about to go out against the enemies and to undertake a most difficult province, our God, full of faith and truth, said: «I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee». Therefore, let no tyrant be able to snatch us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we should not trust in this world though shaken by evils, but in him who has overcome the world. Our friend Antronio has succeeded well, relying upon his own arts. He has long hands and a fat purse. Those who swim into this net will be fed, provided they can get the bait, although at the risk of their souls, which is usually the case with foolish fishes. But o glory to God who has made us victorious over truth, though assailed by so many evils! He is victorious, but by arts and frauds, that is, by Satan; we, in this, conquer, because we have the grace of God in our hand, by which we can stain the brow of this one with shame. Finally, let him do his utmost to accomplish his foolishness, yet we, though unharmed, may act contrary to his will, not only for ourselves, but also for the country and our subjects; for unto them is left the free choice of faith, by the grace of the Lord, and they will not lack ministers to be nourished with their own money. Such is the love for Christ of those who have truly believed. But we have suffered even greater things; God will also give them an end.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, my most beloved brother, a suggestion which I wrote with a sudden warmth when I had considered what was the sentiment of our countrymen, in show indeed towards the people of Zurich, but in reality against the sanctity of our gospel. In this, it is my opinion, we must rest, that we who have given ourselves sincerely to Christ from our understanding of his word, however stripped of alliances and afflicted in society, may yet, with steadfast hearts and the same love with which we have undertaken to worship the truth, promote the faith, which we have once received, known, and considered, with most cordial agreement. Induced by this purpose, I chose rather to bring the night-owls, as it were, to Athens, than to be wanting either to my duty or to charity herself, who is the mistress of all duty. Take especial care, O Bullinger, my most beloved brother, to inflame and encourage your own souls in this, that they do not suffer themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be deemed to have embraced Christ, when, having been tried by so many afflictions, they shall be found no less resolute in maintaining this honour, than they had been victorious, to say nothing of that being the truest and proper victory of the Christian profession, by which, in straits and tribulations, with exalted minds, they are united in spirit, not in strength; by confession, not by arms; for the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of the enemy. By this way it is a pleasure to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be committed against the modesty of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but for the keeping and defending of the truth, whereby, if those who fight perish, they gain great glory, having no more honourable use than to contend with Christ, and not with the Achaeans or Bruti, who must be avaricious not for the shedding of blood, but for the retaining of the Lord's word. But the Lord will give fortitude both of arms and of strength to those that trust in him, provided the undertaking be right, which we are attempting. "For I will not leave thee," said our God full of faith and truth to Josue, when he was about to go against the enemies and undergo a difficult province. Therefore there is no cause why any tyrant should snatch away the hope from us. This is the temper of our profession, that we are exercised by evils, and yet do not trust to the world, but to Him who has conquered the world. Antonio has succeeded well enough, trusting in his own arts. He has long hands, and a fat purse. Into this net there are some who will leap of their own accord, provided they be fed, though with danger to their souls, as foolish fishes usually are. But oh the glory to God, who hath made us conquerors through the truth, though beset with so many evils! He conquers, indeed, but by art and fraud, that is, by Satan; we conquer in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may sprinkle our forehead with modesty. To conclude, that he may attain his utmost, to fill up his folly, yet it is lawful for us to act contrary to his will, and not only for us, but also for the country and the subjects; for to them is left the free choice of faith by the grace of the Lord, and they shall not want ministers to be maintained at their own charges. So great is the love to Christ of those who have truly believed. But we have suffered more grievous things; God will give an end also to these. Take care, that the people of Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, with the other ministers, be admonished, that they do not lay their hands slackly to the common cause of defending.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, my dearest, a suggestion which I wrote down with a sudden heat, when I observed what was in the mind of our pagans against the Zurich people, indeed in appearance, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this, in my judgment, we must rely, that we who have given the name of Christ sincerely from our understanding of his word, however robbed of alliances and afflicted in society, yet with firm minds and with that love with which we have proposed to worship the truth received and once known and seen, should promote it with most harmonious desires. Being thus induced, I preferred to carry, as it were, the night-owls to Athens, than to be wanting either in duty or charity itself, which is the teacher of all duty. Take especial care of this, O Bullinger, my dearest brother, that you inflame and encourage your minds, that they may not suffer themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts.

By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done to the dishonour of piety; for we love the use of arms, such as Zwinglius did, not for revenge, but instituted for the retaining and defending of truth; so that those who fight, if they perish, conquer with great glory, having no more glorious use, than to endeavour with Christ, not with the Aetolians or Brutians, who are greedy to retain, not to pour out blood, but the word of the Lord. But our Lord will give courage both of arms and of strength to those that trust in him, provided the enterprise be right, which we are going about. “For I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee,” said God our Lord, full of faith and truth, to Joshua, when he was going out against enemies, and undertaking a most difficult province. Therefore there is no occasion that any tyrant should snatch us away with his wicked arts. This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils, and not trust the world, though shaken, but Him that hath conquered the world. Our Antronius hath succeeded very well, relying upon his own arts. He hath long hands, and a full purse. Into this net there are some that leap of their own accord, provided they can feed upon bait, though with danger to their souls, which is usually the case with foolish fishes. But O the glory be to God, who hath made us victorious over truth, though sought after with so many evils! He overcomes, but by art and fraud, that is, by Satan; we overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may sprinkle our forehead with honour. Lastly, that he may accomplish the utmost of his folly, it is lawful for us to act, contrary to his will, and not only to ourselves, but to our country and our subjects; for these have still left them the free choice of faith, by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained at their own charge. So great is the love to Christ of those who have truly believed. But we have suffered greater things; God will give an end to these also. Take care that the ministers of Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen are admonished, that they be not slack to help in so common a cause.

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger most beloved, a proposal which I wrote in a sudden flash of warmth, when I observed what feeling the pagans of our party had towards the citizens of Zurich, in appearance indeed, but in reality, against the holiness of our Gospel. In my opinion, this is the point to which we should cleave: that we who have sincerely taken the name of Christ in the sense of his word, however deprived of alliances and oppressed in our society, yet with constant minds, and with that love wherewith we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be worshipped, should with the most united desires promote the faith received, once and for all, and understood.Being thus induced, I chose rather to send owls to Athens, as they say, than to be wanting either in my duty or in that charity, which is the mistress of all duties.Take care, most beloved brother Bullinger, that you inflame and encourage your own mind in this, lest they suffer themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts.Then only will they be seen to embrace Christ, when after so many afflictions, they shall be found no less valiant in retaining this honour, than they were victorious in obtaining it; not to mention that it is only a very true victory and even peculiar to the Christian profession, when, in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in spirit, not in strength; by confession, not by arms; to the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of the enemy.By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done to the dishonour of piety.For we love the use of arms, as Zwingli did, not for revenge, but for the retaining and defending of truth, so that they overcome with great glory, if they perish, who fight, having no use more glorious than to contend with Christ, not with the Achæans or Bruti, who have a great desire, not to draw blood, but to retain the word of the Lord.Moreover, the Lord will give courage and strength to them that trust in him, provided the design be right which we undertake.For our God said full of faith and truth to Josue, being about to go against the enemy and to take a difficult province, «I will not leave thee nor forsake thee.»Therefore it is not to be feared that any tyrant should carry us away by his sinister arts.This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils, and even being shaken as by storms, should not trust in the world, but in Him that hath conquered the world.Our friend Antronius prospered well, trusting to his own arts.He has long hands and a full purse.Into this net there are some who leap of their own accord, provided they may feed upon the bait, though with danger to their souls, as foolish fishes usually do.But oh, the glory to God, who has made us conquerors by truth, though so many evils have assailed us!Satan is superior, but by art and fraud; we overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, to sprinkle our forehead with modesty.In the end, that he may accomplish his foolishness, it is yet permitted us to act in safety, not only to ourselves, but to the country and subjects; for to them the free choice of the faith is left by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained by their own money.Such is the love to Christ of those who have truly believed.But we have suffered greater things; God will give an end to them also.Take care that the ministers of Berne, Basle, and Schaffhausen also be admonished not to put forth their hands slothfully to the common cause.You can hardly believe with what force they are moved who are filled with the spirit.Meanwhile the flesh acts after its own manner, and triumphs in a womanish way, not knowing how ridiculous it is to acknowledge a thing of which you can give no evident reason.</output>

  <output>I am sending to you, my beloved Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote with a sudden warmth, when I noticed what ill-will our pagan neighbours have towards the people of Zurich, in appearance at least, but really towards the sanctity of our Gospel. In my opinion, this is what we should do: those of us who have taken the name of Christ in good faith from his Word should, however deprived of our alliances and afflicted by our society, still remain constant in spirit, and with the same love we had for the truth we accepted and recognized, promote far more strongly the same faith. I was so moved by this that I preferred to bring the owls to Athens, as they say, than to be absent from my duty or from charity itself, which is the mistress of all duties. Above all, my beloved Bullinger, brother most beloved, take care that you inflame and encourage your spirits, lest they allow themselves to be cast down from the step of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then they will be seen to embrace Christ only when, after so many trials, they will be no less victorious in preserving this honour than they were when they were conquering, not to mention that this is the only true victory, and even the proper profession of Christianity, by which in straits and tribulations, with elevated spirits, they are one in spirit and not in strength; by confession and not by arms; in the glory of Christ and not by the destruction of enemies. It is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops by this way, provided that nothing is done against the decency of piety. For we love the use of arms, as Zwingli did, not for revenge, but for the preservation and defence of truth; and if those who fight perish, they gain a great glory, since they have no more honourable use than to contend with Christ and not with the Achaeans or the Brutuses, who are greedy not for the shedding of blood, but for the preservation of the Word of the Lord. But the Lord will give strength and power to those who trust in him, provided that the design is right which we undertake. "I will not leave nor forsake thee," said our God, full of faith and truth, to Joshua when he was going against the enemies and undertaking a most difficult mission. Therefore, we should not be carried away by any tyranny. This is the genius of our profession, that we should not trust the world when we are tried by evils, but should trust Him who has conquered the world. It has happened very well to our Antonio, being confident in his own arts. He has long hands and a full treasury. There are those who enter into this net willingly, provided they can get their prey, although at the peril of their souls, as foolish fishes usually do. But glory be to God who has made us victorious in truth, although tried by so many evils! He conquers, but by art and guile, that is, by Satan; we conquer in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, by which we may bedew our forehead with modesty. Finally, that he may attain his greatest wish, that is, to fill up his folly, we are allowed to act, notwithstanding his will, without danger to ourselves, and also to our country and our subjects; for to them a free choice of faith has been left by the grace of the Lord, and they will not lack ministers to be maintained at his expense. Such is the love to Christ of those who have truly believed. But we have suffered greater things; the Lord will give an end to them also. See that the ministers of Bern, Basel and Schafhausen are admonished not to put their hands to the common cause with sloth. You do not believe how these are stirred up when they are filled with the dew of the Spirit. Meanwhile, the flesh acts in its own manner and triumphs in a womanish way, not knowing, indeed, how ridiculous it is to acknowledge something of which you cannot give any evident reason. We have on our side the Davidic saying: the counsels of the wicked shall come to nought.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, my most beloved, a proposal which I wrote down in a sudden heat of passion when I had observed what would be the feeling of our heathen towards the people of Zurich, although in appearance it was directed against them, but in reality against the holiness of our Gospel. In my judgement this is what should be done: that those of us who have given our name to Christ according to their understanding of his word, however deprived of leagues and afflicted in society, yet with constant souls and the love wherewith we have proposed to ourselves to honour truth, may advance our received, known and understood faith with the most harmonious wishes. Being thus induced, I chose to take the night-owls, as it were, to Athens, rather than to be wanting either in duty or in charity, which is the mistress of all duty. Take particular care, o Bullinger, most beloved brother, to inflame and encourage the hearts of your people, lest they suffer themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by wicked arts. Then only shall they be said to embrace Christ, when they, after so many afflictions, shall be no less valiant in retaining this honour than they were victorious, not to mention that that is the very true and proper victory of the Christian profession, whereby, in straits and tribulations, with enflamed souls, with one spirit, not with strength; with confession, not with arms; with the glory of Christ, not with the slaughter of enemies, they are exalted. This is the way, through the midst of Satan's troops, to exercise patience, provided nothing be done contrary to the comely piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwinglius loved, not for revenge, but for the upholding and defence of truth; and by that very means, if they perish who fight, they gain great glory, having no greater use than to contend with Christ, and not with the Achaeans or the Britons, who are to be eager, not to suck blood, but to retain the word of the Lord. And the Lord will give strength, both of arms and of forces, to them that trust in him, provided the purpose be right which we are endeavouring. For he said full of faith and truth to Joshua, going against his enemies and undertaking a very hard province: "I will not leave thee nor forsake thee". Therefore there is no cause why any tyranny should take us unawares. This is the nature of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils, and not trust to the world, though shaken, but to him who hath conquered the world. Our friend Antronius hath been successful, trusting to his own arts: he hath long hands, and a fat purse. There are those who willingly creep into this net, so long as they are fed, though with danger of their souls, which is usually the case with foolish fishes. But o the glory be to God, who hath made us conquerors through truth, though tried with so many evils! He overcometh by arts and frauds, that is, by Satan; but we prevail through this, that we have the grace of God in our hand, whereby we may put a blush upon his forehead. And lastly, that he may be most fully accomplished in his folly, yet we may lawfully act against his will, not only for ourselves, but also for the land and our subjects; for to them is left a free choice of faith by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained at their own cost. Such is the love to Christ in them that have truly believed. But we have suffered greater things; God will give an end to them also. Take care that the Bernese and the Baselians, and also the ministers of Schaffhausen, be admonished, not to put languid hands to the common defence. You cannot believe how they are moved with these engines who are filled with the dew of the Spirit. The flesh meanwhile acteth in its own way, and foolishly triumpheth, not knowing how ridiculous it is to confess a thing of which you can give no evident reason. We have in reserve that of David: the counsels of the wicked shall perish. Selah etc.</output>

  <output>I, Joachim Vadian, send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote down with a sudden heat, when I noticed what kind of spirit our pagans had against the people of Zurich, which was in appearance but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. I think therefore that we who have taken the name of Christ in a sincere understanding of His words, though we be stripped of alliances and afflicted in society, yet constant in our spirits and with that love with which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be worshipped, ought to further the faith received once and known and examined in all things with most concordant desires. Induced by this, I had rather carry the nightingales, as it is said, to Athens, than to be wanting in my duty or in charity, which is the mistress of all duty. Take most care, o Bullinger, my dearest brother, that thou stir up, inflame, and exhort thy people, lest they allow themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by the wiles of the wicked. Then only shall they be said to embrace Christ, when, after so many afflictions, they shall be no less zealous in retaining this honor, than they were victorious, that I say not that this is the only true victory, and, in a manner, proper to the Christian profession, by which, in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in spirit, not by strength, by confession, not by arms, with the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of enemies.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I hastily wrote in a sudden warmth, when I noticed something of a pagan spirit in our people against the Zurich people in appearance, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this, in my opinion, we should rely, so that we, who have given the name of Christ from the understanding of his word with sincere hearts, however deprived of alliances and afflicted in society, nevertheless with steadfast minds and with that love with which we have proposed truth to be worshipped, may promote the faith received, known, and understood with the most harmonious desires. Therefore, induced, I chose to bring nocturnal, as it were, Athenians rather than to be absent either from office or from charity, which is the mistress of all offices. Take great care of this, o Bullinger, my dearest brother, that you may inflame and encourage your souls in this, so that they do not allow themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be seen to embrace Christ, when, after so many hardships having been endured, they shall be no less victorious in retaining his honor, than they were victorious before; so that I do not remember that last and most true victory, and indeed the proper profession of Christianity, by which, in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in minds with one spirit, not with power, with confession, not with arms, with the glory of Christ, not with the slaughter of enemies. This way it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops with patience, provided nothing be done against the comeliness of piety. For we do love the use of arms, which Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but instituted for retaining and protecting the truth. By this very thing, if those who fight perish, they gain great glory, since they have no more illustrious use than that in which they contend with Christ, not with Greeks or Brutians. They are eager, not for drawing blood, but for retaining the Lord's word. But the Lord will also give strength, both of arms and forces, to those who trust, provided that the design we are undertaking be right.</output>

  <output>I send to you, dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote in sudden heat when I noticed what a hostile spirit our pagan enemies had towards the people of Zurich, although in reality it was hostile to the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion, those of us who have given ourselves the name of followers of Christ, however much we have been stripped of our alliances and afflicted in our society, yet with our minds still steadfast and with that love with which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be worshipped, should promote the faith received, known and understood with the warmest unanimity. Being thus prompted, I preferred to take, as they say, the night-air to Athens, rather than fail in duty or in charity, which is the teacher of all duty. Take great care, o Bullinger, dearest brother, to kindle, to animate and to encourage your souls, lest they suffer themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be deemed to embrace Christ, when, after so many afflictions, they shall be found no less zealous in retaining this honour than they were victorious, lest I should not remember that the last and truest victory, and indeed the proper profession of Christianity, is that wherewith, in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in spirit, not by force, by confession, not by arms, to the glory of Christ, not to the slaughter of the enemy. This way of going through the midst of Satan's troops encourages patience, provided nothing be done contrary to the becomingness of piety. For we approve of the use of arms, such as Zwingli did, not for revenge, but for the maintenance of truth. By this, if those who fight perish, they gain a great victory, since they have no more glorious use than to contend with Christ, not with the Achaeans or the Britons. They are eager to retain, not the blood of men, but the Word of the Lord. And the Lord will give strength, both of arms and of power, to those who trust Him, provided their undertaking be right, which we are devising. "For I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee," said the Lord our God, full of faith and truth, to Joshua going forth against his enemies and undertaking a difficult province. Therefore, let no tyranny draw us aside to the sinister.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote with a sudden impulse of warmth when I observed what spirit our pagans had towards the people of Zurich, in appearance indeed, but in reality against the sanctity of our gospel. In this, in my opinion, we should rely, that we who have dedicated to Christ a sincere name, however stripped by treaties and afflicted by society, yet with constant minds and with that love with which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be worshipped, should advance the faith, received, known, and viewed, by far the most with concordant desires. Induced by this, I preferred to bring nightingales, as it were, to Athens, rather than to fail either in duty or in charity, which is the mistress of all duty. Take care of this especially, o Bullinger, dearest brother, that you inflame and exhort your minds in this, lest they suffer themselves to be cast down from the step of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be seen embracing Christ, when, after so many calamities, they shall be found no less strong in retaining this honour, than they were victors, so that I may not remember that the last and most true victory, and indeed proper to the Christian profession, is that by which, in straits and tribulations, they being elevated in mind, are one in spirit, not in strength, in confession, not in arms, in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of enemies. By this way, indeed, it is pleasant to go through the midst of the armies of Satan, provided nothing be committed contrary to the comely piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zuinglius loved, not for revenge, but instituted for retaining and keeping the truth. By this very thing, if those who fight perish, they gain a great glory, since they have no more illustrious use than that by which they contend with Christ, not with the Achaeans or Bruti. They are eager not to draw blood, but to retain the word of the Lord. But the Lord will give to the believing both strength of arms and of power, provided the undertaking be right which we are attempting. «For I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee» [Josh 1:5], said God full of faith and truth to Joshua, going against enemies and undertaking a difficult province. Therefore it is not that any tyrants should carry us away with them. This is the genius of our profession, that being exercised with evils, and being, as it were, tossed with tempests, we should not trust the world, but Him who has conquered the world. Antonio has succeeded well, relying upon his own arts.</output>

  <output>I send to you, most loving Bullinger, a suggestion which I hastily wrote with a certain fervor when I noticed what thoughts our pagans had towards the Zurich people in appearance, but in truth against the holiness of our gospel. In this I believe my judgment should be relied on, that those of us who gave our name to Christ from a sincere understanding of his word, though stripped of alliances and afflicted in society, should nevertheless with constant spirits and the love with which we have proposed to ourselves to revere truth, should most of all promote the faith once received, known and understood with united desires. Being thus induced, I preferred to bring the night-owls, as it is said, to Athens, rather than to be absent either from duty or from charity, which is the teacher of all duty. Take care of this especially, O Bullinger, most loving brother, that you inflame and encourage your spirits in this, that they not allow themselves to be cast down from the step of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then they will be seen to embrace Christ only when, being overcome after so many hardships, they will be no less zealous in maintaining his honor than they were victorious, that I do not mention that very true victory and, indeed, proper to the Christian profession, by which in straits and tribulations with elevated spirits they are one in spirit, not in strength, in confession, not in arms, in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of enemies. By this road, through the midst of Satan's troops, it is pleasing to go with patience, provided nothing is done contrary to the honor of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but instituted for the retaining and defending of truth. By this very thing, if those who fight perish, they overcome with great glory, since they have no more honorable use than that with which they contend with Christ, not with the Achaeans or the Bruttii. Who are eager not to draw blood, but to retain the Lord's word. And the Lord will also give strength of arms and powers to the faithful, provided the purpose is right, which we are striving for. "I will not leave you, nor forsake you," [Jos 1:5] said our full of faith and truth God to Joshua, who was about to go against the enemies and undertake a difficult province. Therefore it is not that any tyrant should snatch us away. This is the nature of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils and, being so shaken, as it were by storms, we should not trust in the world, but in Him who conquered the world. Our Antonio has succeeded well, being confident in his own arts. He has long hands and a fat pecuniary estate. In this net there are some who voluntarily plunge, provided they may have their bait, although with the danger of their souls, which fools are wont to do.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote with sudden warmth when I noticed what was in the hearts of our pagans against the people of Zurich, in appearance, though in reality against the holiness of our gospel. It is my opinion that we, who have taken the name of Christ with a sincere understanding of his word, though deprived of treaties and afflicted with adversity, should nevertheless promote the true faith, which we have once accepted, understood, and contemplated, with the most concordant of aspirations. For this reason, I preferred to bear the nocturnal "Athenians," as they are called, than to be lacking in either duty or charity, which is the teacher of all duty. Take great care of this, my dearest brother Bullinger, to inflame and encourage your spirits, lest they allow themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by the wiles of the wicked. Then they will be seen to embrace Christ, when, despite so many afflictions, they will not be less assiduous in keeping this honor, than they were victorious, so that I do not need to mention that this is the truest and proper victory of the Christian profession, that in straits and tribulations, with elevated minds, they are strong in spirit, not in force, in confession, not in arms, for the glory of Christ, not the slaughter of enemies. It is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops with patience, provided nothing be done contrary to the honor of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for vengeance, but for the maintenance and defense of the truth. For those who fight and perish, they conquer with great glory, having no more glorious use than to fight with Christ, not with Greeks or Trojans. They are eager to retain not the blood of men, but the word of the Lord. But the Lord will also give strength, both of arms and of forces, to those who trust, as long as the enterprise is right, which we undertake. For our God, full of faith and truth, said to Joshua, when he was setting out against the enemies and undertaking a difficult mission: "I will not forsake thee, nor forsake thee" (Joshua 1:5). Therefore, we should not be carried away by any tyrants. This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils, and even when shaken, not trust in the world, but in him who has conquered the world. Antonio has succeeded admirably, trusting in his own arts. He has long arms and a fat purse. Some willingly jump into this net, provided they may have their bait, though with the peril of their souls, as stupid sea creatures usually do. But O, glory to God, who has made us victorious by truth, though beset by so many evils!</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote in a sudden heat, when I perceived what malice our heathen had in their hearts against the people of Zurich, though in appearance only, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this, in my opinion, we should have our dependence; that we, who have given to Christ a sincere profession from the conceit of his word, being however spoiled of our leagues, and afflicted in our society, yet keeping our minds constant and the love with which we have proposed to serve the truth, should with most unanimous desires promote the faith received, known, and understood. For this end, I was induced to carry owls to Athens, as it is said, rather than to be wanting in duty, or in that charity which is the mistress of all duty. Take care, therefore, my dearest brother Bullinger, that you incite and encourage your own spirits in this, that they suffer not themselves to be drawn from the degree of their faith in Christ by any evil arts. Then only will they be said to embrace Christ, when, after so many afflictions, they shall be found no less valiant in maintaining the honour of him, than they were victorious; that I need not mention that this is indeed the truest victory, and the very profession of Christianity, to be exalted in mind with the Spirit, and not with strength, and by confession, and not by arms, and to the glory of Christ, and not by the slaughter of enemies. By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing is committed that is contrary to the comely part of piety. For we approve the use of arms, such as Zwinglius approved of it, not for revenge, but for the maintaining and preserving of truth. By this means, if those who fight perish, they overcome with great glory, since there is no greater honour for them, than to strive with Christ, and not with the Achaeans or the Britons. They are desirous to retain, not the blood of men, but the word of the Lord. But the Lord will also give strength and power to those that trust in him, provided their design be right, which is that we undertake. For he said to Joshua, as he was going against his enemies, and undertaking a difficult province, being full of faith and truth, “I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee” [Jos. 1:5]. Therefore there is no cause why any tyranny should snatch us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils, and not trust to the world, though tossed with storms, but to him that hath overcome the world. Antonio hath succeeded well, trusting to his own arts. He hath long hands, and a fat flock. Into this net some leap of their own accord, provided they may be fed, though with danger of their souls, as foolish fishes use to do. But oh, glory be to God, who hath made us, though so sorely tried, conquerors by truth! He overcomes, but with art and guile, that is, with Satan.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I suddenly wrote down with a certain warmth of heart, when I noticed what intention the pagans had against our people of Zurich, though in appearance it was against them, yet in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this, in my opinion, we ought to take our stand, that we who have taken the name of Christ in sincere acceptance of his word, however deprived of our leagues and afflicted in our society, yet with steadfast minds and that love with which we have proposed truth to be worshipped, may promote the faith once received, known and surveyed with far the most cordial desires. Led by this consideration, I chose rather to carry the warnings, as it were, to Athens, than to be wanting either in office or in charity herself, which is the mistress of all office. Take care of this, O Bullinger, dearest brother, to inflame and encourage your minds in it, lest they suffer themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ through evil arts. Then only shall they be accounted to embrace Christ, when, having been overcome by so many dangers, they shall be no less vigorous in retaining this honour than they were in conquering, that I say nothing of that very true victory, and indeed peculiar to the Christian profession, whereby, in straits and afflictions, they are exalted with one spirit, not by strength, by confession, not by arms, to the glory of Christ, not to the slaughter of enemies. By this way through the midst of the devil's troops it becomes us to exercise patience, provided nothing be committed against the modesty of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved it, not for revenge, but instituted for the retaining and defending of truth. By this very means, if they perish that fight, yet they gain a great victory, when they have no other use of arms than to contend with Christ, not with Achaeans or Britons. They are greedy, not of shedding blood, but of retaining the word of the Lord. And the Lord will give strength, both of arms and of strength, to them that trust in him, provided the enterprise be right, which we undertake. “I will not leave thee nor forsake thee,” [Jos 1:5] said the God of truth and faithfulness, full of faith, to Joshua when he was going forth against enemies and undertaking a difficult province. Therefore it is not for any tyrant to carry us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we be exercised with evils, and even when we are shaken as with storms, we trust not to the world, but to him that hath conquered the world. Our Antronius hath succeeded very well, trusting to his own arts. He hath long hands and a fruitful flock. There are those who flock into this net, provided they be fed, though with danger of their souls, which fools usually do. But O the glory to God, who hath made us victorious through truth, though beset with so many evils! He overcomes, but by art and fraud, that is, by Satan. We overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may hide the forehead of this with shame.</output>

  <output>I send to you, dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote in a sudden burst of heat when I observed what our pagans had in mind against the citizens of Zurich, though in appearance they were against our holy gospel. In my opinion, this is what we should be relying on: that we who have given ourselves the name of Christians, though impoverished in our alliances and afflicted in our fellowship, yet with constant minds and the love with which we have proposed the truth to be honored, promote the faith received, known, and examined with the most unanimous resolutions. Therefore, I chose rather to bear the torch to Athens, as it were, than to fail either in duty or charity, which is the teacher of all duty. Take care of this above all, o Bullinger, dearest brother, that your spirits, inflamed, be encouraged, lest they should allow themselves to be cast down from the step of faith in Christ by wicked arts. Then only will they seem to embrace Christ when, after so many troubles, they shall be not less victorious in maintaining their reverence for him than they were when victorious, so that I shall not speak of that only true and proper victory of the Christian profession, by which, in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in spirit, not by strength, by confession, not by arms, for the glory of Christ, not for the slaughter of enemies. This is certainly the way to go through the midst of Satan's troops, if only nothing be committed against the modesty of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but for the institution of maintaining and preserving the truth. By this very thing, they who fight, though they perish, yet win a great glory, since they have no use more illustrious than to contend with Christ, and not with Persians or Britons. They are eager, not to draw blood, but to retain the word of the Lord. But the Lord will give strength and power to those who are confident, if only their purpose be right, which we are endeavouring. For he said to Joshua, going forth against enemies and undertaking a hard province, full of faith and truth, "I will not leave thee nor forsake thee" [Josh 1:5]. Therefore, no tyranny shall snatch us away from this. This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised in evils, and so, although shaken by storms, we should not trust in the world, but in him who has conquered the world. Our Antonio has had a good success, trusting in his own arts. He has long hands and a fat flock. Into this net there are those who voluntarily leap, only that they may be fed, though with the peril of their souls, which fools are usually wont to do. But, O the glory to God, who has made us victorious by truth, though so often assailed by evils! He, indeed, surpasses, but by art and fraud, that is, by Satan. We conquer in this, that we have the grace of God in our hand, by which we may sprinkle our forehead with honor. Finally, that he may accomplish his folly most of all, yet we may act according to our own will, and not only so, but also for our country and our subjects.</output>

  <output>I send to you, dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I hastily wrote down with a certain warmth when I noticed what a pagan attitude our people had against the Zurich citizens, albeit in appearance only, but in truth against the holiness of our gospel. In this I think we should rely, that those of us who have given our name to Christ out of a genuine understanding of his word, however stripped of alliances and afflicted in our fellowship, should nevertheless with steadfast spirits and with the love with which we have proposed to revere the truth, once received and understood, should promote it with our most harmonious desires. Led by this thought I preferred to carry the nightingales, as it is said, to Athens rather than fail either in my duty or in charity, which is the teacher of all duty. Take care, o Bullinger, dearest brother, that you may inflame and encourage your souls in this, lest they let themselves be cast down from their faith in Christ by evil arts. Then they will be seen to embrace Christ, when they, having been raised high by so many afflictions, will be no less vigorous in preserving this honor than they were victorious, and let me not forget that this is the very truest victory and, indeed, the proper profession of Christianity, that in straits and tribulations they are exalted in spirit, not in strength, in confession, not in arms, in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of enemies. With this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of satan's hordes, provided nothing is done against the modesty of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zuinglius loved it, not for vengeance, but for the preservation and defense of the truth. By this very thing, if those who fight perish, they overcome with great glory, since they have no more splendid use than that by which they contend with Christ, not with Accius or Brutus. They are eager to retain the word of the Lord, not to draw blood. But the Lord will also give strength and arms to those who trust, provided the intention is right, which we undertake. "I will not leave you nor forsake you" [Jos 1,5], said God our Lord, full of faith and truth, to Joshua when he went out against the enemies and undertook a very difficult mission. Therefore, let no tyrant snatch us away. This is the spirit of our profession, to be exercised by evils and even when shaken, to trust not in the world, but in Him who overcame the world. Antonio has succeeded well in his endeavor, relying on his own arts. He has long hands and a fat purse. Those who are eager to jump into this net, provided they may have their fill of bait, although with the peril of their souls, as foolish fish usually do. But o glory to God, who has made us victorious in truth amid so many evils! He surpasses us, but by art and guile, that is, by satan. We overcome in this, that we have grace in our hands, by which we may suffuse our forehead with modesty. Finally, for him to gain the most, so that he may fill up his folly, it is yet permitted to us to act in safety from his lust, not only to us, but to our land and subjects. For these, the free choice of faith and the grace of the Lord is left, and they will not be without ministers to be sustained by their own means.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote down with sudden fervour, when I noticed what kind of animosity our pagans have against the Swiss, which is in appearance but in reality against the sanctity of our gospel. In this matter, in my opinion, we must take a stand that those of us who have dedicated ourselves to Christ with a sincere mind, however stripped of treaties and afflicted in society, still keep our minds constant and with that love with which we have proposed to venerate truth, promote the faith received, known and understood with far more harmonious wishes. Therefore, spurred on by this, I preferred to bring, as they say, nightingales to Athens than to fail or the office or charity itself, which is the mistress of all duties. Take care of this, my dearest brother Bullinger, that you may inflame and fortify your spirits, so that they do not allow themselves to be dejected from the level of faith in Christ by evil devices. And they will only be seen to embrace Christ when, after so many hardships, they are no less vigorous in preserving this honour, than they were in winning it, so that I do not mention that this is the truest victory and indeed the true profession of Christianity, that in straits and tribulations they are exalted in spirit, not in strength, in confession, not in arms, in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of the enemy. By this way, it is pleasant to go through the swarms of Satan with patience, provided that nothing is committed against the honour of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but for retaining and protecting truth. Thus, if those who fight perish, they conquer with great glory, since they have no more honourable use than that which they challenge with Christ, not with the Achaians or the Bruti. They are eager to retain not the blood but the word of the Lord. But the Lord will give courage and strength to the faithful, provided that the purpose is right, which we are undertaking. "I will not leave you nor forsake you" [Josh 1:5], the Lord said to Joshua as he set out for war against the enemies and undertook a difficult mission, full of faith and truth. Therefore, let no tyrant snatch us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we may be exercised by evils and thus, shaken like storms, we do not trust the world, but him who conquered the world. Antonio has succeeded very well, relying on his own devices. He has long hands and a fat purse. Some are eager to jump into this pot, provided they can be fed, although with the danger of their souls, as is usually the case with foolish fish. But oh glory to God, who has made us victorious through truth, although troubled by so many evils! He overcomes but by art and cunning, that is, by Satan. We conquer in this that we have the grace of God in our hands, with which we may blush in his honour. Finally, for him to obtain the greatest, in order to fill up his foolishness, yet it is lawful for us to act, unhurt, not only for ourselves but also for the country and its subjects. For to them the free choice of faith, by the grace of the Lord, is left, and they will not lack ministers to be kept by their own coin. Such is the love for Christ of those who have truly believed.</output>

  <output>I am sending to you, my most beloved Bullinger, a proposal which I suddenly wrote with great fervor when I noticed what attitude our pagans had taken against the people of Zurich, although it was not in fact against the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion, we must act in such a way that those of us who have given ourselves to Christ in sincere willingness, although we are robbed of our alliances and a troubled society, yet remain constant in spirit and with the same love for the truth we have accepted, recognized and understood, we promote that faith with the most harmonious of intentions. Prompted by this, I preferred to bear the night-owls, as it were, to Athens, rather than fail in my duty or in charity, which is the teacher of all duties. Take care of this, O Bullinger, my dearest brother, that you inflame and encourage your followers so that they do not allow themselves to be pulled down from their faith in Christ by evil machinations. Then only will they be said to have embraced Christ when, having been subjected to so many trials, they remain no less eager to keep his honor than they were when victorious, not to mention that the most true and proper victory of the Christian profession is that in which in their straits and tribulations they are exalted in spirit, not by strength, by confession, not by arms, to the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of their enemies. It is pleasant to go this way through the midst of Satan’s troops, provided nothing is done against the decency of piety. For we approve of the use of arms, as did Zwingli, not for vengeance but to retain and defend the truth. In this way those who fight and are killed are gloriously victorious, since they have no greater use than to contend with Christ, not with the Achaeans or the Brutae. They are eager to hold fast to the Lord’s word, not to shed blood. The Lord will also give strength and arms to the confident, provided the aim is right, as we are aiming. “I will not leave you nor forsake you” [Josh 1:5] was said by our God, full of faith and truth, to Joshua, when he was about to go to battle the enemies and undertake a difficult mission. Therefore, we have no cause to be carried away by any tyrant. This is the spirit of our profession, that we are trained through misfortunes and not trust in the world, but in him who conquered the world. Our Antonio has succeeded well by relying on his own devices. He has long hands and a plentiful purse. People flock to this net of his, provided they can get food, although it is at the risk of their souls, as foolish fish usually do. But glory to God, who has made us victorious through truth, though tried by so many evils! He surpasses us, but by craft and treachery, that is, by Satan. We conquer by having divine grace in our hands, by which we can blush for this shame. In the end, he will be most successful in fulfilling his foolishness, but we may still act according to our pleasure, and not only for ourselves, but also for our land and subjects. For to them is left the free option of faith, by grace of the Lord, and they will not lack ministers to be supported by their own means. So great is the love for Christ in those who truly believe. But we have suffered more grievous things.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote in a sudden warmth, when I noticed what was in the hearts of our heathen against the people of Zurich, though in appearance only, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this, in my opinion, we must take our stand, that we, who have given our name to Christ with sincere understanding of his word, though stripped of leagues and afflicted in our society, yet with steadfast minds and with that love with which we have proposed to honour the truth, should promote the faith which we have once received, known and understood with most harmonious desires. Therefore, being thus induced, I preferred to carry, as they say, owls to Athens rather than to be wanting either in duty or in that charity which is the teacher of all duty. Take care, O Bullinger, my dearest brother, that you inflame, encourage and exhort your souls in this, that they suffer not themselves to be cast down from the degree of their faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only shall they be accounted as embracing Christ when, after having endured such great afflictions, they shall be no less constant in maintaining this honour, than they were victorious, that I may not mention that this is the only true victory, and indeed the proper profession of Christianity, by which in straits and tribulations they are exalted in spirit, not by strength, by confession, not by arms, by the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of their enemies. By this way it is a pleasure to go through the midst of the devils' troops, provided nothing be done against the honour of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but for the keeping and defending of truth. Therefore, if they perish that fight, they gain a great glory, in that they have no greater use than that wherein they strive with Christ, not with the Romans or the Britons. They are eager to retain the word of the Lord, not to draw blood. But the Lord will give strength and arms to those that trust in him, provided the undertaking be right, which we attempt. ‘I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee’ [Josh 1:5], said the Lord full of faith and truth to Joshua, going against his enemies and taking upon him a difficult province. Therefore there is no cause why any tyrant should snatch us away. This is the nature of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils, and not trust to this world, though shaken, but to him that hath conquered the world. Antonio succeeds well, trusting to his own arts. He has long hands and a fat flock. Those are they that leap into this net, provided they be fed, though with danger of their souls, which is usual with foolish fishes. But oh the glory to God, who hath made us victorious in truth, though assaulted with so many evils! He is too strong for us by art and subtilty, that is, by Satan. But we prevail in this, that we have grace of God in our hands, whereby we may sprinkle our brow with honour. Lastly, that he may be most successful to fulfil his folly, yet we may go securely, not only ourselves, but also our field and subjects. To them is left the free choice of faith, by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained with their own money. So great is their love to Christ that have truly believed. But we have suffered greater things. God will give them also an end.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my most beloved Bullinger, a proposal which I wrote down in a sudden flame of fervor when I had observed something in our pagan mind against the citizens of Zurich, in appearance at least, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this matter, in my opinion, we must rely on this: that we, who have given to Christ a sincere name from the understanding of His word, however stripped of treaties and afflicted by society, with brave minds and with the love by which we have proposed to venerate truth, may advance the faith, once received, known and understood, with most harmonious desires. Encouraged by this, I chose to bear the night owls, as they say, to Athens rather than to fail in duty or charity, which is the teacher of all duties. Take care, o Bullinger, my most loving brother, to inflame and support your souls in this, so that they do not allow themselves to be cast down from the step of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then they will be seen to embrace Christ, when, after so many woes, they will be no less brave in retaining this honour than they were victorious, in order that I may not remember that the only true victory and therefore the proper profession of Christianity is that by which, in straits and tribulations, with exalted minds and spirit, they are united, not by strength, but by confession, not by arms, but by the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of enemies. By this way it is a pleasure to go through the midsts of the devil's troops, provided nothing be committed against the decency of piety. For we love the use of arms, as Zwingli did, not for revenge, but for the keeping and defending of truth. Hence, if they perish who fight, they win with great glory, since they do not have a more excellent use than that by which they contend with Christ, not with Accius or Brutus. They are eager to retain, not shed, the blood of the Lord. But the Lord will give strength to the confident, both of arms and of courage, provided the aim be right, which we are striving for. "For I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee" [Jos 1:5], said God, full of faith and truth, to Joshua going forth against the enemies and undertaking a difficult province. Therefore there is no cause why any tyrant should snatch us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we may be exercised by evils and so, shaken as by storms, may not trust in the world, but in Him who has conquered the world. Our Antronius is succeeding well, trusting to his own arts. He has long hands and a full purse. To this net those rush of their own accord, provided they may be fed, though with peril to their souls, which usually foolish fishes do. But oh, glory to God, who has made us victorious, though beset by so many evils, by truth! He conquers, but by art and deceit, that is, by Satan. We conquer in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, by which we may bedew our forehead with honour. Finally, that he may be most able to accomplish his foolishness, still it is allowed us to act in safety, not only to ourselves, but to the field and the subjects. For to these has been left the free option of faith by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they be without ministers to be supported at their own expense. So great is their love to Christ of those who have truly believed. But we have suffered more grievous things. God will give an end to these also. See that the ministers of Berne, Basle, and Schafhausen are admonished, that they do not put forth sluggish hands to the defence of the common cause.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote in a sudden heat of spirit when I observed what a spirit of enmity there was against the Zürich people in show, but indeed against the holiness of our Gospel. In this I judge it our duty to adhere, that we who have given ourselves to Christ with a sincere understanding of his word, however stripped of confederacies and afflicted society, yet with constant minds and that love with which we have proposed the truth to be worshipped by us, may still promote the faith received, known, and approved, with the most unanimous consent. Being therefore induced, I chose rather to carry the owl, as they say, to Athens than to be wanting either to my duty or to charity itself, which is the mistress of all duties. Take great care, O Bullinger, my dearest brother, to inflame and encourage your spirits herein, that they suffer not themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be esteemed to embrace Christ when, after so many afflictions, they shall be no less constant in maintaining this honor than they were victorious, not to mention that this is the very true and even proper victory of the Christian profession, by which, in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in spirit, not by strength, in confession, not by arms, to the glory of Christ, not to the slaughter of their enemies. By this way it is good to pass through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be committed contrary to the comeliness of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli did, not for revenge, but appointed for the keeping and defence of the truth. By which means, if they perish that fight, they overcome with great glory, having no other use than that they may contend with Christ, not with Achaians or Brutuses. They are greedy, not of shedding blood, but of retaining the word of the Lord. And the Lord will give strength and courage to such as trust in him, provided their enterprise be right, which we take in hand. «I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee» [Jos 1,5], said God full of faith and truth to Joshua when he was going against his enemies and undertaking a most difficult service. Therefore there is no cause why any tyranny should snatch us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils, and so, though we be tossed like waves of the sea, yet let us not trust in the world, but in him that hath overcome the world. Antonio hath succeeded very well, trusting to his own arts. He hath long hands and a fat flock. Into this net there are some who willingly leap, so they may be fed, though with danger of their souls, which foolish fishes usually do. But oh the glory to God, who hath made us conquerors, notwithstanding so many evils, by the truth! He overcomes, but by art and subtlety, that is, by Satan. We overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, to sprinkle our forehead with the shame of it. And lastly, that he might be fully accomplished in his folly, we may nevertheless use our liberty according to his pleasure, not only for ourselves, but also for our country and subjects. For unto them is left free choice of the faith, by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained with their own stock. Such is the love to Christ of those who have truly believed. But we have suffered greater things. God will give an end to these also. Take care that the Bernese and Basel ministers, and also the Schafhausenians, be admonished not to put forth their hands slothfully to the upholding of the common cause. You cannot think how much they are moved with these engines, who are filled with the dew of the spirit. But to God be the glory, who hath made us conquerors, notwithstanding so many evils, by the truth!</output>

  <output>I send you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote down with a sudden warmth, when I noticed what was in the minds of our heathens towards the people of Zurich, in appearance only, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this, I think, we must rely on that we, who have given the name to Christ with sincere understanding of his word, though deprived of alliances and afflicted in society, yet with firm minds and with that love with which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be worshipped, promote the faith, once received, known and understood, with the most unanimous prayers. For this reason I was induced to carry the nightingales, as it were, to Athens, rather than be wanting either in my duty, or in charity herself, which is the mistress of all duties. Take this great care, O Bullinger, my dearest brother, that you may inflame and exhort your spirits to let not their steps in faith towards Christ be turned by wicked arts. Then only they will be seen to embrace Christ when, after so many afflictions, they shall be no less zealous in retaining this honour, than they were victorious, that I may not mention that this is the very true victory, and even the proper profession of Christianity, by which, in straits and tribulations, they are exalted in spirit, not by strength, in confession, not by arms, to the glory of Christ, not to the slaughter of their enemies. By this way, it is pleasant to go through the midst of the satanic troops, provided that nothing be committed against the becoming reverence of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zuinglius loved it, instituted not for revenge, but for retaining and defending the truth. By this means, if they perish that fight, they conquer with great glory, having no greater use than that which they strive for with Christ, not with the Achaeans or the Bruti. They are desirous of retaining, not of drawing blood, but of the Lord's word. But the Lord will also give strength, both of arms and of strength, to them that trust in him, provided the design be right, which we are undertaking. «I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee» [Josh 1:5], said the Lord full of faith and truth to Joshua, going against his enemies and undertaking a difficult province. Therefore it is not that any tyrants should carry us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils, and even being tossed, not trust in the world, but in him that hath overcome the world. Antonio of ours succeeded very well, trusting to his own arts. He has long hands and a plentiful purse. Those that swim into this net must be satisfied with the bait, though with danger to their soul, as foolish fishes usually do. But O glory to God, who hath made us conquerors in truth, though encompassed with so many evils! He overcomes, but with craft and fraud, that is, with Satan. We overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hand, to befoul the face of this with shame. At last, that he may be most successful in filling up his folly, it is lawful for us to act, notwithstanding his lust, and not only for us, but for the country and subjects. To these is left the free choice of faith by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained at their own charges. So great is the love to Christ of them that have truly believed. But we have suffered greater things. God will give an end to these also. Take care, that the ministers of Berne, Basel, and Schaffhausen, be admonished, not to put their hands slothfully to the common cause to be defended. You would not believe with what disregard they are moved at these inventions, who are filled with the dew of the spirit. The flesh meanwhile acts after its own manner, and triumphs after a feminine way, not knowing certainly how ridiculous it is to acknowledge a thing of which you can give no evident reason.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I have hastily written in a certain warmth, when I noticed what kind of spirit our pagans had towards the people of Zurich, although in reality it was against the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion, this is where we should rely on, that those of us who have given the name of Christians to Christ, to the best of our understanding of His word, however deprived of covenants and afflicted in society, yet with constant minds and with that love with which we have proposed to worship the truth received, acknowledged and understood, promote it with the greatest concord of desires. Induced by this, I chose to carry the nightingale, as they say, to Athens rather than to fail either in duty or in charity itself, which is the mistress of all duty. Take care of this, o Bullinger, dearest brother, that you encourage and strengthen your souls, lest they allow themselves to be pulled down from the step of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then, they will be seen to embrace Christ when, after so many afflictions, they will be no less victorious in retaining this honor than they were as victors, so that I do not remember that victory, and indeed it is proper to the Christian profession, whereby in straits and tribulations they are exalted in spirit, not in strength, in profession, not in arms, in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of enemies. Certainly, through the midst of the Satan's hordes, it is pleasant to go with patience, provided that nothing is committed against the beauty of piety. For we love the use of arms, as Zwingli did, not for revenge, but for the purpose of retaining and defending the truth. By this very thing, if those who fight perish, they overcome with great glory, since they have no more glorious use than that by which they contend with Christ, not with Attics or Brutuses. They are eager not to draw blood, but to retain the word of the Lord. But the Lord will also give strength to those who trust, both of arms and of strength, provided that the plan is right which we are undertaking. «I will not leave you nor forsake you» [Jos 1,5], said God full of faith and truth to Joshua who was going against the enemies and undertaking a difficult province. Therefore, it is not necessary that any tyrant should snatch us away. This is the nature of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils and thus, though shaken by storms, we should not trust in the world, but in Him who has overcome the world. Antonio of ours has succeeded very well, relying on his own arts. He has long hands and a fat flock. Some voluntarily jump into this net, provided they are fed with bait, although at the peril of their souls, which usually stupid fish do. But oh, the glory of God, who has made us victorious in truth, though assaulted by so many evils! He overcomes, but with art and fraud, that is, with Satan. We overcome in this that we have the grace of God in our hand, with which we may shame the face of this one. Finally, that he may have gained the most, to fill his foolishness, yet we are allowed to act contrary to his inclination, not only to us, but also to the country and subjects. For these, the free choice of faith by the grace of the Lord is left, nor will they lack ministers to be maintained by their own money. Such is the love of Christ in those who have truly believed. But we have suffered more grievous things. God will give an end to these also. You will take care that the ministers of Bern, Basel and Schaffhausen are reminded not to put their hands slackly to the defense of the common cause. You do not believe how they are not moved by these artifices, who have been filled with the dew of the spirit. Meanwhile, the flesh acts in its own way and it triumphs in a womanly manner, certainly ignorant of how ridiculous it is to acknowledge one whose no evident reason can be given. We have in our number the Psalmist's words: The counsels of the wicked shall perish.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my beloved Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote in a sudden heat of feeling, when I observed what was in the heart of our pagans towards the citizens of Zurich, in appearance indeed, but in reality against the holiness of our Gospel. In this opinion of mine, it is to be relied upon, that we who have dedicated our name to Christ in sincerity, according to the understanding of his word, however stripped of leagues and afflicted in society, yet with constant minds and that love with which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be worshipped, do far most cordially promote the faith once received, known and understood. Therefore induced, I chose to carry, as it is said, the owl to Athens, rather than to be wanting either to duty or to charity herself, which is the mistress of all duty. Take care of this especially, o Bullinger, my most beloved brother, that you may inflame and encourage your people in this, that they do not suffer themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be thought to embrace Christ, when they shall have been conquered, no less valiant, in preserving the honour of this, amidst so many calamities, than they were conquerors; that I may not mention, that this victory is at last the most true and proper to the Christian profession, by which in straits and tribulations, with elevated minds, they are with one spirit, not with strength; with confession, not with arms; with the glory of Christ, not with the slaughter of enemies. It is pleasant to go by this way through the middle of Satan's hosts, with patience, provided that nothing be committed against the decency of piety.</output>

In this, it is my opinion that we should rely, that we, who have dedicated our name to Christ with a sincere understanding of His word, however stripped of alliances and afflicted in society, yet with steadfast minds and with the love by which we have proposed to honor the truth, should most harmoniously advance the faith that has been accepted, understood, and perceived.

Take care, o Bullinger, dearest brother, to inflame and to exhort your souls in this, not to let themselves be cast off from the step of faith in Christ through wicked arts. Then only will they be seen to embrace Christ when, after so many tribulations, they shall have been no less victorious in holding onto this honor, than they were in their victories, not to mention that the truest victory, and thus the proper one of the Christian profession, is when, in distress and tribulations, with exalted minds, they are of one spirit, not of strength; of confession, not of arms; of the glory of Christ, not of the slaughter of the enemy.

  <output>I send to you, my most beloved Bullinger, a suggestion which I suddenly wrote in a fit of passion when I observed what was in the hearts of our pagans against the people of Zurich, in appearance but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion it is necessary to maintain this, that those of us who have sincerely given our name to Christ in accordance with his word, although deprived of covenants and afflicted in society, should be of one accord in promoting the faith which has been accepted, known and understood, with firm minds and with the same love with which we have proposed to worship the truth. Being thus induced, I would rather bring nightingales, as it were, to Athens, than fail in duty or in charity, which is the mistress of all duty. Take special care of this, my most beloved Bullinger, to inflame and encourage your spirits that they not allow themselves to be cast down from their faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only shall they be deemed to embrace Christ when, after having endured so many troubles, they shall be found no less victorious in preserving his honour than they were when conquering, so as not to mention that this last and most true victory is proper to the Christian profession, in which, in straits and afflictions, with elevated minds, they are of one spirit and not of strength; by confession and not arms; in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of enemies. By this way it is profitable to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided they commit nothing against the comely piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwinglius loved, not for revenge, but for the purpose of retaining and protecting the truth; by which very thing, if those who fight perish, they gain a great glory, since they have no more illustrious use than that whereby they contend with Christ and not with the Accians or the Britons, who are eager not to draw blood, but to retain the Lord's word. The Lord will also give strength, both of arms and of forces, to the faithful, provided the purpose be right which we endeavour. “I will not leave thee nor forsake thee,” said our Lord, full of faith and truth, to Joshua, who was about to go against enemies and was undertaking a difficult province. Therefore there is no cause why any tyranny should take us away.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, my dearest, a suggestion which I wrote down suddenly in a certain heat when I noticed what was in the hearts of our heathens towards the people of Zurich, in appearance but in fact against the holiness of our gospel. In my judgement this is what should be relied upon, that those of us who have sincerely given our name to Christ from the understanding of his word, however stripped of alliances and afflicted in society, yet with unshaken minds and with that love with which we have proposed to honour the truth received and once known and understood, should with most harmonious desires promote faith. Induced by this I preferred to carry out the so-called night-attacks, rather than to be wanting either in duty or in charity which is the teacher of all duty. Take special care, O Bullinger, my dearest brother, that you inflame and encourage your spirits in this, so that they do not allow themselves to be led astray from the rank of faith in Christ by the wicked arts. Then will they be seen to embrace Christ when, after so many troubles, they shall be no less victorious in retaining his honour than they were in conquering, not to mention that that is the very true victory and indeed the proper profession of a Christian, by which, in straits and tribulations, with exalted minds, they are one in spirit, not in strength; with confession, not with arms; with the glory of Christ, not with the slaughter of the enemy. By this way of going through the midst of Satan's troops it is profitable to practise patience, provided nothing be done contrary to the honour of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved it, not for vengeance, but for retaining and defending the truth, instituted; and by that very thing, if those who fight perish, they gain great glory, since they have no more honourable use than to contend with Christ, not with Achilles or Brutus, who are zealous not to suck blood, but to keep the Lord's word. Moreover, the Lord will give strength, both of arms and of forces, to those who put their trust in him, provided the undertaking be right which we are planning. "For I will not leave thee nor forsake thee," said our God full of faith and truth to Joshua going against the enemy and undertaking a difficult province. Therefore there is no reason why any tyranny should carry us away by force. This is the genius of our profession, that we be exercised by evils and even thus, shaken as by storms, not to trust in the world, but in him who has overcome the world. Antonio has succeeded well, trusting in his own arts.</output>

  <output>I am sending to you, my beloved Bullinger, a suggestion that I wrote in a sudden burst of warmth when I noticed what kind of attitude the pagans of ours had towards the citizens of Zurich, in form but actually against the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion, this is what we should strive for: that those of us who have dedicated ourselves sincerely to Christ in understanding of His word, however stripped of alliances and afflicted in society, yet with steadfast minds and with love to guard the truth which we have proposed to ourselves, shall promote the faith, once received, known and understood with the most unanimous of wishes. Therefore, induced by this, I preferred to carry the night owl, as it is said, to Athens rather than to be absent either from duty or from charity, which is the mistress of all duty. Take care, o Bullinger, my dearest brother, to inflame and encourage your spirits in this, that they may not suffer themselves to be thrown down from the step of the faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be seen as embracing Christ, when they shall have been conquered in retaining this honour with no less zeal than they were conquerors, not to mention that this is the very true victory and indeed proper to the Christian profession, in which in straits and tribulations, their minds being exalted, they are one in spirit, not in strength, by confession not by arms, for the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of the enemies. By this way, it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be committed against the comeliness of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved it, not for revenge, but instituted for the retaining and guarding of the truth; by which very thing, if those who fight are destroyed, they conquer with great glory, since they have no more honourable use than that they fight with Christ, not with Acciis or Brutus, who are eager not to draw blood, but to retain the Lord's word. But the Lord will also give strength, both of arms and of might, to those who trust Him, provided the undertaking be right, which we are undertaking. "For I will not leave thee nor forsake thee," said the God of faith and truth, full of faith, to Joshua when he was going against the enemies and undertaking a difficult province. Therefore, it is not that any tyrant may carry us away to the left hand. This is the genius of our profession, that we exercise ourselves in evils, and being tossed, as it were, by storms, we trust not in the world, but in Him who has conquered the world. Antonio of ours has had a good success, relying on his own arts. He has long hands and a fat sheepfold. There are some who willingly creep into this net, provided they have their bait, though with the peril of their souls, which fools are usually prone to.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote in a sudden heat of passion when I observed what was the sentiment of our heathen towards the people of Zurich, in appearance indeed, but in reality towards the sanctity of our gospel. In this point, in my opinion, we must resolve, that we, who have devoted ourselves to Christ from a sincere understanding of his word, should, though deprived of our treaties and afflicted in our society, yet with undaunted spirits and that love with which we proposed to worship truth, advance our faith, once received, known and understood, with the most concordant affections. Induced by this motive I chose rather to bring the nightingale, as it is called, to Athens, than to be wanting in my duty, or to charity herself, the great mistress of all duty. Take care, my dearest Bullinger, to inflame and animate your spirits in this point, that they suffer not themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith which they have in Christ, by the wiles of the wicked. Then only will they be truly said to embrace Christ, when, after so many calamities, they shall be found as steadfast in the maintaining of his honour, as they were victorious; not to mention, that the highest and most true victory, and indeed that which is proper to the Christian profession, is to be so raised above afflictions and tribulations, as to be of one spirit, not of strength; of confession, not of arms; to glorify Christ, not to triumph over enemies. This is a pleasant way to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided that nothing be done contrary to the honour of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwinglius loved it, not for revenge, but for the maintaining and defending of truth: and they, who so fight, though they perish, yet in a great measure overcome, in that they have a more honourable employment than to contend with Accius or Brutus, who must be eager, not to draw blood, but to retain the word of the Lord. But our Lord will give strength and power to those that trust in him, provided their purpose be right, which we endeavour. «For I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee», said God full of faith and truth to Josua, when he was going to battle against his enemies, and to undertake a most difficult province. Therefore we have no cause to be carried away by any tyrants. This is the genius of our profession, that we, being exercised by troubles and tossed as it were by storms, should not trust in the world, but in Him who hath overcome the world. Antonio hath succeeded well, trusting to his own skill. He hath long hands and a fat purse. Into this net there are some, who leap of their own accord, that they may have their fill, though with danger to their souls, which is commonly the case of foolish fishes. But O the glory to God, who hath made us conquerors in truth, through so many evils that have been laid upon us!</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, my dearest brother, a suggestion which I hastily wrote down in a sudden heat, when I perceived what was the frame of mind of our heathens towards the people of Zurich, in appearance indeed, but in reality against the holiness of our Gospel. In this point, in my opinion, we should stand firm, that we who have devoted ourselves sincerely to Christ, after the manner of his word, although we may be stripped of leagues and afflicted in our society, yet with constant minds and that love, with which we have proposed the truth to be worshipped by us, should, with the most concordant desires, promote the faith, once received, known, and seen. Being thus induced, I had rather carry owls to Athens, as the proverb is, than to be wanting either in my duty or in charity itself, which is the mistress of all duty. Take care of this, O Bullinger, my dearest brother, that you inflame and encourage your spirits in this, that they may not suffer themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by the evil arts of men. Then only shall they be said to embrace Christ, when, after so many afflictions, they shall be no less zealous in maintaining this honour, than when they were conquerors, not to mention that this is the very true victory, and even the proper profession of Christianity, to be exalted in spirit, and united in one spirit, not in strength; in confession, not in arms; for the glory of Christ, not for the slaughter of enemies. By this way it is a pleasure to go through the multitude of Satan, provided nothing be done contrary to the comely piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwinglius loved it, not for revenge, but for the keeping and defending of the truth; and so, if those that fight perish, they gain a great glory, having no more glorious use than to contend with Christ, and not with Accius or Brutus, who are to be desirous, not of drawing blood, but of retaining the word of the Lord. And the Lord will give strength and courage to them that trust in him, provided their purpose be right, which we are going about. For our God, full of faith and truth, said to Joshua, when he was going against his enemies and undertaking a difficult charge, «I will not forsake thee, nor forsake thee». Therefore there is no cause why any tyranny should snatch us away. This is the nature of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils; and therefore let us not trust in the world, though we be tossed as with storms, but in Him that has overcome the world. Our Anthony has prospered well, trusting to his own arts. He has long hands and a fat flock. To this net some jump in of their own accord, so long as they may feed, though to the danger of their souls, which commonly stupid fishes do. But, O! the glory be to God, who has made us conquerors by truth, though so sorely beset with evils! He is overcome with art and policy, that is, with Satan; but we by this are conquerors, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may sprinkle our forehead with honour.</output>

  <output>I send to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote with sudden fervor when I noticed what was in the hearts of our pagans towards the Zurichers, who, though in appearance, in truth were opposed to the sanctity of our gospel. In this, in my opinion, it is necessary to hold fast that, those of us who have, with full understanding, dedicated ourselves to Christ, even though we are stripped of our alliances and afflicted in our society, we should nevertheless, with steadfast hearts and with the same love with which we proposed to worship the truth that we have accepted and understood, promote it with the greatest of harmony. Therefore, being thus induced, I preferred to bring owls to Athens, as they say, rather than to displease or be unfaithful to charity itself, which is the teacher of all duty. Take care, o Bullinger, my dearest brother, that you inflame and encourage your spirits, so that they do not allow themselves to be cast down from the rank of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be seen to have embraced Christ, when, after so many afflictions, they shall have been found not less brave in keeping and defending this honour, than they were victorious; as not to mention that very true victory and proper profession of Christianity, in which, amidst straights and tribulations, their spirits being exalted, they oppose with spirit, not with strength; with confession not with arms; the glory of Christ, not the slaughter of their enemies. It is pleasant to go this way through the middle of Satan's troops, provided nothing is done against the honour of piety; for we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but for the keeping and defending of the truth, by which, if those who fight perish, they gain a great glory, since they have no more honourable use than that they contend with Christ, not with the Achaeans or the Brutus, who must be eager, not to draw blood, but to retain the word of the Lord. Nevertheless, the Lord will give strength and power to those who trust in him, provided their undertaking be right. «I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee», said our God full of faith and truth to Josua when he was going against his enemies and undertaking a difficult task. Therefore, no tyrant can snatch us away with any sinister design. This is the nature of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils and not trust in the world, though shaken, but in Him who has conquered the world. Antonio has succeeded very well, trusting in his own arts. He has long hands and a fat purse. Into this net some willingly leap, provided they can be fed, though with danger to their souls, which is usually the case with foolish fry. But glory be to God, who has made us victorious with truth, though persecuted with so many evils! He obtains the victory, but with craft and guile, that is, with Satan; we overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, with which we may cover our faces with shame. At last, that he may fill up his folly, it is lawful for us to act, not according to his will only, but also according to the good of the country and our subjects; for to them is left the free choice of faith, by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained with their own money.</output>

  <output>I send to you, most beloved Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote down in a sudden heat when I noticed the attitude of our pagans towards the people of Zurich, which is in appearance, but not in reality, contrary to the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion, we should rely on this, that we who have given our name to Christ in sincerity, although stripped of treaties and afflicted with society, yet with constant minds and with the love with which we have proposed that the truth should be worshipped, promote the faith once received, known, and perceived with the most unanimous desires. Thus induced, I chose rather to carry the owl, as it were, to Athens than to fail either in duty or in charity itself, which is the teacher of all duty. Take care, O Bullinger, most beloved brother, that you inflame and encourage your spirits in this, that they do not suffer themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then only will they seem to embrace Christ, when, after so many calamities, they shall be no less victorious in retaining this honor than they were in gaining it, not to mention that this is the true and proper victory of the Christian profession, whereby, being exalted in distress and tribulation, they are one in spirit, not in strength; by confession, not by arms; the glory of Christ, not the slaughter of the enemy. By this way, it is pleasant to pass through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done against the modesty of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but appointed to retain and defend the truth; by which very thing, if they that fight perish, they gain a great glory, being no less eager to retain the word of the Lord than to draw blood, and not of the Accians or the Britons. But the Lord will give strength both of arms and of virulence to them that trust in him, provided the design be right which we are undertaking. «I will not leave thee nor forsake thee» said our God full of faith and truth to Joshua, going against his enemies and undertaking a difficult campaign. Therefore it is not to be feared that any tyrant will carry us away with sinister designs. This is the genius of our profession, that we be exercised by evils, and so, shaken as by storms, we trust not to the world, but to him that hath conquered the world. Our Antronius has succeeded well, trusting to his own arts. He has long hands and a fat purse. Into this net there are who leap willingly, provided they may be fed, although with danger to their souls, which usually are the foolish fish. But o glory to God, who hath made us victorious over truth, though beset with so many evils! He prevails by art and guile, that is, by Satan; we prevail in this, that we have the grace of God in our hand, to sprinkle our forehead with honour. Finally, that he may be most successful in fulfilling his folly, yet it is lawful for us to carry on our business in safety, not only for ourselves, but for the country and the subjects; for unto them is left the free choice of faith by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained by their own means. Such is the love to Christ of them that have truly believed.</output>

  <output>I send to you, Bullinger, my dearest brother, a suggestion which I wrote down with sudden warmth when I noticed what was in the minds of our pagans, indeed in appearance against the citizens of Zurich but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion, this is to be our foundation, that we, who have given our names in sincerity to Christ according to His understanding, impoverished as we are in alliances and afflicted in society, nevertheless with steadfast minds and with that love with which we have proposed to ourselves the truth to be respected, may promote the faith received, known, and understood with the most united desires. Influenced by this, I preferred, as they say, to bear my night-owls to Athens than to be absent either from duty or from charity itself, which is the mistress of all duty. Take care, o Bullinger, my dearest brother, that you inflame and encourage the souls of yours, lest they allow themselves to be cast down from the step of faith in Christ by wicked arts. Then they will be seen to embrace Christ when, notwithstanding so many calamities, they shall have been no less victorious in retaining the honor of Him than they were in conquering, that I may not mention that that is the very true and proper victory of the Christian profession, wherein in straits and tribulations, with their spirits exalted, they are one in spirit, not in strength; by confession, not by arms; for the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of enemies. By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be committed against the decency of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but instituted for retaining and defending the truth; wherein, though they that fight perish, yet by their great glory they overcome, having no nobler use than to contend with Christ, not with Accius or Brutus, who are eager, not to draw blood, but to retain the word of their Lord. And the Lord will give strength both of arms and of forces to them that trust in Him, provided their undertaking be right, which we are undertaking. "For I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee," said the God of faith and truth to Joshua, going forth against his enemies and undertaking a most difficult task. Therefore there is no cause why any tyrant should snatch us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we be exercised with evil and so, being shaken as with storms, we trust not to the world, but to Him that hath conquered the world. Antonio has succeeded well, trusting to his own arts. He has long hands and fat cattle. Some voluntarily jump into this net, provided they be fed, though with hazard of their souls, which foolish fishes are wont to do. But oh glory to God, who hath made us conquerors through truth, notwithstanding so many evils! He overcomes us, but by art and guile, that is to say, by Satan; but we conquer in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may be suffused with the honor of this. Finally, that he may accomplish his folly most, yet it is lawful for us to act, notwithstanding his desire, and not only for us, but for the country and the subjects; for unto them is left free option of faith by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained with their own money. Great is the love in Christ of them who have truly believed. But we have suffered greater things; God will give these also an end.</output>

  <output>I am sending to you, my dearest Bullinger, a proposal which I wrote with a sudden heat of mind when I observed what was the sentiment of our people towards the Zürichians, in appearance indeed, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In my opinion, this is the thing to be kept in view, that those who have sincerely devoted themselves to Christ, from the true understanding of his word, however oppressed with alliances and afflicted with society, yet with constant minds and that love wherewith they have proposed to themselves the truth to be honoured, may with the most unanimous desires promote the faith which was once received, and once understood and tried. Being therefore induced thereto, I chose, as the saying is, to carry owls to Athens, rather than to be wanting either in my duty, or in charity, which is the mistress of all duties. Take care of this in the first place, my dearest brother Bullinger, that you may inflame and encourage your spirits, lest they should suffer themselves to be cast down from their standing in the faith towards Christ by evil arts. Then only will they be thought to embrace Christ, when, notwithstanding all their afflictions, they shall be found no less constant in preserving his honour, than they were in obtaining it; that I may not mention, that this is the only true and proper victory of the Christian profession, that when shut up in straits and troubles, their minds being elevated, they vanquish with their spiritual, not with their corporal strength; with their confession, not with their arms; in the glory of Christ, not in the slaughter of their enemies. By this way it is pleasant to pass through the very midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done contrary to the comeliness of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwinglius loved, not to revenge, but to maintain and keep the truth; by which means, if those that fight perish, they conquer with great glory, having no more excellent use of them than to contend with Christ, and not with Accius or Brutus, who are greedy to retain, not to shed blood, but the word of the Lord. And our Lord will give strength, either of arms or of courage, to such as put their trust in him, provided the enterprise be right which we undertake. «For I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee,» said God our Lord, full of faith and truth to Josue, when going against his enemies, and undertaking a difficult enterprise. Therefore there is no cause that any tyrant should snatch us away. This is the temper of our profession, that although we be exercised with evils, yet let us not trust in the world, but in him that hath conquered the world. Antonio hath succeeded well, trusting to his own arts indeed; he hath long hands, and a fat flock. Into this net there are some that creep of their own accord, if they may have their bait, though with danger to their souls, which is usually the case with foolish fowls. But oh the glory to God, who hath made us victorious, though tried with so many evils by the truth! He overcometh with craft and subtlety, that is, with Satan; we overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may sprinkle our faces with a becoming modesty. And lastly, that he may be most capable of filling up his folly, yet may we go on securely in opposition to his will, not only for ourselves, but also for our country and the people subject to it; for to them is left the free choice of their faith by the grace of the Lord, and they shall not want ministers to be maintained at their own charge. Such is the love to Christ of those that have believed truly. But we have suffered more grievous things; God will give an end to them also. Take care that the ministers of Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen be admonished, that they do not lay their hands negligently to the common cause to be maintained.</output>

  <output>I am sending to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote down in a sudden heat when I had observed what was in the minds of our heathen towards the people of Zurich, in appearance indeed, but indeed against the holiness of our Gospel. In this matter, in my opinion, we must stand fast, that those who have given their names to Christ, in sincerity of understanding his word, however deprived of leagues and afflicted in society, yet with constant minds and with that love which we have proposed to reverence truth, once received, known, and viewed, should promote the received faith with the most concordant desires. Being moved by this, I preferred to bear nocturnal Athenians, as it were, than to be wanting either in duty or in charity itself, which is the mistress of all duty. Take care of this especially, o Bullinger, my dearest brother, that you inflame, encourage, and exhort your minds not to suffer themselves to be cast down from the degree of faith in Christ through evil arts. Then they shall be accounted to embrace Christ, when they shall have been overcome with so many afflictions, no less zealous in retaining this honor, than they were victorious; that I may not mention that this last victory is the very true and proper victory of the Christian profession, in that in straits and tribulations, with exalted minds, they are one in spirit, not in strength; by confession, not by arms; for the glory of Christ, not by the slaughter of enemies. By this way it is pleasant to go through the very midst of the devil's troops, provided nothing be done contrary to the decency of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but for the retaining and defending of truth, ordained; by which, if they that fight perish, they conquer with great glory, having no greater use than to contend with Christ, not with Accius or Brutus, who ought to be greedy, not of blood, but of retaining the Lord's word. Yet our Lord will give strength, either of arms or of strength, to them that trust in him, provided the undertaking be right, which we are framing. «For I will not leave thee nor forsake thee», said the God of our faith and truth, full of faith, to Joshua, going forth against his enemies and undertaking a very hard province. Therefore there is no cause why any tyrants should snatch us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils, and not trust in the world, though shaken, but in him that hath conquered the world. Our Anthony hath prospered well, trusting to his own arts. He hath long hands and a fat purse.

Such is the love to Christ in them that have truly believed. But we have suffered more grievous things; our Lord will give an end to these also.

  <output>I am sending to you, my dearest Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote in a sudden burst of ardor, when I observed what was in the minds of our pagan adversaries towards us, in appearance only, but in reality towards the sanctity of our Gospel. In this matter I think it is to be relied upon that we, who have given ourselves to Christ sincerely, according to the understanding of his word, although stripped of treaties and distressed in our association, yet with constant minds and that love with which we have proposed to ourselves to reverence the truth once received, acknowledged, and understood, should with most unanimous desires, promote the same faith. Being induced by this consideration, I preferred, as they say, to carry owls to Athens, rather than to be wanting either to my office, or to charity, which is the mistress of all offices. Take care, O my dearest Bullinger, that you inflame and encourage your own minds in this, that they suffer themselves not to be drawn from their degree of faith in Christ, by evil arts. Then, only, will they be accounted to embrace Christ, when, after so many oppressions, they shall be no less victorious in maintaining this honour, than they were before in gaining it, not to mention, that this is the only true victory, and in effect, the very profession of Christianity, by which in straits and tribulations, being raised up in spirit, they fight with one, not with strength; with confession, not with arms; to the glory of Christ, not to the slaughter of their enemies. By this way it is pleasant to go through the midst of Satan's troops, provided nothing be done against the comeliness of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwinglius loved it, not for revenge, but for the keeping and defending of truth, instituted; and by that very means, if they perish that fight, they gain a great victory, having no greater use than to strive with Christ, not with Accius or Brutus, whom they must be desirous to retain the blood of the Lord's word, and not to draw. But the Lord will give strength and courage both of arms and forces to them that trust in him, provided the design be right, which we endeavour. "For I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee," said our God full of faith and truth to Joshua, going against his enemies, and undertaking a very difficult enterprise. Therefore, let no tyrants carry us away with ill success. This is the disposition of our profession, that we should be exercised with evils, and not trust to the world, though shaken, but to him that hath overcome the world. Our Antronius hath succeeded very well, trusting to his own abilities. He hath long hands and a fat flock. To this net they leap in of themselves, so they may be fed with bait, though with danger to their souls, which is usually the case with foolish fishes. But O the glory be to God, who hath set us victorious over truth, though so much beset with evils! This one conquereth by art and subtilty, that is, by Satan; but we overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, to fill our faces with a comely shame. At last, that he may be most accomplished in foolishness, yet we may walk at liberty, according to his pleasure, not only for ourselves, but also for our country and subjects; for unto them is left a free choice of faith by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained with their own money. Such is the love of Christ in them that truly believe. But we have suffered greater things; the Lord will give them an end also. Take care that the Bernese, Baselenses, and Schafhusians, and other ministers, be admonished not to move their hands slothfully to the common defence. You would not believe how these means affect them that are filled with the dew of the Spirit. The flesh meanwhile acteth according to its nature, and triumpheth in a womanish sort, not knowing how ridiculous it is to acknowledge a thing, for which no evident reason can be given. But to God be the glory, who hath set us victorious over truth, though so much oppressed with evils!</output>

  <output>I send you, Bullinger, my most beloved friend, a suggestion which I wrote in a sudden warmth, when I observed what was in the mind of our pagan enemies towards the people of Zurich, in outward show indeed, but in reality towards the holiness of our gospel. In this I think that we ought to rest, that we who have given our names sincerely to Christ from a feeling of his word, whatever be our condition as to covenants and the distressed state of the church, yet with resolute minds and that love with which we have proposed the truth to be worshipped, should promote the faith received, once for all, and now comprehended and viewed, with the most unanimous desires. Actuated by this, I had rather, as they say, carry the owl to Athens, than be wanting either in duty or in love, which is the mistress of all duty. Take special care, O Bullinger, my most beloved brother, to kindle and encourage the minds of your people, lest they suffer themselves to be overcome from their steadfastness in the faith towards Christ by wicked arts. Then only will they be esteemed as embracing Christ, when they shall have been vanquished by so many afflictions, no less resolute in preserving this honor than they were victorious, not to mention that the true victory, and indeed that which properly belongs to the Christian profession, is that in which, in straits and tribulations, with elevated minds, they are one in spirit, and not in strength; in confession, and not in arms; for the glory of Christ, and not for the slaughter of their enemies. By this way, through the midst of Satan's troops, it is pleasant to go in patience, provided nothing be done repugnant to the decorum of piety. For we approve of the use of arms, such as Zwinglius approved of, not for revenge, but instituted for the preservation and defense of the truth; and in that case, when those who fight perish, they overcome with great glory, having no greater use than that they may contend with Christ and not with the Achaeans or Bruti, who are desirous of retaining, not the blood, but the word of the Lord. But the Lord will also give strength both of arms and of courage to them that trust in him, provided their undertaking be right, which is what we are attempting. «For I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee», said our God, full of faith and truth, to Joshua, going forth against his enemies, and undertaking a most difficult enterprise. Therefore there is no need that any tyranny should take us off on the left hand. It is the genius of our profession, that we should be exercised by evils, and not trust to the world, though shaken, but to Him who has conquered the world. To our Anthony it succeeded very well, trusting to his own arts. He has long hands and a rich treasury. Into this net there are some who leap of their own accord, provided they be fed with bait, though with the peril of their souls, which is usually the case with foolish fishes. But O the glory be to God, who has constituted us victorious over truth, though encompassed with so many evils! He prevails, but by art and fraud, that is, by Satan; but we prevail in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we may sprinkle our forehead with this honor. Finally, that he may be enabled to commit the utmost folly, it is yet lawful for us to act, contrary to his inclination, safe ourselves, and our country and subjects; for to these has free choice of faith been left by the grace of the Lord, nor shall they want ministers to be maintained out of their own purse. So great is the love towards Christ in those who have truly believed. But we have suffered greater things; God will give them also an end. Take care that the Bernese and Baselers, together with the ministers of Schaffhausen, be cautioned not to show an idle hand in the defense of a common cause. You would not believe how they are moved by these engines, who are filled with the dew of the Spirit. The flesh, meantime, acts after its manner, and triumphs vainly, not knowing how ridiculous it is to own a thing for which you can give no evident reason. We have in record the psalm of David: «The counsels of the wicked shall perish».</output>

  <output>I send to you, most loving Bullinger, a suggestion which I wrote in a sudden heat of passion when I had observed what sort of malicious intent our heathen had against the citizens of Zurich in appearance, but in reality against the holiness of our gospel. In this I judge that we should stand firm, so that those of us who have devoted ourselves to Christ with a sincere understanding of His word, however stripped of alliances and afflicted in our fellowship, yet with constant minds and the love with which we have proposed to worship the truth once received, held, and seen, should promote the faith with the most unanimous good wishes. Therefore, I have been persuaded to bring the owl to Athens, as the saying goes, rather than to fail either in my duty or in charity itself, which is the teacher of all duty. Take great care of this, O most loving brother Bullinger, that you may inflame and encourage your spirits, that they not suffer themselves to be cast down from the steps of faith in Christ by evil arts. Then they will be seen to embrace Christ when, after being so often afflicted, they are no less valiant in retaining this honor than they had been victorious, not to mention that this is the very true victory and, indeed, the proper profession of Christianity, wherein, in straits and afflictions, with exalted minds, they are in spirit one, not in strength; by confession, not by weapons; for the glory of Christ, not for the slaughter of their enemies. By this way it is a pleasure to go through the middle of Satan's troops, so long as nothing is committed contrary to the comeliness of piety. For we love the use of arms, such as Zwingli loved, not for revenge, but for the purpose of retaining and protecting the truth; and by this very means, if they who fight perish, they gain a great glory, since they have no nobler use than to contend with Christ, not with the Achaeans or the Bruti, who are not eager to draw blood, but to retain the word of the Lord. But the Lord will also give strength, both of arms and of forces, to those that trust Him, so long as the purpose be right, which we are endeavoring. "I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee," said the God of our faith and truth to Joshua as he was setting out against his enemies and undertaking a most difficult province. Therefore, it is not to be feared that any tyranny should snatch us away. This is the genius of our profession, that we are exercised by evils, and so, being tossed as by storms, we do not trust in the world, but in Him that hath overcome the world. Antonio of our party has prospered well, trusting to his own means. He has long hands and a fat purse. Some, to be sure, leap into this net, so long as they can enjoy the bait, although with the peril of their souls, which generally the foolish fry do. But O glory to God, who hath made us victorious in truth, though tried by so many evils! He overcomes, but by craft and deceit, that is, by Satan; we overcome in this, that we have the grace of God in our hands, whereby we can cover our forehead with shame. Finally, that he may accomplish his folly most, it is nevertheless lawful for us to act contrary to his lust, and not only for us, but also for our country and subjects; for them has been left the free choice of faith, through the grace of the Lord, neither will they want ministers to be maintained with their own revenue. So great is the love to Christ of those who have truly believed. But we have suffered greater things; God will give an end to these also. Take care that the people of Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, besides their ministers, be admonished not to put forth slack hands to the defense of a common cause. You would not believe how they would not be moved by such techniques, who are watered with the dew of the Spirit. Meanwhile, the flesh acts in its own way and triumphs femininely, being ignorant, to be sure, how ridiculous it is to acknowledge a thing of which you can render no evident reason. We have in our account the psalm of David: "The counsels of the wicked shall perish." Selah.</output>
