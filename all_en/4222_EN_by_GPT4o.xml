      <p>Greetings and Peace. What I long thought would happen has finally occurred, beyond expectation.</p>
      <p>The papal kingdom has once again been published by Oporinus, with some of my other works included, and at the end, he added some things that are not mine. Among them is a poem by someone unknown about the Lord's Supper, comparing Christ and the Pope. When I gave this compiled booklet to a certain jurist here, and he came across that poem, he immediately showed it to the prince. The prince became so enraged that he ordered me to be dismissed from the temple, suspecting either that I had written it or that I shared the same opinion.</p>
      <p>I am neither questioned nor heard; he is so convinced of the truth of what Brentius or someone else whispers to him. Now, brother, I beg you, help me with your advice.</p>
      <p>For about nine years, I have taught the gospel here without complaint, opposed no one, and contended with no one for the sake of harmony and peace, although I sometimes heard with great sorrow things very far from the truth; for you know the Brentian fabrications. Now Oporinus has ruined me with his additions.</p>
      <p>Where then should I turn? I truly do not know; if you know of any place either in your territory or elsewhere, please let me know.</p>
      <p>I am not inclined to return to my abandoned legal studies; for I am in my fifty-first year and I do not dare to approach my former patron Jakob Fugger again; for he was very displeased that I returned to theology and sacred sermons. I earnestly ask you, look around, inquire for some position for me.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet your colleagues there in my name. Given in Stuttgart, February 29, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Naogeorg.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his lord and friend.</p>
