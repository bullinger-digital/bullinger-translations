    <p xml:id="regest1">Do not know if the bad news about Leo [Jud] is true; asks Bullinger to be concerned for the health of Theodor [Bibliander]. The newly elected Basel mayor Hemmann Offenburg has hardly distinguished himself - at least in church matters. Allegedly, the first Swiss mercenaries in the service of the French [King Francis I] have fallen; Myconius fears God's wrath upon the Confederation and calls for repentance, without being heard. The Frenchman is said to have paid the Turks incredible sums; his downfall would still be to the detriment of Germany. The Swiss are again being urged to aid the Turks and to restore Savoy. Myconius has referred Johannes Hospinian to the university regarding his job search and has declared himself unsuitable to help him in courtship. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I have received news about Leo [Jud] that I wish I hadn't; however, I do not know if it is true or not. They say Theodor [Bibliander] is again suffering from a fever, which makes me sad. That man should have heeded the advice of good friends, so that he would not be among those of whom the common saying goes: "He who does not accept advice cannot be helped." I hear that he is going to seek the hot springs; I would advise caution unless he does so on the advice of the most learned and faithful doctors. I say this only because I am very concerned about the man; for I fear for him. The reason I write this to you rather than to him is because of your authority with him; I believe that he will accept what you advise. I ask you to strive, as much as you can, to preserve the man.</p>
      <p>We also have a new mayor designated, Hemmann Offenburg. If he accepts, I will wait to see how he will conduct himself. I do not know if anything other than the nobility of his family recommends him. He is a man prudent and not sluggish in worldly affairs. In matters of God, he has not yet gained much praise, although he has shown a remarkably humane spirit towards the rural pastors under his command, albeit not very effectively. May the Lord grant him grace.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the first news reached us that the Swiss mercenaries who went to serve the French [King Francis I] have been cut down to a man. Tell me if you have any truth, as soon as you can. I seem to see the counsel of God: Switzerland has been glorious enough, indeed has lasted long enough.</p>
      <p>I indeed cry out for the people to turn to repentance, but in vain. I grieve and have no one here to grieve with me, so devoid of ears are the minds of men. It will go well with those who know God, whatever happens, whether good or bad.</p>
      <p>We will pray that He increases His knowledge in us. A certain famous merchant has spread the news that so much gold has been spent by the Frenchman on the Turks that, if you say it, no one would believe it. And this is to be the most Christian king! It is a miracle to me that the Lord allows him to rage against Him for so long, although I know the end will not last much longer.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I would rather he be good than perish, and that for the sake of his kingdom; for as long as it lasts, the freedom of Germany will remain, and with its loss, this freedom is lost. Such are the affections of man, etc.</p>
      <p>We are, I hear, again being called against the Turk. It is being repeated by the Duke of Savoy; there are threats unless we comply everywhere. Something will eventually happen.</p>
      <p>Finally, Johannes Hospinian has come and is seeking a position, which, however, does not exist. I have therefore referred him to the academics; if he has left, I do not know. He then asked me to be present at the betrothal, which is as foreign to me as anything could be. Therefore, there was nothing for me to respond except that I am most unsuitable for such matters; it is better, therefore, that I be absent than present, lest I harm, since I cannot help. I hear he took this refusal rather badly; but I know, if he knew how sincerely I acted, he could not be angry. I await what will happen.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with all yours, with Theodor, Pellican, Gaspar, and others.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, June 20, 1542.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, theologian, in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
