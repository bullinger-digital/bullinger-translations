      <p>Greetings in Christ.</p>
      <p>We are sending an Englishman with a cloak to you; we will also come ourselves if we hear that he is alive. Therefore, so that we might know more quickly, it pleased us to send this swift messenger ahead with a hired horse; for it was not permitted to hire more. I ask that you order him to hasten back to us if Frensham is alive.</p>
      <p>A cloak will be more easily and closely obtainable for you in Aarau, if needed. May the Lord Jesus, the source of all salvation, keep us for His glory!</p>
      <p>May 6, that is, the day after your letter was delivered here. Basel.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, J. Foxe.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
