    <p xml:id="regest1">Curione did not receive Bullinger's letter. Bullinger did not need to thank him for his little book [«De omni artificio disserendi atque tractandi summa»], as Curione owes him and his family so much. It is very commendable of Bullinger that he makes no fuss about his generosity! Nevertheless, Curione will not forget what he owes Bullinger, even if he cannot reciprocate the kindness shown to him due to his poverty.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">In his letter [not received], Bullinger recommends the student [Lamprecht Zehnder?], who, along with Huldrych Zwingli the Younger, has fortunately appeared at Curione's. Curione has given permission to all, but especially to the one recommended by Bullinger [Zehnder?], to visit him at any time and use his facilities. He also encouraged them to study and behave well, but above all to sincere and pure worship of God. Since the young students are less frequently with him than he would like, Bullinger should admonish them to regard Curione as a father and to use his household as their own.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">What does Bullinger write about the Council of Trent? Is Curione supposed to be called there too? That is a matter for cardinals and bishops, not for him! But if he had to go there, he would follow Bullinger into danger without hesitation. But without Bullinger, no Curione either!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">But joking aside: He has heard nothing about the continuation of the council, especially since even the imperial envoy [Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo], the Bishop of Trent, is neither with Pope Paul III nor with those who are ostensibly meeting in Bologna. For the lack of consent from all the princes serves as a pretext for rejecting any future changes [in holding the council]. Since no general council in the sense of Emperor Charles V can be held in Trent, he, as Curione heard, lets the imperial estates select a few to settle the religious disputes. Charles V will (of course!) always support their efforts for peace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">These are the news Curione has received. Bullinger should likewise share news with him in return, as he is undoubtedly well-informed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Greetings, also to the family and colleagues.</p>

      <p>In recent days, I received your letter, most learned and kind Bullinger, in which you thanked me for our little book, that is, for nothing, I say, to me who owes and wishes everything to you and all yours. But you are of such sweetness of character and kindness of spirit that you wish to surpass in every way, not only by giving benefits but also by concealing them. However, with your remarkable dissimulation, you will never achieve that I forget I am bound to you by servitude and obligation. But my poverty makes it so that I cannot respond to your merits towards us.</p>

      <p>In the same letter, you diligently recommend to me a certain student from your area. He came to me together with Zwingli, whom I was glad to see. And to him, whom you recommended to me, as well as to all others, I offered myself and my resources, allowing them to visit me and use my facilities whenever and as often as they please. Furthermore, I encouraged them towards good studies and morals, and also towards the sincere and pure worship and honor of God. It remains for you to write to them, so they may freely use me as a father and my resources as if they were their own. For they are less frequent with me than I would like.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>But what is it, my Bullinger, that you write to me about the Council of Trent? Will Coelius also be summoned there? But those are councils of cardinals and bishops, not of the likes of me. However, if I must go there, I will follow my Bullinger and will not hesitate to face all dangers with him. But if neither Bullinger nor Coelius!</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>But joking aside: I hear the Council of Trent is not proceeding, as the Bishop of Trent, the emperor's envoy to the pope, could not obtain it from the pope himself, nor from those gathered in Bologna under the guise of a council. For they use the lack of consent from all Christian princes as a pretext, claiming they will not change anything without it. However, as I have heard, the emperor has urged the German estates that, since a general council in Trent, as he desired, cannot be held, they should select a few to attempt to settle the religious disputes, and he will never fail to support their efforts for peace.</p>

      <p>You have what I have received. In return, my best brother, if you have anything, which I do not doubt, you will share it with us.</p>

      <p>Farewell through Jesus Christ, the only savior. Greet your entire household and those holy and most learned brothers. In Basel, the day before the calends of February 1548.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian, Heinrich Bullinger, most holy and vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, a friend and brother to be especially esteemed. In Zurich.</p>
