      <p>S. D. Doctor Conrad Gessner, an excellent man, is so diligent in greeting me on your behalf that he could not be more diligent; he very rarely sends me his letters without most dutifully adding your greetings to me, fulfilling the duty of a most faithful and dutiful man. I have now found the best way to return your greetings through your son, who has now returned to his homeland, and I wanted to commend myself to you. If only you could see how much your Dryander values his Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I frequently read your books; rarely is anything that has come from Bullinger set aside from my table, and the one that is inscribed by you, "On Justifying Grace through Christ," etc., captivates me so much that it cannot satisfy and fill my mind by being read just once, but must be read repeatedly. So continue, my Bullinger, to deserve well of many in Christ in such a way, etc.</p>
      <p>Your son Johannes (as is fitting) wanted to obey his father who called him back, whom I have always proposed to be observed and honored as a living example, which many other good people have also done, who have willingly testified with their own hand in the prepared book, namely by exhorting the son to look up to his father, to try to emulate him in every way; if he does this, both the time and whatever expenses have been incurred will not have been poorly spent... it will be necessary. How your son conducted himself here in Marburg, I do not wish to exaggerate as much as I would like; the matter speaks for itself, and honest people among us will testify that he conducted himself well here, lest I seem to fulfill the role of a flatterer more than that of a friend, I wish to be more modest in praising. I have uniquely commended my son to him and allowed him to follow him to Strasbourg, which I would not have done if I had not clearly seen the utmost integrity and purity of life in your son. There is a good nature combined with piety that I have always admired in your son; but as today the world is corrupt and youth is as slippery as it is, both your son and mine must be admonished to conduct themselves rightly in their duties, so that they may honor both themselves and their parents. But I, a pig teaching Minerva, say these things to you; may you deign to accept these my writings, however they may be, with an even mind, and have me commended to you again and again. Your Johannes will inform you about my adverse health.</p>
      <p>I willingly bear the cross offered to me by the Lord, ready to depart from this world whenever the Lord commands. Considering my years, as I am scarcely entering my 60th year, death is hardly hastened; I think my destined hour is near; but it is the Lord's calling and friendly correction, who corrects everyone whom he loves, etc. It is my duty to patiently bear the afflictions imposed by the Lord and to strengthen my spirit to endure hardships; for thus the scripture says: "Whether we live or die, we are the Lord's; may he be blessed forever and ever." You, along with Mr. Gwalter, farewell and commend your Dryander before God with your prayers. Given in Marburg, September 23, in the year 59.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Dryander signed. To the most splendid and learned doctor of sacred letters, preacher in Zurich, excellent man, patron, and lord, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>From Mr. Johannes Dryander 1559.</p>
