      <p>God be with us. Dearly beloved son, I thank you for the hare and will send you something in return, but I fear that today, when one eats snails in a company, it will not be of use to me; but if it is useful to me and I have a message, I will gladly send it to you. Herewith you have the account along with the little handbook, also the new Josie's account, which pleases me very much, and I bet that he would have already kept the other register. I urge you, when you copy them, to apply diligence, because with the cipher it quickly falls apart, so you should also add to it diligently. Veteran Spanish soldiers from Naples and Sicily and new Spanish soldiers from Spain have come in quite a large number under the leadership of Alba to Milan. They will not stay there long, hence I fear war. There are many other things that I do not dare to write now; therefore, make haste slowly and settle your affairs, etc. It is good to pray to God that He may graciously help us and all oppressed people. If only we all would repent!</p>
      <p>And since Dyes is not here around 12 and poor Ben... who otherwise cannot come here, I have sent him away in an overloaded manner, so that he can still make it there. The candle mold is still here. I have placed your back register here with Heinrich's and Josie's letters, also a plane iron in the handbook, etc.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet Lysenbethli, my dear Susanna, etc., the whole household.</p>
      <p>As for young Hans Peter, I do not have his account, I have an example.</p>
