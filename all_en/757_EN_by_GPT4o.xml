      <p>In the year 49, on the 10th of December.</p>
      <p>Most honorable Mr. Bullinger, I received your letters, which were most pleasing to me; I would have responded through my corrector sent to Mr. Froschauer, if I had received yours earlier. If any admonition were needed with Mr. Froschauer, I would wish for your assistance in printing the English Bible; my good English friends are urging me greatly and desire its completion. For the Emperor had pressed the English envoys heavily about composing a form of religion according to the mediating doctrine; but they, after deliberation, confirmed the one instituted by Mr. Bucer throughout the entire kingdom with public edicts.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bucer had been gravely ill, but now restored, he enjoys great authority and favor among the people of London. I have heard nothing about Florian the Pole.</p>
      <p>The maritime cities through the people of Hamburg, Lübeck, and Lüneburg are diligently working on reconciling the people of Bremen and Magdeburg; unless they negotiate religion, they will achieve nothing. If your lordship has any news about the newly elected pope, do not hesitate to inform me. Here, everyone seems to be eagerly awaiting him.</p>
      <p>The Emperor, having changed his plan, will spend Christmas Day in Brussels. He is preparing for a journey to Italy. We are expecting your letters to our archbishop and your booklet and Calvin's.</p>
      <p>Petrus Martyr has published a disputation on the sacrament of the Eucharist held at the University of Oxford in England, consisting of 43 folios; I would have sent it if I had had a messenger to Basel. I have given these letters to Mr. Froschauer, so that he may hasten the completion of the Bible as soon as possible. Greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johann Birckmann.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, lord and greatest friend. In Zürich.</p>
