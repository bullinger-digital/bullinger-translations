    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller wrote recently [No. 2462] in haste; so also this time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Due to the flight of wealthy citizens [from Augsburg], a popular uprising may occur. Haller fears that especially [Mayor Hans] Welser might accept any peace terms out of fear. The Confederates should encourage the people of Augsburg. [The latter] are indeed hesitant to open up to the [Confederates].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Behind the mediation attempts of Duke [Wilhelm] of Bavaria lies the intention to impose a bishop on the [people of Augsburg] again and to carry out a Reformation in Augsburg as papist in nature as in Nuremberg. Haller fears that some pastors might go along with it. However, he would rather die than give up the purity of the doctrine. Bullinger should encourage the [people of Augsburg] through frequent letters and urge the [people of Zurich] in his sermons to be helpful. It is hard to believe how people who seemed so zealous for the word of God are now so fearful! Haller will admonish [steadfastness] to the best of his ability.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The fearless [Sebastian] Schertlin will make [Hans Wilpert] Zoller the standard-bearer and wants to recruit 2000 Swiss [mercenaries], as he expects more from them than from 10000 pikemen. The Swiss indeed enjoy a high reputation. Since their neighbors are affected, it also concerns them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Haller must now preach. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Salvation and life through Christ Jesus, our Savior, etc. I wrote recently in haste and turmoil, which I am doing again now. Therefore, consider it kindly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Our city is in great agitation. The wealthier citizens are fleeing with great impatience from the common people, so much so that we fear a riot. We are calming things down as much as we can. The council is also faint-hearted. Especially Welser, I believe, would accept any terms of peace rather than war. I fear, therefore, that their fearfulness will bring about great evil. I would gladly wish that the Swiss would at least add some courage to them. They are ashamed to open up to them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Duke of Bavaria is interceding as much as he can. But as far as I can judge, there is one underlying issue, which I especially fear, that they will impose a bishop on our city again and carry out a Reformation in Augsburg as papist in nature as in Nuremberg, as similar as an eel is to a serpent. And I fear that some of the ministers might uniquely desire this, so that peace may be achieved in this way. May the Lord preserve the purity of His doctrine! For I would rather die gloriously for the pure gospel than live disgracefully in disguise. I therefore ask that through frequent letters you encourage both our spirits and yours with your sermons, so that they may provide some assistance, by which our people may regain their courage. For I thought it impossible that those who pretended so much zeal for the word of God could be so dismayed by human threats. I give thanks to the Lord that He has given me a strong spirit and an unshaken mind. I want to work as much as I can, by admonishing, exhorting, strengthening, consoling, praying, and even providing something with my hands, if necessary.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Schertlin is exceedingly brave and courageous. He will make Zoller the standard-bearer. He wishes to have at least 2000 Swiss, from whom he promises himself more results than from 10000 pikemen. In summary: the name of the Swiss is so noble among us that it is almost worshipped. I would therefore wish that they consider that their own interests are at stake when the neighbor's wall is on fire. Because the cause is just, the Lord will not forsake it.</p>

      <p>Farewell. I could not write more, because I am now going to preach. Greet all the brothers. Augsburg, June 20, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful teacher of the church in Zurich, his uniquely esteemed lord and father. M. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
