      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have already responded with three letters to those slanders, with which the false brothers have tormented me too harshly. Now I am also sending to our Lelio the faith that the pious brothers have shown in this matter, it is written in Italian, he will interpret it for you, and another to Celio Secundus, residing in Basel, as you know, whom I have earnestly asked to make it available to you. He also knows very well that another wife was dismissed by me for adultery, often asking me, while he was with us, to do so. I would have gathered the proof and testimony of other brothers, had I not been forced to flee from Venice due to the wickedness of someone who sought my death, so that I might be handed over to the papists to be burned; he is well known to our Lelio. You now have, most esteemed brother, all the lies of the impious refuted; if they will be sufficient, as I hope, to calm your minds, praise be to God; if not, we will prepare other more convincing proofs. And at the same time consider how I can find no rest, wherever I am, for the sake of the Gospel; but you, please, strengthen my mind, since we are members of one another. You will also immediately inform me whether you have received all my letters, especially those long ones I wrote on these matters along with those written to you by a certain nobleman from Brescia, with whom I often lived together with my wife. Farewell in the Lord and love me. Given in the fields of Brescia on February 6, 1550.</p>
      <p>Always devoted to you, etc. B[aldassare] A[ltieri]. To the most steadfast and learned minister of Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, always to be honored as a lord and brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
