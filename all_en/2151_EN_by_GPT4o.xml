      <p>Greetings and blessings. I received your letters, most esteemed lord and brother, and since there is nothing in them that requires a response, I will not trouble you with any reply. The reports from friends here and there are so varied that I do not know what the future holds.</p>
      <p>It is asserted with certainty that through the machinations of the Emperor, Mary has been betrothed to Philip, and thus all of England has been brought under the power of the Spaniards. If this is true, I do not think these things happen without God; for it is necessary that they be horribly punished by a cruel and intolerable nation, who have denied and rejected Christ with such obstinacy. O Lord, grant your servants to confess you steadfastly and to worship you devoutly. Lord, have mercy on us. Some say that mutual plans are being devised by the Emperor's and the papists' parties to continue and restore the Council of Trent, and therefore negotiations are being conducted with the French for peace, mainly for this purpose, that they may agree to the council. For when it has been concluded with the unanimous consent of the monarchs, Germany and Switzerland will be asked to subscribe, or war and proscription will be threatened; thus it is believed that it can be accomplished by mutual arms.</p>
      <p>This is the art of that beast. However, having crushed or subdued the Germans and the Swiss, he hopes to gain control of the French without any trouble. Plus Oultre.</p>
      <p>Perhaps these things are hidden from the eyes of the French, and punishment should be taken on him and us. Yet let us pray to the merciful Lord and urge everyone to repentance, if perhaps God may grant peace in our days. But let the will of the Lord be done. Farewell with all yours. ZÃ¼rich, January 9, 1554. Remember my relative.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Ambrosius Blarer, faithful minister of the church in Biel/Bienne, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Biel/Bienne.</p>
