    <p xml:id="regest1">The news about the 12,000 slain [soldiers of Landgrave Philip of Hesse] turned out to be a rumor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Blarer could not send anything with the bearer [...] of Bullinger's letter [not received], as he did not have a letter ready at that time. Only recently did he entrust [...] Herrliberger with a letter [No. 2514] for Bullinger and also sent back the letter of the Landgrave [and Elector Johann Frederick of Saxony to the Confederates] with the same. However, the council of Konstanz has reported everything to the council of Zurich, and Bullinger will have been informed about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- If possible, Blarer will continue to write. However, there is so much to do that on several days [Thomas Blarer] and [Konrad Zwick] cannot even visit Blarer, who is still bedridden [due to a hernia].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Swedish King [Gustav I Vasa] is on the side [of the Schmalkaldic League]. The Danes were able to stop 1,500 cavalrymen, who were intended for Emperor [Charles V], and made them swear not to march against [the Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Blarer sends along the letters of [Georg] Frölich [No. 2510] and [Johannes] Haller [No. 2511].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Hopefully, [the meeting of the Protestant city cantons in Zurich] can contribute to improving the situation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Some (but not Blarer, who trusts in God) fear that the refusal of the Swiss [mercenaries already in the service of the Schmalkaldic League] to return to Switzerland could have dire consequences.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Bullinger's suggestion on how Blarer could send his letters to him through the city clerk of Konstanz [Jörg Vögeli] without arousing his suspicion is not feasible. For if [Thomas Blarer] or Zwick (who, by the way, are not always available) were to address Blarer's letters, Vögeli might suspect that the two are conspiring with [Hans Rudolf] Lavater behind the back of the [Konstanz] council or the secret council. However, Blarer can use the transmission of letters from Augsburg intended for Bullinger as a pretext for his letters to Bullinger. It would also be good if the Zurich messengers would always stop by Blarer on their own initiative.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Bullinger should pray for divine protection and victory.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- In Wollmatingen and other villages of the [Konstanz] bishop [Johann von Weeze], as many mercenaries as possible are being recruited.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- The eagerly awaited Landgrave is expected to arrive in southern Germany soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- [Johann Freiherr] von Heideck has been appointed commander-in-chief of the [Württemberg] troops.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- [Enclosure:] Excerpt from a letter from a secretary [...] in Brunswick to a friend [...] in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- The Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave have ordered the demolition of the castles Wolfenbüttel, Steinbrück, and Schöningen, which was carried out on July 11. Subsequently, Bernhard von Mellingen, captain of Wolfenbüttel, and his soldiers were accommodated in the property of the canons of Brunswick.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- There is a strong armament. Brunswick alone can provide 16,000 citizens. In [Brunswick], 1,800 cavalrymen with their captains, Johann von der Asseburg and Christoph von Obergen, were present. They intended to ride to Emperor [Charles V]. However, the Landgrave managed to cunningly persuade them to join the [Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- In the dioceses of Bremen and Minden, they are on guard. The borders have been occupied with troops, and spies have been sent to the Netherlands. Thus, they would be well-prepared against an invasion [of the imperial troops].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Duke Albrecht [VII] of Mecklenburg and Duke [Franz I of Saxony]-Lauenburg have mustered about 800 cavalrymen for the Emperor. However, due to the [military] blockades, they will probably not be able to advance further.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- The King of Denmark [Christian III] is in armor. In Holstein and Denmark, he has called up every third man [for the Schmalkaldic League] and is accepting all mercenaries and sailors. He has blocked the Baltic Sea and the Sound and stopped 400 Dutch ships coming from Danzig and Livonia, mainly loaded with grain. This is causing great inflation in the Netherlands. However, this blockade offers advantages to the Hanseatic cities. Hamburg, Lübeck, Rostock, Wismar, and Stralsund are accepting all sailors and ferrymen. Furthermore, those cities, as well as Magdeburg, are arming themselves.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">- [2nd letter from August 1:] 16 [Schmalkaldic] companies were sent to the Klause [Ehrenberg] to defend it. Previously, the abbot of Kempten [Wolfgang von Grünenstein] provided the mercenaries of these companies with breakfast. Why, is a mystery to Blarer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">- The Bishop of Bamberg [Weigand von Redwitz] has ordered his subjects to surrender if the Landgrave should attack.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">- The Bishop of Würzburg [Melchior Zobel] sent his chancellor [Georg Farner] to the [Landgrave] to inquire about his intentions. [The Landgrave] showed [the chancellor] his armaments and told him to inform the [Bishop] that he intended to attack him. The Bishop is therefore preparing for a counteroffensive.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">- The [Schmalkaldic army] is now stationed at Donauwörth. The Spanish [troops] coming from Hungary and Austria are camped at Rain am Lech.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest23">- In Bologna, about 18,000 soldiers have been mustered. They are equipped with helmets, half-hooks, a lot of ammunition, and assault ladders.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest24">- The Landgrave and some strong cavalrymen will arrive in southern Germany in three to four days. The rest of the army will follow.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest25">- [P.S.:] Blarer wrote the [1st letter with the enclosure] a few days ago but has not found a messenger for it. He also does not know when he will find one, as he is still bedridden [due to his hernia].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest26">- [3rd letter:] In the [confiscated letter package near Ulm], letters to the Welser and Fugger were also found, which in turn contained letters to the Emperor. From these, it was learned that the two merchants had lent the Emperor seven tons of gold. The [Schmalkaldic League] has now demanded under threat of punishment that they lend them the same amount of gold. Bullinger should keep this secret. One day it will come to light anyway.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest27">- [P.S.:] Blarer still does not know when he will find a messenger. Perhaps he will send the letters with the butchers or carters.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother, the news about the 12,000 slain is a fabrication, spread by those who would like to see such things. Praise be to God! He wants to suppress the lie with the truth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>So I could not write anything to you with the one who delivered your letter to me (as I had nothing to write) and only recently wrote to you through Herrliberger, to whom I also sent back the Landgrave's letter. However, my lords have written everything to yours, so you are well informed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>When I can, I will not spare myself from writing. There is so much to do that sometimes a whole day passes without my brother or cousin coming to see me. Furthermore, I am still bedridden, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You know how the King of Sweden is also with us. Likewise, Denmark has turned 1,500 horses away from the Emperor and made them swear not to march against us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I hereby send you letters from Augsburg from Leto and Haller. You will learn how things stand around Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We hope that something good will be accomplished with you now and that things will improve somewhat.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The fact that your Confederates do not want to return home causes concern for some, as it might cause much and great trouble. However, I hope the matter will not turn out entirely bad, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Your suggestion on how I might write to you without arousing the suspicion of our city clerk, namely that my dear brother or cousin make the address, etc., is not feasible, as I do not always have them at hand. Also, the mentioned person might not like to have it, and think they have something outside of a council or the secret with Lavater; which would not be good. I will see how I can do it so that I do not withhold anything from you that I know, as before. For I can sometimes have letters that come to you from Augsburg, sometimes otherwise, when your messenger, who is on the post, always comes to me when he brings letters from yours to my lords.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Pray to the Lord continuously that He may keep us and grant victory to the praise of His name. Amen.</p>

      <p>On the 22nd of July in Brunswick. Excerpt from a letter from a secretary in Brunswick to a good friend in Augsburg: Saxony and Hesse have caused the demolition of the three castles Wolfenbüttel, Steinbrück, and Schöningen to the ground, which also happened on July 11. Thus, Lord Bernhard von Mellingen, captain of Wolfenbüttel, withdrew with his servants into the city and was accommodated by our lords in a council in the canons' court. They must provide for them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>There is great armament here, beyond all measure (Brunswick alone can provide 16,000 citizens). There were also 1,800 foreign cavalrymen here under two noblemen, who were their captains, namely Lord Johann von der Asseburg and Christoph von Obereck. They intended to join the Emperor. The Landgrave persuaded them to lead the captains to the Schmalkaldic League.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>In the diocese of Bremen and Minden, they are very vigilant, and the passes have been heavily occupied, with enough spies placed on the Netherlands, so we hope that if they come, they will find enough people before them. For in these lands, everyone is so alert that you need not worry about foreign troops.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Duke Albrecht of Mecklenburg and the Duke of Lauenburg have about 800 horses. They belong to the Emperor. None of them shall (God willing) come out. For in these lands, all passes are blocked, and you will (God willing) hear wonders from us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>The King of Denmark is in excellent armor. He has called up every third man in Holstein and Denmark to help us. He also takes all the servants and sailors he can get and has then closed the sea, as well as the Sound, so that no one can go back or forth. And there are about 400 small and large ships from him, which belong to the Netherlands and Holland, held up, most of which are loaded with grain, also some with oats and merchant goods, at Danzig and Livonia. The king keeps them all to himself, which will cause great inflation in the Netherlands and Holland. However, this is of excellent and great benefit to the cities here. So the Hamburgers, Lübeckers, Rostockers, Wismarians, Sundt, these cities, take all sailors and ferrymen who are suitable for seafaring, also all other servants they can find. Likewise, Magdeburg and Hanseatic cities are arming themselves excellently.</p>

    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>Furthermore, you should know that ours have sent 16 companies to the Klause to rescue it. These servants had breakfast with the abbot of Kempten. I do not know how to understand this and what they have dealt with him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21">
      <p>The Bishop of Bamberg has ordered his people to surrender when the Landgrave comes, as he cannot protect them, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>The one in Würzburg had his chancellor with him and asked what he should rely on. He showed him his armament in his camp and told him to inform his lord that he intended to visit him. The bishop is now preparing to set up a counter-defense.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div23" corresp="regest23">
      <p>Our camp is now at Donauwörth. And the Spaniards, who were stationed in Hungary and Austria, are moving up. They are lying at Rain. Our people will see how to meet them, etc.</p>
      <p>In Bologna, a large infantry has recently been mustered, up to 18,000, mostly well-equipped with helmets and half-hooks, also with much ammunition, but especially with many ladders for assault.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div24" corresp="regest24">
      <p>The Landgrave will be here in three or four days with some cavalrymen, but not with the whole crowd. He has something to accomplish beforehand.</p>
      <p>Given on August 1st.</p>

    <div xml:id="div25" corresp="regest25">
      <p>I had the other letter ready a few days ago and could not have a messenger. I do not know when I will have one for this either. I am still bedridden. Otherwise, I would like to do it right.</p>

    <div xml:id="div26" corresp="regest26">
      <p>In the intercepted posts, among other things, a letter was found. They were addressed to the Welser and Fugger, but inside were others addressed to the Emperor. From this, it was precisely learned that the mentioned ones had lent the Emperor seven tons of gold. This was very displeasing. And they were told to think and lend this state seven as well, or if not, they must do evil. Through our friendship, I implore you not to tell any mortal anything about this at this time - and not without good reasons. However, there will be a time when both this and other things of this kind will be brought to light.</p>
      <p>Given on August 1st.</p>
