      <p>Johannes Blasius to his esteemed Heinrich Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>You rightly doubted the trustworthiness of the notaries, most revered man in the Lord; for the letters which you sent us on June 8th, newly consigned to us by the most honorable Zürich council through the schoolmaster, we finally received on June 20th. This negligence, or rather treachery, has affected us very badly for many reasons, since indeed it was not possible for us to respond to either your earlier or later letters, as you requested.</p>
      <p>Therefore, most learned Bullinger, it should be your task to attribute all this delay not to us, but (as you have excellently reasoned) to our sluggish and stupid negotiators. There is no reason for you to doubt our faith in you. We are not so dull and ungrateful as not to duly observe and venerate your inclination towards us, as well as your benefits, care, and tireless diligence in writing (despite being otherwise very busy), for which we give you immense thanks on behalf of all of us, promising you all our little effort. Furthermore, we have heard with great joy from you that the contention about the administration and virtue of the sacraments, which recently arose among the exceptionally learned and pious ministers of our church in Chur, has been settled. May the Lord ensure that what has been well settled remains firm, etc.</p>
      <p>Finally, accept the matter of the schoolmaster briefly as follows. After we understood that Cellarius would certainly not return, we appointed the son of a certain citizen, a very good man, to this position, which could not remain vacant for long (due to our frequent school), although a rather small salary was assigned to him, namely 46 Rhenish guilders without lodging.</p>
      <p>For the steward with 32 students, Pontisella with his family, and likewise a third person, who is called our provider, with his family, have occupied the monastery, which is otherwise quite spacious. The reader has been assigned only one room; therefore, this condition is not suitable for a married man, but rather for a young and solitary one. I would have certainly and quickly sent you this opinion on the present matter, if your letters had been delivered to us in time; we also beg you to receive it from us with an even mind, and we beseech you not to interpret the delay unfavorably, etc.</p>
      <p>We also received with great joy the letters concerning the Interim (a temporary religious settlement), which you sent, as well as the latest ones sent through Lord Werli, our consul, in which you informed us about the state of the trembling cities. By the immortal God, to what extent has that sweet liberty of illustrious Germany reached! But it is the day of the Lord (in my judgment), which is revealed in fire, as the apostle testifies, and the fire will test what kind of work each one has done, etc. May the Lord grant to all the faithful and especially to the co-workers of God the spirit of fortitude, so that they may be encouraged to persevere in the profession of the gospel until the end. Amen.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 26, 1548. Comander, consul Heimius, Tscharner, and all other good men greet you very much and wish you longevity.</p>
      <p>The same yours, however little he may be, Blasius, up to the altar.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and pious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the great church of Zürich, his most esteemed brother and lord.</p>
