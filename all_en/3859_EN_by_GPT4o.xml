      <p>Greetings. Since I cannot write to you at length now, venerable lord, due to certain pressing matters, please accept a brief account of what is happening here. I cannot predict what the nature of the assembly will be; the envoys of the electors and the remnants of certain imperial orders have arrived, but none of the princes have come, nor do they think any will come. What this means, let others judge; certainly, the electors and some others have not agreed with the emperor. Recently, the emperor has imposed immense taxes, so that nearly a tenth of certain goods must be paid, and this even in some free imperial territories. A new census for aid against the Turks is also being conducted, as I hear, although he has turned all the military force he had destined for Hungary against his younger son; for he, aided by the Shah of Persia, is moving against his father. How the purer religion might be exterminated is being diligently discussed.</p>
      <p>For there are some obstacles preventing these clandestine machinations from breaking out into open violence. I fear that the Landsberg Alliance may bring some harm.</p>
      <p>Some evangelical princes are also coming together. They say the King of Denmark has recently died, which is why I think his son-in-law Augustus will not come.</p>
      <p>I was very pleased to receive what you wrote about the Polish assembly and the hope of spreading the gospel there; they say they are also deliberating on appointing a successor to the throne, should the king die without a male heir. The candidates are the Archbishop of Magdeburg, Charles, the emperor's son, and the son of the Voivode of Hungary. Some of the kingdom's leaders think someone should be designated, and I judge this to be most advisable for them as well as for the English, if they do the same.</p>
      <p>I suppose you have already heard that the Queen of England was crowned on January 15th. Here, the most sumptuous funeral rites are being prepared for Charles V by his brother Ferdinand, to be conducted on February 19th; certain altars and many images of saints, which are an impediment to the preparations that occupy nearly the entire church, and indeed the largest one, are being removed, which greatly displeases the mass-goers. These are the things I thought should be written about.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg on February 8th, 1559.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Georg von Stetten. I ask that you send the enclosed letters to Basel by messenger.</p>
      <p>To Emanuel Betuleius; his whereabouts can be easily inquired at the college. To the venerable and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and friend. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
