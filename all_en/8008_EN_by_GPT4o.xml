      <p> S. You will learn what Beza writes from these. He sent them to me open; I read them and sealed them. What he writes about Aurelia is harsh. I have nothing to add, except that it is written from the court of the Duke of Savoy that the admiral has left Poitiers. I think these are false; for I do not know where the king would get such forces, about which they write at the same time. It is certain that the adversaries are very restless. It goes day and night through my lord's land crosswise without pause. </p>
      <p> The Lord, who sits in the heavens, will laugh at them. I know nothing certain about the departure of the Confederates; some say this, others say differently. However, it is generally said that all will set out except for those from Lucerne; but where or from whom the soldiers? It is also said, but with uncertain rumor, that cavalry is being gathered in Bavaria, who will set out with the Swiss to the king; it would be strange if the other princes of Germany allowed this. I expect to learn more certain things from you. My father-in-law sends you many greetings, who cannot praise enough how much pleasure he derived from a one-hour conversation with you. If only I could have been the third to be present with you! He excuses himself for leaving so early. The other brothers, both consuls, also greet you. We have a strange business with Wingartner, about which you may have heard from others; therefore, I will not bother you with it. Bern, 18th September 1569. </p>
      <p> Yours, whom you know by hand. </p>
