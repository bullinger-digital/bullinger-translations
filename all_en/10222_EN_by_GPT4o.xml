Luther's letter to the people of Frankfurt pains him, as he feels that they want the same thing but cannot find the right words. An admonition to hold firm to faith in Christ. News from Bremen and about the council negotiations between the Emperor and the Pope.</p>

      <p>Greetings, most excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>As you write, our hope has always been that our common enemies can be decisively confronted with a single masculine response, for it is certain that, however much they are incited by outsiders, unless they see you broken or betrayed, they will not dare too much. What you attribute not only to them, they certainly acknowledge you have a cause. But the evils that threaten both equally should have been worn down by those who have no spirit for these things, and to entrust the highest matters to those who do. But the Lord wills to be present with His own in such a way that this glory is shared with no one else.</p>
      <p>Luther, alas, has again been stirred by some flatterer to write harshly against the people of Frankfurt. And that which he himself feels and has written to be appropriate to the body of the Lord only because of the sacramental union, namely to be received into the hands, mouth, and stomach, he contends should be absolutely attributed to it. May the Lord be present with His church. I see and feel that what the pious think about this matter is the same, and, oh temptation, words cannot be devised by which we might express this in agreement. How small, how truly it becomes us! We disturb the salvation of so many thousands of souls more than can be said by this dissension. As I have always done, I urge and beseech you and whomever I can, not to think about what we suffer unworthily and what others do, but what is worthy of Christ, what our profession requires. We all confess that Christ is our one Savior, the sum of religion. Let us measure everything by this friendship, brotherhood, severity, and leniency. We want the truth to be defended, but that by which the soul stands, and in such a way that life stands. I see that...iss. also vexed, no one is not his own.... The day of the Lord will reveal, about which...we will speak. But enough has been indulged to grief, for which I seek a remedy in vain so many times. The Lord will finally put an end to this, when He will also grant rest from the remaining labors.</p>
      <p>Farewell, all excellent brothers. A sudden and unexpected messenger has now returned to us at an inopportune time, it is not permitted to inform Capito, I wrote this suddenly, more at another time. Farewell again. Greet each other.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, February 14.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bucer.</p>
      <p>When something adverse happens to those acting as you now strive, do not doubt, here and elsewhere there will be those who will take account of you. It is reported to us that the same thing happened in Bremen as happened with you the previous year: that citizens armed themselves in the city - which is large and powerful - and those who want to be from the gospel succumbed. Matters in Frankfurt are quite disturbed. May the Lord grant peace in Himself. Truly Satan does not sleep. Would that we might be vigilant. About the poison prepared for the Emperor, nothing here, but that he is to return to Spain, all testify with one voice. The French and English seek a council; who previously suffered hatred of the Emperor, now seek to recall the Pope from the Emperor with this pretext. But in the meantime, they unite their illegitimate offspring in marriage.</p>
      <p>With a large retinue, the illegitimate daughter of Charles is now seeking Italy to marry Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence, who hopes by this pact to become the Duke of Milan for the Pope.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and pious man Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, a brother to be respected.</p>
