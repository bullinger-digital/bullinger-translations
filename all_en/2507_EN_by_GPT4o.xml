      <p>Our Laelius will tell you, dearest brother, why I have not come now and when and for what reason I will come to you. By the grace of God, I am well, but I am overwhelmed with labors, yet the Lord sustains me. The brothers who are in Venice urge me not to miss this opportunity to address that envoy, about whom Laelius will tell; for they know that there has been a great connection between us since childhood. Therefore, for the sake of those brothers, and since the envoy invited me, I am going down to Tübingen today for a meeting, and I will go to Chepingam, where I will wait for him. The cold is pressing, the roads are bad, and I am burdened with very high expenses; but it is the business of Christ, whom I serve, and it must not be neglected. The prince read in my hearing what I wrote about you in my printed response to the Catalogue of Heretics, in which you were neglected; for I composed three from the neglected, the duke, you, and Fallesius. I am now making that booklet in Latin at the duke's urging.</p>
      <p>Finally, Volmar expelled Theodor, indeed unjustly, I know well; in fact, all the boarders deserted the man. I took in the young man for the sake of his father and my Zurichers, to whom I wish to render greater services. Now about to depart, because my kitchen rests in my absence, I have arranged for him a good citizen with whom he may stay; when I return, if he wishes to be with me, I will not refuse. He asked me to commend him to you and to his father, which I do. I testify by right that he is making progress; at least he has been awakened from a kind of sleep, which seemed to oppress him last year, and I have good hope for him. I bid farewell to the three sons-in-law, my dearest sons, and also to the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Pray for me. God be with you. Tübingen, December 20, 1554. Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
