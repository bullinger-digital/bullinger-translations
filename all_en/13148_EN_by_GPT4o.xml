    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer thanks Bullinger for his [New Year's] wishes. May Christ also richly bless Bullinger and his family both temporally and spiritually!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger is further thanked sincerely for sending the messenger who arrived the day before during Blarer's morning sermon [...]. Since Blarer also had to deliver the midday sermon and had various other tasks to complete immediately afterward, he was forced to hold the messenger back until this morning.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The [letter entrusted by Bullinger to the messenger for delivery] was forwarded to Blarer's cousin Konrad Zwick, whose [response] to Jean Merveilleux is already enclosed with this letter. Bullinger should ensure its forwarding at the first opportunity. In return, Zwick offers his services to Bullinger and wishes him and his family countless good years and eternal life!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blarer recently sent two letters for review with a letter [No. 3092] (in the rush, he no longer remembers to whom he entrusted them for delivery). Bullinger should return them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The people of Konstanz still have nothing new to report regarding [their petition for reconciliation with Emperor Charles V]. May God have mercy on them! He is their only hope, especially since no comfort or encouragement arrives from anywhere else. However, he should arrange everything according to his will. May he grant the people of Konstanz the strength to turn to him and commend themselves to him, but without letting themselves go, especially since the FLESH is weak. Oh, how terrifying it is to have to swim in the vast sea without a ship or land in sight! Moreover, the fickle people are capricious and unreliable. Yet the heavenly Father will surely not abandon his own!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] It is pitiful that neither Zurich nor Bern nor Basel respond to the letter from the Konstanz secret councilors, and consequently, the people of Konstanz cannot even count on 300 men from their jurisdictions in Thurgau or elsewhere! The wise Bullinger will surely understand what this means and what consequences it has!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] May God grant success and fortune to the Swiss delegation sent to Lyon and to King Henry II of France, so that his kingdom may be expanded through it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] It is said that several letters from Strasbourg have reached the assembly in Baden [on December 19]. If Bullinger is not bound by confidentiality regarding this, he should report what he knows about it. Something must have happened.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Enclosed is the "Instruction" that the Emperor sent to Landgrave Philip of Hesse through Johann von Lier. What a pity! It is clear what the whole thing aims at! Bullinger may have the document copied, but he should not disclose his source. He should return it with the two other [aforementioned] letters at the next opportunity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Blarer would like to know from Bullinger whether the Zurich councilors would comply with a petition addressed to them concerning the Thurgau couple [Hans Rutishauser and Dorothea Diethelm], especially since the young woman is pregnant. Would the other [Swiss Confederates administering Thurgau together with Zurich] allow the couple to remain in their region? Blarer inquired about this in the last letter [No. 3092].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] In Konstanz, one hears the same about the Hanseatic cities as in Zurich. But nothing is certain. Magdeburg is said to have attacked the Counts of Stolberg, and they are said to have been commissioned to enforce the [imperial] ban imposed on the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] It is said to be true that Duke Maurice of Saxony has left Augsburg. In Konstanz, there is also the rumor about Strasbourg [that the Emperor wants to move the Imperial Diet there]. From Augsburg, nothing certain is heard about the council, although Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo, Bishop of Trent, should have returned there [from Rome]. As soon as Blarer learns something new, he will report it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Greetings to Bullinger's family and his colleagues. The people of Zurich should pray for the people of Konstanz! Blarer's family and especially his wife Katharina [née Ryff] send their regards. She also thanks for the booklet sent to her by Bullinger. In Konstanz, Blarer cannot find anything equivalent with which he could reciprocate. He is increasingly in Bullinger's debt!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Enclosed is another letter intended for [Konrad] Gessner, which a servant [...] of Sebastian Schertlin delivered the evening before with a request for forwarding. Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz is still seriously ill in Stein am Rhein. He expects to be reconciled with King Ferdinand any day. Ferdinand's daughter [Anna of Austria] has presented Schankwitz's petition to her father, and he is said to have expressed his willingness to be gracious.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Bullinger should inform about the current price in Zurich for Johannes Stumpf's "Swiss Chronicle." In Konstanz, the work is not available for less than 4½ florins.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Blarer has already paid the messenger's fee. Very early in the morning at the opening of the city gates.</p>

      <p>I express my deepest thanks for your good wishes. I sincerely desire from God through Christ Jesus that He may repay you and all your loved ones a hundredfold, richly and graciously, with an increase of all good things in body and soul. Amen, amen, amen, may it become true!</p>

      <p>I thank you very sincerely for sending the messenger with good, faithful intentions. He arrived yesterday during the morning sermon. I also had to preach at midday and then had unavoidable business, and thus had to keep him until this morning.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have sent the letter to my cousin Konrad Zwick. He writes here again to Merveilleux with a request to send the letter at the first opportunity. He sends you many services, good wishes, and greetings, wishing you and all your dear relatives a hundred thousand good years and eternal life.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I recently wrote to you in haste and enclosed two letters that came to me in my writing. I now cannot recall to whom I entrusted them. I hope they have reached you by now. I only ask you to send the letters back to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Our situation remains unchanged. May God have mercy on us and make everything good! We need it, as no comfort or encouragement comes from anywhere, nor on such a path that might be without the emperor's displeasure. But He alone is strong enough if He wills. If He does not will, nothing can help. He truly grants improvement, and that we turn to Him from the heart and trust in Him! But we must not let go of the reins. The flesh is weak. Swimming in the vast sea without oars and ship and seeing no land is terrifying and frightening to the flesh. Moreover, the fickle people are wonderfully adventurous. Yet the loving true Father in heaven will not abandon His own.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>It is, humanly speaking, pitiful that my lords' secret councilors' letters to yours, as well as to Bern and Basel, receive no response, and in case of need, not even 300 men can be obtained from my lords' jurisdictions or elsewhere, etc. You should well consider what this implies and what consequences it must eventually have! You are wise. You know how to calculate well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>May God grant much success and fortune to your appointed delegation to Lyon and France, and let everything serve much good, so that His kingdom may be increased and expanded!</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>We hear and learn that some letters from Strasbourg have come to the assembly in Baden. They have been copied there. If you know what it is and are allowed to disclose it, we would like to hear. Perhaps they are new tidings.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Herewith I send you the emperor's instruction given to the Landgrave by Lier. There you see again great sorrow, and where everything wants to lead. Do not say that this writing comes from me. You may have it copied, but send me this copy along with the other two letters back with the next messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Regarding the marriage matter, I would like to know if your lords are aware of it, whether they would take up the matter on behalf of the couple and dispense with the marriage, since the good daughter is pregnant, and whether they might remain in Thurgau for the sake of other confederates. I also wrote to you about this in the last letter, if it has reached you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>We also hear about the Hanseatic cities as you write, but nothing certain. Those from Magdeburg are said to have attacked the Counts of Stolberg, who then had orders to execute the ban against them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>It is certain that Duke Maurice has left Augsburg. From Strasbourg, there is also some talk with us, but nothing substantial. Likewise, we have nothing definite from the council in Augsburg. However, it is thought that the Cardinal of Trent has now arrived. Whatever new I learn, I will let you know at any time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Greet all your household and dear relatives with all brothers. We sincerely desire your faithful intercession. All mine send you all love and good wishes for many good years! Especially my dear wife thanks you kindly for the booklet. We have nothing like it here that I could reciprocate. I am deeply in your debt. May God grant that I can settle it one day.</p>

    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Herewith a letter to Gessner. A servant of Schertlin delivered it to me last night with a request to forward it. Marcell Dietrich is still very ill in Stein. He awaits his reconciliation with the king every day. The king's daughter herself has presented his supplication. He has said he will give her a gracious answer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Please inform me how one might purchase the new chronicle in Zurich. Here we cannot obtain it for less than 4½ florins.</p>

      <p>I have paid the messenger for his service. God be with you eternally! Dated December 26, as the gates opened, 1547.</p>
