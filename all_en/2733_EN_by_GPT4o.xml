      <p>As with my previous letters, so with these, I write nothing that is very worthy of your eyes and mind, but lest you think me less devoted to your kindness, I would rather err through inexperience than negligence, especially since my wife added a spur to my already willing self, namely the niece of Philipp Melanchthon's sister, who asked me to procure for her through you a garment worth one thaler, die man mit den elen angmi√üet, die auch kein leisten haben und hubsch rein sein (to use her words and description). God willing, I will pay Froschauer in Frankfurt; in performing this service for me, although I should not have troubled such a great man as you, yet through your utmost kindness I am most convinced that this is permissible for me, as I am in turn ready to gratify you even in more serious matters, nor could I honestly deny my wife the honest request for garments, with which she might veil and adorn her modesty, chastity, and modesty, especially because of her services, which she pursues with me, both most honorable and most pleasant as well as useful. Furthermore, so that you may also have some knowledge of the state of my affairs, know that I have indeed somewhat renounced the sharing of my table with students for the past two years because of the great ingratitude and rudeness of some, then known to me, but now again, at the request of two doctors of law, one of whom spent some time with you this summer, having returned from Rome, I again support them as table companions with other, namely older and wealthier, scholarly men, each of whom pays 30 florins for the bare table and separately pays their own prices for accommodations and bedding, yet I would hardly admit them to my table unless drawn by the love and sweetness of learned discussions, the subject and occasion of which I gladly tend to raise for the sake of learning, especially since I have ascertained and known that one of the doctors has such felicity of memory, judgment, and eloquence that I prefer to hear his extemporaneous responses, solutions, and decisions rather than those of Oldendorp or even Ferrari, senior professors of law. I omit that in the knowledge of sacred history and literature he is scarcely second to any jurist and, not content with the knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages, now also lays the foundation of the holy language through me. His name is Aegidius Mommer; but because of his excellent talent, Philipp was accustomed to call him Palladius. Farewell. Hastily, in Marburg, September 23, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and equally best man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the word of God, his esteemed lord.</p>
