      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. I received your writings along with the booklets on the 4th of March through a man named Quade and an old man, most excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I truly give immortal thanks for so many benefits, with which you overwhelm the undeserving. May the rich and abundant God of mercies repay you most abundantly, etc. The Gospel of Christ lies in contempt among the people of Ribeauvillé (Rapoltstein); it is proclaimed, etc.</p>
      <p>Our prince, now old, was finally scarcely persuaded to leave behind fornication and possess his own vessel in sanctification. This matter is being dealt with, although he is ill among the people of Montbéliard (Montbelgard), etc., about which I wrote to Vogler. We all earnestly pray to the Lord that He may preserve for us the one who (although he has sinned most foully with greed and lust, as he now freely admits) has been steadfast thus far in promoting the sincere business of piety without any superstition, for a very long time. And you pray to the most gracious God, lest, if he is taken away, wolves devastate our little churches. About my health, Vogler. The ministers of Strasbourg (Argentoratum) have not yet come to an agreement with the papists, who do not cease to blaspheme Christ. We are informed about the people of Locarno (Locarnensibus); may the gracious God be the patron of their cause. Few attend the assemblies; they argue about the shadow of a donkey. Enormous things are reported about the Turkish expeditions; it is said again, as many suppose, that Germany will be fined, and sooner. May the Lord have mercy on His church and keep His own perpetually unblemished in the boiling pot of this world, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell with these words, most excellent Bullinger; greet all the household and all the fellow ministers, whose names would be too long to list, etc. In Riquewihr (Richenvilla) on the 8th of March, 1553.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, especially in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the church of Zürich (Tigurina), a brother to be respected.</p>
