      <p>S. D. P. Andreas Schadcoviensis, notary of the Wieliczka salt mines, a truly pious and noble man, has instructed me to send you his most diligent greetings in his name and to express his utmost gratitude for the letters written to him and also for your small gift. He commends himself to you as much as possible. I promised a larger gift in your name, which he assured would be most welcome, and in return, he offers his services to you and all of yours. He is very busy with his duties, otherwise, he would have written himself.</p>
      <p>I express my utmost thanks to you for that recommendation and am indeed grateful. And if there is anything in which I can be of service, I promise to be most willing.</p>
      <p>I commend my mother to you.</p>
      <p>Things are proceeding quite successfully.</p>
      <p>May God always be with me by His grace.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write about religion; they say that two Roman cardinals will be coming here in the next few days. Hallowed be the name of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire family and all friends in my name. Farewell and continue to love me.</p>
      <p>Given in Kraków, September 14, 1558.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await your letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Antonius Schneeberger, d. [doctor?] To the most vigilant and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the Church of Zürich, his most revered lord and parent. In Zürich.</p>
