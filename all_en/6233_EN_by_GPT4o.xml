      <p>Greetings. I received your letters through this man from Glarus and I give your piety my greatest thanks, especially for the faithful advice you shared with me regarding the matter of the new confederation.</p>
      <p>I am returning it to you; but I am surprised at how it happened that it was sent to me, unsealed or opened, and only wrapped in the first page of your latest response to Brentius, which you call the Repetition, by the prefect of Lausanne, Petermann von Erlach, who had sent a messenger there. I transcribed from it what seemed important, and I did not think this messenger would return so quickly from Fribourg; otherwise, I would have written to you more extensively; for he returns at night and will depart again tomorrow morning, when I also have to preach.</p>
      <p>This matter also keeps me very concerned, and I greatly fear that we may be led into a serious temptation. Beza writes to our people, and being quite cunning, he knows whom he should influence; therefore, he urges and insists, and there are those here who listen to him, who otherwise would hardly listen. The pretext is plausible, but the matter itself is entirely rotten.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord not to lead us into temptation. Marshal de Villeville and the Archbishop of Limoges came here last Tuesday; the day before yesterday and yesterday they were heard, first by the senate, then by the dioceses. I cannot yet write with certainty what they proposed and what was answered to them, as I have not yet been able to hear any of the trusted ones discussing these matters; you will know soon enough. They are now heading to Lucerne; for they are avoiding Solothurn due to the plague also threatening there. They will also come to Zurich to deal with you, as they have done here.</p>
      <p>I am also returning Beldius's letters; he wrote to me about the same matters. I still worry that nothing good will come of it, and I fear the others are not faithful enough.</p>
      <p>From Geneva, there is nothing else, except that I understood from Mr. JÃ¶rg Obrecht from Lyon, who was also here these days, that the Duke of Savoy offers them all good things and fears that we will not maintain the peace with him as he does with us. May God grant that it will be as good! My lords are otherwise dealing with the Genevans for their good; for if war should come, which God forbid, it would be as hard for the Genevans as for anyone else. If peace is concluded, efforts will always be made to ensure that they are also satisfied. We mean better with them than they understand.</p>
      <p>These are my hurried thoughts for now; I will write more next time.</p>
      <p>May all yours be safe.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 19, 1564, at night.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Greet my brother for me, to whom I cannot write now; for I still have letters to write to Glarus. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, my lord and compatriot, to be honored with the utmost piety.</p>
