      <p>Greetings. For your friendly disposition towards me, which you wished to declare by the book sent to me, I give you immense thanks, my dear Bullinger, and although at this time I am extremely busy with completing books of greater importance, I will nevertheless make an effort, as much as possible, to gratify you in this matter either at our home or through another. Recently, I received from Augsburg two rather long letters written in Latin on the same business, which a certain friend of ours, Heinzelius, also sent to me and thinks it worthwhile to publish. Perhaps I will join them to your little book, so that we may pour out the whole broth at once.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dear Bullinger, and pray to the Lord for us. Basel, August 9, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus from the heart.</p>
      <p>I was about to write the same to Lord Pietro Paolo Vergerio; but since there was no leisure, I wish these little letters to be shared with him through you. Also, greet him in my name as courteously as possible.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed friend. Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed friend. Zürich.</p>
