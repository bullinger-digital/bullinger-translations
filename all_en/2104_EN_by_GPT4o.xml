      <p>S. P. Most learned ecclesiastic, from your letter dated December 2nd, I learned that you had not yet received the one I wrote to you from Tübingen on the penultimate day of November. You complain three times about the difficulty of my writing, though yours is more difficult; however, your most loving letters, however written, are more than sufficient for me, which I have now learned to read. Moreover, as is fitting, I will henceforth write to you through scribes, whom I find here and knew would not be lacking as soon as I began to teach publicly. That rather unfortunate journey through Strasbourg cost me more than a hundred gold coins, which I would never have undertaken if the hope of obtaining a family there had not been made and sealed for me by friends in Lorraine, who could not fulfill it. This was the cause of my two-month journey to the princes of Germany, who, granting everything, also claimed me, and when I was urged for many of their academies, I preferred to yield to the Duke of Württemberg, lest he be disappointed in the hope he had conceived of me in Heilbronn, and because he had been concerned about me first (it has been a year now). The principal, whom they call, of the college of Narbonne, named Tufanus, a learned man, a zealot of good letters and the gospel, by nation an Aquitanian, holds that college in Paris, in which no sacred rites are performed nor any exercise, but he teaches well and nourishes boys, whom he also sends to suitable lectures in other colleges.</p>
      <p>There is no one more suitable to take that young man into boarding. If the parents prefer him to be in the academy, which they call the university, that college of Narbonne is located on the street of the Cithara, not far from the bridge of St. Michael, a little above the church or temple of Cosmas and Damian. That Tufanus gives his boys French themes, which he has them translate into Latin and vice versa. He abstains from idolatry and his own, as much as he can, but it is hardly possible that he is not compelled to dissimulate once a month, nor do I know a more suitable place than that. But if there is a more suitable place, he, endowed with such candor, will indicate it with a ready mind, inquire, and help, especially if he is then spoken to. For he still has my firstborn son, whom I wish to bring out with the family in early spring, with letters from five princes already sent through the envoy of the aforementioned duke to the King of France, to grant this.</p>
      <p>In Bourges, there might be greater freedom, at least there was more when I recently left France, as Germans are also accustomed to frequent there, who are allowed to act quite freely, and there French can be learned equally with Latin.</p>
      <p>I have a great connection with François Duaren, the principal, and François Baudouin, who was once my scribe, my professors. To them (if Bourges is more pleasing) I will gladly give letters, and they will certainly find someone who can exercise in French and Latin without subjection to idolatry and in whose house a young German can stay when necessary. Farewell, dearest teacher; I am glad to be closer to you, so that I may more easily enjoy your letters, and I will serve you and yours in whatever matter I can, and that most willingly.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you and prosper you well for the propagation of His church, which I also desire and hope to be more purified here. You will commend me to the Reverend Father Mr. Bullinger, the most learned Bibliander, your family, and others. Tübingen, December 11, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient Charles du Moulin, jurist of Germany and professor in Tübingen.</p>
      <p>Our most pious Vergerius greets you, who is entirely against the enemies, daily devising new things.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian and ecclesiastic Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>I also wish for quickly well-written letters; but for 25 years I have been accustomed to scribes. I order my wife to bring the French, because the Germans are too slow and I am always ready to hasten to the contest.</p>
