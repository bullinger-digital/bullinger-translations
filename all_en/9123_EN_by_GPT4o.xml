      <p>S. I had recently composed this, most illustrious and honorable compater, to hand it over to the merchants who would deliver it to you, but such a storm had arisen that no one wanted to commit to the journey at that time. Finally, after it subsided a little, they left as if forgetting my matters; otherwise, it would have been brought to you sooner. I truly give you immense thanks for sharing this with me and others. I returned to Lord Amman Schuler the German copy, as it was translated by the Beldians, who brings both the French and the German to you here.</p>
      <p>I deeply mourn the death of Lord Wolphius of blessed memory and agree with you that it is not easy to find someone who can replace his labors and learning. But we will ask the Lord to, in His kindness, send another good man into this harvest, who will act for the glory of His most holy name and the salvation of the church.</p>
      <p>We hear about La Rochelle, even though they are besieged in a hostile and severe manner, they still persevere in the utmost constancy of faith. May God preserve them and finally send His angel, who will confound and destroy this treacherous Sennacherib with his bloodthirsty and more than Assyrian army.</p>
      <p>How our affairs are going, Lord Amman will communicate to you; he has as a colleague at the assembly our vicar or proconsul Melchior Hess. Since he is a papist, I did not want to hand over this apology of the royal execution on the Huguenots to him for reading, as it might not have made him better, but worse.</p>
      <p>Consider these things kindly and farewell happily in the Lord. Both the Beldians, Pfendler, and my wife wish you well, etc. I ask you to convey my greetings in my name to all our fellow ministers and brothers, as well as to your entire family, etc.</p>
      <p>In Glarus, December 5, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Hugo in Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich, my most esteemed and dear lord and compater.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
