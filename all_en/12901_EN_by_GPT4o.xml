    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Greetings. Since the people of Zurich have always shown their friendship to the people of Chur, the commissioners and schoolmasters of Chur take the liberty to approach them again, with the request to kindly receive the following statements.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The people of Zurich are already aware of the [Nikolai] school [in Chur] established by the Gotteshausbund from the monastery estates. At this school, 22 boys are taught and provided for three years. They come from the communities of the Gotteshausbund and from families that cannot afford such an education. Once the three years are over, new scholarship students are admitted. However, it would be better if especially the students who have proven themselves suitable for further studies could stay longer than three years. But the communities prefer a rotation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Nevertheless, it is also criticized that the good students have to leave the school after three years, and thus the expenses incurred for them are lost, as most of them cannot continue to finance their studies, especially when they or their parents learn that studying in Zurich or elsewhere costs about 20 to 30 guilders per year just for living expenses (excluding books and clothing). It is also no longer customary and is frowned upon for students to be encouraged by their parents to go from house to house to support themselves through alms.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Therefore, the people of Chur ask the people of Zurich for help and advice: What could be done to enable the talented boys to continue their studies?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Since the authorities and citizens of Zurich believe that not only in Zurich should the youth be educated in the sciences and languages, they may help think about how the people of Chur could further educate the talented boys to become teachers and in the true Christian religion, so that they remain in their studies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Zurich colleagues may now kindly consider the proposal of the people of Chur, especially since it does not represent an excessive burden for Zurich (should this plan please the recipients, they may present it to the mayors and council of Zurich): Perhaps a suitable, furnished house could be found in Zurich, along with a capable citizen who would accommodate and care for students from Chur and elsewhere, ensuring that he manages with an annual pension of no more than 13 guilders per boy, as in Chur, where the [monastery] bailiff [Wolfgang Salet] provides for the students in a modest but sufficient manner without wine, with porridge, bread, barley [soup], peas, and some meat (the boys must provide for their own books and clothing). This would encourage boys and parents to continue their studies. How wonderful if the mayors and council of Zurich approved the project! In this way, the people of Chur would also have educated young men who remain faithful to the [evangelical] religion in the religiously divided Graub√ºnden and are no longer lured by malicious people and good wages, by mass celebrations and the associated horrors, by consecration ceremonies and large parishes, and would also help keep others away from all of this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The people of Zurich may kindly receive and consider this proposal. They know better than the people of Chur can express in writing what this is about.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] If they were to respond that the people of Chur should establish such a pension themselves, they may consider that youth is much better educated abroad than at home.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Lastly, it should be emphasized that wealthy people are more likely to be ashamed of the Gospel and do not encourage their sons to become preachers. Therefore, as always, it is rather the poorer population (for whom the Gospel has always been important) that will produce future preachers. That is why it seems so important to the people of Chur to support the poor students, as it is more likely these who will later be of use to the communities, while the children of the wealthy usually only have their own advantage in mind after completing their studies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The people of Zurich may consider all this kindly and provide their friendly response at an appropriate opportunity. The people of Chur will be grateful for it.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Venerable, highly learned, pious, honorable, and wise gentlemen! Your reverence and wisdom first receive our friendly greetings and willing service, and whatever we can offer in honor, love, and goods. Gracious, kind, dear gentlemen! Faithful, beloved oath and confederates! The special friendship that you have always shown us and kindly demonstrated prompts us once again to present this proposal to you, to write to you our well-meaning and helpful request with the hope that you will kindly accept it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We are well aware that you have a report of our established school from the monasteries through our common Gotteshausbund thus reformed, where now, God willing, 22 boys from our confederation and generally from those who otherwise cannot afford to send their children to school, will be supported for three consecutive years. When the three years are completed, others will be admitted to this scholarship, although we would prefer that those who are first admitted, especially those who have a decent aptitude for studying, should remain longer. However, our communities prefer such rotation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It is no less a complaint and consideration among us, which also concerns us, that the boys who have somewhat benefited from the three years, are then not as useful, and all effort, labor, and expenses are in vain, as several boys, and the majority, are not able to continue studying, especially when they or their parents learn that they cannot support themselves with small costs with you and elsewhere (if there were some who would like to continue studying and devote themselves to learning the arts) and must pay no less than 20, even up to 30 guilders (excluding books and clothing) for board. It is also no longer customary and is frowned upon for poor students to go from house to house with common alms to support themselves and thus be encouraged to continue.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>How we might address this and make a provision, we would like to seek advice, help, and guidance from you, as our gracious, kind, and lovers of good arts, so that the young men mentioned may continue and persist in their studies.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Since you, indeed a mayor and council and the common city of Zurich, are inclined to promote such matters, that the youth be well instructed in good arts and the learning of languages, not only for your own but also for those coming from elsewhere, and you have shown insight and foresight in this, we earnestly and sincerely present our request, well-meaning request, and plea that you would kindly consider how and in what way the matter could be advised, helped, and addressed, so that we may dedicate, educate, and bring up well-mannered young men to teachers and true Christian religion, and thus they would be retained in their studies.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Especially this intention, which we consider entirely beneficial to ours and perhaps not so burdensome to you or the common city of Zurich, we would like to tell you, who would kindly hear from us and if you deemed it necessary (and such would not be taken as displeasure from us), might present and advocate to a mayor and council of your city of Zurich, that a mayor and council might appoint a house (suitable for this purpose) with furnishings and equipment, and a good citizen, agreeable to you, be placed therein, who would be obliged to accept and provide for our and other students (as we have arranged with us) and then be assessed with him, how much to take and give from a boy, as with us, which amounts to 13 guilders and no higher. Thus, our bailiff provides for ours with decent and sufficient nourishment, such as porridge, bread, barley, peas, also sometimes with meat in the week, but without wine and with the boys themselves bearing the costs of books and clothing. Such a manner of keeping the boys, we consider, would also be possible with you and better than with us. And if our boys could find accommodation and lodging with you, the boys' parents, indeed the boys themselves, would commit and devote themselves to continue their studies and follow up and pay the 12 or 13 guilders annually and amicably. That would be our good intention and consideration, which we might advocate with you or with a mayor and council and be agreeable to them. Nothing higher, dearer, and more useful could now come to us from you. Thereby we might also come to educated (learned, knowledgeable) young men and, while our people are also divided in religion, the young men might remain in one religion and at the same time confront the malicious, introduce good, and seek to remove from the mass and its entire horror and attachment with consecrations and large parishes, and themselves seek and draw others away from it and hope for something better and bring benefit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Therefore, gracious, kind, dear gentlemen, we earnestly and sincerely ask you not to take our proposal, request, and provision from us as an offense, but to consider it for good as you can better weigh it than we could describe it in writing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>No less is it that you might respond to our writing, that we might arrange such ourselves or the rich should hold their sons to it, etc., as you know yourselves, the youth is usually better led to good and away from evil in foreign places than in their homeland.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Furthermore, it is now the custom of the world that the rich usually are ashamed of the Gospel, especially to make their sons preachers, to let the Gospel be proclaimed. But always the Gospel is the possession of the poor, so only those who are poor dedicate themselves to the profession. Thus and therefore we are inclined to promote them, so they might be useful to the community of God in due time. The rich, after they have studied, now seek their own benefit with their art.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>All this and more you will kindly consider, for our benefit and yours, and when it suits you, let us have a gracious, good, and friendly response. We desire to willingly deserve (repay) this with all our ability. Given at Chur, on the 20th day of March in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Your reverence and wisdom always willingly appointed by the common Gotteshaus commissioners and schoolmasters of the common school in the Predigerkloster in Chur.</p>
