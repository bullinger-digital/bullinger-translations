      <p>Greetings. For a long time, we have not written to you; we did not want to be a burden to you, who are concerned with the Christian world; now it seems we must dare to do so.</p>
      <p>Our bishop has returned here from Trient in these days. We can learn nothing from him about what was done in Trient and what he brings to us from there, even if Comander and I diligently inquire. However, we have not seen him; for Jews do not have dealings with Samaritans. Nevertheless, we sense that he does not favor what is brought from Germany and France. The envoy of the King of France, who is here, showed us a book written and printed in France against the abuses of the popes; it pleases me greatly. Others showed a book written in German, in which the King of France reveals his intention of the war undertaken against the Emperor and Caesar; and it pleases not less Father Comander than me. Would you disdain to hear my opinion? It has been believed by both ancient and modern writers that the Roman Empire will be abolished and the Roman name removed from the world; likewise, those who have fornicated with that scarlet whore will dispute her.</p>
      <p>What then, if now the causes converge? But this is what we want: if there is anything that you judge worthwhile for us to know and that should be said, that, I say, we eagerly wish to learn from you now. We believe that no less courage is needed now than was needed some years ago when the gospel began to rise, to attack and suppress the kingdom of the Antichrist. May the Lord have mercy on us and grant us confidence. Meanwhile, farewell, most esteemed man in all good things, and command us as you wish, most illustrious leader of Christ. From Chur, on the second day of May in the year 1552. Father Comander, as always, wishes you all good things.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>In every way to the great Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most esteemed by all the learned.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
