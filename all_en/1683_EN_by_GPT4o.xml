      <p>S. I am tormented by the expectation of your letters, which I believe have already been sent; but I am very afraid that they too may be lost.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beg you to renew them, especially to the princes. The Earl of Warwick set out for Berwick with a large retinue at the beginning of May and is expected to return soon. Our Duke was here near Oxford in recent days at an estate that came to him from the inheritance of the late Duke of Suffolk. I approached him and greeted him according to the custom of the academy. At my request, he donated three fallow deer to our fellowship.</p>
      <p>As for you (so may I live), he inquired very kindly about what you are doing and how you are faring. I responded with what seemed appropriate. It is now your turn, it is your duty to reply as soon as possible. Please make sure that I understand that you and your affairs have been of concern to me; this will happen if you mention Alexander in your letter to the Earl of Warwick in the way I wish. Scinnerus sends you his regards.</p>
      <p>Martyr is absent. Oxford, July 27, in haste. The gloves will be faithfully returned to your wife. Farewell, my dearest and most esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your greatness, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger, in Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
