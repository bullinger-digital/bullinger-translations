      <p>Greetings. Most learned man, your letters have been faithfully delivered to me.</p>
      <p>I have had the book of the Martyr for a long time; I confess that I have been greatly helped by it. May the Lord keep such a theologian safe with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>He would already be teaching in Heidelberg if Brentius had not advised Otto Heinrich to beware of martyrs, mice, and dormice. The controversy over the Lord's Supper is being conducted here with majesty.</p>
      <p>I am now acting as a military preacher.</p>
      <p>I cannot recount in a few words what has happened in the meantime.</p>
      <p>I ask you to consider these things favorably: Elector Friedrich has been in Augsburg for some time for the inauguration.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Count Georg of Erbach, his relative, acted as vice-prince, and when he was accused by Tilemann of being a Zwinglian, that is, a heretic because of the matter of the Lord's Supper, he called together all the ministers who serve the church at St. S... He issued a confession and asked to be admitted to the communion. In that confession, he denied that the bread is the body of Christ, and he refused to grant that it is eaten with the mouth of the body and taken by the impious. Here, those who were all united against me were divided; they all judged the count to be worthy of admission; only Tilemann refused to consent, lest he be seen to condemn the Saxon churches, that is, the borrowed votes of Westphalia. The count protested that he would judge the Christian confession with me, which they had previously condemned; thus he was admitted. He said to Tilemann to his face: "The confession I have now issued, I sent to the theologians of the princes when they were in Worms, and it was approved by all of them; even the critic Illyricus could not correct it, and therefore I do not care much for your ban.</p>
      <p>The Roman pontiff excluded me, yet I did not perish from hunger or thirst." And when Tilemann said he could not communicate with Calvin or Bullinger, he was answered: "If Bullinger and Calvin were in heaven, you would remain outside in sorrow." Tilemann wanted to admit the count, as long as he would receive him as an infirm person. The count replied that he was certain of his faith and gave such a demonstration of that certainty that all those who had been such loud shouters were shamefully confused.</p>
      <p>Diller shows himself to be a faithful and good man. Balduin, suffering from hatred of Calvin, is said to advise my adversaries.</p>
      <p>Thomas Erastus and Xylander judge my concord to be good. Pray to God that I may play the good actor; I truly trust in the Lord and hope that He will support His cause. I, as a young man, am drawn as if to the contest of this controversy.</p>
      <p>I have once sent the theses to the Lord; now I send again a more detailed explanation of them. I ask that the Lord deign to confer with Peter Martyr and advise me where I may err from the truth. If Peter Martyr has forgotten me, let him be reminded of the one who assumed in Strasbourg and proved from the round shape of the head that young men are not pigs or swine. Distracted by innumerable affairs, I cannot report this matter to the Lord more elegantly and at length. This excellent man, who will commend himself and whom you will treat with dignity, will recount more to you. For he was here for a full eight days.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given on the 18th of August, in the year 59.</p>
      <p>I ask that the Lord greet the Martyr and other good men. The controversy has spread so that it has become known not only to the ministers but to the entire church. Many pious people are disturbed, many abstain from the Lord's Supper, waiting for the outcome.</p>
      <p>They await the judgment of Philipp.</p>
      <p>I hope that Philipp, as a prudent man, will not give an answer unless ordered by the prince and asked. And believe me, the matter will not be settled without a council of theologians.</p>
      <p>I am a young rider, I gallop my horse, I do not let it go over the kitchen. Because the cause is the Lord's.</p>
      <p>As soon as it can be done, I earnestly request that the Lords communicate their judgment to me about my matters.</p>
      <p>You can greatly help me with your advice. Wilhelm Klebitz of Brandenburg, minister of the church in Heidelberg, your most observant.</p>
      <p>I hear that there is some disagreement between the ministers of your church and those of Geneva on this matter. Tilemann boasts about it a lot; he boasted that Balduin recited to him how Calvin was miserably confused in Bern by his own letters. It would be useful for me to be informed about these things.</p>
      <p>I would like to hear from you and Martyr what should be thought about the manner of the union that exists between Christ and the faithful; for I notice that some speak coarsely about it. To the pious and excellent man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and brother in Christ, always to be respected, these letters are given.</p>
