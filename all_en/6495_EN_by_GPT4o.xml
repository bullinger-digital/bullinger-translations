      <p>To this, I replied briefly: Since he himself considered it improper to ask, I could not advise him to do the improper, and even if I did advise it, he would not be at peace in his mind because of it.</p>
      <p>However, if it is so that the deceased lords and the bailiff have promised to remember his work, as his work has been commendable so far, he might remind the bailiff, as a friendly man, of the promise with modest words, in good hope of enjoying it.</p>
      <p>He, the bailiff, knows well what our lords' order is, against which it would not be proper for Mr. Hansen to act. And if this is done with modesty, I consider it harmless for him.</p>
      <p>I do not know of better advice at this time; I write briefly at 9 at night, as I would rather have gone to my rest, since the letter only reached me then and the messenger wanted to leave during the day, etc.</p>
