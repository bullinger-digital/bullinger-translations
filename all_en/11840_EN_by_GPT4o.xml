    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes also unsolicited, but there is often a lack of messengers. Encloses letters from [Martin] Frecht and [Hans] Welser and requests their return; thanks for Bullinger's letter [No. 1788]. In the event of an Emperor [Charles V] victory over [Francis I], he fears harm to the free cities and the Confederates, and especially after the victory over [William of] Jülich, due to the Emperor's excessive euphoria, that the Protestants will be sacrificed and [Duke Henry of] Brunswick will be given free rein; only Christ offers help. Bucer has sent a letter through his assistant Christoph [Söll], in which he writes that he was pleased with Bullinger's letters and will respond again; Philipp [Melanchthon] and others could only with difficulty prevent Luther from writing against Bullinger. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You indeed strongly encourage me to write diligently to you, my venerable and dearest Bullinger. I, however, do so willingly whenever I can learn something that I believe pertains to you, your people, or our common affairs.</p>
      <p>But often there is a lack of messengers, which prevents me from doing what I most wish to do; and then, when by chance they do appear, they arrive too late for me to inform you of things that have long been written to me. Otherwise, my brother, I would gladly gratify you in this matter as much as I can.</p>
      <p>I am sending here the letters of our Frecht, which I received four days ago, and I also took care to send yours to him yesterday. Then you receive here the letter from Welser, the consul of Augsburg, who never wrote anything vain to me; if only it were a more pleasant message!</p>
      <p>For your letters, which mostly agree, I give thanks. I earnestly request you to return both letters.</p>
      <p>But who, my brother, who is even a little prudent, does not see the extreme evils threatening the Christian world? I clearly foresee that if the Emperor is superior to the French, as many do not doubt, he will leave nothing untried against the free cities, the Swiss, and others, to subjugate them to his will. And indeed, it is astonishing how the adversaries are confident and boastful from this victory against Jülich. Many of them even boast that the Emperor is convinced he will achieve nothing against the Turks unless he first sacrifices us as an expiatory offering, which to hasten, Brunswick now again - undoubtedly with the Emperor's authorization or assistance - provides an excellent opportunity, as he so provokes our people and tries to reclaim his domain from them, that Hesse is already concerned about enlisting soldiers. What do you think will happen if the Emperor supports Brunswick? Will we not predict the ruin and devastation of all Upper Germany from this? Indeed, believe me, all of Switzerland will be in danger. Therefore, venerable Bullinger, it will be our duty to flee to the banners of Christ with much greater zeal than ever before, to be pierced by living repentance for our sins, and to entrust ourselves entirely to the care of the Lord. This alone, indeed, remains for us from this most savage storm of all things, and it is also the only protection sufficient for us against the whole world and its prince.</p>
      <p>Bucer sent me a letter three days ago through Christoph, his servant and scribe, who was also his companion on the entire journey to Cologne. I write less to you about it because, among other things, he remembers you in this way: "Bullinger has sent me two friendly letters, which greatly refreshes me. I have responded and will respond, as is fitting, seeking the utmost friendship with all who faithfully undertake the ministry of Christ. Luther has been restrained with difficulty by Philipp and others from writing against him; for there are many very eager instigators with this old man." This he said. But you will in good faith keep this to yourself for a while, until he himself writes to you about it.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest and best brother in the Lord, with your whole household, whom you will greet most dutifully on my behalf, along with Gwalther, our uniquely dear friend, and the other friends and brothers. You will diligently commend us to the Lord.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Constance, October 2, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the man of distinguished piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his venerable and dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
