    <p xml:id="regest1">He has heard about Nikolaus Steiner's dismissal from office. The accusation that Steiner made him a financial offer to take over the parish of Wädenswil is not true. Through the mediation of Jakob Hegner in Altstetten, Steiner merely offered him a kind of deputy position - as in the case of Jost Müller in Thalwil - until it became clear how his gout disease would progress. He asks for leniency for the elderly Steiner and for his reinstatement in the synod.</p>

      <p>To the strict, steadfast, prudent, and wise mayor and council, also to the venerable and highly learned synod of the city of Zurich, his gracious lords and superiors.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God. My obedient, willing service beforehand, strict, steadfast, prudent, wise, honorable, pious, highly learned, my gracious lords.</p>
      <p>The honorable old father, Mr. Nikolaus Steiner, informs me that he has been excluded by my gracious lords and by a venerable synod, to the honor of God, a whole Christian community, and himself entirely useless, because he is said to have dealt with and influenced me, namely, that he wanted to buy and take over my parish benefice. I must excuse him in truth, for no thought of taking over or buying from me has ever occurred, as he well knew that I am not a merchant, nor do I have any benefice for sale, nor am I a transgressor of divine law or your Christian synodal statutes, therefore he never made any purchase offer to me. However, it happened at the beginning of last winter that I wrote to Mr. Jakob in Altstetten, due to my gout illness, to find me a capable brother who would help me serve my parish during the winter. He then brought me the aforementioned Mr. Nikolaus Steiner. He, who has known me since our youth, spoke to me with the following intention: Since I could not serve the parish alone, because I could not travel over hill and dale to the sick - as I complained - if I wanted to go to his house in Zurich for two or three years until I could see how my illness would develop, he would let me follow from the benefice what would be fair according to my lords' recognition, as was also handled with Mr. Jost in Thalwil. He also trusted that he could obtain favor and goodwill through good patrons and friends with my lords and superiors, as well as with my steward. I was not decided on the matter to give him an answer. It remained at that, and neither of us ever thought of this matter again. With this, I have informed you of the truth. Therefore, I hope that he has not acted dishonorably, ungodly, nor in violation of your synodal statutes in this matter. Therefore, it was shocking to hear that he should be punished so severely, for I hope you can judge for yourselves that he has not violated any written or your Christian statutes in the aforementioned speech, as I would not have wanted to grant him that, as you, my gracious lords, have known me for a long time and will never find otherwise. It is my earnest request for God's and Christian love's sake that you consider the good old brother, who now, due to his age, should be asked if he had done anything wrong, rather than be punished so severely, 1 Timothy 5:1, without doubt, he would do penance and call upon all Christian brothers to pray to God for him, as Simon did after Peter's punishment, Acts 8:24. May you, my gracious lords, graciously consider his age and not take or regard these words, spoken with good intention, so highly, but graciously accept him back into the church and restore him to his previous honor. He always desires to be indebted to you as his gracious lords and superiors in complete obedient service to you, and I also wish to serve you, my gracious lords, in all honor and brotherly love to the best of my ability in all willing submission to God and you, my gracious lords, always with great earnestness.</p>
      <p>Entrusted to God in grace.</p>
      <p>Given at Wädenswil.</p>
