      <p>Greetings. Lest you doubt our well-being due to your love for us, I have decided to write a few words. Our journey, by the grace of God, was fortunate and successful.</p>
      <p>Although we experienced some difficulty before reaching Brescia, because we came from Milan, where we toured the very fortified castle, without those letters that would testify that we had not been in any plague-infested place, so diligently is the plague avoided here, which now rages fiercely throughout all of Poland. However, we arrived in this city on the 21st of October, where shortly before our arrival, three people were executed, namely a father with his son and son-in-law, for the Lutheran religion, and previously a fourth was betrayed by his wife. Four days ago, the Emperor of the Venetians returned from the fleet, met by 50 noblemen dressed in red.</p>
      <p>Nothing about the Turk, whether defeated or victorious, is conveyed to me. Spring will bring something. Meanwhile, the Pope is urging all Christians to prayers and thanksgiving, so that the Turk may be defeated and it may happen to us. The Catholic King, and because the King of the French has eliminated the Huguenots. We certainly wish to be in our homeland when the new king is elected.</p>
      <p>They say this will happen on the first of February, for then my baron could learn much.</p>
      <p>But here our free will is taken away. The nobility generally desires the Muscovite, as it would be a great addition to the empire. Seeing this, the Emperor draws many to his side with many prayers. This election will be difficult. The Turk hinders, that is, demands that neither the Muscovite nor the Emperor's son become our king, which he does, fearing in some way. The deceased king left a great amount of gold, from which the Tartars' wages were paid and something added to win their favor in the future.</p>
      <p>I am weary of living here, as I have neither the books I desire nor the people. Here is the greatest part of the world or nearly the whole world. Yesterday, I attended a Jesuit debate; it was asserted that the Virgin Mary was free from original sin. Publicly, a certain monk explains the Acts of the Apostles in Latin on feast days; he denied that heretics, that is, Lutherans, are legitimately called to the ministry, while he was explaining chapter IV on the feast of St. Martin. I do not wish to write more, because it is not permitted. My student sends his greetings to you. If you ever write to us, you will ensure the letters are delivered to Sebastian the Pole, a citizen in Borgozucho.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Padua, 13th of November, 1572. Greetings from me to all. Johannes Laski.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>"Send these back to me."</p>
