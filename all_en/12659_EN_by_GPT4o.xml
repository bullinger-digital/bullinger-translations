<letter xml:id="file12659"><summary><p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller received three letters from Bullinger [not preserved] since the [three] Zurich pastors [Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder] have been in Augsburg. The first letter was brought by the three mentioned. Bullinger received Haller's response to it [HBBW XVII, No. 2596], as the last letter received from him today suggests. Bullinger refers in it to the events in Neuburg an der Donau and to Thomas Naogeorg. Haller consulted with [Michael] Keller and [Georg] Frölich about him. Naogeorg, who received money from the Augsburgers, is hiding with a good man [...] in Lauingen. However, since the situation there is not safe, he will secretly return to Augsburg. Bullinger is thanked for his generosity towards Naogeorg. Bullinger does not need to worry about a position for him. It is planned that Naogeorg will serve in Kaufbeuren [as a pastor] if others can be appointed in Augsburg!</p><p xml:id="regest2">[2] Like Bullinger, Haller is also surprised by [Jakob] Reinhart's promotion to captain. Pankraz Mötteli, the former accomplice of Wilhelm Arsent (in the murder of the Frenchman [Antoine de Rochefort] studying in Basel) and participant in the [Second] Kappel War, helped him to this dignity. Frölich reports that Reinhart behaves badly and tries to extort more money than usual from the Augsburg councilors. If only he had stayed at home! Michael Hedinger is with Reinhart, but Haller cannot report anything more specific about him at the moment.</p><p xml:id="regest3">[3] Haller is pleased that the three pastors returning to Zurich can testify that his silence, which Bullinger repeatedly lamented, is not due to negligence or laziness.</p><p xml:id="regest4">[4] As astonishing as it may seem, one learns very little and hardly anything reliable about the military actions that are causing confusion throughout Europe, even in Augsburg (despite being close to the events)!</p><p xml:id="regest5">[5] Additionally, Haller does not learn in this large city who is traveling to Zurich. Neither he nor Frölich heard anything about the sons of [Claudius Pius] Peutinger. Both only learned about it through Bullinger's letters.</p><p xml:id="regest6">[6] Haller does not want to send doubtful or fabricated news, especially since he knows that Bullinger shares his letters with the Zurich councilors. Only with Frölich can he learn anything certain, but he does not dare to disturb this already very busy person too often. However, he records all verified news to report it to the Zurichers (to whom he wants to withhold nothing).</p><p xml:id="regest7">[7] Here are some news in German, so they can also be shared with others: Recently, several skirmishes took place near Neuburg [an der Donau] (which the Emperor [Charles V] captured without bloodshed but with numerous rapes of women). Both sides suffered losses, but the [Schmalkaldic League] had the upper hand. On September 25, they captured a significant man [...] from the imperial camp and learned about Charles V's plans. The latter then pretended to march through Bavaria towards Augsburg or Landsberg [am Lech]. To attack him, the [Schmalkaldic League] also crossed the Danube. But suddenly he turned north and crossed the river again. The [Schmalkaldic League] then crossed it again at Donauwörth and tried to reach Marxheim, where the Emperor had entrenched himself.</p><p xml:id="regest8">[8] Attempts to force the Emperor into battle were unsuccessful. Therefore, the Augsburgers and Württembergers were forbidden to deliver wine to Bavaria. As a result, wine prices in the imperial camp rose, and an epidemic broke out. Because of this, the Italians are fleeing in droves. The Emperor ordered all deserters to be captured and hanged in Schwaz and Tyrol.</p><p xml:id="regest9">[9] Things are going well in the [Schmalkaldic League] camp. The 203 companies of foot soldiers there are divided into six regiments under the following leadership: 1. Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony]; 2. Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse]; 3. [Sebastian] Schertlin; 4. Baron [Johann] von Heideck; 5. Count [Christoph] von Oldenburg; 6. Count Wilhelm von Fürstenberg. Strict discipline is maintained, with hangings and beheadings; however, there is much "weeding" to be done.</p><p xml:id="regest10">[10] On September 27, envoys from the kings [Francis I] of France and [Henry VIII] of England are said to have arrived at the Emperor's camp and renounced their obedience to him. Haller could not learn more details. It is certain that the Frenchman [Piero] Strozzi (whose sister [correctly: cousin, Catherine de' Medici] is said to be married to the Dauphin [Henry]) offered troops and money to the [Schmalkaldic League], but at unfavorable interest rates and conditions. The [Schmalkaldic League] did not completely reject the offer but said they would consider it if needed.</p><p xml:id="regest11">[11] The town of Rain [am Lech] was conditionally returned to the prince [Duke Wilhelm] of Bavaria, who remains neutral. The Duke has stationed a garrison of 1000 men there. If he encounters Spaniards or troops on raids, he acts harshly against them on the Emperor's orders.</p><p xml:id="regest12">[12] On September 28, something unprecedented happened to [Sebastian] Schertlin. When he got up at one o'clock at night (to go on watch) and put on his armor while his servants fetched the horses, someone dressed like one of his servants came and stabbed at him with a halberd blade. Schertlin managed to dodge but was grazed on the neck. The attacker tried again. However, Schertlin shouted so loudly that he drove him away. The attacker stumbled over a tent rope and was captured. After a few days, he was interrogated under torture, beheaded, and quartered. His name is Pantaleon Leibrock [correctly: Ebner] and he comes from Lindau. According to his confession, the bailiff Wolfgang [Kantz] of Bregenz promised him 3000 crowns for the murder. God prevented this in a miraculous way!</p><p xml:id="regest13">[13] Keller, who was also in the camp, happened to be present when a Swiss from the three Catholic cantons was about to be hanged (even though the dispute had been settled). Keller obtained mercy for him.</p><p xml:id="regest14">[14] On October 1, the Emperor set out towards Nördlingen, three miles from Donauwörth. He intended to capture this city and then move to Württemberg. However, the [Schmalkaldic League] urged the Nördlingers to stand firm until they could come to their aid. When the Emperor saw that they had anticipated him, he positioned himself on a hill near Wemding.</p><p xml:id="regest15">[15] On October 4, the [Schmalkaldic League] positioned the entire, highly motivated army in battle formation and remained in this position for five hours, as they believed the Emperor would attack. But when he saw the vast army, he withdrew.</p><p xml:id="regest16">[16] On October 5, there were fierce skirmishes in which up to 80 imperial soldiers were killed. On the [Schmalkaldic] side, [Prince] Albrecht of Brunswick-[Grubenhagen] was stabbed through a cheek. The two armies are very close to each other.</p><p xml:id="regest17">[17] The [Augsburg] councilors defend the [Schmalkaldic] army and say it cannot act otherwise. Whether this is true, the Lord will know! It is certain that man is vain. The Emperor burns entire villages. Recently, some large cannons were stolen from him.</p><p xml:id="regest18">[18] Haller does not know what the Swiss are doing at the Klause [Ehrenberg]. However, it is said that their leaders are disgracing the entire Swiss Confederation. They all want to become rich. If only they had stayed at home! Then the customs of the Swiss would still be praised. What Haller has to listen to angers him greatly.</p><p xml:id="regest19">[19] It is also heard that money and other valuables were found in Dillingen, the bishop's seat [of Otto Truchsess von Waldburg], which were walled up. The castle at Wolfenbüttel is said to have been destroyed to the ground at the beginning of the war.</p><p xml:id="regest20">[20] Haller admonished [Hans Wilpert] Zoller in writing because of the gossip about him. However, what Zoller replied in gratitude, Haller prefers to keep silent. If Zoller had been wise, he would have behaved differently.</p><p xml:id="regest21">[21] The pastoral colleagues from Zurich arrived in Augsburg on September 22, as Haller already reported in writing [HBBW XVII, No. 2596]. The council received them with honor with 12 jugs of wine. After spending a day in a public inn, they stayed with Haller on the advice of the authorities. He admonished them to adapt to the customs of the [Augsburg] church in external matters, to represent pure doctrine, and (which is highly valued in Augsburg) to lead an exemplary life. There is nothing to criticize about the teachings of the three. Only [Rudolf] Schwyzer preached excessively harshly and carelessly in the last sermon (as [Konrad] Klauser once did in Isny) against the customs of the wealthy Augsburgers. This speech offended many, with even more people inciting Schwyzer further against the rich. He lacks modesty. Additionally, the Zurich pastors, although Haller hosted them, also ate and drank in the public inn, damaging their reputation. Lorenz [Meyer] is stubborn, otherwise learned and pious. However, he has a sharp accent [when preaching]. Ruman is liked by the Augsburg council because of his clear pronunciation and the simple and clear way he handles his subject in his sermons.</p><p xml:id="regest22">[22] On September 29, a convent was held at Haller's house, where the three pastors from Zurich were presented with ten articles of faith. They also accepted the article on the Lord's Supper, although it was written in an unclear manner ([Wolfgang] Musculus expressed himself more openly than ever before, rejecting a physical presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper and asserting that the signs have no grace, which astonished some colleagues, as he thought differently a year ago; which also gives hope for the Zurich position and for the churches of Germany; if only Haller's efforts are not thwarted by the [three new pastors]!). In this way, they were admitted to the Augsburg church. The council granted them an annual salary of 200 guilders on the condition that they now work in the city's churches but commit to serving in the countryside once peace is restored. They were also asked, without being strictly forced (just as was done in Haller's case), to adhere to the Augsburg church order as much as possible. On the occasion of their return to Zurich to settle their affairs, they were given 30 guilders for the Zurich council, as requested in Bullinger's letter [not preserved], which had been advanced to them for their journey to Augsburg. Each was also given an additional 20 guilders. Furthermore, the councilors reimbursed them for all expenses incurred at Haller's and the inn. They are to settle their affairs in Zurich as soon as possible and return to Augsburg as soon as possible.</p><p xml:id="regest23">[23] This as a confidential communication. Haller only wishes the three colleagues well; otherwise, he would not wish for them to change their behavior.</p><p xml:id="regest24">[24] [Sebastian] Lepusculus and Hieronymus Gunz also recently came from Basel. Their employment is not yet settled. More on this later.</p><p xml:id="regest25">[25] Yesterday, a man [...] was to be executed. Then a fire broke out in the "Gießhaus" and caused an explosion of the ammunition stored there. The damage is great. Five people are still missing. The execution was postponed to tomorrow.</p><p xml:id="regest26">[26] Just now, news comes that there was another battle yesterday. If Haller learns more before the pastors leave, he will add an appendix to his letter.</p><p xml:id="regest27">[27] The discord among the Swiss is very dangerous, especially for the four Protestant cantons. What do [the Inner Swiss] actually promise themselves with their pomposity, with which they think they can intimidate kings and princes, even God himself? Surely they will not cancel their alliances with the French!</p><p xml:id="regest28">[28] May God faithfully preserve his flock. He is the goal and purpose. Without him, one fails. Greetings from the colleagues, from Lepusculus, Sixt [Birck], Keller, Bernardino [Ochino], and Musculus.</p></summary><body><div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1"><p>Grace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. I have now received three letters from you since our brothers were with me. I responded to the first ones they brought, and your last letter, dated the first of October, which I received today, confirms that you have received my response. You show that you have understood from my letters what happened in Neuburg. I have nothing to add except regarding the matter of Thomas Naogeorg. I discussed this with Cellarius and Laetus, who are faithfully handling his case. We kept him for a few days in Laugingen with a very good man, but since he will not be safe there permanently, he will secretly return to us. We have helped him with money, so he is well provided for. I thank you very much for your generosity. Indeed, this is truly pleasing to God, and He will consider it as done to Himself, whatever benefit we confer on such men. You need not be concerned about his position. We are already working on having him come to Kaufbeuren, if we can somehow preserve others for him in our city.</p></div><div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2"><p>Then, regarding your surprise at how Reinhardus became a captain, I am also surprised, although I know that Pangratius Metellin, who was once an accomplice of Wilhelm Arsent in the murder of the French student in Basel and also participated in the disaster at Kappel, assisted him. He helped him and obtained this honor for the poor man, who was already despised by all captains and our lords, being without money and without a leader. However, the chief scribe told me that he is behaving very badly, so much so that I wish he were at home. He shamelessly wants to extort money from our lords beyond the usual. Michel Hedinger is with him, but I do not know what kind of service or position he has with him. When I find out, I will let you know.</p></div><div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3"><p>Thirdly, regarding your repeated requests for letters from me and your complaints about the silence of my pen, I am glad to have the three brothers returning to you as witnesses of my circumstances, so you cannot attribute this to my negligence or laziness.</p></div><div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4"><p>Indeed, it is astonishing that in such a great military preparation and so many disturbances and movements throughout Europe, nothing is happening that is worthy of being written about, even though the most hostile armies are so close that they almost touch each other! And it is even more astonishing that, although both armies are not far from us, we can hardly find out what is happening. For the city is large, and if any news is brought in, it is immediately spread through so many mouths that it eventually dissolves into nothing like smoke. Moreover, even if a consistent rumor arrives, the opposite is soon proclaimed.</p></div><div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5"><p>Additionally, in such a large city, I am uncertain who will be traveling to you. Regarding the sons of Peutinger, about whom you write, neither I nor Lord Laetus knew a word until we both learned about it from your letters.</p></div><div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6"><p>Given these circumstances, as my witnesses will report, I do not willingly write to you about vain and fabricated matters, knowing that you share my letters with the lords of the council. However, since I cannot find out anything better than from Laetus, that most excellent man is overwhelmed with so many and such great affairs in these disturbances that I do not willingly burden him with more (besides, I am ashamed to want to find out the more secret affairs of the council from him; there is also a third reason, that even if I seek him three or four times, I can hardly find him once, and if I do find him, I find him so occupied that I often leave him with the matter unfinished), I therefore ask you to bear my delay more patiently. I will conceal nothing from you of those things you desire to know and which it is important to know. I note down everything that is certain, so that I may conceal nothing from you.</p></div><div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7"><p>At present, I have the following to write in German, so that you can also share it with others: Recently, several skirmishes took place near Neuburg (which the Emperor captured without bloodshed, but with great dishonor to the women), not without damage to both sides, yet ours always prevailed, in which a great lord was captured from the Emperor and some of the Emperor's plans were learned from him. This happened on September 25. Afterwards, the Emperor pretended as if he wanted to march through Bavaria to Augsburg or Landsberg, and ordered provisions to be sent there. When our side thought to intercept him there, and therefore moved to our side of the Danube, he took the trick and crossed the Danube, intending to escape them. When our side became aware of this, they crossed the Danube again at Donauwörth and moved against him. He then took refuge in a forest and had the rear of his army cut down, so that our forces could not follow him. However, they worked so hard that he had to flee from the forest and camped at Marxheim on the Danube.</p></div><div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8"><p>Meanwhile, our side sought means and ways to harm him, since he would not engage in a field battle. Therefore, it was forbidden in our area and throughout Württemberg to send any wine to Bavaria, so that nothing could reach the Emperor's camp; with this plan, they deprived the Emperor of wine so much that a measure cost 5 or 6 batzen in his camp. Also, a plague has come upon his people, which takes them away in droves. The Italians are fleeing in groups, so that the Emperor has ordered in Schwaz and the county of Tyrol that those who are caught trying to leave should be hanged without mercy. All this is well known.</p></div><div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9"><p>In our camp, things are going well, thank God! There are 203 companies of foot soldiers, divided into 6 regiments: 1. Elector; 2. Landgrave; 3. Schertli; 4. Baron von Heidegg; 5. Count von Oldenburg; 6. Count Wilhelm von Fürstenberg. In sum: Humanly speaking, things are going well. God has it in His hand. May He protect us for the sake of His word and truth. Strict discipline is maintained, with hangings, beheadings, etc., but there is still plenty of weeds.</p></div><div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10"><p>On September 27, some heralds from the king of France and England came to the Emperor's camp. It is said they have renounced him. I cannot learn the exact details. But it is certain that a French lord, named Strozzi, if I remember correctly, who is supposed to have the sister of the Dauphin, has promised much good to our side on behalf of the king, to provide them with people and goods, but with such interest and conditions that it is not convenient for our side. However, they thanked him kindly and did not refuse if they needed anything.</p></div><div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11"><p>The Bavarian prince has been given back the town of Rain, but with some reservations. The prince has placed 1000 of his countrymen there as reinforcements, and also patrols with some horses in the land, and if he finds any of the Emperor's troops or others who are raiding from the camp, he also drives them out on the Emperor's orders. He still remains neutral as before.</p></div><div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12"><p>On September 28, a strange case happened to Lord Schertli. As he was sleeping in his tent and around 1 o'clock at night, intending to get up, put on his armor, and go on watch, he sent his guards to fetch the horses. Meanwhile, someone dressed like one of his guards came into the tent and stabbed at him with a halberd. As he turned, he dodged the stab, but he is said to have been slightly grazed on the neck. Then the other made several more stabs at him. But God protected him. For when he shouted, the villain was frightened, dropped the halberd, and ran away through the darkness, with Schertli and his guards chasing after him. He almost escaped them. But God helped, so that he fell over a rope, as the tents have, was caught, beaten, and captured. After a few days, he was interrogated, beheaded, and then quartered. His name is Panthaleon Lybrock from Lindow. He confessed that the bailiff of Bregenz, named Wolff N., had promised him 3000 crowns for the murder. But God miraculously prevented it.</p></div><div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13"><p>Master Michel Cellarius was also in the camp and happened to be present when he released a Swiss from the cantons, who had been sentenced to hang, from the noose.</p></div><div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14"><p>On October 1, the Emperor set out and moved towards Nördlingen (which is 3 miles from Donauwörth), intending to at least conquer the city, so that he could then move more easily into Württemberg. But our side followed him directly and urged the people of Nördlingen not to surrender; they are coming! So they overtook the Emperor and reached Nördlingen before him. When the Emperor saw this, he camped on a hill near Wemding.</p></div><div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15"><p>On October 4, our side arranged the entire army in battle formation, not expecting anything else than that the Emperor would attack. But when the Emperor saw the might, he did not want to bite the nut. Our side stood in battle formation for 5 hours, eager to fight. People say wonderful things about the soldiers, how eager they are.</p></div><div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16"><p>On October 5, there was a fierce skirmish, in which they fiercely attacked, killing up to 80 of the Emperor's men, including some notable people. However, it did not go without damage on our side either. Duke Albrecht of Brunswick, who is on our side, was stabbed through one cheek. They are also camped so close to each other today that they can see into each other's camp.</p></div><div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17"><p>What will come of it, I do not know. Many people do not like it. The lords defend our army fiercely, saying that they cannot act otherwise. I commend it to the Lord, for I see how vain all human wisdom and power is. The Emperor is burning entire villages. It is such a misery with the poor people that God will surely have mercy. They also recently captured and won some large cannons from him.</p></div><div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18"><p>What the Swiss are doing at the Klause, I do not know, except that I hear they are carelessly handling their affairs. The leaders are rascals. They all want to become rich. They are giving the entire Swiss Confederation a bad name. I wish they were all at home, if it were not otherwise. They do nothing but cut each other's lambs, and do nothing to the enemy. Otherwise, one would praise them for their discipline, loyalty, and honor. I have to hear many things that I would rather kick with my feet.</p></div><div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19"><p>Otherwise, I have no news at this time, except that in Dillingen, where the bishop was seated, some money and other valuables were found walled up; but I do not know how much. Also, that the castle of Wolfenbüttel was uprooted and torn down at the beginning of this war.</p></div><div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20"><p>I once admonished Zoller in a friendly manner through letters about what was being said about him, but I do not want to say what gratitude I received from him. If he were wise, he would act differently.</p></div><div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21"><p>Now about our brothers. They arrived on September 22, as I indicated in previous letters. The council received them honorably with 12 jugs of wine. They spent only one day in a public inn. The rest of the time they spent with me, as advised by the lords. I believe I have fulfilled my duty towards them. I advised them to adapt to our church in external matters, and to lead the people here with integrity of doctrine, purity, and sincerity of morals, which our people observe above all - how one lives. In doctrine, I desire nothing in them, except that Svitzer, in his last sermon, was excessively harsh and imprudent (like Clauser in Isny) against the customs of our people. This sermon offended many, but also encouraged many who applaud such rustic sermons, to incite him further against the rich. I wish he had acted more modestly from the beginning - a virtue I greatly desire in him. Moreover, they almost daily entered the public inn (besides my table) to drink and feast. This will indeed cause a great loss of authority for all of us. Laurentius is also a stubborn man. Otherwise learned and pious. However, he has a thin or too sharp pronunciation. Romanus pleased our council because of his pronunciation and simple and open handling of themes.</p></div><div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22"><p>On September 29, we had a meeting at my house. Ten articles were presented to them, including the one on the Lord's Supper, although it was intricate; it was nevertheless received by them with a pious sense (in which article Musculus revealed himself to us as never before, openly denying both the carnal presence and any grace attached to the signs, so that some of the brothers, knowing that he thought differently a year ago, were astonished. Thus, I hope the Lord God will not entirely desert our cause. May God grant that it stands so in all churches in Germany! I wish and anxiously seek that these men do not destroy with their importunity what I have built up with much modesty, constancy, and patience). Thus they were received into our fellowship. Finally, the council decreed a stipend of 200 florins annually for them, on the condition that they now serve the churches in the city, as instructed by the lords, until they also instruct the rural churches once peace is restored. Then, if it seems good to them to send them elsewhere and appoint them to parishes of their dominion, they should not refuse to undertake this. They also requested to bind themselves to them according to a certain form, to which all others are bound. But since this was against and burdensome to them, and since this obligation was not exacted from me either, it was also left free for them. Finally, when they wished to return to Zurich to arrange their affairs, 30 florins were given to them by the Zurich lords, as you requested in your letter, which had been advanced to them for their journey to Augsburg. Each was also given an additional 20 florins. Furthermore, the lords reimbursed them for all expenses incurred either with me or in the inn. Thus we send them back to you, with the condition (for the lords strongly urge this) that they return here as soon as possible after settling their affairs and assist us in our labors.</p></div><div xml:id="div23" corresp="regest23"><p>I pour this into your bosom, so that you may not be unaware of how they have conducted themselves. I wish them well, and if I did not wish them well, I would not wish them to change their ways; therefore, do not indicate to them that I have written this to you. I have indeed promoted their affairs with as much diligence as I could, as the matter itself testifies.</p></div><div xml:id="div24" corresp="regest24"><p>Meanwhile, while they are with us, Lepusculus and Hieronymus Guntius also come from Basel, whose case, because they came later, is not yet finished. I will also write about what is being done with them later.</p></div><div xml:id="div25" corresp="regest25"><p>Yesterday, a man was to be executed. And as they were sitting in judgment, a fire broke out in my lords' foundry, where munitions, balls, etc., are made, and everything exploded, causing great damage. Five people are still missing today. It is not known whether they have disappeared or been burned. The execution of that capital case is reserved for tomorrow.</p></div><div xml:id="div26" corresp="regest26"><p>Just after I wrote this, a cry comes that there was another skirmish yesterday. I do not yet know the details. If I find out before their departure, I will add a little note.</p></div><div xml:id="div27" corresp="regest27"><p>The discord among the Swiss is most pernicious, not so much for them as for us. I wonder what those miserable people finally promise themselves, that they try to terrify kings and princes, indeed God Himself, with their grandiloquence. I also think that their measure will finally be filled. If they do not give the French a careless leave.</p></div><div xml:id="div28" corresp="regest28"><p>May God, the source of all comfort and peace, faithfully preserve His flock through Christ Jesus. He is the prow and stern! If He does not hold the wagon Himself, all our journey will go awry. The brothers greet you, Lepusculus, Xystus, Cellarius, Bernhardinus, and Musculus. Greet all the brothers who are with you most diligently and commend me to them faithfully. Augsburg, in the year of salvation 1546. Yours most devotedly, Johannes Haller.</p></div></body> This translation maintains the structure and content of the original letter, while translating the text into English.
