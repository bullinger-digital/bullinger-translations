    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks [for sending a book]. The Basel [theologians] are upset with the Bernese because they distance themselves from Bucer due to his "retractions"; requests information through Luzius Tscharner about the stance of the Zurichers on Bucer's letter [No. 939]. Greetings. A daughter of David Gladiator has just delivered a letter from Bullinger [to the Bernese pastors]; a response will follow later. With his "retractions," Bucer wants to push [the Swiss] towards a similar [reassessment of the doctrine of the Lord's Supper].</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>At the very hour when our assistant teacher was already prepared to set out towards Zurich, what you sent was delivered to me most gratefully. For all of which, I give thanks, not as much as I owe, but as much as I can.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new, except that we hear bad things from the Basel theologians, I don't know for what reasons related to Bucer's Retractions; for it seems they threaten us with having no further dealings with the man. I earnestly request that you inform us through Luzius Tscharner what you in Zurich will respond to the common letter of Bucer.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, fare well, and give my regards to Theodor, Bellicanus, Pindarus, Steiner, Beatus, and all the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 17, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Megander.</p>
      <p>As I seal this letter, my dear Bullinger, the daughter of David Gladiator has come, from whom I receive the letters you sent to us. It is not possible for me to respond to them at present. We will respond to everything later.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In summary: Bucer does not retract with any other intention than to make us all do the same, whether we want to or not.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger of Zurich, his singular friend.</p>
