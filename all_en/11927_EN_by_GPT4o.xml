    <p xml:id="regest1">Has almost completely read through Bullinger's commentary on John, also because his friend [Kaspar Cruciger] is likewise commenting on the Gospel of John and seeks his advice; Bullinger's [John] commentary is appropriate for the true church, beneficial, and stays close to the given content; urges Bullinger to continue to contribute to the church with pious, useful, and moderate publications. Saw in [Bullinger's commentary on] the Gospel of Matthew the passage about monogamy [on Mt 5:27-32; 19:3-12]; the dialogue [Johannes Lening's] in defense of polygamy ["Dialogus... whether it is... right to have more than one wife at the same time", also: "Dialogus Neobuli"] should not have been published; Melanchthon had expressed his opinion on this to the responsible parties before its release; silence on such errors in otherwise good people would be appropriate. Consensus and spiritual connection must not be destroyed; wants to strengthen the connection with Bullinger and asks for a response. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, whose letter to Markus [Crodel] he accidentally saw and intercepted, to not worsen the situation. Thanks to the printer [Christoph Froschauer] for the sent Bible ["Biblia sacrosancta"].</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I have examined and tasted much of what you have published. But I have almost completely read through your commentary on John. For since a certain friend of mine, who interprets John here, often discusses many opinions with me, I frequently return to your writing, consulting you as well. I love the church and have often felt that the judgments of the church must be greatly esteemed. Therefore, I compare the opinions of both the ancients and the moderns, so that I may hold and pass on the simple, native, and proper doctrine of the church. And I have often testified that your commentary pleases me, because it speaks the truth and is in harmony with the true church of God and is beneficial.</p>
      <p>Many interpreters of foreign works wander and stray so far from their authors that they say nothing or little relevant to the subject. Your commentary dwells on the proposed argument and illuminates it. Therefore, I thank you not only in my name for the book sent but also in the public name for the edition, and I encourage you to continue to deserve well of the church by publishing pious, useful, and moderate works.</p>
      <p>I saw in Matthew the passage about monogamy, and I defended it in public writings. It is useful and pious. And I wish the dialogue excusing polygamy had not been published, and I expressed my opinion to those responsible before its release. For it was of no benefit to stir up that hornet's nest. The matter should rather be buried in silence, and certain things should be forgiven to otherwise good and deserving men, and our evils should be gently mitigated.</p>
      <p>I ask the same of you regarding letters, if any are written from these regions that are more harsh by some, let us nevertheless maintain the consensus and connection of spirits among us and not allow our churches to be more divided. "The left hand," says Basil, "is not as necessary to the right as the concord of the teaching church." The zeal of the good is more easily kindled and maintained, and discipline of any kind can be defended with greater gravity if the teachers agree in teaching and are united by mutual goodwill. Therefore, as much as I can, I wish to strengthen our connection, not to dissipate it. I write these things with a simple and candid mind and ask you to write back about your will.</p>
      <p>I wish health to Lord Pellikan, my old friend, whose letter written to a certain Markus I happened to see and took to myself, not delivering it to Markus, lest fire be added to fire.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>On the 25th of March, on which 5504 years ago Adam was created, 1545 years ago Christ was conceived, and 1511 years ago Christ was crucified.</p>
      <p>I thank the printer for the sent Bibles. Philipp Melanchthon.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, outstanding in learning, virtue, and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, piously teaching the gospel in the church of Zurich, his friend.</p>
