      <p>Greetings. I am sending you, most distinguished man, the council canons you requested, in which you will indeed find many things not only absurd but also directly conflicting with the Holy Scriptures, which, however, have been deliberately inserted by Sagittarius the compiler, so that no one may lack faith and integrity, since it has been demonstrated almost visibly in the discussions of many up to now that everything from the times of the apostles to the council recently held at Trent has deviated in no small way. As for your request in your recent letter for my opinion on the summary of the councils, I do not find anything to respond with, as I do not willingly interpose my judgment in more serious matters, especially in judging the writings of others, in which each one exerts his strength according to his own talent and gift and provides an opportunity for the more learned to think higher. We clearly have no news, as far as I know; everything is so silent that many believe a truce has been made for a time between the Emperor and the French. Farewell with your whole family. November 18, Basel, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Konrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, true bishop of the church of Zürich, most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
