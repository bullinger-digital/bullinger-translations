      <p>Greetings. Although with the utmost gratitude and pious joy, most excellent man, I have received your letters full of love and duty through your present bearer and would wish in every way to be able to demonstrate in reality what dear Gervasius, dearest to me of all, has promised you about me with such full assurance, even though I fully acknowledge that I do not possess such learning nor those virtues and experience in medical matters, you should entirely persuade yourself that by this kind of duty and effort to adorn my dignity, both you and my most beloved co-father Gervasius have gained great favor with me, and I will show the most grateful willingness of my spirit whenever an opportunity arises, since I see that you have regard not only for my fortune and dignity but also for my soul and true salvation. However, many things still prevent me from accepting the most honorable and ample position you offer, nor is there any opportunity given to deliberate or decide anything certain in this matter due to the sudden departure of the courier, much less to respond to you. Indeed, I would not easily undertake such a function, for which I could hardly be suitable due to my advancing age and also the weakness of my body, and also because, as long as I can remain in my homeland with a good conscience, I have decided to await whatever the best and greatest God will kindly bestow. There are indeed many and very fierce threats from adversaries; but God, the avenger and liberator of the afflicted, can suppress all their weapons with a single word and preserve my courage and spirit, so that I would rather undertake any dangers upon myself than depart even a hair's breadth from true religion and sincere confession of faith. I wanted to respond to your request with this, so that you understand that willingness and readiness cannot be lacking in me, but there are other and indeed honorable reasons, some of which I have recounted, and some I am forced to omit due to the brevity of time. As for the remaining part of your letter, having carefully and diligently contemplated the fortune and course of those who practice our art in my mind, very few occur to me who are outstanding in age and experience, and perhaps even hardly one or two whom I think could be moved from their place. For in the last two years or so, many of the most renowned doctors of both the cities of NÃ¼rnberg and Ulm and Augsburg have died. There are indeed some young men with skill and learning, and who have been in Italy, who would not be contemptible; for they could have seen the practice of the art there. But perhaps more about these at another time. If I can in any way assist your most holy endeavors and serve you and dear Gervasius, especially the most ample senate of your city, with my modest means, I always offer myself most ready and willing.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man, and keep me, as you have begun, in your commendation. Hastily from our house in Memmingen, December 17, 1549.</p>
      <p>Ulrich Wolfhard.</p>
