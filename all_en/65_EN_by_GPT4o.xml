    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer has learned through a letter from Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz and personally from his wife [Anna, née Zehntmeier] about Bullinger's continuous support and does not know how to thank him appropriately (not to mention any compensation!). Blarer hopes that the two will show gratitude and will also admonish them to do so. After all, Schankwitz is a moody hothead, but he can be quickly appeased and accepts a Christian admonition.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Blarer would like to show his appreciation for Bullinger's extraordinary book gift [«Series et digestio temporum»], which is one of many proofs of his friendship and helpfulness. Since this has not been possible so far, he preserves his gratitude and will reciprocate Bullinger's active support in an appropriate manner as soon as an opportunity arises. Until then, Blarer prays for abundant and everlasting blessings for Bullinger and his family due to the multitude of Bullinger's benevolences. After the departure of Schankwitz's wife, who has been staying with him for several days and is quite burdensome, Blarer will devote himself with great pleasure to reading Bullinger's work!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Since the people of Constance are exposed to the arbitrariness of Emperor Charles V and King Ferdinand I, their situation has not improved, but rather worsened. May the people of Constance not lose the protective favor of Christ. When Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, was approached by a reliable man [N.N.] about the Constance [request for reconciliation], he announced that he would inform him of the imperial demands on Constance in seven or eight days. The people of Constance practice patience. May God grant a good outcome to the matter!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">In Augsburg, it is reported that Prince Philip II of Spain has landed in Genoa and is now not far from Augsburg, accompanied by Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, the Duke of Alba. Upon his arrival, he is to marry [Margaret of France], the sister of the French King Henry II.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Bullinger has undoubtedly received Blarer's last letter [18049 from March 3, 1548], which was to be delivered by the tutor of the sons of Junker Jakob Rordorf named Fischer, whose first name Blarer does not know. This letter also included a letter addressed to Bullinger from Hans Schöner [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">A letter that arrived in Constance states that the [Protestant] preachers in Augsburg were instructed to wear a choir robe in the church again and that a crucifix must be placed in every church. However, the preachers, led by Wolfgang Musculus, are said to resist these demands. May God ensure that the [Protestant] religion is preserved!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Greetings from Thomas Blarer, Konrad Zwick, and Blarer's family. Bullinger should include them in his prayers. Greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and all colleagues and acquaintances. Another greeting. Bullinger should fervently pray for the people of Constance!</p>

      <p>Saint Marcellus, through his letters, and his wife, in person, have praised your tireless efforts in assisting them so highly that I have no means to adequately express my gratitude for your kindness (not to mention reciprocate it!). However, I hope these people will prove themselves to you in such a way that you will never regret your tireless work. I will exhort them with all diligence and often to do so. Marcellus has, I confess, a somewhat irritable temperament and easily flares up in anger, but he is also easily appeased. In other respects, he is very pious: Even after such outbursts, he endures being admonished and reproved in a Christian manner.</p>

      <p>For your truly outstanding gift, which you wished to add to the many and various magnificent benefits you have previously bestowed upon me, I ought to express equally magnificent thanks. However, since I am now deprived of any opportunity to reciprocate your kindness, I will strive in every way to maintain a most grateful heart, so that I will seize the first opportunity that presents itself and not let it go until I have in some measure responded to your most generous munificence. Meanwhile, as I prepare for this, I will fervently pray to the most gracious Father in heaven through His Son Christ, that He may never cease to enrich you and all yours from the treasure of His blessing here, and then preserve you eternally. I will read with incredible pleasure, as soon as Marcellus's wife, who has been with me for several days and has been quite burdensome, departs.</p>

      <p>Our affairs are in no better condition than they were recently, perhaps even worse, as far as the minds of the Emperor and the King are concerned. May our King Christ grant that we never fall from His favor, by which alone we can be safe! Granvelle recently said to a good man in Augsburg, who spoke on our behalf, that he would inform him in seven or eight days about the state of our affairs and what is expected of us. Thus, we await this. May the dear God grant that it turns out well!</p>

      <p>It is said in Augsburg that the young prince from Spain has arrived in Genoa and is now not far from here with the Duke of Alba. When he arrives, he will be betrothed to the sister of the King of France.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I wrote to you through N. Fischer, the teacher of the boys at Rordorf. I have no doubt that you have already received those letters. I also sent a letter from Schöner addressed to you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>It is written here that the preachers in Augsburg have been asked to wear a choir robe in the church. Also, that a crucifix should be erected in every church. However, the preachers, especially Meuslin, are holding their ground very well. May the Lord God grant courage and grace that the cause of religion remains upright!</p>

      <p>My brother Thomas, Konrad Zwick, and my family send you their most diligent greetings and earnestly desire your powerful intercessions with the Lord. Greet your most holy wife with all the brothers and friends. Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother, and commend us to the Lord with your pious and diligent patronage. From Constance, on the Saturday before Laetare 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and by far most beloved brother of all.</p>
