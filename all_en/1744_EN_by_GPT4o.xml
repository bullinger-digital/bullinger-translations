      <p>My most illustrious Bullinger, I received your letters, which Aurelius brought to me. I thank you for writing to England about me. I am surprised that Morosinus has not arrived. The Cardinal or (as he says, you know whom I mean), the tyrant Turnonius has achieved as much with prayers and promises as my Italy will soon see; for I now serve that theater; I have already written a booklet about our conversation. Camillus has escaped, just as that greatest friend and brother of mine, Bullinger, prophesied, namely by denying those articles he was accustomed to sow, and now he lives securely in Raetia. My Venetians, when they heard that he was asserting our doctrine and had been granted Raetian citizenship, thought the man should be taken into account. There is reason for us to rejoice in this name: they are far more gentle and placable than Turnonius, whom I hear denied your people, etc. In Bergamo, six men (I do not say brothers) denied. Italy is not well, to say what is. I hear the Emperor is sending a certain Spaniard to the Duchy of Milan, who will be a companion of the empire to Ferrando Gonzaga. You will hear the rest from me in person; for after the assembly, I will come directly to you. Christ has invaded a new village through the ministry of the one who writes to you, and has cast out the papacy. Farewell and be well; pray for me. May the Lord Jesus bless your labors. Vicosoprano, 15th of October, 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To you, most illustrious Bullinger.</p>
