    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer received Bullinger's letter from November 20 [not received] only on December 5. The excellent Huldrych Zwingli the Younger brought back the [opinion against alliances with antichristian bishops and prelates] on his return journey from Augsburg and regretted very much that he had forgotten to deliver it on the way there. Blarer is now still expecting the return of the [copy of the letter from Elector Johann Friedrich I of Saxony and Landgrave Philipp of Hesse to the Council of Strasbourg]. The mayor of Zurich [Johannes Haab] will have had enough time [to read the letter]. - There is nothing to report about the [Second Regensburg] religious discussion and the [Schmalkaldic] Diet in Frankfurt, to which [Thomas] Blarer was sent. They are waiting hourly for the return of Thomas Blarer or a letter from him. As before, nothing is to be expected from this religious discussion. Blarer hopes that God will forgive [the Protestants] their naivety and that they will become wiser. - Allegedly, Emperor [Charles V] and [King Francis I] want to help Duke [Charles III] of Savoy regain his dominion. Blarer expects a report from Bullinger on this as well as on the governor of Milan [Alfonso d'Avalos], because [in Konstanz] they only know what is being told these days about the machinations of the Emperor, [Francis I] and the Pope [Paul III]. - A relative [...] writes that [Duke Henry] of Brunswick almost escaped the Landgrave recently. Blarer is worried that he is dealing so leniently with the [Duke]. How much do [the Protestants] lack wisdom, steadfastness, and repentance! May they not bring divine punishment upon themselves! - Greetings from [Konrad] Zwick and Jakob Funcklin. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], and [Rudolf] Gwalther. - [P.S.:] The doctor [Johann Jakob] Menlishofer the Younger has just come from the sick [Christoph] von Landenberg, who was told that the Bishop of Bremen, [Christoph von Braunschweig], had arrested the Landgrave while hunting. Blarer hopes that this is just an invention.</p>

      <p>S. On December 5th, I received the letter you wrote on November 20th; otherwise, I would have relieved you of your concern sooner, my venerable Bullinger. The excellent young man, the excellent son of an excellent father, Huldrych Zwingli the Younger, returned from Augsburg and faithfully delivered the opinion on alliances, greatly regretting that he had forgotten to deliver it on his way there. But it is well, as I have received it, albeit late. I am expecting you to return the other letter written by the Saxon to the people of Strasbourg, especially since I do not doubt that your mayor has had enough time with it.</p>
      <p>There is nothing to report about the colloquy here. Regarding the Diet in Frankfurt, to which my brother was sent on behalf of our council, we have received just as much. However, we are expecting either my brother himself or a letter from him at any moment. These colloquies will yield the same fruit for us as they have so far. You might more accurately call such attempts by the adversaries betrayals rather than efforts to seek the truth.</p>
      <p>I hope the Lord will easily forgive the candor and simplicity of our people (for that is how it seems to be interpreted), but in such a way that they are somewhat recalled to a more solid prudence in handling these matters in the future.</p>
      <p>It is said that the Emperor and the French King are inclined to lend a helping hand to the Duke of Savoy so that he may recover his dominion. But you know these matters far better than I do, as well as what this Marquis of Milan is plotting; I am expecting your letters on this matter. Here, there is nothing at all beyond the usual rumors about the Emperor's, the French King's, and the Pope's machinations that we should write to you about. A certain relative of mine wrote here that it was almost the case that the Duke of Brunswick escaped the Landgrave in these days; we are so negligent and indifferent in holding onto the greatest benefits of our God. I greatly fear that such leniency towards such a ferocious beast might not be good for the Landgrave, and I greatly fear that perhaps his soul might be exchanged for this one's soul by the just judgment of the Lord. Ah, how much wisdom, how much steadfastness, how much courage, and finally, how much skill in rightly administering the Christian republic is lacking in our people, and how much repentance worthy of those who profess the Gospel!</p>
      <p>If these were present, we would soon see a far different face of affairs. Let us therefore pray to the Lord that He may happily clothe both them and us with His power from on high, so that we may act and endure all things in such a way, and so recognize His supreme kindness towards us, that we do not pay the just penalties for such great ingratitude, but rather, by our good conduct, vigorously propagate His kingdom and appear worthy to Him, whom He may graciously admit into a share of the heavenly seats.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother, and commend me most diligently to Christ, as I know you do. All of ours greet you and hope and desire to be helped by your faithful patronage with the Lord, especially Zwick and Jakob Funcklin with the others. May your household be well with the excellent and venerable brothers Pellikan, Theodor, Gwalther, etc. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, December 24, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>Now our young doctor Menlishofer, the physician, comes from Stoffel von Landenberg, who is now sick. While the doctor was there, news came that the Bishop of Bremen had captured the Landgrave in his own land while hunting; but I hope it is all just fabrication: It cannot be spread throughout the land. However, those who strongly wish it to be so, gladly affirm it to be done and easily persuade their own to believe it.</p>
      <p>May God have better things in store for us. May He preserve you for us perpetually, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
