Joachim [Maler] is expected back from the Ulm [City] Day; the opponents hope to achieve their goal through Emperor [Charles V], but God will not abandon His cause.

      <p>Greetings, my venerable Bullinger, brother as dear to me as my own heart.</p>
      <p>Joachim Mötteli, the brother-in-law of my brother-in-law Heinrich von Ulm, desires a minister of the gospel of Christ for his village of Pfyn and has asked me to write to you, so that through your assistance, a pious and moderately learned person may be appointed to that church.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I implore and beseech you, as much as I can, to perform this duty for my sake and, if someone suitable for this task seems to you to be present there, to send him to Mötteli with this letter, thereby doing a most welcome service to him and to me, but especially to the many sheep of Christ he has there. There is nothing else I have to write.</p>
      <p>We are awaiting the return of our envoy Joachim from the Ulm City Day, to see what our people have decided in the matters of Christ. The adversaries are coming into great hope that they can now, with the Emperor's assistance, successfully achieve what they have been striving for many years. Our most solid comfort is that hearts, efforts, and the success of efforts are in God's hand, who has never failed His most excellent cause, no matter how bad we may be. Commend us to Christ.</p>
      <p>Greet all those excellent men who labor diligently and tirelessly in the Lord's vineyard. All of ours greet you, especially our Zwick, who is now suffering greatly from one knee; may Christ soon restore him to us and to our church with great benefit. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, May 22.</p>
      <p>We do not doubt that you have already received those documents we sent through Michael, your Hebrew; we ask you to return them as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Antistes of the Church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed and beloved brother. Zurich.</p>
