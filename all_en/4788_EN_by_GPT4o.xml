      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Last Friday I also wrote. Since then, letters have come from France and a cry that several pious believers have been murdered by the papists in one day, and Cardinal Castiglione barely escaped; for he is also said to be favorable to the gospel. Now there are over 60 people at the king's court, complaining about the murders and calling for justice. The king's council has sent 200 horsemen to punish the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>May God will it so.</p>
      <p>The king was supposed to be crowned today, May 11, in Reims; he wanted to travel there, but he learned that some troops had secretly entered the city and 13 barrels with firearms had been brought there. Because of this, the king's council changed their plan and decided that he should be crowned without delay at Saint-Denis and then ride into Paris. May God grant much grace.</p>
      <p>Given in haste, May 11, 1561.</p>
