      <p>Greetings. You are undoubtedly wondering why I have not written; there is only one reason, which is that due to the weakness and pain in my right hand, I have barely been able to write a letter for almost fifteen days. The main things I could and should write are these: 1. To return to you the Rhaetian history, which I now send back through Mr. Albin's son, the prefect of Lausanne, whom I had previously recommended to you in the name of his father and our Samuel Telamon, while he was still alive; for he was born of Telamon's sister; 2. To inform you about Mr. Steiger's wine; for we fear that an error has been made, since you write that another barrel from those that were to be sent to Glarus has been sent to the governor Häßi. Mr. Steiger does not know there, nor do I know, whether it is that Fridolin Häßi, who recently acted as prefect of Baden from the people of Glarus, or another; for the barrel belonged to that Fridolin, who also paid Mr. Steiger 18 crowns for it, as he himself says. We have no doubt left about the barrel of Schuler. Therefore, please, free us from this concern. As for the rest, we have nothing very special. We have not heard anything from Dauphiné and La Rochelle for several days.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor, which I still do not believe, that two cities near Burgundy and on the borders of Germany have been occupied by the Huguenots, San Desir and Langres. Our envoys have not yet returned from Baden; they might bring some news. Today, both envoys, the French and the Spanish, have arrived here; I do not know what they are planning.</p>
      <p>Some nobles from the French refugees, who are now nesting in these lands, have obtained from the king the concession of their properties and incomes on the condition that they swear in the presence of the royal envoy to our senate that they will not undertake anything hostile against the king, but will live peacefully in these lands. Some have done this; but many others are now separating themselves from these and do not want to bind themselves in this way and think that these are not faithful enough towards their brothers. So there is always something to do. May God improve things everywhere! I will write more when I am better.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Give my regards to all friends and brothers, especially those who are yours. Ours collectively greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 11, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
