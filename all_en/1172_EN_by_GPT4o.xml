      <p>Greetings. I am sending back through these men of proven faith what you recently sent, my venerable Bullinger, dearest brother in Christ Jesus, and I give the greatest thanks that you did not wish to deprive me of that pleasure, which I conceived from the delightful variety of these matters, even though there are also things in them that rightly cause us pain. What you said about the Council of Trent, you spoke truly, prudently, and learnedly, and if only those who should understand these things for the sake of the whole Church of Christ would understand them. But they are as dull and more than stony towards these matters as towards all the truth of Christ, so that you can hope for nothing here, but can only implore the one heavenly Father through Christ the Son, that He may shorten these evil days, indeed worse than the worst, and graciously deliver us with all His children. As for me, I easily gather that the time of my resolution is at hand, for the Lord has also called my little son in these days, so that he might follow his little sister to the glory of immortality, lest I leave these dearest pledges after me in this most corrupt age not without great anguish of soul. Therefore, my soul, strive to obtain for me that one thing from the author of life, our Christ, with supplicating and faith-filled prayers, that with the eyes of my mind fixed and intently focused on the heavenly light, I may fear no evil through this dark and deadly valley of death, especially as I am lifted onto the shoulders of the best shepherd, Christ, as a wandering sheep indeed, but still His own, who may bravely defend me against all those terrors of death and Satan and the horrors innate to nature, and give me courage, so that, just as in reality these things are now nothing but empty phantoms after Christ's triumph, I may truly believe and feel them to be so, entrusting myself entirely to that one Christ, who by the power of His life-giving resurrection has long since crushed Satan under our feet, to whom be honor and glory in eternal ages. Amen.</p>
      <p>I sent your letters to my Scherer, to whom you have done a most pleasing thing, I know, in this regard, and I myself rejoice that your opinion agrees in all respects with mine, which I previously sent to him, and indeed it wonderfully harmonizes.</p>
      <p>I write nothing about rumors, since both they and the letters that are written vary so much that I am quite doubtful in mind as to which should be given the most credence. That Bufler from Isny promises to write to me soon with certainty; when that happens, I will ensure that you also learn of it as soon as possible. Farewell, my most esteemed and excellent Bullinger, with your whole household and all brothers, fellow ministers, and friends, by whose most faithful patronage I both desire and hope that my departure will be commended to the Father of mercies in every way. If the Lord transfers me, grant me this even after my death, that you diligently strengthen my excellent wife with your consolations and raise her into the good hope of soon following to eternal salvation. February 9, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours truly, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Bullinger, his soul's companion.</p>
