      <p>Greetings. Your Muraltus, or rather ours as well, is returning to you. His work has benefited many. Haller, the treasurer, who especially made use of him and had him in his home, is now much better than before, although he still cannot stand or walk.</p>
      <p>Michael Augspurger, a senator and former treasurer of the new province, a good and wise man, has recently passed away. Yesterday, by the grace of the Lord, that very serious and dangerous dispute was amicably settled, which was between the Duke of Namur and the Marchioness of Longueville, about which I think you have already heard. The County of Neuchâtel has been equally inherited by both parties. The Duke is a young prince, dissolute, heavily in debt, having borrowed equally from Fribourg and those from Solothurn, Lucerne, and Fribourg, and is also papist, hoping to bring the gospel back out of Neuchâtel through him. Many secret dealings have taken place. The lady, on the other hand, is well connected to my lords and has been here for well over two months, not unfavorable to religion, having invested much to ensure that the county remains hers, so that she may have a refuge from France there. Now the people of Neuchâtel have an old legal claim from the princes that the lordship should never be divided, and if a division were to occur, then my lords should be the judges, so that one part of the government is assigned and the other is redeemed. This has now come to pass, therefore they have been judged here, and the ducal party has strongly resisted, as the backs are (...) and (...) from other places. Thus, after long negotiations, it was settled yesterday without a formal judgment and accepted by both parties, and the county remains with the princess and her son, and the Duke will still receive 25,000 crowns, despite 32,000 crowns being owed, which the princess takes upon herself. And my lords are very glad that the matter has been brought to this point; for a bad outcome was to be feared.</p>
      <p>With Geneva, it goes as it has for a long time; the Pandects have attacked the Genevans, the Genevans have rightly defended themselves. Before the bailiff of Terni, it is a wild dispute, the old matter is all in court. The Pandects demand that the Genevans show that their judgments are just, which they have made against them and those they have judged. The Genevans believe that as the high authority they are not obliged to do so before a bailiff as a lower judge, to whom they are not subject, and thus it drags on longer and longer, so that I fear a bad outcome. May God turn it away in grace.</p>
      <p>We have heard nothing yet about the assembly of princes held in Frankfurt. If it were safe to write, I would gladly know what gift Consul Habius brought back from Burgundy and how much was granted to him by the senate. I ask this not without reason. The English have been given a place in Verviers, and unless the difficulty of access hinders them, I think they will all go there and establish a church. However, some families may remain in Aarau. This is what I had to inform you of now. I await your letters and hope we will learn something certain about the affairs of Italy from them. Farewell. May all yours be safe.</p>
      <p>All of ours, and especially my household, send their diligent greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 20, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed and respected lord and compatriot.</p>
