      <p>S. I understand that a day has been appointed in Zürich, where your Tetrapolis will deliberate on giving a response to the people of the Alpine regions.</p>
      <p>This plan is very pleasing to me, and I trust that the grace of the Lord will inspire it, so that it will finally be sound, pious, and worthy of the worshippers of Christ. There, I earnestly ask you, to ensure that the interests of the allies are not neglected, nor should the matter be conducted in such a way that we seem excluded or divided. Let charity unite those whom Christ has joined and has also tested together in more than one kind of trial. It will be your integrity to act diligently and not to omit any faithful duty, from which, having observed and learned about it, I promise myself everything. I am sending the letters of Georg Laetus, which he earnestly requested to be delivered to you. You will understand what he wants; if you are going to write back, send it to me, so that he may receive your response through a certain messenger, and indeed soon. Farewell, and whatever you think concerns us, please communicate it to me in your faithful manner.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, on the Nones of November, very quickly, in the year 1548. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his own. In Zürich.</p>
