      <p>S. You will forgive me, dear brother, for returning your brother's writings just as I received them. I can do nothing now, as I am forced to interrupt many other things; my strength, weakened by illness or daily sickness, is failing. If I could do anything, I would prefer to devote it to sacred sermons and other matters pertaining to my ministry, and finally to the response to Brentius's book written against Martyr and me about impious matters. He spreads many and indeed impious doctrines in it.</p>
      <p>He titled it "On the Majesty of Our Lord Jesus Christ". You have undoubtedly seen it; if you have not seen it, it is worth seeing.</p>
      <p>In the old church, he would have long since been struck down by the faithful ministers of Christ; now many seem to be more asleep than is good for the church, etc. I return the bundle; I have only read the preliminary letter; from there I judge the rest and know that your brother, endowed as he is with learning, prudence, and piety, will do nothing rashly. However, how these can be sent to the prince, who is called Ludwig, not Wilhelm, - for I have his own handwriting with me; for this year he sent me letters -, I cannot easily say.</p>
      <p>It cannot be done through Geneva; they rarely have messengers to the prince now, indeed they hardly know what is happening with the prince, because the roads are beset; if they have anything, they have it from Lyon. However, it would be pleasing to first send it to Beza; but he is now following the camp.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing certain from France.</p>
      <p>It is indeed written about the Guise being driven out with slaughter from Ã‰tampes and Corbeil and now both armies being in Paris and negotiating peace. Whether these are true, I cannot say; for there is such a license to lie that I am reluctant to write about these things. In Frankfurt, the princes obtained nothing from Ferdinand; he says he wants to maintain the peace of the empire, but to die in his religion and to maintain and govern his hereditary lands as before; they should leave him unconcerned with the doctrine and faith, etc. The princes have made themselves infamous with immoderate and shameful luxury.</p>
      <p>Such are the times, such are the men, that I often remember: "O Lord, into what times have you allowed me to come?" Farewell. December 18.</p>
      <p>May Matthias, the brother, be safe with his goods.</p>
      <p>Most hastily.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer, residing in Winterthur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Winterthur.</p>
