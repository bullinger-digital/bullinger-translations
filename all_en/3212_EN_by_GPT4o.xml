      <p>Grace from God the Father through Christ the Savior, etc. We have read your letters, Bullinger, dearly beloved. From which we have understood that the spirits of the Lutherans are more than excessively exasperated. We indeed hoped that after Luther's death they would become much calmer and more peaceful in spirit. The opposite happened, undoubtedly because divine providence is thus moderating, by which our spirits are tested, whether they will remain steadfast or not. However, as far as your judgment is concerned, it is not displeasing what you have proposed. This, however, would be especially pleasing to my brothers and fellow ministers, that the Basel Confession be offered to the princes at the next Frankfurt assembly. For we hope that in this way either the benevolent churches will be given the opportunity to judge better about us and our churches, or that all occasion for the malevolent to rage against us will be removed. We certainly hope that in the future their fury will become more subdued.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that His churches may agree well among themselves and that this sole opportunity, in which the adversaries glory, may be cut off, so that truth alone may triumph(?).</p>
      <p>My fellow ministers greet you. You will also greet all the brothers in the name of all of us as courteously as possible. May the Lord preserve you safe for His church for a long time.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, June 14, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the uniquely esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, with singular piety and learning, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
