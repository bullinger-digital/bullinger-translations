      <p>S. D. I am glad that the letters of Dr. Erastus were delivered to your excellence in time, most illustrious man; for I wish to prove not only these but also much greater services to both of you, if it is within my power. I received your letters upon returning from Montbéliard and I give you the greatest thanks I can, for in this age of yours and in such a gathering of studies and occupations, which I hear have detained you for many years, you do not hesitate to correspond with an obscure man through letters. Indeed, since the religious observance of well-deserving elders of the church has always been dear to me, it cannot but be of the greatest importance what proceeds from you and your likes. I presented your letters to our president to be read; he ordered that I should reverently wish you all good things in his words.</p>
      <p>I also think you have been informed there about the visitation of Montbéliard, in which I had to participate by the mandate of my prince and Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg, in the month of June. The cause of it was the same as the previous year, namely the dissension of the ministers of the word concerning the matter of the Eucharist, the analysis of Christ and omnipresence. It grieved greatly the discord, which suspicions and rivalry have hitherto nourished in some. But it was pleasant that the doctrine taught by Peter Tossanus of blessed memory for many years was equally loved and cherished by both the whole church and the councilors of Count Friedrich. Many things were piously and fairly said about the mystery of the supper. A summary of the ministers, matters, eaters, and mouth was extensively delivered by me. I embrace many things in a few words. I discussed publicly and privately with the French brothers about the person of Christ, about the truth of the human nature in Christ against the dogma of ubiquity. I had as colleagues Master Balthasar Bidembach (whom I do not know if I satisfied) and our Dr. Sulcer, who, however, came later than advised by my letters and did not proceed with us to Reichenweier.</p>
      <p>Efforts were made so that no one would be moved from their place, nor would there be a place for teaching either ubiquity or other strange and different doctrines. We advised the dissenters to cultivate peace by forgiving each other. I hope that the one who has hitherto insisted so much on the cold and oral (as they call it) eating along with the ubiquitarian cabbage will be transferred elsewhere, where his ministry may be more fruitful than in Montbéliard. If in his place a lover of peace as well as truth is substituted, the church will be tranquil, as I hope.</p>
      <p>I hear that your excellence has the letters of Simon Grynaeus of blessed memory written on very serious matters.</p>
      <p>If they do not contain certain particulars and secrets, I wish to read them and add them to the other writings of that man. I therefore pray that your excellence does not hesitate to make them available to me; I do not know if I can promise a gift in return that is equivalent. I would have written to Master Rudolf Gwalther if I knew the visit would be welcome and if there had been time for this courier already prepared for the journey; nevertheless, I pray for the health of him and Master Simler and Dr. Wilhelm Stucki, my old companion, and your other colleagues, masters to be honored by me, from Christ. I think I will have to go to the court of my prince in the name of the synod within a few days, and then, if permission is granted, I will meet Dr. Erastus.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend man. 16th day before the calends of September in Rötteln of the Margraves of Baden.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johann Jakob Grynäus.</p>
      <p>I send a copy of the theses, about which we are dealing in our theological disputations, which I hope will not be unwelcome to you, a veteran and retired soldier of Christ, as a specimen of my apprenticeship.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in piety, merits, and doctrine, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed master.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
