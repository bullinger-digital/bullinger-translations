      <p>Be well. I received your letter yesterday, dated February 24th, which, as usual, was most delightful to me. I see that you have heard about the tumult that Satan has stirred up against the gospel in the Valtellina. Know, my dear Bullinger, that such a sight has never been seen in all of Raetia in any memory, and it is not yet settled. Nine commissioners, about whom I had written, arrived yesterday. Meanwhile, I am staying in Chiavenna for serious reasons until they resolve matters there. The entire papacy now openly opposes me with the same engines as once did the king's envoy, Hammonius, whom you know. It is the cause of God and Christ. But if we win now, a great door and great windows will be opened for the gospel. May the Lord do what is good in His eyes. I received those very copious letters you wrote about, both of them; for which I give you immense thanks. As for the affairs of Italy, I have nothing to write.</p>
      <p>The Viceroy of Naples has died; the Marquis of Marignano, who is also Medici, that very arch-enemy of my Raetian lords, has been appointed not in the administration of the kingdom, but in leading the army. I hear nothing about Siena; arms were prepared for the siege, but they had not yet reached the walls. I know that Laelius is in his homeland; for now, the inquisitors are not allowed to rage, although he lives there not without great danger, as he is accustomed to speak freely about the unseen Christ.</p>
      <p>Among us, there is a growing rumor of a huge army from all of Germany, led by Maurice, against the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>Oh, happy is that prince if he undertakes such a province! By my faith, even the women will come and bring help to crush that most hideous beast. One would hardly believe what kind of support and applause he would find in Italy, especially if he brought with him some preachers who would freely proclaim the holy gospel of Jesus Christ in our language. What eruptions of people and what gifts you would see from all the cities! If only Maurice would listen to me speaking about preparing for such a war! But in the meantime, may God stir and inflame him with His spirit.</p>
      <p>The Turkish fleet wintered near Modon and Coron. Do not doubt that it will sail in April and invade Sicily or Apulia. For this reason, that most cruel tyrant has borne infinite expenses throughout the winter.</p>
      <p>Everyone confirms that the Pope is playing both sides, sometimes these, sometimes those; the most holy devil is faithful to no one. It was heard about the kingdom of Poland that the Roman harlot had been repudiated. I beg you, write to me diligently if you have any certain news about it, and also what you hear about the diet being prepared within the empire's states; Mecchard wrote to me that it will be announced shortly. So much for the dead, now for the living. The churches under Venetian rule almost have peace; and the harvest of the gospel grows widely. I know you eagerly await this news with open mouth, since the glory of God is so dear to your heart. An Italian book against Occhino has been published, authored by that very Mucius who wrote against me. Pure slaughter; he shouts that we deny the scripture and the apostles, a foolish and shameless man. After Easter, I hope to come to you with the intention that you will then hear from me. So far, I do not think I have undertaken any journey more useful for the cause of Christ. See if I have satisfied you with my writing; take it kindly if it is inept. Farewell and be well with your whole family, school, and church, as I am accustomed to say. May the Lord bless your labors. Pray for me, who die daily in these regions and in such great rage of the Antichristians. Chiavenna, March 10, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius, brother.</p>
      <p>The tetrastich about that giant who could neither subdue a maiden nor a harlot pleased me. But if only he would undertake the province of subduing the Roman harlot! For this stinking one will easily be defiled. Camillus still reigns; for the matter depends on the people of Chur, who seem to me to neglect such a great matter; I write to you freely.</p>
      <p>[To] Bullinger.</p>
