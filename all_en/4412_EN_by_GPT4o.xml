      <p>Greetings. Your letter (reverend father in Christ) has affected me in various ways, and I wish that in our afflicted and troubled circumstances we could find some harbor! But the same thing that sustains you also sustains me: namely, that the fury of the enemies is like the fire of thorns, which indeed erupts suddenly with great noise, but immediately dissipates into smoke. The adversaries have attempted such things many times over the past 30 years, even when their power was greater; but they have been disgracefully disappointed in their hopes more than once. May the will of the Lord be done, who, in the station he has assigned to us, may grant us to be fearless and invincible by his Holy Spirit! What that master of a thousand schemes is plotting, I do not know. Balinggetus affirms that the day before yesterday, four cardinals passed through Burgundio (a region where there are iron mines), among whom the chief is said to be the pope's legate. Certainly, as far as I know, they have been seen by no one here.</p>
      <p>Unless, therefore, they are secretly hiding with the bishop (which I do not believe); for it is certain that this pope is ill-disposed towards us, and those from Emps did not conceal certain things instituted against him in Rome.</p>
      <p>For when they passed through here and the bishop did not extend any kind of courtesy to them, they were greatly offended, and such words escaped them. Moreover, there is a very close connection between the Bishop of Constance and ours, so that by the favor and intercession of the Bishop of Constance, ours was not only elevated to this rank (for MÃ¤tzler is here as a canon, but also defended at Trent against some on the grounds that he negligently attended to religion and conceded too much to the Lutherans) unless they are hiding here, which I do not think, as you hear, for they would want to do all this secretly from us if they are attempting anything like that, they went straight to Constance and passed through Chur quickly. These men, without a doubt, equipped with apostolic authority, will be present at every action. - As for our affairs, know this: we have not moved at all, but we did not want to let the present opportunity slip from our hands, nor should we have. For we are instructing our people to the best of our ability and the grace given to us, and urging them to pursue what is honorable, pious, and useful for the country and the church, nor is there any reason to fear that we are being hasty. There is so much corruption among us, so many clandestine practices now instituted against the gospel, that unless we wake up, all will be lost. But these things are in the hand of the Lord, who deigns to use us, vessels of his mercy, as instruments. Now the greater part of the citizens are good, the two consuls are the worst of all, which you would never have believed of one of them, although their words are sweeter than honey in the meantime.</p>
      <p>But such are most of those in other places who are in charge, which you would by no means think they do for free. One can paint the matter in another color, and if the Roman pontiff gives it, it can be given through another hand, nor is there any reason to think we are suffering from a sinister suspicion. I wish these things were not too true! Nor does that old man, about whom I wrote, act according to his prudence, so that he consults for peace and quiet; but he consults for his own advantage, looks out for himself and his own. They will not let go of the milk cows.</p>
      <p>But I only have the acts of the Vesprona community at hand now; however, a boy copied them, so that they can be read. From this, you can somewhat understand what is going on.</p>
      <p>And indeed, in Vesprona, several men of senatorial rank, whom I had hitherto found nothing more slippery, openly defended the bishop's side; but their opinion, which is stronger and better, prevailed. Therefore, the die is now cast.</p>
      <p>May God govern the rest, who is also to be prayed to, that he may be present with us and direct this whole matter, whatever it is, to the benefit of his church.</p>
      <p>I now come to those things that greatly disturb me: that my sweetest homeland should be stripped of such great lights, that good men should be driven from their seats and pursue a poor and wandering life with their wives and children, while in the meantime the church is prey to the lust of a few. Who can speak of such things without tears? But consult, my father, consult for the afflicted and desperate circumstances and extend a hand to the distressed. Your learning, piety, and authority are so great that, next to God, hope rests on you alone. But what is Zurich doing in such a crowd of expectants, in such a number of foreigners, not to mention envy? What hope indeed shines for us, you remember hearing from me before; I dare not call anyone, since the inconstancy and avarice of the peasants are so great. There are indeed small benefices vacant among us; but a decent man can hardly have the bread. For 50, 60, or at most 70 florins, we dare not invite anyone; but if Jacob Milyagrius or another would like to leave his wife and child in Zurich and come up for a visit and experience the matter himself, we would do as much as possible to help, as is in our power. However, you would also have to write to Dr. Philipp, for I write this of my own accord. I do not doubt that we could help Dr. Jacob in the meantime at Davos. This could well happen if he were in the country for half a year and became a little known; for some Davosers have been here with me and indicated that the current one is not suitable for them; for he is an unlearned man. I write this with the best intentions.</p>
      <p>I would like to advise and help to the best of my ability, and if my household were in better condition, I would extend from my own. But it cannot reach anywhere; I have more than enough to deal with myself.</p>
      <p>But if Dr. Jacob or another wants to come up, stay here for a day or 14, he shall have lodging with me; for it is the custom that the communities are only found together on Sundays, and a prospective pastor must first preach before anything is finally decided or concluded.</p>
      <p>But an exile must endure until it gets better. Dr. Fridericus a Salice wrote to me, adding that it is commonly reported that Duke Palianus and Cardinal Carafa have been executed. Besides, he has nothing new; I send the letters to you.</p>
      <p>I return all your things at once and have immortal thanks. It was reported from France that on August 20th all the estates were to convene to deliberate on the state of the kingdom and religion; but from yours, I understand that there is not so much hope. However, if these assemblies have their effect, as is certainly affirmed, there is not entirely no hope; for this is precisely what Cardinal Lorraine was anxiously trying to prevent in his letters to the pope. But the common saying comes to mind: If the world were as full of demons as it is of worms, we would not fear anxiously; we will still conquer bravely.</p>
      <p>But enough of this for now.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to God, that he may be present with the struggling church and protect us.</p>
      <p>May he also keep you safe and sound with your most honorable wife and your whole family! Chur, August 26, in the year of our Lord 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
