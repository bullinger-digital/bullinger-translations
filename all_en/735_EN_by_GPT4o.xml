      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed teacher in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letter, most distinguished man, and likewise our most esteemed teacher in the Lord, dated October 1st, we finally received on the 24th of the same month, along with a copy of your Consensus on the sacramental matter. If I seem to respond later than you expected, I ask you to consider my delay justified for two reasons. First, because your letter was delivered to us later than it should have been. Secondly, because we did not immediately have a reliable messenger at hand to whom we could safely entrust the copy of your Consensus to be returned to you. Therefore, please consider this delay of ours with understanding and goodwill.</p>
      <p>The points of your Consensus on the sacramental matter were not only read and transcribed by Mr. Jacob Wirbenius and I. Leopoldus, my fellow ministers and dearest brothers in Christ, and together with them, I also read and transcribed them, but we also presented them to the other brothers serving Christ in the field of our republic of Biel/Bienne. We believe this will not displease you, especially since we did this with a special zeal for promoting piety. These men have so far taught their churches orthodoxly with us, not only in the doctrine of the sacraments but also in all other articles of our holy religion. Therefore, why should those excellent men regret their illustrious constancy in the truth they have received and persevered in for so many years? We thought it should not be concealed from them, this agreement of yours on the sacramental matter made with Mr. Calvin and Farel: especially since Calvin's writings, both in French and Latin, are more familiar to them, partly because of the proximity to Neuchâtel and partly because of the language exchange, than yours, which they rarely have access to. We therefore believe that they will be more confirmed in their old opinion on the sacraments in the future, the more supporters and advocates they have, especially Calvin and Farel, to whom they have always given much weight.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as you ask for our judgment on your Consensus on the sacramental matter, you indeed impose a serious and difficult task on us. For how could we, unlearned and inexperienced, presume to judge the judgment of the greatest minds? But here I recognize, most excellent Bullinger, your Christian modesty, by which, like the Apostle Paul, you acknowledge that the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. Therefore, as you wish, we will briefly present to you our judgment on that agreement of yours.</p>
      <p>We are very pleased with it, not only because it is consistent with canonical scripture, but also because it is concise, solid, sincere, simple, plain, and clear. It is also commendable to us because its points were compiled in order by Calvin himself and sent to us from Geneva. For we believe that in this way, all evasion is precluded in the future. Not that I believe Calvin will ever change his constancy and faith, but because I hope that by the authority of this, some of our people will either never again dare to oppose and bark against our doctrine of the sacraments, or will defend their opinion and error less boldly. For what would the wretched, deprived of such a great champion, dare against the truth in the future? Why do I delay with many words? We only regret that one thing is missing from your Consensus, partly because it is not printed, so that it could be handled by as many people as possible and could not be adulterated by anyone in the future, and partly because Calvin did not initiate this mutual discussion with us many years ago. For in this way, either many churches would never have been vexed and torn apart by those sacramental controversies, or they would have been freed from them earlier, making less loss both in piety and in their salvation. Certainly, Bucer alone, without this Theseus, would not have easily persuaded so many churches in Switzerland of his error. For Calvin had and still has such a reputation for learning and piety among all the Swiss churches that no one would easily dare to introduce any new doctrine to our churches with him dissenting.</p>
      <p>But in this case, we will now follow the proverb which says that what is done well is done quickly enough. We therefore congratulate both ourselves and other pious people everywhere that he, who has always been considered an opponent of our opinion on the sacraments, has declared with the clearest and most splendid exposition that he has always been, and now is, and will be in the future, a defender and protector of it. We also give immortal thanks to God the best and greatest, that through the blessed memory of Zwingli and through you and other pious and learned men, He has preserved His truth inviolate and unblemished against so many monsters.</p>
      <p>You testify not only by your letters but also by many other proofs that you love us and our church. We earnestly ask you to continue doing so. We, in turn, love you and the church of Zürich sincerely and steadfastly. And because we cannot demonstrate our goodwill towards you by other services due to the modesty of our abilities and strength, we will at least show our gratitude to you by our constant prayers for you before the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man, together with all your fellow ministers, whom I greet in my name and in the name of my brothers. May the Lord keep you safe for the advancement of His church.</p>
      <p>Given in Biel/Bienne, November 10th, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Michael Schlatter.</p>
