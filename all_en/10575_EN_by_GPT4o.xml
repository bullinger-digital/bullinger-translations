    <p xml:id="regest1">People from the community of Dörflingen report to him that armed forces from Nellenburg-Austria have attacked their village and abducted seven residents to Stockach as suspected Anabaptists; however, the action is directed against the Reformation. The people of Dörflingen complain that they have received too little support from Zurich in enforcing the Reformation - especially during the tenure of the bailiff [Jakob] Günthard; they now wish to be assigned the reformed church "Kirchberg" located near Büsingen. They ask Bullinger to support their cause.</p>

      <p>May the kind and gracious, merciful, eternal God grant us all His blessing through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Faithful, dear lord and brother, I have come to write to you about this matter concerning some well-meaning people of our holy faith, who are involved in this matter, so that you may learn how, with divine help and the support of our Christian lords and superiors, the community of this part may come to assistance. It is as follows: On our borders beyond the Rhine lies a village named Dörflingen, located in the lordship of Neuenburg, where the lordship holds the higher court and our lords the lower. The people of Dörflingen belong to the church in Gailingen, where the higher and lower courts are under the lordship of Stockach, and the church patronage belongs to the city of Schaffhausen. Now, the honest people of Dörflingen have followed the divine word to Diessenhofen, Büsingen, and Schaffhausen for five or six years and have thus withdrawn from their parish in Gailingen, as from heresy and idolatry, and have taken comfort in God and their Christian lords of Zurich, doing so without human conflict and remaining unchallenged and unjudged for their faith. Now, those from Stockach have recently risen up and suspected them in the matter of God, intending to capture them, but on the way, at night, they sank in the water called the Aach, and some riders drowned; therefore, they turned back home. Yet now, on Thursday, after midnight, they appeared with about two hundred men, coming from Stockach to Dörflingen, miserably attacked seven people, destroyed their houses and farms, took them captive, ate and drank their wine and bread, led them miserably back and forth through fields and woods, and brought them to Stockach, where some escaped, treated them miserably, did not spare the pregnant women, led them quite far and let them go, and made a call to them, saying they were Anabaptists. They are not, dear lord and brother, and have no other claim than that they do not want to have fellowship with their false religion, which they practice in Gailingen in their parish, and take comfort in the word of God, which they have learned in the aforementioned places, and in their Christian lords and superiors in Zurich, with whom they desire to be united in the matter of God, having suffered joy and sorrow with them, paying their annual protection money and grain, standing faithfully for God's and our lords' honor in the Müsser War and the Kappel War, especially on the mountain, etc.</p>
      <p>And yet, for a year and a day, they have not been protected. And again, they, dear lord and brother, do not blame our lords, but some upper and lower bailiffs, namely Günthard and their lower bailiff in Dörflingen, who afterwards goes to the parish to the mass in Gailingen, wearing the colors white and blue, which our lords give him. If an upper bailiff visited or spoke with the lower bailiff, they would have better care to remove the Swiss, the honest leaders, who are attached to the mass and those from Stockach, more peace would grow among the pious people. For, my brother, the pious people lie outside, beyond the Rhine, as if they were nobody. Now, my lord and brother, near Dörflingen lies a parish church, called Kirchberg or Büsingen; there, the higher courts are like in Dörflingen, those of Stockach, the lower courts those of Schaffhausen, as the lower courts in Dörflingen belong to my lords. The people of Schaffhausen have cleansed the church of idols and altars, there is no mass there, and the land is free to proclaim the divine word, without anyone's hindrance. And because of the situation, the pious people desire that our lords appoint them there, since Schaffhausen and our lords are united in faith. Also, Buch, a village further in the Hegau, belongs like Dörflingen to the parish of Gailingen, the lower courts also belong to those of Schaffhausen and the higher courts to those of Stockach. In that village, there is no mass, and they hold to God and their lords. But in Dörflingen, it is as follows!</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear brother, I am quite inclined (in zeal but written, out of the desire of the pious people) to write to you. So that you may consider what further to do as a father of the forsaken poor, who also come to Christ's door, how neighborly they are before the world. But the people of Schaffhausen, in their lower courts, are able to lay down a parish with idolatry and plant the divine word in the empire, much more our lords, a beginning and mirror of divine truth. But it seems to me, it would be as if one had a contrary, evil person present and could not become his master by any means, he would then strike him beforehand with his butt truly full; then he would have power over him and do what he wants, and could then deal with him; and before he is beheaded, he could not accomplish anything with him. Thus, we would be defamed and despised. Ita res nostre cum quinque pagis etc. May God give His strength and awaken us with the power with which Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given at Laufen, in zeal, on February 28, 1535.</p>
      <p>Peter Schnyder, your willing brother.</p>
      <p>To my faithful, dear lord and brother, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
