      <p>Your little book is greatly approved by me, as it will undoubtedly satisfy and bring back the adversaries to a healthier opinion, if they preferred to yield to the truth rather than to stubbornly defend such a gross error. But I have long seen that we will achieve nothing with these most obstinate people, and yet not only posterity, but also those who are now somewhat less corrupt, will judge them rightly. In the meantime, they will greatly disturb the tranquility of the churches, driving some otherwise excellent princes to madness and arming all whom they can against us, so that I see we must earnestly implore our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with frequent and fervent prayers and copiously shed tears, that by some means (which is certainly easy for Him) He may uproot this most pernicious heresy to its roots, lest in this unbearable manner the properties of their natures, which He assumed into the unity of His person, be confused against the most accepted opinion of all the ancient churches. I would never have dreamed that it would come to this on our, the evangelical, side, that someone would have dared to bring such an absurd dogma to the fore. But, as I fear, some far more absurd things will follow these, unless the Lord Himself soon restrains this license; which, having mercy on us, let us strive to earnestly obtain from Him with fervent prayers.
