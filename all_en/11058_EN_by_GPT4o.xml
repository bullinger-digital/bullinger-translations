      <p>The grace of God be with us.</p>
      <p>Dear lord and benefactor, know of our well-being, praise be to God, who has led us here in peace, etc., and we were kindly received, a great palace was given to us, but little cost again, yet good Alsatians, as I have been allowed to choose in my lord's cellar, etc.</p>
      <p>Know that my lord has issued a mandate to prohibit swearing, drinking, and gambling; finding godliness by his grace. Although, unfortunately, it prevails more in Alsace than up there. The longer it takes to work, etc.</p>
      <p>Many mercenaries are also being recruited here in the city for the captain of the Emperor. It is said that next Monday they should move out to Fußach. Please convey this to my lord Röist along with my greetings.</p>
      <p>The first blasphemer, who was imprisoned these days, is a nobleman's servant here, who was not spared.</p>
      <p>I ride tomorrow to my lord in Montbéliard, to fulfill my duty.</p>
      <p>My wife sends her greetings to you all, as do I, and our son.</p>
      <p>I will arrive on time.</p>
      <p>Done on Monday, the 9th day of July in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler, citizen of Zurich, now steward in Riquewihr.</p>
      <p>To my beloved Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, etc.</p>
