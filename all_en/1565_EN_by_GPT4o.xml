      <p>S. D. I received letters from your kindness written in January. In the previous ones, you mention certain things about Osiander's writings, and although I am neither a prophet (as it is usually said) nor the son of a prophet, I have long predicted what now the best people complain is happening and has happened. I saw the man to be of indescribable arrogance and pride. Therefore, I expected from him both new things and pestilential disturbances. We have rightly taught in our churches until now that the righteousness of Christians is imputed; for thus speaks the scripture, the most certain rule of truth. For God, because of His great mercy, does not impute sins to us and, from the faith which He inspires in us, imputes to us the righteousness of Christ not as if it were foreign, but as our own. For Christ lives in us, and we live in Christ, who is entirely ours with all His gifts. This simple doctrine would not displease Osiander unless he were nurturing a monster, which indeed is thought to have raised its head from the mouth of his disciple, when he thus concluded: no work justifies; the passion of Christ is a work; therefore, the passion of Christ does not justify. Good men opposed Osiander; but I hear that almost all have turned to him alone. Therefore, you will soon hear, God willing and defending His cause, that Osiander's exaltation will be followed by some great fall. God gives grace to the humble, but resists the proud. I do not wish to read any more of that man's monstrously swollen writings, etc. I do not wish to have any more regard for him. May the Lord restrain him!</p>
      <p>What should I write about Bolsec, since I have not yet fully understood his case? I believe and teach, together with all the pious, that God has chosen all believers in Christ from eternity for salvation, and therefore those who believe are the elect, those who do not believe are the reprobate.</p>
      <p>I add that faith is not from us, but a pure gift of God. However, the fact that not all believe is not due to God but to our own fault.</p>
      <p>As the Lord explained in John chapter 3 and the apostle in 2 Corinthians chapter 4. I have treated this matter more fully in our Decades, namely Decade 4, sermon 4, and finally Decade 3, sermon 3, and on the powers of man in Decade 4, sermon 2, folio 159b.</p>
      <p>You will understand what the fathers of the Council of Trent have decided from the sessions, which I send, 2, 3, 4, and from the argument of the 5th, which was celebrated on the conversion of St. Paul. I pray that either you or our Mr. Gastius will ensure that Mr. Cellarius sees them, and then that they are promptly returned to me. I have also received some other things, such as the response of the council to the protestation of the King of the French, the protestation or rather submission of the Margrave of Brandenburg, the speech given by the secretary of the council in the session of the continued council under Julius III, the second, and some other things of this, that is, all that has been established there; but these, which I send, are the most important. Gastius will present them to you.</p>
      <p>The mass is so great that it is not permitted to transcribe each one, etc. We received Mr. Hausinger of Magdeburg with as much kindness as we could and recommended him to the brothers in St. Gallen and Schaffhausen. The magistrate paid all the expenses incurred in the inn and gave 17 crowns for the journey, 3 to the minister, and referred the matter itself to the next assembly to be discussed with the Bernese, Baselers, and Schaffhauseners. I fear that they will not receive as much from the Swiss as they hope; the good men do not know our poverty, which many acquire for themselves through excessive luxury, however much they are deterred by the word of God. Certainly, with us, the dearness of things and poverty are so great that I often think about where this most troublesome matter will finally erupt. We will not fail in our duty; may the Lord provide us with increase! You will hear the rest from Gastius. Farewell forever, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Zurich, February 10. The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Johannes Sapidus. Before indeed the war, in the war, finally after the war:</p>
      <p>The honor of virginity is preserved for me. M But since now there are so many thousands of men U Tell me, how could I remain a virgin? G Rodolphus Gwaltherus. I have not suffered men, although I have suffered the reproaches of men R</p>
      <p>Hands, swords, wounds, whips, deceits; U For neither with flattering promises did a lover B Nor with heavy threats could he conquer my heart, E So that I would wish to deny my old unfaithful husband, D Whom love joined to me with saving blood. G My virginity is safe through a thousand dangers; A To him is owed glory, praise, and honor. M I have written this, esteemed lord, so that you may be cheered by the sweetest and most holy poem. Gwaltherus, who was standing by as I wrote this, bids you farewell from the heart, wishing all happiness to you and your family. Farewell forever.</p>
