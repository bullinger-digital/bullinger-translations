      <p>Most illustrious man, I do not know how wisely I have acted, who, when I was free, have again thrown myself into the straits of these Alps and, as it were, into a certain prison, certainly into the greatest dangers.</p>
      <p>First, the spirits of many are inflamed; they have been stirred up, of course, by papal instigations. We hoped that if Bishop Planta of Chur had succeeded (for he indeed did succeed), everything would be settled; but nothing less. For he and his followers, especially a certain great friend of yours of great authority among the Rhaetians, wish to return thanks to the pope for liberation and absolution and are preparing a notable persecution against us. But this is not the only danger; listen to more serious ones. Shortly, we are to have the Emperor nearby, namely at Innsbruck (from there, one can easily reach us in a three-day journey); already many of his courtiers travel this way daily. Furthermore, the conspiracy of Trent, filled with the most cunning and cruel men, looms over us like a threat to our necks, who think of nothing else but how to destroy the gospel along with its defenders. I could almost reach them in three days from here. Therefore, due to such proximity, they know everything that happens among us. It is truly remarkable how all adversaries are emboldened against us by the proximity of both the Emperor and the council; they dare to threaten almost openly.</p>
      <p>However, I have never preached so freely nor with such spirit as I do now, and I openly warn that no decrees of that synagogue are to be accepted. I hear that a booklet I preached with the title "The Council of Trent" etc., has reached them, and those masked fathers are furious; for their positions have been repeatedly exposed. But they will grieve over greater things.</p>
      <p>The magistrate protects me; for out of 18, 15 are pious. In summary, I think thus: the new year is renewed; if again a pious magistrate is appointed, I will indeed remain here even in the greatest dangers because I feel I am making some progress in these valleys, especially since many brothers from Italy not only send me frequent letters but also visit, confer, and bring books, with which they incite others. But if a less favorable magistrate were elected, I could hardly remain here longer, indeed I could hardly set foot outside. But I commend the cause to God. Again, I say there are many who are greatly amazed that I can live now in these dangers and indeed with a joyful spirit; it is a gift from God. Meanwhile, from that highest and most opulent king, nothing of benefit or aid; now would be the time to help, now he should at least expend a little money for him who risks his life, not to live in luxury, but to be able to resist and fight.</p>
      <p>The papists would return if they knew that we, who fight, are so despised, and they would have good hope for their cause. I asked Martinengo, who is traveling to that island, to remember me there. You again urge those nobles and seriously, as you are accustomed. Meanwhile, from elsewhere, from that prince whom you know, not even a penny, nor do I strive; but something would flow if I strove. May God himself have my cause commended.</p>
      <p>Surely neither honor will come to them nor to the brothers if I am forced by poverty to leave this station.</p>
      <p>See the letter I prepared for the Cardinal of Trent and will send, if it seems so to you, especially to you. I have experienced the judgments of some, who altogether confess that they were aroused by it to recognize impostures. Consider that those fathers will never agree that we can be numbered among the bishops and judge together with them in sessions; if they truly deny this, now many even among the papists will think and speak very badly of them. If it seems so to you, I will send and publish it; indeed, if it seems to you to be sent, write to Oporinus to print it, and announce that I will immediately pay for two hundred copies, which I will spread through Italy. - I also send a certain version of Mr. Francesco Negro; I published the book in Italian a few months ago and I know many were aroused by it. Perhaps from other nations, who do not understand our Italian language, some would be aroused if it were now published in Latin, and it will be published if it seems so to you. It should be sent immediately to Oporinus, whom you should encourage to print it as soon as possible; I would buy a hundred copies.</p>
      <p>Dearest brother, I am very concerned that the lords of Bern might think ill of me; but truly it is not flesh and blood that keeps me in these Alps and present dangers. I earnestly beg you to write to Mr. Haller and confirm with your authority that I remain here, so that I may bring some inconvenience to the council and help the brothers of Italy, to wait and see what kind of new magistrate will be. Moreover, advise him to deal with those lords about this matter. This is very dear to my heart. I commend my nephews, that is, that you urge them not to be lazy, and also understand how they live, and call them back to the way if they have strayed, as that age is wont to do.</p>
      <p>I have faithfully translated your booklet to the king, and it pleases me more every day; now I will have it copied and send it shortly.</p>
      <p>I have written a rather long and even negligent letter; take it in good part. I dare so much with you, since I recognize you as truly pious, who are accustomed to interpret everything in a good way. Farewell and be well with the whole church and school. Pray for me, who expose my head for the glory of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, October 28, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
