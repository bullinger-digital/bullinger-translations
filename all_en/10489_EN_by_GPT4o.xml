    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's book gift «Assertio...» and letter. Bullinger is right: Ambrosius Blarer's situation is quite different from that of the Zurichers; to save souls, shepherds sometimes have to disguise themselves. Christ should only be proclaimed on the basis of the Holy Scriptures. He likes Augustine's opinion on this. Zwingli and Oecolampadius never agreed to this formula of agreement in Marburg, even if it has been preserved in Oecolampadius's handwriting. Such things are now being used to create confusion again. Bullinger's «Assertio utriusque de Christo naturae» addresses an urgently important topic, as the divine and human nature of Christ is often not properly understood. That is why Karlstadt also preached more than twenty times on: «The Word became flesh...» John 1, 14. Recommends Pierre Toussain. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I give thanks both for the gift given and for the letter, with which it will be possible to silence the mouths of some. You wisely judge that the condition of Blaurer is different from that of the Zurichers. For it is necessary for shepherds to sometimes rush into the crowd of wolves in another guise, to rescue the sheep, and thus we see Paul did. May Almighty God grant that we proclaim Christ, who according to the Scriptures was preached by the true apostles, not otherwise than according to the prescription of Scripture.</p>
      <p>I am pleased with Augustine's opinion: "Do not rely on my words," etc., which you know very well. Indeed, I truly acknowledge and know that Christ, who removes sins from consciences and brings divine peace with his body, could not have accommodated his body to the removal of sins without quantity, as testified by Moses, Isaiah, the apostles, and Christ himself. Therefore, we must be careful, lest while we take away quantity from Christ, we deprive ourselves of the way to heaven. But what if Zwingli and Oecolampadius had suffered something human? Yet we have been assured that they never wanted to accept such a phrase at Marburg. Indeed, a manuscript of Oecolampadius was found here, in which such things are written. But we also found that he described not his own but the desired thoughts and wishes of the Lutherans. This is nothing to you, but so that you may see by what means they not only try to defend the perhaps well-discovered findings of others but also to attract and pour out dregs upon men already rightly formed.</p>
      <p>You have rightly written about the dual nature of Christ, as the circumstances demand. For we see that some do not acknowledge the divinity, others the humanity. The impiety of some has also moved me, so that I have now given more than 20 sermons on the exposition of that: "The Word became flesh" [John 1:14]. Oh, that we may not plot anything against the Son of God! Wolves come in sheep's clothing, thinning their bellies, to diminish the glory of Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily and have Master Pierre Toussain commended to you, and also me. Greet your wife, mother, daughters, likewise Master Heinrich Utinger and Master Leo and others, and rebuke me strongly if you hear that I am wavering or departing in word or deed.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 6, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Carolostadius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his most esteemed and dear lord.</p>
