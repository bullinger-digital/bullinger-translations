    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer expects a report from Bucer about the further actions of Emperor [Charles V.] against [Hermann von Wied], for whose steadfastness one must pray. - He has informed [Konrad Zwick] about the response of [Johannes] Haab, which greatly puzzled Zwick, especially since Haab remarked that a negotiation [by Zwick] would not have been necessary if a [connection of Konstanz to the Swiss Confederation] was not in prospect. Yet Haab knew that Zwick had negotiated on his own! - Little is to be expected from the [Second Regensburg] religious discussion. However, Bucer's efforts should not be underestimated, for in the belief that more people seek God with a pure heart than is actually the case, he constantly hopes that the two parties would come closer to each other and to the truth. The previous failures [of such religious discussions] only show that the opponents shy away from the light of truth. One must pray that the Lord strengthens the path to a solid concord among the [Protestants] and grants them a tolerant steadfastness towards liars. - Blarer is pleased that Bullinger mentioned the prophecies of [Johannes] Zwick in his letter [not received], because it shows him that Bullinger has not forgotten Zwick either. - Blarer also hopes that [Johannes] a Lasco [remains steadfast]. - Bullinger rightly admonished Vadian; certain zealots spread unwise or joking words of great men to discredit the cause of others. - Blarer congratulates [on the appointment of] Heinrich Buchter. - He is surprised that Bullinger wrote nothing about the request of the council of Isny [for the dispatch of a pastor]. Blarer has already learned about it [from a] letter written by [Peter] Buffler, which was delivered by the messenger from Isny [...]. This messenger also reported on the [Zurich] decision to provide a successor for [Johannes] Marbach. Bullinger should write about it and pray for the church. - Greetings from [Thomas Blarer] and Konrad Zwick. - Peter Scher the Elder writes about the poor conditions in France and reports that [Francis I.] had assembled an army of 60,000 soldiers against [Henry VIII.].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am waiting to hear from Bucer about what further actions the Emperor has taken against the Archbishop of Cologne. In the meantime, we will support this excellent prince with prayers to the Lord; if he continues steadfastly as he has begun, he will surely understand what it means to hope in the Lord and trust in Him alone, and how His strength is perfected in our weakness. We face the same struggles, but Christ will also triumph through us.</p>
      <p>Regarding your consul Haab, I informed my cousin of his response; he is greatly puzzled, especially since Haab added: "If the intention was not to negotiate from a friendly, neighborly understanding, there would have been no need for mediation," even though he cannot be unaware of the good faith with which he was dealt, and that from his own mind: "all these things were done with no mortal being aware except us," which he also affirmed most solemnly, so he should not have doubted, etc.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write about the religious discussions, except that the outcome has been less than fortunate, as the matter itself has shown. In the meantime, no one can easily condemn Bucer's efforts, for he, relying on the goodness of the cause and believing that more people seek God with a pure heart than actually do, constantly hopes that if the matter is examined a little more diligently, the two sides will come closer to each other and the truth will be more purely revealed through this exercise, even though, having been struck several times, he does not seem to urge it much, since so many attempts have ended so unfortunately, except that even in this misfortune some progress has always been made, and the opponents have been seen to avoid the light of truth more than we have. But we must pray to the Lord to pave a way for us to solid concord through His Holy Spirit (for us, I say, who truly seek the glory of His kingdom, though we still gravely disagree in some matters), and to strengthen our spirits with adamantine tolerance towards those who are sold to defend lies, so that we never yield.</p>
      <p>It was exceedingly pleasant to read in your letters the prophecy of our dear and beloved Zwick, not so much because of the prophecy itself, but because I understood from it that his memory is still present and vivid with you; with which I also occasionally delight myself, striving to compose myself in some way according to the example of this heart most thirsty for the glory of Christ.</p>
      <p>You will have done rightly if you have admonished our Vadian as you write. Certain zealots spread with great applause words of this kind, uttered by great men of that kind either imprudently or even in jest, so as to make the cause of others more odious.</p>
      <p>I hope the same for the illustrious man Johannes a Lasco as you do. He will surely prevail, since He who is in him is much stronger than he who is in the world. I heartily congratulate your church on Heinrich Buchter; may the Lord, having most kindly imbued him with His Spirit, make him suitable and in every way apt for the right administration of the province he has undertaken.</p>
      <p>But hey, my dearest brother, how is it that you have not said a single word about the petition from Isny? About which the excellent man Buffler had already informed me, and that through the very messenger who brought your letters from the Isny council, so I would very much like to know what your response to them was, and I hoped to understand it from your next letters. The messenger, who lingered there for a few days, solemnly affirmed that there was agreement from your side that someone from your colleagues would be designated to succeed Marbach in the Isny church. But since this kind of people is usually unreliable, I did not dare to trust him. Therefore, write to the next messenger how this matter stands, and pray diligently for us and for the church of Christ, which is tossed by so many storms of many dangers, so that its faith does not fail.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother. From Konstanz, September 19.</p>
      <p>Greet your household and brothers. Our people greet you, especially my brother and Konrad Zwick.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>Peter Scher the Elder writes that there is a great plague and famine in France and also a cruel war; for the king has gathered over sixty thousand fighting men together against England, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his very much esteemed brother. In Zurich.</p>
