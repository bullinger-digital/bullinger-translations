      <p>Greetings. I am grateful to you, dearest godfather in the Lord, for sharing the letters of Mr. a Lasco and Micronius, and I ask you to send my letters to the latter whenever you have the opportunity.</p>
      <p>Let it be far from me to serve fanatical people with my writings. If that assembly intended for reconciling evangelical ministers proceeds, I wish to know from you what you think our people should do; I think I can guess what they will do; but what they ought to do, what is in the interest and glory of truth and beneficial to the churches, I seek your opinion here. As for what you ask of me regarding excommunication, whether I think it should be mixed with the Lord's Supper, so that sinners are denied the use of communion for a certain time, I am very surprised that you ask my opinion here, when in such matters you should rather be consulted by me than I by you. But if you think it is entirely in your interest to know what I think here, unless I am mistaken, from what I recently wrote to you about excommunication, you can gather enough of what you are asking here; for what is said about the whole sufficiently indicates what should be thought about the part.</p>
      <p>But since you wish me to respond specifically to this point, I will do so briefly, as is fitting for one who writes to a learned man, who does not need to be taught by me, but seeks to know what I think. I believe there are three considerations here: custom, edification, and either divine or apostolic institution. You know what the custom was in ancient churches; it does not move me unless there is either a reason for edification or the authority of a certain divine or apostolic institution.</p>
      <p>As for the consideration of utility and edification, I believe this consideration should be left to the leaders of each church, whose role, according to the apostle's opinion, is to establish and moderate everything in the church for edification.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I cannot establish anything certain here in general. In our churches, I do not see how it would contribute to edification if excommunication were mixed with the Lord's Supper, indeed how this could be attempted, let alone done, without serious disturbance and dissipation of the ecclesiastical body.</p>
      <p>The remaining consideration is that of institution. Regarding the passage in Matthew 18, I think I have already written about it, as well as about the one in 1 Corinthians 5, where the apostle says: "With such a one, not even to eat," I understand that all social interaction of human life should be denied to unrepentant sinners, such as those listed there, so that even what seems to have less danger is imputed to them, let alone that relationship and communion which is in the sacred commerce of religion. You will find those who easily bear the denial of the communication of religion and the mysteries of God, provided they are not excluded from the rest of the social interactions of this life. Therefore, it was not enough for the apostle, who was concerned with the salvation of delinquents, to cut off ecclesiastical interaction with such people unless he also removed the rest, which pertains to this life, so that they might be ashamed and amend. I feel, therefore, that this kind of excommunication, by which a sinner is only separated from the Lord's Supper and meanwhile retained in the rest of the commerce of our whole life, neither conforms to the form of apostolic institution nor serves the end to which all things in the church should be directed. Thus, I think you can understand what I feel: I do not approve of plans that are neither purely apostolic nor heal the ills of the church. I have arranged for the summary of true religion, which you sent to my wife, to be prepared separately for her, so that it may be read to her when domestic duties allow. I highly approve of the apology against the writings of the Saxons, and I wish that the moderation of the brothers would be such that they read and reread your and Calvin's responses not for contention, but for a just understanding of this cause! Unless it is, we will achieve nothing, even if we write a thousand volumes. As for me, I have destined the treatment of this cause to my places, in which, according to my mediocrity, I will try to assist not contentious people, but brothers who are zealous for the truth. That Musculus, who is said to agree with the Westphalian absurdities and establish the presence of Christ's flesh in the Supper, is not in Bern, but in Frankfurt an der Oder; so I understand from the Augsburg brothers; for otherwise, he is entirely unknown to me. I am grateful to you for both booklets and approve of the practice by which you publish most things in modest booklets and at an affordable price; for they are read by more people this way than if they were included in full volumes and works. Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household and the brothers. You have lost a great ornament of true innocence; may many such true Israelites be restored to you in his place. My wife and children greet you, especially the one who is yours in Christ, whom I see has more of the Swiss spirit than the Swabian; may the Lord guide him with His holy spirit.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 22.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your godfather.</p>
      <p>I ask, when you write to Mr. a Lasco and to Peter Martyr, commend me to their prayers before the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest godfather in Christ. Zurich.</p>
      <p>The opinion of Mr. Wolfgang Musculus, theologian and professor in the school of Bern, on excommunication, 1556.</p>
