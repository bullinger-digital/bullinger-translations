      <p>Grace to you [...] What has been done with Justus Velsius by our academy, it seemed you should know. Therefore, briefly, as much as my occupations allow, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>On the past Sabbath day, the greater senate of the academy heard the man offering his written work, and immediately sent him back to his lodging, instructing him to await with a calm mind a friendly response worthy of Christian profession.</p>
      <p>For the recitation of such a lengthy writing was to be postponed until Monday due to the preachers. Therefore, yesterday, on Monday, the writing was recited, and it seemed to some to contain four main points. First, that he was called by God as a prophet and apostle, indeed that Martin Luther's calling was of the same kind, but incomplete and mutilated, and that the evangelical ministers had none. Second, that the evangelical churches were not churches, but assemblies of heretics and schismatics. Third, that Luther, with his doctrine, had perverted the matter of justification and corrupted it with the greatest harm to people. Fourth, that the faculties of the natural man were not entirely null.</p>
      <p>It was decreed that his petition should be answered thus: It does not seem to be in the interest of either the church or the academy or even the republic that these matters be proposed for public debate. However, since they are theological, they pertain to the order of theologians, and the other orders of the academy cannot deal with them.</p>
      <p>If, therefore, he wishes to undertake a friendly conversation with the theologians and ministers of the church privately, there is no doubt that they will patiently listen to him and, according to the apostle's precept, give an account of their faith [1 Peter 3:15] with gentleness and reverence. Therefore, he can appeal to the theologians. Thus, he was referred to the college of theologians and ministers. The theologians and ministers present were asked (since they seemed to avoid the conversation and were somewhat irritated) to act among their colleagues so that he would not be repelled from the conversation, nor received otherwise than would befit Christian brothers, to whom nothing had been more diligently inculcated and enjoined by the Lord than charity. And since Velsius so greatly urged regeneration, they should signify with charity that they also perceive the efficacy of regeneration.</p>
      <p>They were therefore asked that, if a conversation were to take place, they would also allow other professors the opportunity to listen, if any wished. These things were done. What will happen next is not certain, but you will learn in due time (God willing).</p>
      <p>As for me, I confessed in the whole assembly and now also frankly confess to you that from that lecture I could not ascertain whether those four points were in this sense, or more, or fewer, or whether Velsius's writing contained them or not.</p>
      <p>For most things seemed very obscure to me. Therefore, I did not want to judge rashly about what I did not understand. It seems to me that this man has a zeal for God, perhaps, however, not according to knowledge [Romans 10:2]. For I suspect that he has more Anabaptist views on certain matters. I have indeed conversed with him twice, and he displayed singular moderation and gentleness, but I cannot yet pronounce anything about him.</p>
      <p>You will learn otherwise, if it seems good to God, what we have discussed among ourselves. Farewell in Christ, my lord and brother Bullinger, and forgive my hasty writing and in my name bid all the brothers much health.</p>
      <p>From Basel, from our study, June 17, in the year of human salvation 1561. Yours sincerely, Johannes Hospinianus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man and best theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
