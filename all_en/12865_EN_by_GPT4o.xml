    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer learns quite unexpectedly that Hans Peter Wellenberg [residing in Zurich] is in Konstanz. Since he wants to send this letter with him, he is in such a hurry that he can hardly write.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] What the people of Konstanz learned about the armament of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and about the identity of the war opponents of King Ferdinand I and Duke Maurice of Saxony corresponds to what the people of Zurich heard from St. Gallen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Reports from Hungary and Venice repeatedly state that Sultan Suleiman is heavily armed. He may decide the outcome of the war. That should be fine with [the Protestants]! [Christendom] deserves it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is a good sign that the people of Zurich do not punish their mercenaries who were drawn into the [Schmalkaldic] War. For the people of Konstanz, this is an encouraging signal.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Their situation is still uncertain. Numerous warnings and offers of mediation are coming in from neighboring areas, especially since those areas rightly fear that they too would feel the consequences of an imperial campaign against Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Sebastian Schertlin and Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz are still in the city. Allegedly, a French envoy in Basel [François de la Rivière or Guillaume du Plessis, sieur de Lyancourt] is trying to recruit both military leaders for service with King Francis I of France.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Count Friedrich von Fürstenberg, Hans Jakob von Landau, Wilhelm Truchsess von Waldburg, the Land Commander Johann Werner von Reischach, the Abbot of Weingarten Gerwig Blarer, and Überlingen offer to mediate between Konstanz and Emperor Charles V. Hopefully, it will not lead to an irresponsible agreement! God is to be implored. Nothing is to be expected from humans.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The suspicion is repeatedly expressed that the Emperor will march against the Confederates. Recently, an Imperial [...] said that the people of Konstanz, with their refusal to reconcile with the Emperor, are far from being out of trouble. Their time will come, namely when the Emperor demands that they allow his troops free passage against the Confederates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Gerwig Blarer was recently in Hagnau. He wanted to meet his relative Thomas Blarer there. Since he was ill, he sent the trustworthy [Melchior Eberhart]. Gerwig told him that the people of Konstanz should not join the Swiss, for the latter had helped no one and would not be spared themselves. As the imperial commissioner for the Upper German cities, Gerwig is informed about all plans. What exactly he has to accomplish with these cities is not yet known. If Bullinger tells the Zurich council about it, he should not mention Gerwig's name, but only say that the statements come from a noble gentleman.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Landgrave Philip of Hesse remains calm. He is said to be confident and to devote himself to hunting because Maximilian Egmont, Count of Buren, and Count Reinhard of Solms are negotiating for him with the Emperor, and have even obtained his reconciliation! If this is true, it will bring misfortune upon him. May God not let him fall so deeply!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] There are still people who are convinced that the Emperor is dead and instead a double, who is only stronger and healthier, is showing himself to the people. This speculation is fueled, among other things, by the following incident: The young Maximilian recently secretly rode away from Ulm. In the letter he left behind, it said that it was pointless to search for him. If God wills, he will return in two years. Since the letter was found early, he and his two companions were tracked down about two miles from Ulm and brought back. The reasons for his departure remain silent. It is only claimed that he intended to mourn the death of his mother [Anna Jagiello of Bohemia and Hungary] with his father Ferdinand. But that does not fit at all with the content of the letter. Therefore, it is suspected that he no longer wanted to stay because he knows exactly that the alleged Emperor is not the real one.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Enclosed is the letter addressed to Johannes Brenz, which was posted by an unknown person on the church door of Schwäbisch Hall.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] The matter of Hans Stadelmann was resolved in another way. Therefore, he returned the [letter addressed to Bullinger for him] from Blarer [No. 2804]. However, Blarer still encloses it with the present letter, even though it contains no news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Bullinger should support the people of Konstanz with his prayers. May Christ trample the devil, who only wants to seduce the good, underfoot!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Greetings, also to family and colleagues. Blarer's colleagues also commend themselves to Bullinger's prayers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] [P.S.:] How is Rudolf Gwalther and his "Endtchrist"?</p>

      <p>I unexpectedly learn that Mr. Peter Wellenberg is here, and I truly cannot write in such haste. (Time pressure) I am worried he will escape me. Therefore, in utmost haste.</p>

      <p>What has been written here about how the Elector is armed and what the King along with Duke Maurice have planned is also what has been written to your people from St. Gallen. Whether it is certain, we do not yet know, but concerning the Elector, it is still quite certain.</p>

      <p>The Turk is said to be in terrible (frightening) armor, it is written repeatedly from Hungary and also from Venice. He may decide the war. Fiat, quod bonum est in oculis nostris! We have all deserved it. (earned)</p>

      <p>We are pleased to hear that your people have dealt so graciously with the soldiers, for we can hope for something good in the future in case of need. Yet all hope is founded in God!</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Our situation is still the same. We are still waiting for God's grace, whatever He may give. There are excellent warnings from all sides, especially from our neighbors. Everyone is urged to act and do their best. (do) For (Because) the neighbors worry, if we are attacked, they too must be destroyed, as is true.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The captains Schertle and Marcell are still here. There is a French envoy in Basel. I hear well that he, on the King's orders, would like to recruit these two to serve the King, with excellent promises.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Count Friedrich von Fürstenberg, the one from Landau, Mr. Wilhelm Truchsess, Land Commander, Abbot of Weingarten, Überlingen, etc., would all like to be mediators with several others against (towards the) Emperor. I hope to the dear God, ours will accept nothing unreasonable or irresponsible. May the dear and true God help us, to whom I implore you to intercede for us diligently, through Christ Jesus I beseech and implore. It is very necessary! There is nothing good in all mankind.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The conjectures (suspicions) always converge and meet, that the Emperor also has something against the Confederates in mind. A short time ago, an important imperial person said: "It does not harm those from Konstanz that they cannot agree to reconciliation like others, for their situation is accordingly." And among other reasons, he also mentioned: "Should the Emperor demand from them to allow passage against the Confederates, it would undoubtedly be very difficult for them for many reasons."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Abbot of Weingarten was recently in Hagnau. He would have liked to have my dear brother as his cousin with him. He excused himself due to illness, etc., and sent a trusted man in his place. He was to reveal his opinion to him. To this, the Abbot said among other things: "The people of Konstanz now seem and do not attach themselves to the Swiss! For they (the Confederates) have helped no one. It was better for him before. Moreover, they themselves will not remain unchallenged." Now he knows well about all plans. He is also now an imperial commissioner in the Upper German cities. He is to accomplish something with them, etc. But you should not mention the Abbot in any way. It is my earnest desire. However, you might well inform your people that an important person has said such things. In summary: They intend to bring everything under their control.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>About the Landgrave, it is said repeatedly that he sits very quietly. He hunts and is confident, for the one from Buren and the Count of Solms are negotiating on his behalf with the Emperor; and he is reconciled! If it is true, greater misfortune will come upon him. But I hope to God, he will not let him fall so deeply. Otherwise, it would be a cruel, terrible fall.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Some still want to insist (claim) with force that the Emperor is dead and the one who now lets himself be seen and heard is truly not him, but looks like him in all things, yet stronger and healthier than the Emperor. They have many, many suspicions. For you know that the young King Maximilian recently secretly stole away from Ulm and rode away. He left a little letter behind in his lodging, in which it said he was riding away, and they should not search for him, for they would not find him. But in over two years (may God let him live) he would return. Thus, the letter was discovered too early. They pursued him and caught him about 2 miles from Ulm and brought him back. But what his intention (plan, purpose) was, no one is told. It is only claimed that he wanted to go to his father the King and complain about the mother. But that does not fit at all with the letter, as you notice. There are many and various accounts of it, and especially because he knows that this is not the real Emperor, he did not want to stay any longer.</p>

      <p>Herewith the letter that was posted to Brenz at Hall on the church door. But it is not known exactly who did it.</p>

    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The Stadelman matter has been resolved differently, as his matter was otherwise settled. He now brings me the letter. I send you nothing less. I have otherwise also written you news in it.</p>

      <p>Ah, my brother, apply, as much as you can, the aiding spirits of your prayers and the hands of sacred prayers to our efforts, so that they do not succumb under this very heavy burden, but may steadfastly persevere! With wondrous machines, Satan tries to conquer the hearts of good men; may Christ crush him under our feet!</p>

      <p>Farewell well and eternally, brother of my heart and my soul in the Lord. May your house be well with all brothers and friends. Our people greet you diligently and commend themselves to you with this common cause most dutifully. In Konstanz, February 19. Yours, A. Bl.</p>
