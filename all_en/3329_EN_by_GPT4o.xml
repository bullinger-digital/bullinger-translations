      <p>Hermann Pincier to Heinrich Bullinger, greetings through Christ.</p>
      <p>If I had to write to anyone other than you, I would have hesitated greatly, lest I fall into some suspicion of impudence. But your utmost kindness, which you showed towards me, a stranger, recently when I was in Zürich, and your most favorable disposition towards all foreigners, makes me fear nothing of the sort and allows me to write to you freely about what I wish. These two young men, moved by the reputation of the city of Zürich, are about to set out to see it and have asked me to provide them with some letters, by the help of which they might gain the acquaintance of one or another and more easily achieve their purpose.</p>
      <p>Although I myself, lacking closer friends, could hardly have been able to gratify them in this, yet, when they insisted and your benevolence came to my mind, I did not want to allow a rustic and empty modesty to seem to have hindered this their desire and utmost delight. Therefore, I ask you to be willing to admit them into your presence and to honor them with a single word; they will consider it a great thing, and I will regard it as a matter of the highest favor. Moreover, if you wish to know anything about the state of religion in Carinthia and Styria, one of them has just come here from those parts; he knows many things which, if you hear them, will not be unpleasant for you to know. Farewell in Christ and love me, as you are accustomed to love all the Pinciers.</p>
      <p>Basel, 24th of September, in the year 57.</p>
      <p>To the best and most learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the church of Zürich, his master.</p>
