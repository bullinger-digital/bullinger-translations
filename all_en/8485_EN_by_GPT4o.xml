      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>We send letters to you quite frequently, dear brother, both your brother and I, but we have not received a single letter from you for one or two months now. In my last letter, I included letters to Mr. Benedikt Aretius. Your brother later sent everything I had received from friends elsewhere, and I included the instructions for the mission of my envoys to Basel. But whether you have received it or not, we do not know from you. I hope you are not silent because of death!</p>
      <p>The people of Basel promised to respond in writing; but we have seen nothing yet, perhaps they will not send anything in the future, unless they share everything with the people of TÃ¼bingen, Strasbourg, and the Margraves; for they lean more towards outsiders than towards allies and confederates. Therefore, I do not know whose fault it is, unless perhaps largely that of Simon Sulzer.</p>
      <p>There is great scarcity of all things here and a great number of poor beggars, a most miserable complaint; we are already paying the penalties for our extravagance, drunkenness, and crimes. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>We suffer much here because of the tyranny exercised by the neighboring authorities in those common jurisdictions and the domains of the Bishop of Constance and the Abbot of St. Gall. May the Lord see and demand justice and deliver us from evil.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 6, 1571.</p>
      <p>Here, all carnival, feasts, chicken dinners, and the like have been abolished.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Johannes Haller, minister of the church in Bern, my honorable and dearest compatriot and brother.</p>
      <p>Bern.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Haller, of Bern, in the main church, etc.</p>
