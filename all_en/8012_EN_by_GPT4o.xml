      <p>S. D. I congratulate your happy old age, venerable old man, most esteemed lord and dearest brother in the Lord. For I hear from friends that you serve the Lord with intact strength of both mind and body. Once, God also extended the years of life of his servants into several ages, namely so that they might be witnesses and propagators of his sound and salutary doctrine. Nor do I doubt that you have been granted this healthy longevity by the Lord for no other purpose than that you may strive with all your strength to preserve the purity of doctrine in the Basel church. You alone, as far as I know, are the survivor of those who were the most faithful assistants to Oecolampadius (of blessed memory), an incomparable man, in reforming the Basel church, and you alone survive from those who bravely defended the cause of truth in the Baden disputation against the architect of lies and loquacious sophist Eck. Therefore, when the most distinguished man, Dr. Wolfgang Waydner of Worms, came to Basel to bequeath a handsome sum of money to both the Basel and Zurich schools, he chose you from all to be his companion on his journey and brought you to me in Zurich. You know, however, what kind of conversation he initiated with us in my study and that, among other things, he wanted each of us to express our confession regarding the Lord's sacred supper. You first issued the one that was also of Oecolampadius (of blessed memory). I added the one that was also of Zwingli and Oecolampadius (of blessed memory). What more? We were of one and the same confession and in complete agreement. This greatly pleased the excellent man, and he gave the greatest thanks to the Lord, adding that he was of the same confession with us and therefore a member of the Zurich and Basel churches, which he recognized as one and the same church. And as a testimony of this, he wished to bequeath a certain sum of money to our schools, where you well remember that I faithfully acted on behalf of the Basel school, so that the good man would contribute more wealth to the Basel school than to ours, as ours seemed more affluent and yours more modest. Soon he decided to bequeath 3000 florins to yours and a thousand to ours. We gave the greatest thanks to his humanity for such liberality towards studies and schools. However, he added: I will donate this money to your schools on the condition that, at whatever time your pastors and professors defect to Luther or to the papists and do not follow this simple method of teaching about the supper, nothing more should be paid to the schools, but everything should be converted to the use of the poor. He advised us to remember this, which he also intended to insert into the instruments of donation. After these matters were thus amicably concluded, we parted on both sides. The same man, in March of the year 1554, in letters written to me in his own hand, which I still have and can show, testified to me in these words: "If ever (which God graciously deigns to avert) it happens that the purer doctrine in Basel is corrupted by their ecclesiastics either relapsing to papism or colluding (which is also abominable) with the Lutherans in the article of the Lord's supper, and the same happens in their schools, I wish that the pension of three thousand henceforth annually be turned either to dowry poor virgins or to other pious uses of the true poor of Christ according to the last article of the obligations. And my conscience is my witness here, the obligations are witnesses, and even Christ himself will be a witness in the universal judgment, with what mind I donated that pension of three thousand gold coins to the church, school, and poor of Basel." Thus he spoke. To what end do I say this? I will say briefly: Since we two, after our Lord God, were the principal authors of this donation and he especially commended his institution to us and before others to be preserved while we live, I certainly think it is primarily our duty to ensure, as much as we can, that nothing is done against the will of that good and pious man. Now it is certainly affirmed among us that Dr. Sulzer, the principal minister of the Basel church and professor of theology in the school, has completely deviated from the doctrine of Oecolampadius and Zwingli (of blessed memory) regarding the Lord's supper to the doctrine of Luther (of blessed memory); but also those things that were done with the most illustrious man Dr. Peter Ramus attract not a little with them. Meanwhile, we also hear that the Basel confession issued in 1534 is being put forward, which indeed we have always approved and still approve as agreeing with the doctrine of Oecolampadius, that is, Christian, and with our church. However, with this, the doctrine of Luther regarding the Lord's supper diametrically disagrees, which we confidently believe we can demonstrate without difficulty if necessary. Hence, he who confesses to follow Luther's doctrine in the matter of the supper has indeed repudiated the aforementioned Basel confession and the faith and doctrine of Oecolampadius and the Swiss churches. What then, my lord and brother, remains, except that Dr. Sulzer and, if it seems so, the professors of the Basel school be reminded of the institution and will of Dr. Waydner and therefore that Dr. Sulzer be especially admonished not to proceed to introduce a new kind of doctrine, which is contrary to the first reformation achieved by Dr. Oecolampadius, but by preserving sincere concord with the Swiss churches, he may retain the doctrine in the Basel church or the 3000 gold coins be transferred to the pious uses of the poor from the school according to the will of the donor and as is attested by his letters. Nor be offended by me if you show these my letters, if it seems so, to Dr. Sulzer himself, Dr. Zwingger, or others, as it seems fit.</p>
      <p>For I cannot dissemble here through my conscience. And you know, my lord and brother, what we owe to the deceased Waydner, what faith requires. Meanwhile, you will commend me to good, learned men and brothers and greet them from me. For I do not write this as an adversary or enemy, but as a friend, wishing nothing more from the Lord than that we may all think and speak the same in Christ Jesus, our Lord, in whom I pray you may fare well. I write this to you because you are still surviving from the first teachers of this church, and this matter is commended to you and me. Again and again, farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 20th September in the year of our Lord 1569.</p>
      <p>I commend to you and the other teachers of your school our students, whom we send to you, etc.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours from the heart entirely.</p>
