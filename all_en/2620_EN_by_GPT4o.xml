      <p>Greetings. I read your letters, my father, with the greatest eagerness; yet, when I consider how busy you usually are and with what matters, I easily place my private concerns before public ones, so that there is no need for you to seek an excuse for silence. Although my own affairs are not of the same importance, they have kept me occupied with almost similar matters for a long time, preventing me from writing to you as I usually do. Even now, I am very occupied with both public matters of our church and school and also with the private injuries of some, as I write this to you. For it cannot be said how much the progress of our little academy and the fruits of our moderate industry irritate some people. But you will learn more about these things either from Mr. Calvin's letters, which I am sending to you, or from ours at some point, if the Lord grants that either these sycophants will be silenced once and for all or that I may henceforth be allowed to lead a private life in greater leisure. Whatever will be accomplished, I will make sure you understand. In the meantime, I ask that you commend the cause of the good to the Lord in your prayers. From our France, I can bring you no joyful news. The Frenchman continues in his folly, blinded by the just judgment of God. I recently wrote the French confession in the name of the exiles of Dijon, which I hope will be read by the senate, hopefully with some benefit. There is a consistent rumor here that the English envoys, who were traveling to the Pope, were intercepted in Turin with a large sum of money, which was not sealed, so that the fraud could not be understood; it was being carried to the Florentine, who is sustaining the burden of war in Italy, if what we hear is true. They say a certain Cardinal from Santa Croce was designated as Pope in Rome in the absence of the French. It is certain that the Emperor is trying everything to make a pact with the French against Christ; for this is the one thing that fox desires; if he achieves this, then indeed the worst awaits us, and what does our perpetual and untamed αψαριστια not deserve? But it is well that heaven awaits us, who are cast out from the earth. In the meantime, let us run our race bravely and pray, as you rightly advise, that the Lord may look upon his churches for the sake of his most holy name, which he certainly will do. I have replied to Mr. Gwalter about your students; they will indeed be no less a concern for us, do not doubt, than if they were our own sons, nor will it be our fault if we do not also prove our faithfulness and diligence to you and the other fathers and brothers to be respected there. If they are less diligent or, God forbid, live less religiously, we will try to remedy it, and if they reject the medicine, we will promptly inform you, which I am also compelled to report to you about a certain Otto Chrysopaeus. Although he had previously shown himself to be quite studious and teachable in the Corderian school, he now seems to have completely abandoned not only the care of studies but also of piety, which he demonstrates both in reality and in his entire demeanor and appearance. You would say he is more of a soldier than a scholar: a red cap, a Spanish cape, slashed boots, a distorted face, so that when he recently met me, I could hardly recognize the man. I rebuked, reproached, and advised him to change these things; today I noticed he was the same and was amazed at his impudence all the more because he was not ashamed to bring your messenger to my house in this attire. Therefore, I foretold that I would write to you about these matters. He is so far from attending school that he even avoids it. When asked for the reason, he said, "Corderius has forbidden me from the school." I know this to be utterly false; but when letters were discovered in which he was soliciting a noble girl with a gift, fearing punishment, he preferred to flee the school rather than seek pardon for his fault, and Corderius, the best and truly holy old man, seeing him with such depraved morals, advised him, of course, that unless he wanted to amend his ways, he should rather abstain from school than infect others with this most harmful contagion. You have unpleasant news; but it is our duty not to conceal these things from you. We will also seriously consider a remedy and you will decide there. Mr. Viret, Eustathius, Ribittus, and my other colleagues greet you with me along with the whole church. But my wife also commends herself to your prayers and those of your most excellent wife, as she is now pregnant for the first time. Farewell, my most esteemed father. May the Lord Jesus strengthen you and your entire church more and more each day with his holy spirit. We have written to our brothers in Locarno these days and sent a small amount of money to your most illustrious senate, which is to be delivered to them, so that, as much as we can and as the Lord has given us, we may testify to our respect and love for them. May the Lord preserve them, who has given them this, that they not only believe in Christ but also suffer for his name. Farewell again. Lausanne, April 22.</p>
      <p>Your Beza, your most devoted son in the Lord.</p>
