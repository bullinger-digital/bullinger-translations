      <p>He commends himself. Do not find it burdensome, most esteemed leader of letters, that I approach you with these letters, full of other business and thus unknown from behind, that is, I creep towards your friendship. You will know, however, if you hear about me from our Gervasius Scholasticus, to whom I have also written now as an old friend, so that I might become somewhat more known to you through letters. For I am a most diligent cultivator of our Switzerland, to which I owe the fact that I was born a man, then educated as I am. But the spirit of fornication, which was in the midst of the papacy, also blinded my eyes with its shining religion, so that, having left everything, I devoted myself to the Carthusian religion, although I was far removed from all religion. But how could I have avoided it, when the whole world worshipped and almost adored these holy fathers as high, divine, and conscious of the mysteries of God? And we are deceived by the appearance of right. And the worst hypocrite monk, my fellow citizen, who lured me into this trap, may God destroy his advice, born from the belly. But, I beseech you, what do you think I should do now, after I have stripped off and prostituted this very kind of religious life, since I am poor, a man of slender fortune, and the Interim (a temporary religious settlement) of the papists today undermines all our affairs? Do you think I should return to this feigned way of life, where above all justice, piety is inverted with the appearance of plausible religion and, to say it once, whose works, even the most holy, are not done from faith or obedience to the word, but from human reason? They rely on their own justice, which they oppose to the judgment of God, safe enough if they believe in Christ, although they do not use it for salvation and justice.</p>
      <p>I do not say these things to flatter myself by saying I approve of this way of living, which I rejected long ago and have hitherto shown myself a vigorous and keen follower of Christ, whose task I diligently and evangelically attend to. But what do you do when struck by so many rams?</p>
      <p>I was once the greatest in the fellowship of the Carthusians, though now I am the least. Certainly, our Adam Bartholomew, the licentiate, to whom you have written so often, has instituted the most sacred interimistic rites in Ulm and also performs them himself. He defends the canon of the mass, which he also uses in the mass publicly and defends. Then he is an advisor and helper to others to imitate him. And he offers me the most splendid condition of ecclesiastical ministry, if I comply with him. For he embraces me with the greatest favor from the time we lived together with Otto Henry.</p>
      <p>But again I ask, what do you do when you see in these lands all the learned men hanging in doubt and stumbling over the opinions about the Interim and being tormented by the obscure expectation of things? Not only men of the common sort, but even the highest, not only ambiguous, but also cultivated. Nor are these things said so that you think me wavering or limping. For I have not yet been able to persuade myself about the religion of this Adam or to teach anything with a violated and protesting conscience.</p>
      <p>It is not my plan to follow his gamble. And would that in this wavering time sustenance might come from elsewhere, so that it might be permitted to be free from all administration of ecclesiastical affairs.</p>
      <p>But as for what more closely pertains to the matter at hand for me, it is that I will use your advice, most learned Bullinger. You will therefore allow me to enjoy you in the Lord. While I intended to devote myself to the Carthusian life, I leave the world, as they call it. There then my father, rich in some way, but born of the highest rank among the peasants of Valais, is miserably afflicted, groaning over letters to be called away from the monastic institution, complaining that he is being deprived of his only beloved son, whom he had as his only legitimate one, etc. But while I refuse to obey, he fixes me with dire curses. And not long after, he dies from excessive grief. But what do my Carthusian monks say to this? They mock my father, killed by mental torment, and even flog him dead as if sinning with carnal affection and indulging too much. Then they console me with this from Moses, where those who said to their parents: "I do not know you," were the most observant of God's covenant.</p>
      <p>And why not? There then I, considering my father's anguish, which had fixed him to the bed, to console him, I contribute all my goods, which I had from my mother, long deceased, as my own, then also my father's goods, which were someday to return to me, to him with a written document or will (which monks about to die to the world are accustomed to do), so that from these goods of mine sold or used according to his judgment, he might have the comfort of old age in my place. But before this will could reach him from the Carthusian house in Freiburg im Breisgau to Valais, my father, consumed with grief, was taken away by death, lamented by me, his offspring. But my sisters, of whom there are two, seized the will with my goods as if they were the heirs of my father. But see the most unworthy thing. I contribute these my goods to my father for the solace of old age, and so that he might be less tormented in mind, then to render some benefit to the parent, as the words of the will state. But the notary added of his own, that these goods should be of the father and his heirs, when I by God made no mention of heirs, but the notary added this of his own, not ordered.</p>
      <p>And with this pretext, my sisters, even very rich with their husbands, protect themselves and use my goods as if their own, excluding me as if dead. For they judge with the whole papacy that I am dead to the world and that the will is confirmed by such a death (which by the authority and laws of the papists is valid). And although I assert that I am still alive, they claim against me that I am a perjured monk, an apostate, living only for the flesh and the loins, but being a living dead.</p>
      <p>But what about these things? I am poor, then increased with several children and in need of the goods of my parents, as much as anyone. Do you think I can rightly be excluded as illegitimate and spurious? Let us grant them that I am guilty and a breaker of vows, do you think I can be barred from the inheritance of my parents in the name of sins?</p>
      <p>The laws of the forum are different from those of heaven. Many disinherited by God according to the law of nations receive inheritances in the polity of the world. Therefore, I earnestly ask you through Christ Jesus, that if you know any of the senators in Zurich, who is usually sent to the public assemblies of the Swiss for common causes, you ask him in my name what needs to be done. For I know that I will obtain nothing from the papist judges of my Valais except a club and a cross. However, before the public judgment of the Swiss, I could have achieved something. It would be impious to judge so severely against me, who slipped in the apprenticeship of age. For if the years had been present, I would have seen to my affairs more rightly. The opposing party has letters or a will, where I voluntarily offer them my goods as if dying to the world. They protect themselves with this writing and will strangle the voice of my throat, if ever we are to go to court, not to mention that a person dead to life can neither do nor ought to do anything. You certainly understand what I mean. And again, I beseech you by our common homeland, that if you have a little free time, you explain to me what I seek and take up this cause as a patron.</p>
      <p>Then about Theodor Bibliander, whom Frecht has recently warned me about, who had given us hope of elucidating the Bible, I wonder why he keeps his work hidden for so long.</p>
      <p>All the learned judge that the writings of this man are most complete. And about Dr. Conrad Gesner, whether he is going to publish a second, more extensive volume of the Bibliotheca, about which it should not be troublesome for you to write even a little word, I ask through this your paternal affection, with which you embrace all the learned and studious sons of your Switzerland, compensating also with some service, if you confer anything on me. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given on the second of Agnes in the year of restored salvation 1550. Peter Venetscher, ecclesiastic of Blaubeuren, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious of all who are among the learned of Switzerland, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the highest preacher in Zurich, to be observed and most esteemed in the Lord.</p>
