    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Some time ago, Frey had his response [HBBW XIX, No. 2866] to two letters from Bullinger [not received] delivered by Samuel [correct: Josua Wyttenbach]. Now he does not want to let Michael [Schlatter], who is traveling to Zurich, go without any letter, even though Schlatter, as Bullinger's [former] talented colleague, is well known to him and would not need any recommendation. It might be taken the wrong way if Frey let him go without a recommendation. After all, he is Frey's best friend in Biel, to whom he can entrust everything. Therefore, Bullinger should assist Schlatter just as he would for Frey.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Schlatter will ask for support for his sons [Michael and...] in Zurich. They have so far attended the Latin school led by Frey. They have learned well, behaved well, have not done anything wrong, and are worthy of being supported. No one will regret having supported them. Therefore, Bullinger should assist them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] With this, Frey has only addressed part of Schlatter's matter, [because he himself will report further], especially since Bullinger and Schlatter know each other well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Frey and his family are well. However, Frey's workload is steadily increasing! Bullinger knows this, as he was once a teacher himself. Unfortunately, Frey (probably unlike Bullinger at the time) has no helper. If his burden does not soon decrease, he will have to ask the people of Zurich for help, as he no longer has any time left for study. His godfather Schlatter will be able to report more extensively on this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also from Frey's wife [...].</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Recently, I responded to your two letters through Samuel, dearest father. Now, as Master Michael is hastening to you, I could not allow him to go without a letter. For although he is known to you as a brother, as one endowed with the same function from the Lord as you, and as a faithful preacher of the gospel, he may commend himself more by his own merits than by my recommendation. However, what was my duty, I could not omit, lest I be marked with the crime of ingratitude towards him and impropriety. Indeed, I have no firmer friend here than him, although I have some very firm ones, nor is there anyone with whom I can share my plans more safely or usefully. Therefore, I sincerely wish him well and pray that you may assist his cause with no less zeal than if it were my own.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>His sons, about whom he is now concerned and has come to seek your help, I have had in my school as teachable and obedient, honest and so far blameless, truly deserving of a richer fortune. If they live, I hope it will not be regretted by their parent, nor by you, nor by anyone who promotes them. Therefore, I pray (and what I pray, I also hope) that your support will not be lacking to them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>As for the matter of my friend, I have touched on it more sparingly than I should have, but only with you, to whom he is better known, so that there is no need for more words.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding my own affairs, so that I say something, accept these very few words: I am indeed very well with my family, but to the labors (which you know are not few, as you once also, but perhaps not without an assistant, devoted yourself to teaching boys) other labors are added, which unless they are soon either removed or diminished (since in this way it will not be free to devote myself to the muses), I will be forced to seek your help. You will be able to learn the whole matter from my godfather Michael.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>My wife sends her greetings to you. You will greet all yours with my words. Farewell. From Biel, the day before the Ides of June 1547. Yours as you know, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most revered father.</p>
