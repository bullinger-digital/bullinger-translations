    <p xml:id="regest1">Was pleased with Bullinger's letter. Congratulates him on the peace and tranquility in the Swiss churches and is glad that the Bernese conflict is over; wonders about its origin. The people of Biberach are convinced that after Luther's response [to the Swiss], unity among the churches will be achieved. Bullinger's publications are appreciated by him, Martin Frecht, and others, and they suspect that he is not unapproachable in the matter of the Lord's Supper; asks him to continue and to show himself accommodating despite concerns. Was happy to assist the letter carrier. Hopes that their correspondence will continue. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letter, most distinguished man, has filled me with the greatest joy, partly because you renew the mutual duty of writing between us, which has been interrupted not by any ill will or even suspicion, but by complete and firm friendship, and partly because I have been informed that the churches with you are doing well.</p>
      <p>I rejoice and congratulate both you, who are my pillar, and the churches advancing to the peak with perpetual tranquility and peace. You should think no differently about ours, which are endowed with the same tranquility, by the grace of God. I am also greatly pleased that the little cloud that arose in Bern was immediately dispelled and calmed by a happy and serene north wind. However, I wonder who stirred up these troubles, whether it was one of the brothers or someone else?</p>
      <p>A copy of Luther's letters has also been brought to us, and we fully understand their meaning, as he wishes to interpret the words of the Supper as simply as possible, and we are firmly convinced that there will be the greatest concord among the churches.</p>
      <p>Thus, your most learned works on baptism and others, which please and are approved by us and the most learned man, my father Martin Frecht of Ulm, and all the best people in a remarkable way, give us the conjecture that you will not be difficult in the matter of the Supper. Therefore, continue, most learned Bullinger, in your books, which we always expect with the greatest desire, to promote the church of Christ and at the same time diligently instruct us for its benefit. And if any scruple remains, I beg you, for the love of Christ and us, to show yourself accommodating.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have assisted the one who brought your letters to me, for your sake, with the diligence and effort I could, by consulting and approaching the council and otherwise helping with a willing spirit.</p>
      <p>And I pray that the exchange of letters between us does not cease, as it has so far. You will greet Caspar Megander, my most esteemed brother and lord, and the Millers, my relatives, in my words as courteously as you can. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Biberach, March 20, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Bartholomäus Müller, preacher of Biberach.</p>
      <p>To the most renowned and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor and preacher in Zurich, my dearest brother and father in Christ.</p>
