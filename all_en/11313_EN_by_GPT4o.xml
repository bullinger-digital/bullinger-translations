    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a letter and money shipment. Sends him Vigilius’ [“Against Eutyches”], inquires whether he wishes to have the Chronicle of [Burchard of] Ursberg in Hedio's translation, and forwards him the Sedulius volume, which Oporinus handed over to him. Grynaeus, Myconius, and others are fighting against having to accept the doctoral degree; Gwalther has heard with concern that their opponent Karlstadt, who seeks to co-opt the council for his purposes, wants to return to Zurich.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter and the money from Michael, dearest patron. I give you immense thanks for not neglecting your former kindness towards me. But why, I ask, was there a need for such an exact calculation of the coins? It would have sufficed to write how much is still left; for I am not unaware that you take no less care in safeguarding mine as you do your own.</p>
      <p>I am sending you Vigilius here; it costs 2 blapphart. I did not dare to send the Chronicle of Ursberg, because I do not quite understand which version you would like. Crato Milius printed the German Chronicle in Strasbourg, translated by Hedio from the Ursberg history; he added an appendix to these histories up to the year 1539. If you want that or another, write to me; I will then ensure it is delivered to you immediately. Here you have the Sedulius given by Oporinus.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write, except that here both Grynaeus and Myconius are very busy and are contending with others about the doctorate in theology; for Karlstadt has contrived so much, as I hear, that even the senate has decreed that Myconius and Grynaeus, and whoever are archbishops or professors of theology, should take on the degree of doctor. Myconius and Grynaeus are strongly opposing this decree, preferring to leave Basel rather than accept the title of doctor.</p>
      <p>The outcome is still in doubt. But in summary: Karlstadt is restless; he sometimes appeases the senators with gifts so that they favor his side.</p>
      <p>He will see for himself what he does. There is a rumor that he very much desires to return to Zurich; I wish this guest of my homeland not at all.</p>
      <p>Greet the whole family in my name, and especially your brother. Farewell, most humane patron, and may God keep you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>From Basel, at the house of Mr. Myconius, May 12, 1539. The courier here is a servant of Adam Fry, a native of Zurich; entrust him with what you wish; he is honest and will diligently take care of everything.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the truly learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron.</p>
