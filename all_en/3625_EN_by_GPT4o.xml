      <p>Greetings. I have nothing special, dearest brother and godfather, yet I have sent this to you so that our Lindinerus does not return to you empty-handed and completely without letters. We live here by the grace of God quite well with effort and great work, etc.</p>
      <p>The assembly is being held in Baden; we hear nothing about what is happening there. There is a rumor that soldiers are to be requested from the Swiss by the king; I assert nothing certain.</p>
      <p>The King of France has led his armies and besieged Thionville on the borders of Lorraine and the Duchy of Luxembourg on the Meuse, not far from the city of Metz.</p>
      <p>It is said that he is very troublesome to the city with his cannons. Strasbourg fears for itself and has prepared a garrison of 10 banners, 6 outside the city, 4 within. From Germany, the younger Duke of Saxony, the captured elector's son, and the landgrave's son have led a notable cavalry into France. It is said that the French have 10 legions of German infantry; I call a legion what is today called a "regiment," having 10 banners. Philip is making great preparations at Maastricht (commonly called Ma√ütrycht) and perhaps is already moving against the French.</p>
      <p>The instigator of this mournful tragedy was the one who now revels in Rome as if in a tavern. May the Lord, the just judge, repay him.</p>
      <p>A contrary rumor is brought from Thionville. For some say the city has been attacked and captured with great slaughter of the victorious French, others say the French have been repelled and frustrated in their hopes. - From Vienna, it is reported that there is fear Ferdinand may initiate persecution against the faithful, and that the Turk may also wage war. How I wish at this time that Lord Friedrich had not descended into those parts, from which he will not emerge without great danger.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect and bring him back! His two boys left without greeting me and without deserving such. I wrote, as soon as I understood they had left, to Friedrich and Caspar von Salis; I sent letters to the most honorable man, Lord Ambrosius Martin, but I fear they may not have been delivered to those already on their journey; if you have any certainty about this matter, let me know. I am not at all pleased with the boys and those who indulge them, etc.</p>
      <p>Here you have part of my labors; with God's will, you will soon receive a more extensive work of another kind; I am already toiling on it. Live and farewell with all good things.</p>
      <p>I wrote very hastily and poorly. June 24, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
