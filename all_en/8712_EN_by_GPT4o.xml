      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, my willing service to you, etc. in advance. Know that your letter along with the letters for Augsburg and Nuremberg have reached me well by courier.</p>
      <p>With God's help, I will deliver them as per the given instructions. Herewith a letter, which reached me before the given date, writes to me, for which I am very grateful, how the traitors in England, with the help of the Antichrist's member, the Duke of Alba, have directed their plans, which, with God's help, have failed, for which we rightly have to praise God. You will learn everything in his writing. I also thank you very much for the two copies; I will send them to you with the first reliable messenger. Before the given date, we have letters from Augsburg and Nuremberg, in which the victory over the Turks is confirmed; praise be to the Lord. The Venetians, the Pope, and the Spanish Armada did not achieve it, only the Almighty God has had mercy on the poor captive Christians. Herewith in print, as it has been sent to us. From Lyon, we have not received a letter in 5 weeks. As soon as I have something certain, I will inform you first. I will not spare myself to serve. I hope that Zily will have been with you.</p>
      <p>My dutiful request, to greet my dear lord Walther on my behalf, thanking him for his friendly writing; I will deliver his letter as per the given instructions. My gracious beloved lords, I wish to show you my entire humble service. God's grace be with us all; may He preserve you and yours, amen, etc. In ill.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant always, Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>I have unfortunately heard that God the Lord J. Gorussen from Ulm is said to have attacked you, which grieves me greatly. May the Almighty God strengthen him with His grace, and let him and us all enjoy the precious merit of His beloved Son, our Lord Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned sir Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, faithful servant of the Church of Christ, my dear lord in Zurich.</p>
