    <p xml:id="regest1">Among those called by God into the kingdom of light is also Reekamp, who should continue to follow his calling, and in whom the Lord may complete what He began when He freed him from the [papacy] and led him to the true religion, so that Reekamp may also lead other people to eternal life. Paul was once also commissioned by God for this purpose [Acts 16:9f]. Reekamp's proclamation can be achieved through the establishment of schools and the appointment of scientifically and theologically educated pious men (like Reekamp); these should provide instruction based on the Holy Scriptures to train more people to become evangelists and church servants. The following should be taught: the truth of the divine Holy Scriptures, the perfection in Jesus Christ, the human [hopeless] condition, redemption through Christ, justification by faith, and sanctification; furthermore: what false religion is, false righteousness, false faith, true worship, superstition; the proper use of the sacraments and prayer to God [alone] through Jesus Christ should be restored, and the schemes of the pope should be exposed so that everyone understands that Christ does not need a representative on earth, but is Himself the head of the church; furthermore, there should be discussions about almsgiving and state affairs. What is heard must also be put into action, as Christ taught [Luke 11:28]; therefore, false teaching must be combated, as well as the idolatry of the [pope], the papist masses, the crimes against the teachings [of Christ], blasphemies, cursing, adultery, fornication, drunkenness, debauchery; all this according to the word of the Apostle [Paul] and following the example of the kings who adhered to the teachings and eradicated all evil, such as Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah, followed by Constantine, Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius; for in the externals of religion, a large part of our faith is expressed; if someone worships images, participates in papist masses, or lives according to a monastic rule, but holds nothing of it, instead conceding everything to Christ and the truth, why does he not show it openly? The words of the Lord and of Paul are clear in this regard. Bullinger knows how small [cunning] the serpent [the devil] can make itself; thus, the Pharisees tolerated that Christ taught the truth, but when He took action and drove the merchants out of the temple, how angry they became! So too could the prince of this world [the devil] somewhat tolerate the preaching of the gospel, provided he would not suffer a loss of power, superstition and profanation would continue, and it would never come to action. But the weapons and instruments of superstition must be removed; people must be explained that the Antichrist has ruled until now; it is especially soothing when not only is abolished, but also rebuilt; in place of the eradicated evil, true worship of God is to be planted; in place of the idols and mass, the proclamation of the gospel and the holy rite of the Lord's Supper; in place of the language understood by only a few and the canonical hours of prayer, holy assemblies, public prayers, and the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures; likewise, the trade with masses, anniversaries, seventh, thirtieth, vigils, and grave prayers and the doctrine of purgatory is to be abolished; the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection, and eternal life are to be proclaimed, and a public almsgiving system is to be established. Reekamp should furthermore ensure honestly and faithfully that daily preaching is done in simplicity and for the benefit of the listeners; the errors and transgressions of the people are to be reproved; pious pastors should help the fallen, erring, and sick, refute the schismatics, and piously administer the sacraments, living vigilantly and blamelessly in all things, so that when all this is introduced in all churches, no one would have anything to criticize; should an evil opponent arise, stir up strife, and proceed to persecution, one should remember the words of Christ; Bullinger does not approve of those who, before they have tried everything, leave their churches and abandon them to evil people, even to ruin; Reekamp should therefore not leave his own, unless his situation is hopeless, or he could entrust his sheep to another; for Christ, who is stronger and mightier than all the kings of the world, something must be risked; trust is to be placed in Him; for Him, even a cruel death is to be accepted, all the while with caution and prayer. Nothing is to be expected from the emperor or the diet; one must obey God more than men [Acts 5:29]; the highest judge is Christ, who will soon come and to whom all, including kings and princes, must give an account on the Last Day; if the emperor, who has conspired with the pope until now, wants to be a good prince, he will instruct Reekamp to reform the churches according to the standard of the gospel; also from the imperial estates, which have mostly recognized the pope until now, nothing is to be expected; they promised a reformation twenty years ago, but cunningly took care of their wealth; Reekamp should rather consider how he will account for himself on the soon-to-arrive Last Day; he should no longer hesitate and rather cry out with David: "The Lord is my helper..." [Ps 118:6]. Bullinger sends him writings he has authored [published in: "De scripturae sanctae authoritate... deque episcoporum... institutione et functione... Accessit... Responsio ad Ioannis Cochlei... libellum", Zurich, Christoph Froschauer, 1544], because these deal extensively with the establishment and reformation of schools, church servants, reformation of churches, and dealing with opponents; he asks for a favorable reception, even if Reekamp does not need his help, especially since he has famous scholars like Johannes a Lasco and Hermann Aquilomontanus by his side. He asks Reekamp for a good reception of this letter; even if they both live very far apart, they are united by one spirit; Reekamp should indicate at the next autumn fair whether he has received this letter. Greetings also to his own from Megander, Rudolf Gwalther, Erasmus Fabricius, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and Konrad Gessner, as well as from all other lecturers, professors, deacons, and brothers.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I give thanks to God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, that from all nations and all orders of men, He calls from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light, grace, salvation, and His most beloved Son, whose works He soon uses to call others also, and many more, to eternal life.</p>
      <p>Among this number, you too are, venerable Father in the Lord and most esteemed Lord, as testified and proclaimed by those who come to us from your regions and neighboring areas or write letters. I congratulate you on that ineffable happiness and blessedness of yours; I pray to the Lord, from whom you received that inestimable benefit, that He may confirm and complete what He began in you, and I finally urge you to serve your calling and devote yourself entirely to it, considering above all for what purpose you were called by the Lord. He called you out of Egypt, from the servitude of Pharaoh, from Pharisaism, and finally from Antichristianism, certainly so that you may abandon all impiety and superstition and never admit them once abandoned. He called you to His eternal kingdom, to the participation of His most beloved Son, to true religion and true worship of God in true faith through the word of the eternal and most truthful God, so that you may be saved and freed, rightly worship and revere God, and be an author of eternal salvation and true worship of God in the faith of Jesus Christ through the eternal gospel to all yours, I say, entrusted to your faith and subjected to your dominion. Therefore, the merciful and compassionate Lord desires to bind you to Himself in these lands with an indissoluble bond and covenant, and after you are released from here, to place you with Him in His eternal kingdom, but not alone. You are the head and leader; many people look to you as their leader and prince, whom Christ intends to unite to Himself through your industry and grant eternal life. O happy you, if accompanied by a great multitude of saints, who through the grace of God have become true worshipers of God with you as their apostle and counselor, you come into the presence of the Savior and His holy angels. O miserable you, if, neglecting that noble and holy calling of yours, you have placed the talent entrusted to you wrapped in a napkin in the ground.</p>
      <p>The Lord Jesus wants you to ascend to heaven and indeed with much glory and majesty, with a great multitude of the faithful. Therefore, act and accommodate yourself to such a munificent benefactor.</p>
      <p>You will accommodate yourself if you promote with all diligence that by which the salvation of men is made known and learned. You read in the Acts of the Apostles that Paul had a vision by night, that a man of Macedonia stood by him, beseeching him and saying: "Come over into Macedonia and help us" [Acts 16:9]. And Luke adds: "And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel unto them" [Acts 16:10]. Behold, help is given to men through the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ; for through this it is made known to the world what kind of men we are, that we are all sinners, that sins are freely forgiven through the intervention of the blood of Jesus Christ. Here He is most clearly depicted to us through the gospel, described and even set before our eyes, in whom alone is salvation, righteousness, peace, joy, and perfection.</p>
      <p>Therefore, to save and gain many for Christ, there is a need primarily for evangelical preaching. You will promote it in this way: First of all, you will establish schools, and those just and sincere. To this end, colleges and monasteries, which were once also schools and hospices for the poor, must be converted, as even pontifical books testify. It must be ensured above all that you have at hand men learned and practiced in good letters and sacred scripture, grave, orthodox, and zealous for piety, who teach and expound the sacred letters, showing how they can be rightly understood and sincerely, simply, and with much fruit explained to the people. For this purpose must be set, that those who lecture form preachers, and those who are listeners learn to preach, that is, to interpret the scriptures, to teach, to confirm, to refute, to admonish, to exhort, to console, to counsel. In these, they should exercise themselves both in writing and teaching, be wholly in these, devote themselves entirely to these, and turn all their other studies to this. And it may be more difficult to find such teachers, that is, suitable ones, practiced in sacred matters and the art of speaking, pious also and alien to the spirit of contention, than listeners who are rightly formed. But to one who is willing and sincerely willing, nothing is difficult, nor does Christ abandon those who call upon Him and seek the edification of the church. You have in colleges and monasteries, also scattered in cities, happy talents, devoted to piety and good studies. Collect them diligently and consecrate them to those studies of Christ, that is, to become evangelists and ministers of the churches. Thus, ecclesiastical resources will finally return to their ancient and legitimate use, nor will the farmer be reluctant to pay tithes and revenues to those he sees watching over the common salvation. And this is indeed one way by which you will promote evangelical preaching; for from this Christian and evangelical school will come forth excellent and practiced teachers, who will plant and preserve the most illustrious churches for God and Christ with the word of truth, holy prayers, the legitimate use of the sacraments, studies of righteousness and innocence, a matter which, as there is none more precious, so there is none equally necessary.</p>
      <p>Then it will not be necessary to wait until they grow up; for immediately it must be diligently seen that you have some men who even now, without any delay and procrastination, announce the gospel to the people subject to you; for it seems to us by no means permissible to be surpassed in this matter by the children of this world. There is a king and prince who, with much expense and great labors, forms servants for himself from childhood, yet he does not lack ministers in the meantime, while they grow up. Therefore, it must be ensured above all that you have good, honest, learned, and modest men, who now begin to instill in all your churches into all minds and hearts what is the first and infallible truth, that God has spoken here through the prophets and apostles, whence it follows that certain and absolute truth is contained in the scriptures; therefore, this and all manner of life must be sought from the scriptures. Again, what is that to which the whole scripture refers, the highest good, life, blessedness, holiness, righteousness, and perfection in Christ Jesus our Lord. Here, therefore, it must be taught what and what kind of powers are ours, how we are restored through Christ, how through Him we are justified by faith, what is the nature of the restored, how faith works in us, what are the studies of the saints.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on the opposite side, it must be demonstrated what is false religion, righteousness, faith, etc. These must be proposed so clearly from the secrets of the scriptures without immodesty and scurrility, that even the most profane may not be unwilling to hear or not understand. True worship of God must be taught, superstition must be opposed, the true use of the sacraments must be taught, and their horrible profanation must be refuted, prayer and invocation of the name of God through Christ Jesus must be restored, the arts of the Antichrist, the Roman pope, and his members must be exposed, so that no one may not understand that Christ does not have a vicar on earth, but is Himself the head of His church, present in His spirit, power, and operation, and is the only and eternal king and high priest, who alone suffices for the faithful, in whom He lives through faith and they in Him. Now also about almsgiving and its just use, about political works and rightly instituted polity and honoring the magistrate, the evangelical leader will diligently dispute and form the minds of all.</p>
      <p>Wherever Christ, true piety, faith, charity, and true worship of God have been faithfully, clearly, simply, and evidently preached, and there are none or few or those who do not labor in ignorance but malice, who do not understand what Christ, what Antichrist, what truth, what falsehood, what religion, what superstition is, now also the hand must be added and contemplation brought into practice. "Blessed," says the Savior, "are those who hear the word of God and do it, indeed keep it" [Luke 11:28]. Therefore, it is not enough to preach, to hear, unless you also do what is preached and heard. The Savior cries out: "Why do you call me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?" [Luke 6:46]. And the Apostle Paul: "They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate" [Titus 1:16]. Therefore, false doctrine must be prohibited, all that Antichrist idolatry must be removed from the midst, idols along with all worship, papal masses with all the profanation of the sacraments; crimes contrary to the holy doctrine of our Savior, blasphemies and execrations, adulteries, fornication, drunkenness, luxury, and if there are any other things of this kind must be proscribed. For the Apostle clearly commands that we remove evil from our midst; he also deals much against the eating of things offered to idols for sincere religion. And in ancient history, we read about the most holy kings, that they first indeed repaired the doctrine, then abolished, removed, and cut off, leaving no trace, whatever seemed adverse to the saving doctrine of God. But you will say I am speaking when you have read the deeds of Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah in the books of Kings and Chronicles or Paralipomenon. Our kings also followed their example, Constantine, Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius, who, as it stands in the Code of Justinian, not only helped Christian doctrine with their laws, but also proscribed, condemned, and trampled all paganism. For in that external religion is a good part of our confession. For he who worships before idols, who makes himself a participant in the papal mass, who still lives according to the rule of Benedict or another monk, who still wears the cloak or garment of that one, by the very habit, by the very worship, openly and in the sight of all confesses and even silently speaks that his mind still clings to them; for if he attributes nothing to these, if he attributes all to Christ and the truth of the gospel, why does he not, having cast off and left these, carry these forward, act, and confess with his mouth, habit, and finally with every gesture and operation? Or is it not clear what the Lord says in the gospel? "Whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels" [Mark 8:38]. And again: "Whoever confesses me before men, him will I confess also before my Father who is in heaven. But whoever denies me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven" [Matthew 10:32-33]. Nor is that of Paul obscure: "Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness, and what communion has light with darkness, and what concord has Christ with Belial, or what part has a believer with an unbeliever, or what agreement has the temple of God with idols?</p>
      <p>For you are the temple of the living God, as God has said: I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Therefore, come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean, and I will receive you" etc. 2 Corinthians 6:14-17. The same apostle elsewhere: "You cannot," he says, "drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the Lord's table and the table of demons" [1 Corinthians 10:20], and again: "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them" [Ephesians 5:11], "abstain from every form of evil" [1 Thessalonians 5:23]. But I know how here that tortuous serpent twists itself into volumes. For even then the Pharisees bore the doctrine of truth in Christ somewhat; but when He put His hand to the work and drove out the sellers and buyers with a whip of cords from the sacred house, adding: "Take these things away and do not make my Father's house a house of merchandise" [John 2:16], good God, how the profane merchants rage! And the prince of this world could somewhat bear the free preaching of the gospel, provided in the meantime he remained in possession and superstition and profanation of sacred things were nonetheless exercised; that is, he would bear the words somewhat, provided the works did not follow.</p>
      <p>But in the gospel, we read: "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are in peace; but when a stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes from him all his armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils" [Luke 11:21-22].</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is necessary to take away the arms, vessels, and instruments of superstition; it is necessary to tear down the Satanic fortress, so that now the King of kings alone, Christ and the true high priest, may reign in the church and His institutions may prevail and flourish. It is indeed intolerable to many men of this world if they are stripped of all worship by which they have hitherto believed they served God. But they will also be appeased if they hear that God is not pleased with this worship, but irritated; if they hear and it is continually inculcated to them the word of God, which condemns and commands to remove those things, if they hear that these have hitherto been times of ignorance, in which that unhappy Antichrist reigned, obscuring or plainly abolishing all of Christ and instituting different or contrary things. But it will especially appease if you do not, like some, only destroy and build nothing. For it is necessary to remember that word of the Lord: "I have set you this day over the nations, to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to throw down, to build and to plant" [Jeremiah 1:10]. Therefore, in place of the evils you have uprooted, you will plant good things pleasing to God and true worship of God, so that no one may rightly complain that he is stripped of all worship of God. You have removed idols, which were called the pictures and letters of the laity and were worshiped; replace them with the preaching of the word and living and true speaking letters; command true worshipers to worship God, to lift their faces to heaven; command the poor, substitutes of Christ, to be worshiped and adorned. Thus, I say, you have eradicated and planted; you have abolished the mass, which was sold as a sacrifice for the living and the dead, etc. Replace it with the preaching of the gospel, which illustrates the power and effect of the unique and eternal sacrifice of Jesus Christ; replace it with the salutary rite of the Lord's Supper. Let the people be exhorted, make them diligently, according to the apostolic doctrine, to offer their bodies as a living, holy, acceptable sacrifice, a reasonable service, etc. You have cast out from the sacred house the language understood by few along with those canonical hours celebrated little canonically; replace immediately in place sacred assemblies and public prayers, replace at certain hours the exposition of the sacred letters or prophecy, which Paul describes in 1 Corinthians 14:26-40. You do not want trade to be exercised in the temple of God, you do not want the people to buy masses, anniversaries, seventh, thirtieth, vigils, and grave prayers anymore; take care that now the living are well and rightly instructed, so that they may happily and in faith depart even without fear of purgatory, but also rightly understand these articles of faith: "I believe in the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of this flesh, and eternal life" and hold firmly that from the death of the body the souls are immediately carried by the power of Christ into the eternal homeland, as John 3:16; 5:21, 24; 6:40; 11:25-26 clearly teaches. Restore public almsgiving, by which you save the souls of the poor, the old, the orphans, the widows, the afflicted, the sick; for these uses, spend what has hitherto been collected for the salvation of the souls of the deceased.</p>
      <p>Do likewise in the rest.</p>
      <p>Finally, take care and ensure with utmost faith and diligence that the word of the Lord runs, that it is announced sincerely, faithfully, assiduously, daily, simply, and so that the listeners may derive some fruit from it. Errors and sins and crimes that are in the people must be reproved, nor should pious pastors cease before they see repentance follow. They effectively persuade the constant study of virtues; they commend truly, from faith through the Holy Spirit, in charity good works and indeed good ones, which God, the only good, has judged to be good through His word.</p>
      <p>They exhort the idle, raise the fallen, bring back the erring, care for the sick, console the afflicted, restrain the fierce with the word of truth, refute schisms and false doctrines. In all things and through all things, they watch, live blamelessly, religiously dispense the sacraments. If these things are done in this way piously, holy, and religiously through all the churches entrusted to your faith and subjected to your dominion, who, I pray, will oppose, who, I ask, unless manifestly and openly perverse, will say that you sin even a little in true religion? But if Satan stirs up some to sow dissensions among brothers and seeks whom he may devour, you will think of what our prince and Lord Jesus Christ foretold us all in Matthew 10:16-23, in John 15:18-21 and 16:2-3, 33, and among other things: "Blessed," He says, "are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before us" [Matthew 5:10-12]. I do not approve of the counsels of those who, before they have tried everything, leave their churches and abandon them to perverters, indeed to be destroyed, while they consult their own peace. Therefore, I would not want you to withdraw from yours unless everything is hopeless unless you have substituted another who will care for your sheep. Something must be dared for Christ, who never abandons those who call upon Him; He is stronger and more powerful than all the kings of this world; in Him, all your trust must be placed, and all things must be endured, which He wills you to endure for the sake of truth, even that bitter death, now for Christ no longer bitter, but gentle and glorious. Meanwhile, nothing must be attempted rashly, but all things must be done prudently, and the Lord must be prayed to at every moment, that He may provide counsel, strength, success, and a happy end of all things.</p>
      <p>You must not look to Caesar Augustus in this matter, nor await the imperial diet: Christ must be looked to, who is the supreme king and high priest of His church. Caesar is a man and not God, and it is more necessary to obey God than men [Acts 5:29]. Christ is the supreme judge, who will soon come with all His saints and chosen angels to judge and celebrate that great assembly long expected by the faithful from the beginning of the world. But all, even kings and princes, must be manifested before the tribunal of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. To this assembly, I pray, turn your eyes.</p>
      <p>The judge will not ask whether you have obeyed Caesar in all things and in everything, but whether you have believed the word of the judge Christ, whether you have observed His command; those who have done the commands of kings and princes, enemies of the word of God, or have been hindered by them from doing what they have recognized in their hearts and conscience to be done, will be condemned with them. Caesar has hitherto been sworn to the pope and still is; therefore, he will compel you either to receive or retain the mark of the beast. But if he wishes to perform the office of a good prince, he will command you to reform the churches according to the standard of the gospel, which you are now doing with greater praise and great salvation of your people voluntarily. The estates of the empire, for the most part, still recognize the Roman pontiff. What, therefore, you expect from such a reformation, you understand; indeed, they have already promised reformation for more than 20 years.</p>
      <p>What has followed? They have consulted their affairs with delay and deceived many with vain hope, cunningly retaining them, lest they proceed in the work of Christ. If you wish to look to these and await the happy outcome of the diets, you will be preoccupied by death, snatched to the terrible tribunal of the most just judge, before you reform anything in your churches. Now think, what will you then answer to the most just judge. Therefore, do not delay any longer; for that day does not delay for us; we expect it hourly, indeed momentarily. Caesar is subject to God, the estates of the empire are subject to the laws of God. If you now sin nothing against God, nothing against the word of the eternal God, what will they have to object to you?</p>
      <p>Act, proceed in Christ, reform your churches, do the duty of a pious man and prince, complete what you are called to and cry out with David: "The Lord is my helper; I will not fear what man can do to me" [Psalm 118 (Vulg. 117):6]. Because in these little books, which I send here to your humanity, I discuss more copiously about establishing and reforming schools, about ministers of the churches, and about reforming churches, what finally can be answered to our enemies who oppose us (those who are attempting and completing reformation), it seemed advisable to me to give them to you. I pray, however, that you kindly accept this little gift from your most devoted one and read through it. I wanted to testify to you my readiness of mind towards you with this little gift; for your piety will promise you this about me, as about a most closely connected brother. But thanks be to God, who has endowed you in all things so that you do not need my works; for not to mention your other resources, has not the Lord sent you a unique man, who can be for many kingdoms? I think of the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes a Lasco, the Pole. He left royal wealth for Christ and has most openly testified that he prefers heavenly things far above earthly ones; the same, being practiced in every kind of learning, of the greatest name among all learned and good men, will be able to advise and be present with you in serious matters perpetually. You have at hand my Mr. Herman Aquilomontanus, both learned and good man; he and many other men will devote themselves to you and to Christ. We will all help you with writings, if you wish and it is necessary; the churches will help with holy and fervent prayers. Dare now something and proceed in Christ; He will abundantly supply you with counsel, courage, and strength to complete every good. Amen.</p>
      <p>I have written these things candidly and simply; I beseech your humanity to consider these my things kindly; for although I dwell in the Helvetians near the roots of the Alps and indeed at the very roots, you act among the Frisians in the German Ocean, yet one spirit has joined us both, so that I sincerely wish you well and wish all good things to all yours. Farewell with all yours, venerable Father in Christ and most esteemed Lord. I would eagerly wish, unless it would be troublesome to you, that you would briefly indicate at the next autumn fair in Frankfurt whether you have received this of mine. The most pious symmists and our brothers Mr. Gaspar Megander, Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, Mr. Erasmus Fabricius, Mr. Konrad Pellikan, Mr. Theodor Bibliander, Mr. Mr. Konrad Gessner, and all other lecturers, professors, deacons, and brothers send you greetings and wish all good things to you and all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 24, in the year of our Lord 1544.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich (the primary city in the Helvetians), yours entirely from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the venerable Father and Lord Mr. Johannes Reekamp, abbot of the monastery of Aduard, in Great Frisia, his most honorable Lord.</p>
