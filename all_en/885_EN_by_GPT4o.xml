      <p>God be with us all. Especially trusted lord and brother, regarding your last letter, written on April 11, I briefly inform you; when one hears one part and not both, it is only half: My lord Mayor Hab, who is a truly faithful man, especially in faith, does not at all admit that he helped or advised that the magician should now deal with his devil's conjuring, even if those from Baden write again. When those from Baden kept the advice of the common Confederates, those who are with the Gospel advised faith, improvement, and prayer, and that sorcery should be dealt with; the others advised to proceed with the matter as it had begun. This was told to those from Baden. They have taken the following or the other advice. What does this concern my lord mayor? If those from Winterthur had done right by him, they would have been spared the trouble; yet each one blames the other for his disgrace.</p>
      <p>I wonder who sent so much grain there. I had it inspected in one place where it might bring some good, etc.; besides, I kept it for my own, which is not taken by any officials, and it is all good, all mine. It is heard here in the annual report; one must consider it good. The honest people who pay tithes and dues to our foundation have brought little else; we are glad of this and cannot complain of any danger.</p>
      <p>Klingenzell lies in the bailiwick of Thurgau, and if it comes to a right (which cannot be dismissed by any means), it would be lost without all that. The pious people of Ramsen have been taken to Stocken; they could not resist the right, as they partly belong to Nellenburg; they have lost the right. My lords have done their best, sent to Innsbruck, etc.</p>
      <p>As other Confederates noticed that it also wanted to go to Innsbruck, they intervened and made a treaty, which brought about the change; as far as it lay in my lords' authority, they would not have consented to it; nevertheless, my lords will still try if something can be obtained for Ramsen for the sake of the word. So much in haste. Consider it good. God be with you and all yours. Dated April 18, 1550. Greeting all our friends.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, now residing in Winterthur, his dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Winterthur.</p>
