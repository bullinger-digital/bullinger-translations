    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter and tried to find out the desired information. Knows from merchants that a Turkish commander [Hayreddin], called Barbarossa, has established his rule over Tunis, against which the Emperor is mobilizing soldiers; nevertheless, the Emperor will come to Milan in the spring. A dispute arose between Pope Paul III and the Duke [Francesco Maria I della Rovere] of Urbino, which could become the spark for a war. Has nothing else to report.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, most honorable Bullinger, and I have tried with as much diligence as I could to investigate the matters you wish to know.</p>
      <p>From the reports of merchants, we have learned that the Turkish commander, known as Barbarossa, has begun to establish a kingdom in the place where Carthage once stood;</p>
      <p>the Italians call it Tunis. The Emperor, as they say, is going to enlist some soldiers from Germany and send them there. Nevertheless, they say he will come to Milan in the spring.</p>
      <p>Also, some disturbances have arisen between Pope Paul III and the Duke of Urbino. The daughter of a certain prince, having passed away, remained the sole survivor of her entire lineage. The most holy one sought her as a bride for his son, but since he was slow, the Duke of Urbino took her away and betrothed her to his own son. This might perhaps be the spark of war among those ambitious and stubborn men.</p>
      <p>Nothing else is reported that would concern or delight you.</p>
      <p>From Chur, the first of February, 1535.</p>
      <p>Devoted to you, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the excellent and most learned man, M. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the church of Zurich, his esteemed lord.</p>
