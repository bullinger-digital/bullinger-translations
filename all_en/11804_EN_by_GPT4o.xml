      <p>Dear sir and brother.</p>
      <p>Felix Pfest has been delegated to the city assembly in Frankfurt. The Emperor is reportedly coming to Kempten, Memmingen, Ulm, and Speyer in Southern Germany, as the war in the Netherlands is intensifying. It is certain news that the Turk, with an army of 300,000 strong, personally arrived in Belgrade on the same day the Emperor arrived in Genoa, and is advancing towards Vienna; I suspect he is now in Buda or even further upstream.</p>
