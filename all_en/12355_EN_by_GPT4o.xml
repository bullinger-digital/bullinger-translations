      <p>Greetings. Those in the Low Countries under the Emperor are beginning to bear the burdens with difficulty, as they are increasingly weighed down day by day, to the extent that some cities are said to exclude him, claiming that it is enough if they fulfill what they are legally obligated to do.</p>
      <p>If only he would finally go to his own! For he has disturbed Germany too much until now.</p>
      <p>Soldiers coming from France spread the news that a new dissension has arisen between [Francis I] and the Emperor at the meeting of their envoys with those of [Henry VIII of] England. I do not know the cause, unless perhaps it is the plot against Turin, as they call it. Captain [Wilhelm] Frölich has been summoned by the king for this reason, as he believes.</p>
      <p>Someone from Strasbourg brought news yesterday that at the Bundestag in Frankfurt, these two things, among others, are to be addressed there, and perhaps have now been addressed: One, that the Schmalkaldic League will remain in the word of the Lord, whatever the council, the Emperor, and the diets may decide; the other, that henceforth no one should owe anything to another by virtue of the league, unless someone is attacked because of the word. More on this later.</p>
      <p>From the court of George, Count of Württemberg, and the young Duke [Christoph of Württemberg], it is reported that the Brunswick [Duke Henry] has been released, all possessions restored, and he himself has become a Protestant. It does not seem likely to me.</p>
      <p>You know about the Seven [Catholic] Places in Valais, what they have done. I wonder how your people and the others, whom the Lord has gifted with the gospel, will accept this. When I compare this with what is said to have been done at the last diets in Baden, I am greatly disturbed. I wanted you to know this, if you did not already know.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ. Basel, hastily, December 22, 1545. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
