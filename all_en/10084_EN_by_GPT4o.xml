      <p>Greetings and peace of conscience.</p>
      <p>It is not unknown to you, dearest Bullinger, what I have recently spoken with you, although not at leisure and according to the desire of my mind, as I was excluded by unfavorable circumstances. I wish you to take the utmost care of this matter. By the gift of God, you are now in a position where you can greatly assist a friend in distress. If ambition or another mental ailment, and not pressing hardship, made me a candidate, I would be worthy, in my opinion, to suffer rejection; however, since my affairs have been reduced to such a narrow state, I should be seen as asking this of you by right, not as seeking it ambitiously.</p>
      <p>I envy none of the competitors, least of all Rhellicanus, with whom I have long had a great friendship, and by whose right, I believe, given his faith and modesty, he would willingly yield to me if he knew how much danger I am in. I only ask that it be judged fairly whose fortune is worse and who should be more considered now. Of the others whom I have as competitors, none, as far as I know, have had their status diminished, but mine is so far from remaining intact that nothing remains for me but exile. For how can I, having professed Christ, sing in harmony with those who send me, or as they say, sing for the choir? This will have to be done soon, or I must resign from my office, not to mention the other evils that are gathering around me from all sides. Add to this what should be considered most. If we must all have regard for good letters, as many of us are students of them, we must ensure that they do not suffer any loss anywhere. Furthermore, whether Rhellicanus can be recalled to Bern without the loss of letters, let it be your judgment. To me, it seems no less important that he remains there, as long as he can, to promote good studies, than that Megander remains for the sake of asserting piety. If anyone thinks this should be turned against me, I reply that the condition of both is by no means the same. He acts safely in a free city with great fruit of studies and no less profit of his affairs. I, on the other hand, oppressed by miserable servitude, not only do not help letters, but besides the loss of my fortunes, I bring my own head and that of others into danger. That some grant citizens only to such functions, I neither praise nor blame at present. I only say that I am not entirely foreign. My wife is a citizen of Zurich, and I have always defended their authority as vigorously as if I were born there, which many can testify, and for which I have also incurred the envy I now burn with.</p>
      <p>Therefore, for Christ's sake, do your utmost to ensure that no one is preferred over me. Also, if Rhellicanus happens to arrive, remind him, if it can be done with his consent, to forgive our old friendship. Then also explain this to the others as diligently as you can. I cannot be more verbose in my own cause, perhaps I would be more eloquent in another's. I choose you as my patron. Do what you can.</p>
      <p>I would have gladly written to Pellicanus and the others if I had been given enough leisure by the messenger. Therefore, greet them in my name, and if it seems appropriate, also hand over this to be read, and farewell happily.</p>
      <p>Frauenfeld, the tenth of January in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your Petrus Dasypodius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, defender of pious and good letters, his friend.</p>
      <p>Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the cathedral, etc.</p>
