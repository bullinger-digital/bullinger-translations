      <p>Greetings. To the common letters, I believe, my beloved godfather Mr. Haller, my dearest godfather in the Lord, is responding.</p>
      <p>He shows us the beginnings of great matters, which are now being attempted in Saxony. We must pray to the Lord both privately and publicly, that He may be willing to assist with the strength of His spirit the efforts of those afflicted and placed in extreme need against the impiety and wickedness of the antichristians, and to provide for His churches according to His infinite providence. Otherwise, these movements will not remedy the evils of these times, but will rather bring about more intolerable disturbance and exacerbation of all things, unless we are aided by the grace and help of God.</p>
      <p>Nor should it be thought that your affairs, just as ours, are now being managed less than those of others. The danger is entirely common; if it goes badly for those who now expose their lives and all they have to danger, we will soon see the flames of this fire threatening our walls, which the most merciful Father may deign to avert. But concerning these matters, there is no need for me to remind your prudence. We must see to it that we are wise, so that we do not fail in piety and brotherly charity.</p>
      <p>I commend you, my dearest godfather in Christ, along with all yours, to the Lord. Greetings to all the lords and brothers there, and especially to your most honorable wife and children. My household is still quite peaceful by the grace of the Lord, although the plague, somewhat subdued until now, has begun to visit us again. Farewell once more.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 13, 1551.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your godfather in the Lord, entirely.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his godfather in Christ, most dearly beloved.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
