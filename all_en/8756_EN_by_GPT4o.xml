      <p>Greetings. I write these few words, beloved brother, so that you may see that I have received your last letter in good faith regarding the deceitful business of the Rezüntzian. Since you have faithfully done your duty, leave the rest to God; He will also bring this to an end.</p>
      <p>You know the saying: after darkness, light; you know what the Lord has threatened us with and what our predecessors have endured. Let us therefore encourage our hearts with constancy and patience, persevering in good work and among brothers who love you sincerely from the heart.</p>
      <p>The Lord will reconcile to you those who now seem to be the most hostile enemies, and He will give you His blessing. Also pray to the Lord that you may continue to be who you have been up to now.</p>
      <p>If only I could discuss more extensively with you about the military campaign being organized against the Turks!</p>
      <p>You would see, as you otherwise see: this foreign war, which does not concern us, will entangle Switzerland in the greatest evils unless it repents; about which we will confer when you come to us. May the Lord bless your journey. There is a rumor that the people of Zürich have agreed to this Turkish war. It is a most blatant lie; they have not agreed and will not agree. Whoever wishes well for Switzerland and our descendants will be careful not to involve us. The news I have from Augsburg, I share with you in the enclosed letter.</p>
      <p>Greet both consuls, Campell, Pontisella, Mr. Karl Gregor, Bonett, the doctor R[uinella], and other good men. May the Lord bless you and keep you from all evil. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zürich, January 25, in the year of our salvation 1572. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, his honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
