      <p>Greetings. Our brother from Poland, a Mercurian, has arrived, bringing a bundle of letters, and found us very busy; therefore, we were neither able to read nor transcribe them. Moreover, he was in a hurry; hence, it was agreed by Mr. Peter and me to send everything to you through him, so that you may read them and add your opinion, and then safely return all those writings to us as you now receive them, so that we may also read and write our opinion on this matter. However, since your envoy complained that he was without travel funds, I gave him, in our name, five French gold coins; for I would spend myself and all my possessions, if necessary, for your sake, whom I sincerely love in the Lord. Mr. Peter sends his most friendly greetings to you, Beza, and all the brothers; other brothers also greet you. We hear here that after the death of King Francis, Charles has been made king, with the King of Navarre appointed as governor, and that the Guise family has been overthrown and Navarre has summoned Mr. Beza to France.</p>
      <p>I truly wish these things to be true; but the affairs of mortals are so uncertain that I fear not all of it is true. Therefore, I beg your kindness, most esteemed Calvin, to write to us with certainty about these matters, and since you have the most accurate knowledge of French affairs, and what has happened with our brothers in the Angrogna Valley, we ask you to write to us diligently and promptly about these. We are surprised that in these great changes you have not sent us any letters; if you do not have the time (for we know what business oppresses you), let someone else write in your name; you have many to whom you can entrust this task. Gallus has written a virulent book against Melanchthon's letter published in Heidelberg to the Palatine. I hear that a diet is to be held in Naumburg, where the princes will discuss the future council and the sacramental matter. The Swiss diet will be held in Baden on the 12th of this month. The threats from neighbors are great; we are in danger, and the spirits of all are raised. Pray to the Lord for us with your people.</p>
      <p>On the 28th of December, at the fifth or sixth hour before dawn, the sky appeared to be on fire in these parts. The vision was quite dreadful; it caused great commotion among the people everywhere, as some ran here, others there, thinking there was a great fire somewhere: the people of Appenzell thought St. Gallen was burning; the people of St. Gallen thought the towns and villages by Lake Constance were burning; our people thought Baden was burning, the people of Chur thought the neighboring mountains and Maienfeld were burning. May the Lord be with us and deliver us from evil! It is said here that the Duke of Florence has suddenly died. Farewell.</p>
      <p>I can write no more now.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 3, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Beza, if he is still in Geneva, or by letter if he has left. To the most illustrious Mr. Johannes Calvin, minister of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
