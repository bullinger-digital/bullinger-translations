      <p>Grace and peace through Christ.</p>
      <p>We finally have the synodal decrees, most learned Bullinger, issued under your and Leo's auspices, fortified by the authority of the senate. Now they are carried in the hands of the brothers, burdened by the uncertain and diverse counsel of many, so that some are of the opinion that they should not be promulgated in the churches, while others are very much in favor. Thus, another discord has arisen. One claims that public reading is prohibited, another argues that nothing less should be done than the bare and open prohibition of those matters that pertain to the use of the churches. They are matters of light, not darkness, of truth, not falsehood, of honesty, not disgrace. It will now be your task, along with Leo and the brothers of the city, to quell this discord of new discord. From the letters of the senate, I have gathered diligence, care, and vigilance, but not the silence of the matters acted upon. Therefore, lest we all sin, one through negligence, the other through rashness, address this. Write back to the deans, your brothers, what should be done, all of you or you alone.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we, who are situated by the banks of the Rhine and the Thur, have also gathered the day before to discuss the deacon, indeed a matter of honor, but serious due to the support and way of life, that is, dealing with sustenance. It was decided to refer the main issue to you. They say there is an idle prebend at the Rhine catapults or cataracts, as they call it. Whether it is meager or rich, I do not know. From here, we could not sufficiently discern whether the minister of a rather large and populous province could be supported. In Ossingen, there is another, but burdened more by a trunk than a man, in Stammheim one, but now so burdened that it can hardly bear such a heavy load, in Stein am Rhein the monastery - what hope from here, with the state of our affairs fluctuating so?</p>
      <p>We wanted to inform you of these things, excellent man, by letter, and to commend our affairs and ourselves with the churches to your faith and prayer.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ. May He keep you, the brothers, and the churches unharmed. Amen.</p>
      <p>In Stammheim, hastily, December 4, 1532.</p>
      <p>Your Lorenz Meyer (Agricola) etc.</p>
      <p>To H. Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, a distinguished and pious man, dearest brother and friend.</p>
