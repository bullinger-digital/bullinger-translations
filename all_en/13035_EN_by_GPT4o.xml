    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Pfister has nothing to report, as Jodocus Kilchmeyer will act as a letter and present the situation [of the church in Bern] in a summary. As a wise person, Bullinger will easily recognize how precarious the situation is based on his conversation with Kilchmeyer. Therefore, he should not keep him in Zurich for too long. The situation of the Bernese church is indeed worse than even Kilchmeyer might think. The opponents lack not the will, but the ability to advance their plans. Bullinger should inquire with Kilchmeyer about this. He will be surprised! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Furthermore, Bullinger need not doubt Pfister's loyalty concerning his writing [“De sacramentis”]. He will adhere to his instructions. He has always remained the same and, thank God, has never broken a promise. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Bullinger should continue to be well-disposed towards him and convey his greetings to Konrad Pellikan and Johann Jakob Ammann. </p>

      <p> Nikolaus Artopoeus Balingius to Heinrich Bullinger, most learned man, greetings. There is nothing at present that I could write to you, most learned man. Our Lord Jodocus will fulfill the duty of the letter. He will recount in full detail how our entire situation stands. I ask you not to keep him for too long! Believe me, the state of our church demands it. As you are a wise man, you will easily understand from both his speech and conversation. Our church is in a more precarious state than he himself might perhaps think, and our adversaries do not lack the will to advance their plans, but the strength. Please make sure to hear something about this from him. You will be surprised, I know, beyond measure! </p>

      <p> Furthermore, regarding your book, do not doubt my loyalty in the slightest! I will do as you instructed. Thus, both you and the Lord will love me. I have always been of this disposition and remain so today. Thanks be to the Almighty, I have never learned to break a promise! </p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p> Farewell, most sincere man, and never cease to love your Baling. I ask you to convey my warmest greetings to Konrad Pellikan and Johann Jakob Ammann. Entirely yours, Baling. Bern, the eleventh of August. </p>
      <p> To Heinrich Bullinger, a man of great learning and most skilled in theological matters. </p>
