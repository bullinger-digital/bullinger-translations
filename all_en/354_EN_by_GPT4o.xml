      <p>Greetings. I received your letters from your kindness, my esteemed Myconius, and there is no need for me to respond to them laboriously; meanwhile, I give the greatest thanks for your diligence and your labors, and I pray to the Lord to direct matters beautifully to His glory and for the salvation of our souls and the consolation of the afflicted. I have no new matters, except that I received certain news from Italy, from which I learned that King Philip of Castile or Spain's ships have not yet arrived. Indeed, a place is being prepared for him in Milan with much pomp, and there are those who believe he will never come through Italy to Germany; perhaps he will come by the Ocean; may those ambitious and restless heads all swim together in the middle of the Ocean.</p>
      <p>The envoys agree excellently on all points, which we all consider a very happy omen. Everything was discussed most freely and amicably. I am very glad that the matter has turned out happily. Only your people disagree with our people, the Bernese and the Schaffhousians, on the point of the council; your people want to simply and without dispute or declaration agree to a general, free, and Christian council; the other three cities think a declaration is absolutely necessary, so that we are not caught in words, and the adversaries do not think we promised what we did not promise. They hope your people can be persuaded to their opinion, so that the remaining four cities do not seem to disagree and be unable to agree on such an important matter. Therefore, a new assembly is called in Basel for December 9th; the four cities will meet there again to make a concordant response. Then envoys will be sent, who will prudently, piously, and firmly report the response to the seven Swiss cantons.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it will be your task to encourage your people not to persist in holding any private opinion, but to agree on the common one. I have good hope in the Lord's grace, help, and deliverance. Encourage your people steadfastly to prayer and repentance. I cannot say more now. Brother D. Pellicanus, Theodor, Gwalther, Otto, and Haller, who was also here, greet you.</p>
      <p>[...], November 8th.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, D. Oswald Myconius, faithful minister of the Basel church, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
