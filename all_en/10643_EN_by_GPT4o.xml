      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Your kindness towards me, most excellent and sincere brothers, and that singular courtesy with which you treated me while I was there, have had such an effect on me that, wherever in the world I may be or will be, the most pleasant memory of you will never indeed perish in my mind. This is done so rightly and deservedly, since the principal law of friendship should be that if we cannot respond to our friends and benefactors in deeds and services, we should certainly preserve their memory perpetually, as far as possible. Nor am I of such a dull mind that I do not recognize your services towards me, that is, of the entire church of Zurich and indeed of the council itself, nor am I so ungrateful as to make light of them. Therefore, if perhaps I have testified my mind towards you with some fuller proof, I will indeed seem to have done something worthy of myself.</p>
      <p>I cannot yet write anything certain about my affairs. We are still residing here, my wife and I, at my father-in-law's, awaiting the will of the Lord, whose peace is always with you.</p>
      <p>Given at Isny, a town in Rhaetia, on the first of July, 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
      <p>Melchior Rufus Volmar.</p>
      <p>To Master Bullinger and the entire church of Zurich.</p>
