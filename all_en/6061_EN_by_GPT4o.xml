      <p>Led by your kindness, most revered father in Christ, I have written this letter to you according to the measure and modesty of my ability, in which I wish to leave a testimony with you, at least in words, that I truly and sincerely desire that at some point it may be possible to demonstrate your more than paternal spirit towards me in reality. Therefore, certain of this benevolent and paternal spirit of yours towards me, I have not hesitated to disclose my business to you in a few words.</p>
      <p>When I requested a stipend for three years from the magnificent council of Bern, they did not entirely deny it; but now, as I understand, with this year having passed, they wish to recall me.</p>
      <p>However, as I remain in my opinion, namely that it be granted to me for three years, I have again requested the most honorable council of Bern not to deny it to me; for in one year, I cannot achieve what I wish to learn from the Hebrew language; for all that is beautiful is difficult.</p>
      <p>But I, if God is present, will strive, as much as is in me, that they may not justly complain that they have conferred a benefit on an ungrateful person, and that they may never regret what they have bestowed.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I again implore your help, most kind father in Christ, as well as that of some other excellent men, to urge this matter with the pastors and professors of Bern.</p>
      <p>If you do this, you will not only bind me to you more and more each day, but you will also perform a service pleasing to God himself.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, my most esteemed lord and father, and continue to love me, as you do. Please convey my most cordial greetings to Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Ludwig Lavater, Mr. Josias Simler, and also to the most beloved sons, etc.</p>
      <p>Mr. Immanuel Tremellius, Mr. Ludwig Masurius, and the other good men send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you.</p>
      <p>Metz, March 12, 1564.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Michael Hortinus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, faithful servant of Christ and most revered father, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, truly faithful pastor of the church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
