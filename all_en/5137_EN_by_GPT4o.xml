      <p>Greetings. The reason I have written to you less frequently until now, most esteemed man and brother in the Lord, is not so much due to my own occupations as to yours. Knowing that your tasks are infinite and significant, it seemed inappropriate to me to interrupt them with my trivial matters, especially at this time when I knew there were others who could report the state of our affairs to your kindness with much more grace, such as our dearest brother Junius, to whom I had entrusted my greetings and anything else that needed to be communicated to you.</p>
      <p>He willingly took on this task, as he was more inclined towards your kindness. But now, since the Lord has taken him from us, perhaps due to our deserving sins, I could not refrain from causing some inconvenience to your kindness with my letters amidst such great turmoil, which I do not doubt you will bear with a more patient mind if you remember that it is done for the common benefit of our church. The wound our church has suffered from this brother's death cannot be described; for although it was beset by many misfortunes and various adversarial schemes while he was alive, it always felt him to be a faithful defender both privately and publicly. Many grieve and fear that, with him gone, a greater opportunity to harm has been given to the adversaries. To remove this evil from us, we must not only pray to the Lord but also strive with as much care and diligence as we can to appoint someone who will follow in his footsteps with the same magnanimity and continue what he began.</p>
      <p>If your kindness also provides us with your assistance in this matter, we do not doubt that you will have rendered a most welcome service to us and a most useful service to the whole church. Here, there is nothing new except that the threats of the enemies of truth resound throughout the heavens, who rejoice and are glad that they have discovered some new deceptions and plots against the kingdom of Christ with that pretentious Council of Trent. May the Lord be present with His afflicted church.</p>
      <p>Once again, may your kindness fare well in the Lord and always commend us to God in your prayers, as you do.</p>
      <p>Dr. Borrhaus and Marcus Bertius send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, Wolfgang Wissenburg. To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, his brother and lord in Christ, to be respected. Zurich.</p>
