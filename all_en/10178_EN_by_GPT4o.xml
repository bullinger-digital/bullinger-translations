      <p>My lord, beloved brother. Regarding my affairs, the summary is as follows: I never went to Frauenfeld, but instead sent my wife there with the relatives. Thus, the other places, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, have petitioned for me with my wife, in such a way: if they assure me of honor, life, and safety, I am willing to submit. This was agreeable to my lords' envoys and everyone. So they have taken the petition to their lords and set the next day in Baden, four weeks from Sunday, to respond. However, my gracious lords have let my opponents from the eight places go home and given them no further instructions, which they were quite displeased about. The rest, God willing, I will report to you orally.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I hear that my gracious lords from Zurich and the Abbot of St. Gallen's matter is over. Also, I hear that my lords' envoys have petitioned for Peter Weber. The Abbot has answered that there is no need to worry about him; likewise, he intends to do the best for the peasants concerned with the matter. However, the envoys will report everything thoroughly. I ask you, if it is convenient for you, to inform Peter Weber, as I have heard, until I come.</p>
      <p>Also, I hear that a day has been set in Zurich for Othmar's money matters. I suspect Captain Berweger will come there as an envoy from Appenzell. I intend to wait, God willing, to come with him.</p>
      <p>My lords, the Confederates, can only come to TÃ¤nikon tomorrow.</p>
      <p>May God strengthen you and us. Greet your dear wife, father, mother, and household for me. Praying to God for us.</p>
      <p>Done in Elgg, on St. Martin's Day in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your poor Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my beloved lord and benefactor, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, to hand.</p>
