      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, I wished to learn something about you, about whom I have heard nothing for a long time, and also something certain about public affairs - for many varied and uncertain things were being reported - and behold, your letters are delivered to me, from which I am informed both about your condition and about new matters, for which I give you immense thanks. I am indeed in good health, which is the kindness of God; but old enemies are not lacking, who trouble me; indeed, even some new ones cannot bear that a foreigner and exile can achieve so much with just a word. For you should know, Heinrich Bullinger: recently, our Lord God has gained another village through my ministry. A new brother, of great learning and eloquence, who had been an Augustinian, also fled from Italy and assists me greatly; for he came directly to me. Therefore, the adversaries rage when they see that a refuge for pious men is established in my home.</p>
      <p>Would that at least those who have given their name to the gospel would favor my labors! But I wrote enough about these matters in my recent letters.</p>
      <p>Several brothers from Italy had written that they were coming to me, so that I might visit those churches with them. I have waited a long time, but they have not yet appeared; I hope, however, that they will be here soon, and with them, I will come to you. In the meantime, write, I implore you, for your love and charity towards me, declared in so many sweet letters, greatly consoles me. These letters are carried to you by men, whom you will see; for they travel through the village where I live. But I hope they will deliver them, even if they do not agree with us on religion. This kind of my little sons, whom I nourish with the milk of the gospel, had not yet seen, and it will be beneficial to have seen, as I hope; for I will denounce the pomp and luxury of Sardanapalus.</p>
      <p>My Venetians almost rest; certainly, they do not anxiously persecute the brothers. But Caesar of Cremona rages and grows fat. From that slaughterhouse, a new fugitive, about whom I wrote, has escaped; would that many others might escape! I think you have heard about Siena. It is certain that this city has shaken off the yoke of Caesar and, what is more, an army is being prepared there to invade the Kingdom of Naples. The Turkish fleet is surveying and plundering the entire coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea; would that it might also reach Rome!</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well, most reverend brother, and pray to God for me with the whole family, school, and church. I bid all the brothers to be well. May the Lord bless your holy labors.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, on the first of September 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Bullinger</p>
