      <p>Greetings and blessings. I owe you immortal thanks, most learned man, for being the first to spur me on with piety and Christian steadfastness in my affliction. It is incredible how much I cherished your letters, which you arranged to be delivered to me through Fabricius, our fellow citizen. I understood that our friendship, once formed, still remains intact.</p>
      <p>This was a rare sight last year (which was a leap year of iniquity), especially for the Alsatian church. I therefore ask that you be concerned for me, as I now lack my dearest Erbe.</p>
      <p>You will take his place as a patron and diligent encourager for the church entrusted to me. In six months, I have received no letters, neither from Erbe nor from other friends who were once most steadfast; what they are like now, since fortune has frowned, God knows. I, however, cannot resist raging fortune by any means other than patience, which I pray may not be taken from us. I wish you and yours the happiest beginning of this year. If Erbe writes anything to you, make sure to inform me.</p>
      <p>You will hear about my affairs from a living letter.</p>
      <p>He has rather inconveniently announced his departure to you; therefore, forgive the clumsy and unrefined pen. Wolphius and Erhardus Labhardus send their greetings to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Bischofszell, in the year 1561, on the Epiphany of the Lord. Yours, Johannes Rietmüller.</p>
      <p>To the man of uncommon learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich and his esteemed patron. Zürich.</p>
