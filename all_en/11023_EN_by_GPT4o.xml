    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a letter and expresses his opinion on Bucer's [letter to Luther] at Bullinger's request. Whoever presents [the Swiss churches] to Luther in such a light harms the concord; it is particularly incomprehensible that Bucer excuses a position to Luther that he presented in Basel as Luther's own opinion. It is only for this reason that Basel and St. Gallen have spoken out in favor of signing the [Wittenberg Concord]; Bucer's claim that they, together with Mülhausen, have shown more discernment than others is not true. Luther is likely to proceed more honestly than Bucer, as he has probably passed on Bucer's letter to test his credibility. Nevertheless, one should remain silent about this matter, on the one hand because of the confidentiality of the correspondence, and on the other hand, to avoid angering the Strasbourg council, although Bucer also seems to have been dishonest towards Ammeister Mathis [pastor].</p>

      <p>Be well, most illustrious Bullinger. I read your letter gladly, especially for this reason, that you deal with me with such sincere faith and do not hide what you think is important for us to know. For the rest, namely elegance, humanity, and erudition, are never lacking in your letters and always delight and benefit. However, to fulfill what you ask and to say what I feel; first, Bucer's actions trouble me greatly, and it offends me not a little that he handled such an important matter in our name so contemptuously before him, whom he should have commended us to beyond measure and ingratiated us with exceedingly. He does not seek concord but burdens discord with the worst suspicions, who so coldly commends those who have deserved well, especially among those with whom we have had the gravest conflicts. What was the need to excuse to Luther what he had handled in the public assembly of all orders in Basel in the name of Luther with such, as he said, faith, even adding a protestation that Luther felt no differently about the Eucharist than what he himself had brought forward in the declared articles? For this reason alone, the Basel Senate and our St. Gallen Senate thought it necessary to subscribe to the articles, lest any hindrance be thrown into a cause of great utility, because it was publicly established that Luther, according to Bucer's report, felt no differently than what our people had been teaching for many years. And you were giving thanks to the Lord in the name of the ministers for the fact that it was finally established in reality that we did not disagree, but that Luther held the same sense to establish concord that our churches had hitherto held. Now he excuses what he was ordered to do, and he excuses it in such a way that he openly accuses himself of some kind of prevarication, when he testifies that he granted us many things that might perhaps displease Luther. To this, he commends the people of Basel, Mülhausen, and ours as if we had been of sounder judgment than yours, who nevertheless approved nothing other than what all approved, except for the one will to subscribe, which his declaration of Lutheran faith had extracted from us. But now it is clear from his own books how badly we felt, namely, that we would subscribe to the troublesome articles according to the sense reported by him in the name of Dr. Luther, which he had to excuse so much before Luther himself. What can I say? Luther will act far more candidly with us than he did, for he did not hesitate to communicate Luther's letters as if they were suspect to friends and to publish them as if in the light, so that it might be established whether we had been treated well or otherwise. However these matters stand, I think the whole affair should be concealed with utmost faith and not touched upon in the present with any word, not only because it is established that we often entrust letters as if they were secret messages, which we would not want to be known even to all friends, indeed we often complain about our dearest friends among friends; but also for this reason, which is most important to me, lest we alienate the Strasbourg Senate by revealing the matter more freely, although Bucer also seems to have abused the consul Mathis. Nevertheless, it is most advisable to dissimulate, lest we add oil (as they say) to the fire and stir up sad tragedies among brothers, partly because of the published letter, partly because of the trust that the Strasbourg Senate placed in our people in the presence of such a great man. The day before the Kalends of April 1537.</p>
