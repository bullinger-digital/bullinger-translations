      <p>My greetings and willing service beforehand, venerable, faithful, dear godfather, today after the sermon, Captain Fridli Schüler comes to me and tells me how he understood from my brother-in-law, Captain Schiesser, that there are supposed to be 300 cavalry stationed in Geneva. Now I am curious about what and why they are there, with a request to write to you about this, so that you can give us a report on the situation there. I could not refuse him and also ask you to understand everything from me in the best way.</p>
      <p>He also sends you very friendly greetings, as do my wife and all my household.</p>
      <p>Dated the 25th of March, in the year 1572.</p>
      <p>Johannes Hugo in Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the venerable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zurich, his faithful dear lord and godfather, to his hands.</p>
