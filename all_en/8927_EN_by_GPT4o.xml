      <p>God with us. Faithful, beloved father, I assume you understood yesterday how things are with brother Hans Rudolf, that he is very weak; because besides having previously coughed up a lot of blood many times, on Saturday night the blood came rushing, and yesterday afternoon it flowed in such quantity that he became so weak that we expected nothing other than his end.</p>
      <p>However, he has somewhat recovered and no more blood has flowed since yesterday; because we have applied and used some known blood-stopping remedies, but we do not know how Almighty God will further decide.</p>
      <p>We entrust everything to Him with earnest prayer, that He may act according to His divine will, in the way that is most beneficial and salutary for us. If the blood returns in the same manner, I fear he will not be able to overcome it. However, I will write to you immediately about how all matters develop. I cannot leave him due to his weakness, and have therefore instructed my dear wife to diligently handle everything that concerns the church, etc. Therefore, dear father, it is not necessary for you to come out; because in addition to the grief and sorrow, it would cause great harm to your health.</p>
      <p>However, if sister Dorothea could conveniently come out and it would not be against you, it would be pleasing to us. Otherwise, Hans Rudolf is very comforted and manly, so I have no doubt about him; regarding his other matters, I hope Almighty God, who has always protected him from disgrace, will show wisdom and a way to help us out of the situation.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God's protection; may He always be with us, etc.</p>
      <p>Berg, June 16, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient son, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered father, etc.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
