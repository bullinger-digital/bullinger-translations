      <p>S. "Let us omit," you say, "titles" and immediately you address those very letters to a "Most Excellent" man, indeed. It has been foolish long enough, let such trifles cease henceforth; it is enough for one to be distinguished by the name of either friend or brother.</p>
      <p>The pious young man Johannes Rudolf praised your kindness towards him greatly to me. I fear that he may not be able to be appointed in the place of his deceased father, both because of other competitors and especially because of that Merchant, who, being born of a more renowned family, will surpass Rudolf not by the weight of votes, but by their number. For even those who wish to appear as professing the gospel have fallen into such injustice that they desire to consult persons rather than churches. I would minister to that church for free, so that the afflicted widow could pay off the foreign debt to which she is bound, if I could achieve anything by this means. But I do not know what will happen, except that certain things are conducted with marvelous arts, and I see it is difficult to strive against the current. The care of his church has not yet been entrusted to anyone, but they have hired the service of another deacon here until St. John's feast day, that is, for the time being, for thus the more prudent interpret it, while that Merchant insinuates himself familiarly among some in Zurich and thus achieves his desire. But the Lord himself will see to it.</p>
      <p>Recently, a letter came to me from a good lord and friend; he informed me that Doctor Abraham Murgel, son of Doctor Hans Murgel, recently came up from Mainz to Lindau; he told him credibly and for certain that Duke Moritz had suffered a great defeat with significant loss of noblemen; also Duke Georg of Mecklenburg with some other captured persons, who are quite prominent, have been taken to Magdeburg. Oh God, that they might endure it! But if it should finally turn against them, they will be treated all the more cruelly, the more the previous victories have been. Help, God, from heaven and have a fatherly insight, make our wickedness and ingratitude and thus also the tyranny of our enemies come to an end.</p>
      <p>With Milan, it is not good for anyone. The strong alone, God knows, may He look upon us with gracious eyes once.</p>
      <p>My dear Schero, I beg you by the Lord, do not cause any trouble by returning thanks; for I suspect from your letters that you are contemplating this; it will be more than enough if you have deemed the man worthy of a brief letter, by which he may understand that you have received that little gift and that it was not ungrateful to you; if you add anything... I solemnly assure you that he will consider himself affected not by honor, but by great [injustice] from you. Farewell with your household, which I ask you to greet most dutifully on my behalf, not omitting all the brothers, by whom I always wish to be most diligently commended to the heavenly Father. January 13.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious servant of Jesus Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, by far the dearest friend of all.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
