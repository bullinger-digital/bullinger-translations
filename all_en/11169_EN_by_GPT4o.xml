    <p xml:id="regest1">Received his letter [Nr. 1114] and his book "De scripturae sanctae authoritate" [HBBibl I 111], but cannot yet give a judgment on the latter. Their views continue to differ; although he got to know Zwingli - as well as Oecolampadius - in Marburg as an excellent man, he found himself separated from him in doctrine, and also the publication of his ["Fidei expositio"] by Bullinger displeased him. Despite mutual reservations, he hopes to witness that God creates unity through His Spirit.</p>

      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, diligent and attentive minister of the church of Zurich, to be venerably loved in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>Your letters, my dear Bullinger, have been delivered to me, along with your book "On the Authority of Scripture and the Function of Bishops." I have not yet read the book thoroughly, being occupied with other many matters, yet I did not want to delay my response beyond this Leipzig fair, even though I cannot express my judgment on your book in such a scarcity of time. You know that we do not otherwise disapprove of the style and subject matter of the things you are engaged in, but we differ in sense and affection. I will speak freely: After seeing and hearing Zwingli in Marburg, I judged him to be an excellent man, as well as Oecolampadius, so much so that their downfall nearly overwhelmed me, for no greater reason than that I was compelled to believe that they were alien or rather remained apart from our opinion, which we consider to be true no less than you do yours. And it also pained me that you later published Zwingli's book, written to the Christian king, under your name, praising it with great admiration, even though you knew that there were many things in that book which not only offend us but all the pious with good reason. Not that I begrudge Zwingli's honor, for whose death I conceived such great sorrow, but because the sincerity of doctrine should not be disregarded for the sake of any man.</p>
      <p>I write this so that you may see that I deal with you in true candor without any animosity. Perhaps you believe that we are in error. I commend that to God's judgment. Certainly, we also cannot approve of all your views unless we wanted to burden our conscience, which you will not demand from us, as I do not doubt. But nothing could happen to me more joyously before my death than if, by the grace of God, that spirit were given, which would recreate one heart and soul in the Lord, so that we might think and speak as one in Christ to the glory of God the Father and the salvation of souls. Meanwhile, take this in good part, until, if God wills, I have read your book.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Wittenberg, May 14, 1538.</p>
      <p>Martin Luther.</p>
