    <p xml:id="regest1">Repeats his admonition to ensure that Zurich insists in the negotiations [about the Solothurn "bandits"] that the discussion of faith comes first; Basel wants to involve Mulhouse to strengthen this position. Does not know how Bullinger stands regarding the upcoming conference in Eisenach, and asks for a statement on the [Four Cities] Confession, which the people of Strasbourg want to base their discussions on there, but which he himself could only approve in connection with the Apology [Bucer's]; the actions of the people of Strasbourg still seem ambiguous to him. In Valais, troublemakers are said to be at work. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. What I have written, I beg you, do not consider it as nothing; the matter is not to be disregarded because of good men and for the propagation of the gospel, indeed also because of our contempt. It is first to deal with those things which pertain to faith. As for the goods, they will follow willingly. There are many things that drive the people of Solothurn towards peace, provided there is no intermediary who offers an opportunity for stubbornness through leniency and softness. Because the action of faith was always postponed before, it has happened that all disturbances have followed, the people of Solothurn have become so insolent, and we with the gospel have been so shamefully despised. Let the envoys remove these things at once or at least the better and more powerful part - for they can through one firmness -, and there will be no doubt about a favorable outcome. If I understand the matter correctly, our people have also called upon the people of Mulhouse, so that the number of good wishes may be greater. Nor will it be that the people of Solothurn can complain of being forced into faith. Everything will be conducted in such a way that the last resort will be the law, which they will not be able to bear. Then indeed they will be compelled either to the law or to settle willingly or allow everything to be settled, unless they prefer misfortune. Be, as I do not doubt you are, even in this cause, I pray.</p>
      <p>You know about the conference in Eisenach. I truly do not know what your mind is. The people of Strasbourg, I understand, will do nothing except from their own confession. If you have seen it, please tell me what you think. I say frankly: Unless the apology were attached, there is nothing that would please me. While they wanted to act in this way, what was the need for such anxious urging for us to meet? The same perplexity seems to be in their actions, which has been in their words so far. If anything good comes from this, we will be amazed. But I am forced to stop because of the scribe's hasty departure.</p>
      <p>However, this should be added, the people of Valais are said to be attempting something more.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord with your people and Utinger.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Basel, April 29, 1536.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother in his Lord.</p>
