    <p xml:id="regest1">Is healthy and hopes the same for Bullinger and his family. Would like to come to him. Has learned things in Lindau that make him optimistic about the future of the evangelical faith. According to [Bartholomäus] Berweger, a meeting of the Reformed is scheduled for Sunday; Vadian is surprised by Bullinger's concerns that such gatherings take place in Zurich. Thomas [Gaßner] reports that Zwick wished Bullinger were in Constance. A good wine harvest is expected in the Rhine Valley. The following day, the Appenzell envoy [for Baden] will be appointed. Bullinger can send news with the bearer or the Appenzell envoy. Greetings. Asks to give the [enclosed] letter to Werner Steiner.</p>

      <p>The grace of God through Christ be with us forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>My lord, beloved brother, my humble service to you. Knowing also our health, which we, if it is God's will, would gladly hear from your entire household, etc.</p>
      <p>First of all, it concerns me (as soon as we can, as I hope not long), to come to you. I would also like to wish to be with you for an hour, to talk with you about various things.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, great works of God are present, to happen in the coming year, revealed to me in truth in Lindau (as I will tell you); that I do not think in three years, the sun will shine to promote God's honor and to redeem the pious once, and without doubt our mutual conversation, as we have with each other, in which you have acted, how God unites His own from evil to good. I hope for divine help; therefore I would gladly let myself be moved with God's help; for I hope to see salvation. Well then, I spare it, to speak with you orally, reasons (because), I have been gracious in Lindau with my wife for the goodness done, etc. I have also informed Vadian, the faithful, alone. From this he has received hope and become more joyful, etc.</p>
      <p>Item Vadian instructed me today, as we learned through Berweger, who was with me, the day, which is set for Sunday in Zurich (perhaps quietly desired by the Bernese) to write to you, that we are surprised by the reason, that you and other pious people often let it be noticed against him and me, that there is great concern, when the day is set with you, as you well know (although we hope for good in this matter).</p>
      <p>Item Thomas, the faithful preacher in Lindau, instructed me to write his service to you. He tells me, how Doctor Hans Zwick wrote to him and bears great concern, thus speaking: "Oh God, if you would let us have the good man Bullinger here in the cross."</p>
      <p>Item my wife is in the Rhine Valley with my children for the wine harvest. There is much wine, a third more than anyone estimated. All old barrels are being bound. There is the rumor, the Zurich wine is fresh and healthy, praise be to God, which my wife heard and therefore filled 2 barrels, intending to take it with her. It has become good.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, Wednesday, the envoy to Appenzell will first be appointed; I do not know who. I think, Berweger would be it, if he does not turn away so quickly. He sees the unfaithfulness of the peasants.</p>
      <p>Item this woman, a citizen of St. Gallen, will come back again. If you write us news with this or with the envoy from Appenzell, it will reach you at home.</p>
      <p>Greet your household for me, two remarkable women, your mother and your wife, if we let one at the other. So let your [wife] know, she is still young.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, on Tuesday, the 12th day of October in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>I ask you to give the letter to Master Werner Steiner.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my lord and friend, M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to his hands.</p>
