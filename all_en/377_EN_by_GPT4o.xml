      <p>Honorable, highly learned, especially gracious, dear sir, I send you my friendly greetings along with my willingness to serve at any time, etc. I express my great thanks for your friendly sympathy and offer of willing service, with the assurance that I am always ready to show you love and service.</p>
      <p>Regarding what I have arranged in Basel on behalf of my lords' recent writings, you will be well informed by my lord mayor, along with the latest news from France, which I have sent to the aforementioned lord. I had intended to depart from Basel this coming Saturday; however, the gout has so severely affected my hands that such a departure is not possible for me. Nevertheless, I am hopeful, if nothing else intervenes, to set out shortly after Christmas, as the time and delay are very tedious and vexing for me, etc. With this, I commend you to the Almighty's long-lasting protection, etc.</p>
      <p>Basel, Saturday, December 22, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your willing friend and supporter, etc. Johann Haab, mayor.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the city of Zürich, my especially gracious lord and friend. Zürich.</p>
