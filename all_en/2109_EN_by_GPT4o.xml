      <p>S. D. As soon as I arrived in Straßburg, most illustrious and in many respects esteemed man, I wrote to you, in which I not only conveyed my own situation but also the state of England. Now again it seemed right to write, so that you are not unaware of what has happened in England since, and how my affairs are finally here. On November 14th, the Lord of Canterbury, along with Lady Jane, formerly queen, and the sons of the Duke of Northumberland, were brought out in public and condemned to death; and the archbishop was assigned the most cruel form of punishment, namely, to be hanged, and afterwards his body to be cut into four parts: and although they do these things in reality for the sake of religion, they do not want to cover it with that more honorable pretext, but only allege the crime of treason; yet they pardoned other nobles who were involved in the same guilt, because they either defected from the religion now accepted or never truly favored it. They also decided in the assemblies that the mass should be admitted everywhere, and they set a deadline of December 20th: they also established the doctrine of transubstantiation, which was not difficult for them to do, since they did not admit learned and pious men to those councils and discussions: but meanwhile, while they were dealing with these matters, they either kept them confined in prison, or completely excluded them from their assembly of malignants. Yet they could not so guard themselves with these arts of theirs, that there was no protest against transubstantiation; but those who resisted achieved nothing, since they were overwhelmed by numbers, not, however, convicted by reasons, which can be none. These things indicate to us what can be hoped for from the assemblies of bishops: the good are either not admitted, or if they have been imprudently admitted, they achieve nothing, being overcome by the crowd of the unlearned and impious; hence the modern bishops, and the fathers and councils of our times, make the ancient ones suspect to us. Therefore, rightly, without the authority of the word of God, we do not trust them. These things about the English church.</p>
      <p>About the queen, it is reported that she is preparing a journey to Calais, where another Mary, the sister of the Emperor, is going: there they will confer together, and everyone thinks that a marriage between the English queen and Philip, the king of Spain, is to be entered into; if it succeeds, the English will suffer a loss not only of religion but also of the kingdom. Therefore, they must be aided with the most effective prayers to God.</p>
      <p>As for my affairs: our Sturmius, along with the principal professors and most of the ministers, have worked very hard to keep me here, and the school authorities have been quite inclined towards this. But two or three of the ministers, who have some authority, resist because of the sacramental doctrine, and they have opposed it in such a way that the matter has not yet been settled. Since I do not wish to be with the unwilling, I ask you, by our friendship and love in Christ, to find me some position somewhere, in which I may be able to exercise my calling honorably and with fruit. Because I am certain that I do not need a longer exhortation with you, I will not say more about this matter; but I await your response with great desire, and indeed soon. May the Lord grant that you do not labor and exert effort in vain on my behalf.</p>
      <p>You see how boldly I deal with you. But there is nothing for which I would not dare to promise myself concerning your goodwill towards me, especially eager that you do the same for me repeatedly. May God keep you safe for us for as long as possible! May you bid all your fellow ministers to be well in my name. December 15th, Straßburg.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, as much as he is, Peter Martyr. To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
