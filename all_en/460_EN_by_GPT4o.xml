      <p>S. D. At this hour I have received your letters, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, along with some others, namely from Bernhardin and Christoph Montius, who sincerely wish you well, and from Bucer who writes among other things: "Indeed, I see no remaining reason why I can wait here until the calends of March. For while our people have decided that they can retain nothing of pure religion here in public, except as much as they can beg from the bishop and the emperor, and the bishop has denied everything, while the emperor is willing to concede a little more, you see what place is left for us.</p>
      <p>The bishop also demands the colleges back and will deal with us on this matter, we who are in the College of St. Thomas. My colleagues remain steadfast, none of whom so far want to accept any moderation in preaching the gospel of Christ from men.</p>
      <p>The emperor also explicitly told our envoys in Cologne that he would accept the excuse of the senate and the people and be favorable to them. But regarding the preachers, he wants to keep the matter intact for himself because we published our confession against the Interim publicly. It was also clearly said to me because I rejected the grace and kindness offered at Augsburg, what grace I should expect in the future. But I am the Lord's; may He only grant me to always be faithful to Him." At the end of the letter, he added: "Today, I think, some of us will be dismissed; for four days ago it was announced to the citizens not to do anything against the Interim and to observe the days of fasting and holidays. But we could not yield anything to the Lord, nor can we. Pray to the Lord for the most miserable people.</p>
      <p>You would see tears, hear groans and prayers if you were present, which would also move you, because you foresee how great a ruin of the churches this fall of the church will bring with it, those laments which are of the greatest pain and sorrow. In a few days, I think I will have finished all the remaining actions that keep me here; then I will have to go where the Lord leads me, about which I can be less certain today than before." Thus he. Therefore, even the church of Strasbourg returns to antichristianism, from which many hoped for better things. We must pray that He does not lead us into the same temptation by His just judgment; for we too are sinners and no less ungrateful for heavenly grace than they are.</p>
      <p>Bernhardin, in his letters, which I have now received twice, dated December 23 and the last, calls me to England with these words: "I showed your letters to the most reverend Archbishop of Canterbury, and when he had read them, he showed a great desire for your coming to England and confirmed again what he had promised before. But because you wrote that you still hoped for something in Germany, he added: "I say that such hope is very thin." But since you said you had a large family and feared that the expenses would be greater than you could bear, he spoke to a certain merchant to provide you with all necessities. He will send, I think, a hundred crowns for travel expenses.</p>
      <p>As for my own opinion, if you ask, I advise and encourage you to come. You would not lack a lecture in Cambridge; if that condition did not please you, you could preach publicly in London, where there would be no lack of a very large audience; for there are over five thousand Germans here, to whom you would undoubtedly be most welcome. Therefore, I very much wish that, if it can be done without great inconvenience to you, you come as soon as possible. There is nothing else I can write about the most reverend, except that he favors the truth of the gospel more and more every day, and although something unfavorable was previously spread about him, now he shows in reality that he is very pious and wants nothing more than for Christ to flourish and reign; therefore, I get along very well with him." Thus he.</p>
      <p>Regarding this calling, I have no thought unless there is no opportunity to serve Christ in Germany, as I wrote to Bernhardin before. However, it is very pleasing that the purity of Christianity is obtaining more and more in this kingdom, which will undoubtedly receive many exiles fleeing to it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we must pray unceasingly to the Lord for him, that He may finally quell that dangerous Scottish war, from which not a few evils can rush into that kingdom, unless the Lord averts them with His mercy. As for my own case, I have nothing certain yet, except that yesterday the senate recommended it to the schoolmasters, one of whom is the treasurer Haller. The other two, also of senatorial rank, are unknown to me. They will deal with me, as I hear, both about the administration of the office and about the annual stipend. What you write to me, if the Lord wills me to stay here, I will faithfully perform. I think there will be no danger from the German ministers in this synod that could harm peace and tranquility; but the same is feared from the French as you write; however, those who will be appointed by the senate will take care that no contention and dissension arise, whatever those contentious and talkative minds may attempt. I have great thanks for your kindness towards my wife and children; may the Lord repay you, and I will acknowledge this faith of yours towards me with a grateful heart if the occasion ever presents itself. If my own conjectures do not deceive me, I will be able to return to you on the 24th of this month.</p>
      <p>Farewell very well, dearest of men. Greetings to your whole household and to all my lords and brothers, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Theodor, and Mr. Gualther, and our Gervasius.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 12, 1549.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Most illustrious theologian Bullinger, of the church and brotherhood...</p>
