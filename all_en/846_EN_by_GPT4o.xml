      <p> Greetings. Regarding our godfather Mr. Haller, dearest godfather in the Lord, in my opinion, he is well situated and is doing quite well, and I perceive nothing from him that would lead me to believe he is troubled. Furthermore, I received from the treasurer Mr. Haller yesterday that his stipend has been increased quite appropriately, and he is now considering how to transfer what he has with you in Zurich to here, for which reason I also believe he will come to you shortly. I have commended my cause to the Lord; unless He assists my affairs, there is little I can hope for. I think constantly about our Gervasius; the people of Biel have claimed that he is an old man and a Buceranist, as if a minister of Christ, because he is a presbyter, would be inconvenient to the ecclesiastical presbytery, and if he were to breathe Buceranism, you there would be so dull as to have observed nothing of it until now. I beseech you, when our godfather Mr. Haller comes to you, to advocate for our excellent brother's cause. I will not desist either, but will press the matter here as far as is appropriate for my position. By the grace of Christ, everything at my home is still safe. Farewell excellently, dearest godfather and most sincere brother in the Lord. </p>
      <p> Greetings to all yours in my name and in the name of mine. Also to Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, and the other lords and brothers. Bern, 1550, February 25. </p>
      <p> Wolfgang Musculus, your godfather in the Lord. My Abraham is hardly limping anymore; praise be to the Lord; I am of good hope that it will become much better. My Sarele sends her playmate Verele a thousand greetings; she would like to run around the garden with her, if only mother Klunglerin were not there. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his dearest godfather in the Lord. </p>
      <p> Zurich. </p>
