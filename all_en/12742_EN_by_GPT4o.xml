    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] What more can one write when what was previously considered certain now appears uncertain? The situation is so entangled. May Christ cut through this Gordian knot!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Yesterday, a letter arrived dated November 22 from the [Schmalkaldic] camp near Giengen, according to which [Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Landgrave Philipp of Hesse] intended to set out for home on the same day. The princes have learned that Saxony is almost entirely occupied and that the Bohemians would follow suit. Furthermore, Duke Moritz [of Saxony] is soon to attack Wittenberg. The [Upper German] cities have good reason to fear, especially since Emperor [Charles V] is still holding out in the camp. This could have dire consequences for them and for [Duke Ulrich of] Württemberg. Yet, there is still no reason to give up hope, for victory is solely God's affair! Moreover, the cities and Württemberg have enough soldiers, should they choose to muster people and rely on God's help (the Emperor's army has been miraculously decimated by plague and disease). Should they fall into the Emperor's hands, they will eventually still overcome the victor! Was not Daniel's victory in Babylon greater than what Jehoiachin or Zedekiah could have achieved in Jerusalem? However, perhaps the news transmitted to Zürich is also false.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It is certain that a treaty between King [Francis I] of France and the Schmalkaldic League will soon occur. The withdrawal of the princes could well be the first result of this alliance with the Egyptian king! Myconius and [Francisco de] Enzinas should keep this to themselves unless they hear the same from others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Currently, the Small and the Great Council are deliberating whether to muster troops to the banner or the company now or only after Christmas, and how to deal with the mercenaries who have joined the Schmalkaldic forces. The people of Zürich have strict, yet entirely justified laws in this regard.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also to Enzinas, [Johannes] Gast, and [Johannes] Oporin.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. What can I write, my dear Myconius, when even those things that were certain until now are becoming uncertain? The situation seems to me to be entirely entangled, like a Gordian knot in the hands of the parties involved. May the Lord Jesus cut through it for the glory of His name and the safety of His church!</p>

      <p>Yesterday, we received letters from the Danube camp at Giengen, dated November 22, indicating that on that day our camp was preparing not for winter quarters but for home, which caused great fear and sorrow in the cities, especially since the Emperor is still firmly entrenched in his camp. The princes have received news that almost the entire territory of Saxony is occupied (and indeed Maurice is soon to attack Wittenberg), with the Bohemians following. Perhaps this is why they are hastening home. What do you think will happen to the cities and Württemberg in the meantime? I have not yet given up hope, my brother (even if what is written is certain), for victory does not come from men. The soldiers of Württemberg and the cities are numerous and well-equipped, if they wish to prove themselves as men and implore God's help, especially since plague and disease have miraculously devastated the Emperor's army. The Lord will provide. But if they fall into the Emperor's hands, they will still conquer, even in defeat, and the victor will be vanquished! You know the ways of our Lord God! Daniel's victory in Babylon was greater than what Jehoiachin or Zedekiah could have achieved in Jerusalem. Perhaps what has been written to us is false and fabricated.</p>

      <p>It is certain that a treaty between the King of France and the Schmalkaldic League will soon be concluded. If the miserable withdrawal is the first fruit of this treaty with the King of Egypt? I write this only to you and Dr. Dryander. Unless you hear the same from others, I do not want you to say that you received anything of this from me. Let us pray to the Lord, that in His holy will He may have mercy on us and preserve us.</p>

      <p>Right now, the Small and Great Council are deliberating whether to muster troops to the banner or the company now or to let it rest until after Christmas; how to deal with the mercenaries who have joined the Schmalkaldic forces. You know well what strict, yet good regulations we have. May God Almighty guide it well!</p>
