    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The day before, Peter Scher the Elder returned from Ulm with so much news from Schwarzenburg that Blarer cannot write it all down.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In the Ulm Minster, the chairs and benches were removed, and the soldiers were mustered there, shooting around with their arquebuses! To remedy this situation, the [Ulm authorities] pretended that the church had to be cleared because a requiem mass for the deceased Queen [Anna of Bohemia and Hungary] was to be held there. In the Dominican monastery, where masses are being celebrated again, the church and altars were decorated, and a golden Mary was hung in its original place. It is likely that the monks and priests will be allowed back into the city and permitted to practice their faith and rites, just as the Protestants are still allowed to do, until it is forbidden again at the first good opportunity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Scher recounted how a Protestant [...], who wishes to remain anonymous, reported to him in Ulm that he heard Maximilian of Egmont, Count of Buren, and Emperor Charles V. railing against Pope Paul III. The Emperor allegedly said, among other things, that he would teach the priest that he is his Emperor; he also plans to appoint a suitable person to the papal throne. He is being incited by the unrestrained Spaniards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] He has also granted leave to all Italians. Almost all have already withdrawn. [Bernhard] of Schaumburg is supposed to move to Augsburg with nine companies of German infantrymen, [Eriprando] Madruzzo with four or five companies to Ravensburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Allegedly, Landgrave Philip of Hesse is also seeking the Emperor's mercy. Therefore, Buren is said to have gone to Ulm to the Emperor as a mediator. In the presence of a young man [...], he asked the Emperor whether he would not invite the Landgrave along with the [Duke Henry of Brunswick, held captive by the former] and pardon him? The Emperor smiled and said one could think about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Landgrave is in good spirits, goes hunting as usual, and sometimes takes the young Duke [Charles Victor] of Brunswick with him. The strict detention conditions of Duke Henry have also been relaxed. If this is true, it means that the Landgrave's freedom will depend on that of the Duke. What a pity!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The imperial soldiers rob, plunder, and mistreat women of all ages, especially in the Ulm area. The Ulm captain Michel Berchtold von Nellingen told Scher that the residents of a village complained vehemently in Ulm about soldiers who raped very young girls while standing, so that their shoes were full of blood. There is truly neither discipline nor honor among these people! How angry God must be!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The Michelsberg near Ulm has been surveyed because the Emperor wants to build a castle and a fortress there to better control the city, which will likely lose its freedom forever.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] About 15 mules of [Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle, were seen in Schaffhausen and Stockach accompanied by 150 horsemen. The innkeeper in Stockach [...] told Scher that the horsemen had their interpreter [...] say that they were going to [Italy and Spain] to recruit 15,000 new soldiers and then also subdue Switzerland.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] A lot of salt is being bought in Lindau for Central Switzerland. Recently, [the Urner Martin Tresch], bailiff in Münsterlingen, acquired over 40 barrels for these places. They are probably up to something. The Zurichers should be cautious!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg has been expected in Ulm [to prostrate before the Emperor] for some time, but has not yet appeared. Perhaps he is ill.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] It was good that the Zurich envoy [Georg Müller] was in Konstanz. As in the city, it will soon be said in the surrounding area that the Confederates will not leave Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] It is, of course, not the intention of the people of Konstanz to submit to King Francis I, as Bullinger will have understood. Consequently, negotiations with France should be conducted as [Konrad Zwick] outlined [in No. 2762]. Only such negotiations can be justified. May God grant success!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony is said to have attacked the [Upper] Lusatia, which is in the possession of King Ferdinand I. Apparently, the King is now moving against him with many Bohemians. May God assist this elector, abandoned by all!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] What will happen regarding the people of Konstanz is uncertain. Scher heard from the imperial commander in Kirchheim unter Teck, [Lorenz] von Altensteig, that the counts [Friedrich von Fürstenberg]-Heiligenberg and [Hugo] von Montfort were commissioned by the Emperor to pressure Konstanz. Perhaps the city will not be besieged, but it will be outlawed and forbidden from trade and access to markets. Yet even then, God would not abandon them if they willingly trusted Him. Bullinger should pray for the people of Konstanz, for such measures will soon cause discontent among the population.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] [On February 9] Blarer wrote to Bullinger through Hans Stadelmann, pastor in Altnau, and asked him to assist Stadelmann. He has probably already been to Bullinger or will appear shortly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] Since the submission of Augsburg, Blarer has not received a letter from Georg Frölich or the mayors [Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot], but he has from other pious and noble people (including Sixt Birck), who complain greatly about the city's compliance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] Scher also reported that during the Schmalkaldic War, letters from several preachers were handed over to the Emperor's confessor, [Pedro de Malvenda]. This caused great harm, as the letters contained all sorts of things about the Emperor. Blarer therefore thinks that the letters written during the war should be burned or otherwise disposed of. Enclosed is a [threatening letter addressed to Johannes Brenz], which was presumably posted by Malvenda on the church door in Schwäbisch Hall.</p>

      <p>My dear brother-in-law Peter Scher arrived yesterday from Ulm. He brought me so much and various news that I cannot write it all down.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In the Ulm Minster, all the chairs and benches have been removed, and the soldiers had to be mustered there. They fired their arquebuses inside, and thus one had to hear the sons of thunder, etc. In order to clear the church, a pretext was sought, claiming that a requiem mass for the deceased queen had to be held there. In the Dominican monastery in Ulm, the church and altar are being decorated again, and the beautiful golden Mary has been hung up in the middle, as it was many years ago. Mass is also being held there. It is believed that monks and priests will be reinstated, allowed to practice their faith and ceremonies, and we will also believe and hold what we want until further notice, which will be given to us at the first opportunity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>He also told me about a good-hearted man (who is of our faith, but is not to be named) who heard in Ulm from the Count of Buren and the Emperor that they spoke very badly of the Pope, and the Emperor said he would teach the priest that he should see that he is his Emperor! He also wants to set the Pope's chair right and put the one in it who belongs there! He spoke much else about the Pope. And the Spaniards speak terribly badly of him without fear. (Fear)</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Furthermore, the Emperor has already granted leave to all Italians. Most have already left. The one from Schaumburg is supposed to go to Augsburg with nine companies of German soldiers, and the one from Madruzzo with four or five companies to Ravensburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It is believed that the Landgrave should also come to grace. The one from Buren is said to be handling this with the Emperor in Ulm. The same one said to the Emperor in the presence of a good young lord: "Most gracious Emperor, how would it be if the Landgrave came before your Imperial Majesty and brought the Duke of Brunswick with him? Would your Imperial Majesty not show mercy?" To which the Emperor smiled and said: "We would have to do something about it, but we would think about it."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>It is said that the Landgrave is safe and in good spirits, pursuing his old habits, sometimes taking the young Duke of Brunswick with him on the hunt. And the old one is no longer in harsh captivity. If it's true, then I'm sure, quod erit anima sua pro anima illius. It is a pity!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Furthermore, they rob, plunder, and mistreat women and young maidens, especially in the countryside and in the dominion of Ulm, so miserably that it is pitiful. A pious captain told my brother-in-law, named Michel von Nellingen, that a letter and supplication had come from a village to those of Ulm, where the subjects complained miserably about how this wretched warfolk had raped several young, immature daughters so constantly that their shoes were swimming in blood. In summary, there is neither discipline nor honor, neither fairness nor justice among these people, and a great wrath of God against us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Also, the Michelsberg, located near Ulm, has been very diligently surveyed, and it is believed that the Emperor wants to build a castle and fortress there, so that the city will always remain oppressed and controlled, never to regain its liberty.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Approximately 15 mules of Granvelle have been loaded with 150 horses, also been to Schaffhausen and Stockach. The innkeeper in Stockach told my brother-in-law Peter Scher how the horsemen said through their interpreter, they wanted to go in and bring 15,000 fresh soldiers and also make the Swiss obedient.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>So much salt is being bought in Lindau for the lands. And the bailiff in Münsterlingen recently bought over forty barrels of salt in Lindau for the lands, which makes one suspect that something is being planned. Therefore, be cautious!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The Duke of Württemberg has not yet personally been to Ulm. It is not known what it means, as he was supposed to come there a few days ago. Perhaps he is ill.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>That your envoy was here is a good thing. And the rumor is already spreading throughout the city that the Confederates will not leave this city. It will soon be heard outside the city as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Regarding France, that we should submit to the crown of France is not at all our intention, as you yourself know the reasons well, but to negotiate in such a way as you from my dear one. That would be feasible and justifiable before God and the world. May God grant that it happens!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>The Elector is said to have attacked Lusatia. It belongs to the king. The king is supposed to march against him with many Bohemians. The pious prince is abandoned by everyone. May God preserve him for much good, etc.!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>What they have in mind for us, we cannot yet know. But my brother-in-law Peter has now been to Kirchheim in Württemberg with the Emperor's commander. He is one from Altensteig. From him, he heard that the Emperor said: "The people of Konstanz will now be handed over to the counts of Heiligenberg and Montfort. They will know how to deal with them with the support of the imperial forces." As we then suspect, there will be no siege against us, but they will outlaw us and cut off trade and markets, etc. But God, who can help in everything, will not abandon us if we are willing and well comforted in Him. Therefore, help us heartily with prayers, for the poor common man, who must seek his livelihood outside, will be greatly burdened by such a way, if God does not turn it away, and soon become impatient and restless.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>I wrote to you today through Hans Stadelmann, pastor in Altnau, that you would assist him in his matter. Remember, he has been with you or will come to you today or tomorrow.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Since Augsburg submitted, neither Lętus nor any mayor has written to me, but several other pious and also prominent people, who complain greatly about this action. Sixtus Betuleius, the schoolmaster, and others also write to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>My brother-in-law Peter told me that many letters from several preachers, which they wrote together during this war, have been found and handed over to the Emperor's confessor; from which great discord arose, as they wrote all sorts of things about the Emperor to each other, so that I often think we should burn all our letters written during this war or otherwise dispose of them. Herewith a letter. Someone posted it on the church door in Hall. Who he is, is not known; it is suspected that Malvenda did it.</p>
      <p>To the man of incomparable piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his friend and brother in every way. Zurich.</p>
