      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>You marvel in your letters to me and inquire, most learned Bullinger, how it happens that I have so far neglected my duty in writing. Certainly, it was not the will, but the ability that prevented it; for having been severely afflicted by a quartan fever for almost four continuous months, enduring such deadly pains and lethal agonies, I was not only unable to write anything, but could scarcely even breathe. Nevertheless, as is fitting, while I breathe, I hope and, trusting in Christ Jesus, I strive to ask the gracious God to dissolve me at a good hour and make me reign eternally with Christ His Son. Meanwhile, consider my frail old age and our church commended to your and your brothers' devoted prayers.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you write about a certain Servetus, driven mad by Satan, we have scarcely any information about his name so far, which is why we know nothing about his impious doctrines; however, we wish to be informed about them by you. You also marvel at the silence of the prince. He is now at Montbéliard and is so strongly occupied with taking possession of those his realms that he writes less frequently; once these matters are perhaps settled, he will return to his former activities.</p>
      <p>No one among the brothers has yet seen the booklets on Justification published by you; therefore, if by chance some faithful bookseller, who are very rare in our region, brings the booklets for sale here and there, we ask that you entrust these signed copies to one of them and have them sent to us. If we know their prices, they will be paid without delay.</p>
      <p>Also, six on Justification; also those brief popular sermons privately printed and collected into a booklet, which I will give to a pious and truly religious matron; also 4 German booklets, one of which is written on Psalm 50 Miserere, translated by Sarcerius.</p>
      <p>The state of our church, under the protection of Christ, remains as it was and sincere; everything is still safe, pure, and unchanged.</p>
      <p>We hear dreadful things about the English kingdom, about which you may know more certainly than we do. It certainly seems that Satan has gone out from the face of God to afflict the church of Christ, which indeed our sins have deserved. Besides, there is nothing new with us, since there is no one in Strasbourg with whom I exchange letters. If there is anything with you, please let us know. And so now farewell in the Lord, to whom I have sanctified both my death and my life, and I will not be put to shame forever. Amen. In Riquewihr, on the 8th day before the calends of February in the year 1554. Johannes Ulstetter, the leader of our youth, also greets you.</p>
      <p>Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and renowned in piety Lord Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zürich, his lord and brother.</p>
