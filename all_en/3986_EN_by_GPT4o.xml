      <p>My humble willing service and all good things are before you.</p>
      <p>Friendly, dear brother-in-law, I have received your letter and therein understood your good friendly will, also that of your wife. I have shown this to my sister, also to Mr. Manuel, their cousin, therefore they let you know their friendly thanks, that you are so kind and take their sons in such a way, that they would not have needed to ask you with effort. But since you are making such an attempt with the sons, my sister is very satisfied with it.</p>
      <p>I also think the boys will behave with you so that they can stay well together; for they have been together for a good time in Lausanne; but now at home, they are somewhat more lively. Depending on how they behave in the meantime, you can act according to your good judgment. As for the reward, my sister will be very satisfied with it, also with the rest that she should otherwise pay, in the same manner. She has instructed me to prepare the sons and dress them decently and, as soon as possible, send them off; they have been instructed to do so, and as for music, to let them learn as much as possible. Greetings to our sister-in-law, etc.</p>
      <p>With this, you are truly entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>I also wonder if my son Hans Ulrich is doing well with his master Stampfer. Done on the 9th of June in 1559. Your willing brother-in-law L... Zehender.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned, and wise master Heinrich Bullinger in ZÃ¼rich, his friendly brother-in-law, to hand, etc.</p>
