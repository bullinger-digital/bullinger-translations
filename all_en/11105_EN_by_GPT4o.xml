    <p xml:id="regest1">B[artholomäus] Westheimer will have paid Platter the gulden owed by Bullinger for the Nizolius edition. Would like to have the Sedulius fragments back if no one wants to print them. Sends Walter of Châtillon's work on Alexander the Great; if it is printed, Bullinger wishes to receive 4 free copies for the intermediaries [of the manuscript]. Has learned from Johann Jakob Ammann that Platter would like to see Zwingli's New Testament; leaves this to Platter for private use with the request for a prompt return; because it is dear to Bullinger. Requests the procurement of the work by Hermann von dem Busche on the sole authority of the [holy] scriptures; [Johannes] Gast has also written about it.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The golden florin that I owe you, dear Blatter, has been paid to you for Mario Nizolius, I believe, by B. Westheimer. For I had earnestly requested this from him. If you have not yet received it, let me know, and do not doubt that you will receive it shortly.</p>
      <p>As for the fragments of Sedulius, which I sent to you a year ago, please return them unless you wish to print the most charming author at some point.</p>
      <p>At present, I am sending you the life of Alexander the Great described in heroic verse, the work of a certain Walter of Châtillon. If you do not wish to print this, return it in good faith. However, if you do print it, please give me 4 copies, so that I may give them to those through whose efforts I received this author. However, the moon is missing due to the carelessness of this printer. You have many there with you who can correct the book.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the distinguished man Johann Jakob Ammann, my dear brother, has reported to me how eagerly you wish to see the New Testament of the blessed memory of Mr. Huldrych Zwingli; that you pledge your word that it will be returned to us shortly, and that you do not wish to entrust it to the hands of typesetters, but wish to use it privately and compare it with other copies. Therefore, under this condition and trust, I hand it over to you, otherwise, I would not give it if I knew it would reach other hands than yours. Nor would I easily have entrusted it to anyone else. For it is held in the highest esteem by me, and that for many reasons. Therefore, you will ensure that I experience your trust, about which I have no doubt in this matter.</p>
      <p>Hermann von dem Busche wrote two books on the unique authority of the scriptures. I would like you to procure these for me. I would pay the price in good faith. I have also written to Gast about them.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me, dear Blatter.</p>
      <p>3rd of November, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the industrious man Thomas Platter, printer in Basel, a singular friend. Basel.</p>
