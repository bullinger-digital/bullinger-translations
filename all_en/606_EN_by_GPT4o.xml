      <p>Be well, most humane of all men.</p>
      <p>I fully responded to those two letters of yours while I was in Chur. Other letters were delivered to me later, in which you express your incredible love towards me. For you leave nothing undone in which you can gratify me. I wish that I could someday show the same towards you. But I easily allow myself to be surpassed by you in this, to whom I give thanks for all these things you have conveyed to me.</p>
      <p>In Venice, while I was here, news was brought that the persecution against the saints of God is becoming more severe by the day. Therefore, I proceed there not without danger; for you know how hated I am by the papists and the impious. But I will not rashly commit myself to the journey. The Lord will indeed save me from all these evils; you will pray to Him for me.</p>
      <p>The churches of this Valtellina valley would be marvelously growing everywhere in the way of the Lord, if not for two things that wonderfully hinder them. One is the poisonous doctrine of Camillus, whom you know, he infects and disturbs the minds of all, the other is the laziness, which perhaps seems incredible to you, of Doctor Augustin, the bishop of the church of Chiavenna; for he acts as a pastor in no way, as I have often heard from the testimonies of many most reputable men and I myself have observed some things. For due to his negligence, that church is utterly dissipated. Therefore, this calamity can be addressed if those two are ordered to appear at the Chur synod, which, as you know, is held twice a year by those ministers, to give an account, one of his doctrine, the other of his administration. This matter should not be neglected. You can, if you wish, inform your dearest Johann Blasius about this matter. You, however, can learn from many others whether these things are so. I previously thought well of Augustin and could not have persuaded myself otherwise unless I had seen these things with my own eyes. But I would wish that such matters be kept with you, lest, if they were perhaps discovered, I should incur the name of a detractor or informer. You, in your piety, will do what seems right to you and necessary for the churches of Christ. You will ensure that these are transmitted to our Lelio as soon as possible and you will love me and convey many greetings to all the pious in my name. Farewell in the Lord most happily.</p>
      <p>Given in Caspano, on the 28th of July, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Balthasar Altieri.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable lord Heinrich Bullinger, adorned with utmost piety and learning, lord and brother always to be respected. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
