      <p>Last week, several people who had left the city were summoned to Constance with a safe conduct, namely Ludwig Heurusen, the guild master Sebastian Bären, and Hubentobler, all three of whom were members of the daily council. The commissioners dealt with each of them individually and asked if they wished to receive the king's pardon. When they answered yes, they imposed a fine of 2000 florins on Heurusen and 400 florins on Bären as a penalty for being rebellious and disobedient to the king. If they paid this, they would be reconciled like others, allowed to return to the city with their belongings, and take the oath like others if they wished to stay. If they did not wish to stay, they could leave with their belongings to wherever they desired. They were to give an answer within three days. Heinrich Hack from Frauenfeld, who is also a citizen of Constance and had been a substitute city clerk for several years, was also summoned. After marrying a wealthy woman, he became a churchwarden. The 13 cantons wrote on his behalf. They asked him if he wished to remain, to which he answered yes, and they postponed their response. I do not know what was written about him.</p>
      <p>He is, however, a very pious and capable man in matters of religion. They also dealt with Hubentobler, but no fine was imposed on him because he owns nothing in Constance and is also a Swiss confederate, having property near St. Gallen, etc.</p>
      <p>They also summoned a man who had left the monastery of Petershausen long ago and became a citizen after marrying, having several children. He has now left again and come to Thurgau. My brother-in-law Gorius from Ulm has helped him become the pastor of Dondorf, not far from Wellenberg. He has a very good parish and a fine disposition, and I could not wish for more temporal happiness from God than to have such a small church to care for with a proper calling. I would be happy for all the principalities, even if it had a small income. When this good man appeared before the commissioners, they said nothing more to him nor wished to deal with him further than this: "Dear sir, you have been misled; therefore, leave in the same manner in which you came," etc. They have not summoned any other preachers, all of whom are citizens except for me and one other. Neither my brother nor my cousin Conrad Zwick nor the guild master Labhart nor the city clerk have been summoned. It is not known what will happen, whether they will not pardon the prominent ones or perhaps deal with them later, etc.</p>
      <p>It has also been agreed that the properties of those who left will be rebuilt at their own expense, and in the event that their properties are taken away, they shall and will be reimbursed for the costs incurred in rebuilding.</p>
      <p>There are no more than 40 foreign soldiers left in the city; the king maintains them. The commissioners are expected to leave very soon. They reassure the citizens very well regarding the Spaniards, saying that there is nothing to it, and that some troops will be stationed there, so that they are completely believed.</p>
      <p>God willing, it is true.</p>
      <p>Given in Yl. March 27. Forgive through Christ.</p>
      <p>I wrote to you on the 20th of this month and do not doubt that you have received it. If the enclosed letter reaches you in time, please forward it, as it is now on its way to Solothurn to be handed over to the messenger from Basel, so that it may reach Frau Eva in Basel. Forgive me for troubling you so much, etc. If it is lost, please send it otherwise with the next available messenger; whatever you spend on drink money, write it down; I will always repay you with great thanks, etc.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
