      <p>To the honorable and godfather, I was at a wedding here on October 30th, and from several conversations I had with the bailiff, who was sitting next to me, I was able to understand, as well as from other observations, that nothing but war (may God prevent it) is imminent. However, when some were missing at the wedding and people asked about them, it was said among other things that they were in Ilanz at a meeting they had to attend on behalf of the embassy that had come to them from the Five Places.</p>
      <p>And as the messenger passed through here on the same day after completing his mission, wearing the colors of Lucerne, and was stopped by some here, I was informed of all these matters as necessary. That evening, I went to a trusted council friend by night, with whose advice all things were discussed, and he is an old experienced man and especially a good Zürcher. From this, I understood so much that, together with Herr Pontisella, a pious, honest, and faithful Zürcher, I got up on the morning of the 31st of this month before daybreak and went to the Upper League to learn about these practices. (For it seemed to me that I had not learned, the Lucerne messenger had made them better disposed). And as I had now gone a little more than half a mile, the old man from Capol, once a land judge, came riding to me, who, when he offered me his hand and I asked him, as the one who had attended the last meeting in Ilanz in the Upper League, about one thing and another, answered: a messenger from Lucerne had come, sent the next day, and brought letters. Their content was this: "We hear that you from the Upper League want to help your parties and the Glarus people to justice, which we do not expect from you, etc. For we think that letters and seals should be kept with us, and we hope in God that we should not be further instructed in justice." (Note this: Pontisella was present; no one is more sincere and integral and more devoted to you). As much as I could, I have put these words.</p>
      <p>He added: the messenger brought all the negotiations that were conducted in Einsiedeln, and when he recited the summary, it did not agree with yours. But still, they sent everything that was negotiated in Einsiedeln, but in a different way than from you. Since I understood that, I soon returned.</p>
      <p>And when the consul Tsch[arner] immediately understood from the land judge (for I had reconciled with him) and I could not understand that any attention was given to the matter, that anyone in the lands was found to arm themselves, and it seemed strange to me that they sent a runner to Constance (as you heard) and now only to the Upper and not to other Leagues, and it seems to me that people are dealing with matters as you understood, namely giving good words, acting differently behind the scenes, and ours are doing as much as they can (I speak of the guilty; for I exclude pious, honest people, of whom, God willing, the greater part is in our lands): so I could not refrain, since the practices of people are swift, to report this to you and, since it is very important to me, to send a special messenger. If I have served the city of Zurich with this, it is well and good; if not, I have done my part and hope to God, he recognizes my heart and good intentions, and will also reward everyone in time according to their actions and omissions. Yet I commend myself to the protection and shelter of the honorable city of Zurich, but above all to God's protection. Amen.</p>
      <p>This is written in great haste.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you to forgive me.</p>
      <p>Also, one more thing, that those from the Five Places sent their embassy to Misox a few days ago and negotiated there regarding Lord Beccaria and a schoolmaster and among other things threatened: if it is not done from the land, they want to take them out by force. Whereupon the good people, since the land judge in the Upper League also threatened them, have decided to do it before St. Martin's Day; for Antonius Lazarus, who supported Beccaria and had a special reputation, is dead. These are very certain; for they were discussed here in the assembly, and I from the consul.</p>
      <p>Do what God reminds you, and do not believe all smooth words, and if it must be, then let it be sooner rather than later; for I fear badly, too much is believed. I write what is most certain and well-known.</p>
      <p>You know the hand and who I am, who writes.</p>
      <p>I have sent this letter as far as Sargans, to the current lord bailiff with a request that he send it to you promptly and, if possible, before the messengers from Baden ride. For what the people have in mind can be understood from both writings, both to the vicar of Constance and to ours; for why do they write this only to the Upper League. Also, if our honorable lords write all negotiations briefly and also send the letter to the communities and then another letter to a mayor with a request to arrange for their letter to be read from community to community; for otherwise, if it does not reach the communities, it is in vain. To the honorable, well-learned, pious, and faithful lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich at the Great Minster, his gracious lord, to answer.</p>
