      <p>Greetings. So that I do not write nothing even now, dear brother, I at least wanted to send greetings and report these few things: The royal envoy passed through here, a man, as it appears, not bad, certainly eloquent and not imprudent.</p>
      <p>We discussed various matters.</p>
      <p>Another envoy of the king arrived in Solothurn; however, both spoke with me privately, and the one from Solothurn is not approved as much as yours.</p>
      <p>We have nothing yet from the assembly.</p>
      <p>The Three Leagues did not want to address the matter of Claron from the beginning of the assembly, as had been decreed previously; they claim they have not yet fully consulted on giving a response.</p>
      <p>The mediators took this indignantly and ordered a response within a few days; we are therefore waiting to see what will happen.</p>
      <p>We have nothing from France, except that rumor spreads that the king entered Lyon with royal pomp on June 12 and was received there magnificently. I would rather hear from you about the Hannibalic soldiers, where they are being led.</p>
      <p>The Emperor's commissioners wrote to the prefects of the neighboring Swiss, not to suspect anything sinister, that all is well, and may all indeed be well.</p>
      <p>I am always as I am, in poor health, and yet I must continue until I succumb. The wife of Egli, otherwise a good man, will pay the penalty for insolence and stubbornness.</p>
      <p>Good Egli will bear a heavy burden; for his father, along with his mother, awaits his arrival with great longing. His remaining relatives are poor; they will drain him and in the meantime will not show him any gratitude. He would have lived much more comfortably and peacefully with you; but while avoiding Scylla, we fall into Charybdis.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and your family. Farewell.</p>
      <p>The royal envoy reported amazing things about your fellow member; see to it again and again that you handle him so that he causes no harm, and that a hidden evil, as much as possible, does not erupt and an open discord among you does not harm the cause.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 16, 1564.</p>
      <p>Greet the honorable consuls.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
