      <p>Greetings. Although, reverend father in Christ, I do not doubt that the most illustrious man Friedrich von Salis has abundantly explained to you everything he thought you should know about our republic, yet because this good old man was traveling to you, I preferred to send you a letter rather than none at all. This is the father of the consul Tscharner, whom you have known for a long time, I believe; a man of exceptional integrity who has vigorously promoted the cause of the Gospel among us, which I think you have heard from others. Therefore, as is your humanity, which I think you have heard from others. Therefore, as is your humanity, I ask you to grant him at least half an hour of mutual conversation, which is a service that would delight him greatly. If you wish to inquire about the bishop's cause from him, you may certainly do so. I do not wish to write more, as the good old man will insist on a lengthy letter. Therefore, I ask you to forgive the brevity of my letter. I would ask that you show the good old man the kindness that he is entitled to expect from you, unless by doing so I would seem to doubt your willingness.</p>
      <p>I received your very brief letters, in which you wish to know the state of our affairs and the republic, what is happening in Italy, and what news there is from Naples, about which, however, since I do not doubt that the most illustrious man von Salis has fully informed you, I refrain from writing more.</p>
      <p>May all the ministers of your churches fare very well. Please commend me to the most honorable consuls, Georg Müller and Johann Habi, and convey my many greetings to them, if you can do so conveniently, I ask you not to hesitate.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, reverend father in Christ, and continue to love me. Chur, on the fourth day before the calends of July, in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, distinguished in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church in Zürich, his lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
