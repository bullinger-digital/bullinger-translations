      <p>Greetings. I am grateful for what you wrote on the 6th of this month.</p>
      <p>I have no news from France except that many are still imprisoned for the sake of religion, and there are no burnings. I think I will soon understand what outcome everything will have.</p>
      <p>The hand of the Lord is not shortened, that it cannot protect and defend His own. If you have not seen the recess and all the acts of the Augsburg Diet, I will send them to you.</p>
      <p>I am now sending the history of David of Basel. It would be most pleasing to me if I could gratify you in some way, and I will not miss any opportunity.</p>
      <p>What has been written from Italy,... will be interpreted for you. The Bernese have decided to amicably settle all disputes with the Duke of Savoy. What the outcome will be is uncertain.</p>
      <p>The King of Navarre will remain with the king and will be one of the chief counselors. God moderates and strengthens the hearts of princes.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Martyr, Walter, and those who inquire about me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 15th of September. Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
