      <p>Dear lord and brother, while I was here in Griesenberg, I twice sent letters to my dear cousin Walther or Walthart to Lady Eva von Schönau, in which other letters were enclosed, etc., that he would arrange for them to be sent from Zurich to Basel for me. However, my letter carrier now writes to me in the letter you have now written to me, that no letters have been received by you except the most recent ones, which you sent to Basel with your messenger at my request, which greatly troubles and burdens me; for I wrote all sorts of things in my letters to my cousin von Schönau, which are of no small importance to me, and I would not like the letter to fall into foreign hands and be read.</p>
      <p>Now my dear cousin Walthart tells me that he delivered both letters to you, and you accepted them to be sent to Basel. Therefore, my heartfelt and earnest request to you is to think about to whom you gave the letters, and if you might be able to retrieve them; for it is truly of great importance to me if they should be lost. The first I wrote on October 7; I wrote to you through my Walthart, - the other on October 28, I also wrote to you through Walther, and he delivered both letters to you for von Schönau in Basel, as he says; please remember for God's sake.</p>
      <p>I never thought otherwise than that the letters had been delivered until you now write to me that no letters from me have reached you. There were other letters enclosed, which were meant for Rheinfelden; I have two cousins there.</p>
      <p>My dear brother, my wife, my sister, and I wish you, your honorable dear wife, and children a very, very good, gracious, faithful, loving, patient, and peaceful happy year and thereafter eternal life. Desiring all your faithful intercession.</p>
      <p>Regarding Walther, my dear sister is well satisfied, as he must not neglect his studies; he sends you much love and good wishes.</p>
      <p>Doctor Nikolaus Mayer was recently in Winterthur overnight, and he let it be known that he intends to ride to Zurich; I am very curious about his business, for various reasons. It is my friendly request to inform me of what you know; but if it is a secret not to be revealed, I would still like to know whether he is still at the Württemberg court or not, etc. If I had known he was in Winterthur, I would have certainly gone to him; he is a wonderfully skilled, entirely worldly, experienced man, as one rarely finds in many lands. I have various concerns regarding him, and I would like to know whether he has been to Zurich or not and whether he is still with Duke Ulrich.</p>
      <p>Now a special messenger from Balingen has come to me, who also wants to leave early, as my cousin Walthert can well inform you; I must also dispatch him; for my brother-in-law Peter Schär writes to me that a letter and a document among the letters belonging to the Alpirsbach monastery, where I was, have been found, in which my late mother pledged that after her death four hundred should fall to the monastery, etc., and we have been concerned that the newly appointed abbot will demand such money, as he has already summoned my brother to Augsburg for this reason as an heir. My dear brother-in-law suggests how this document might be retrieved; for all the letters belonging to the monastery are still lying in Stuttgart and have not yet been handed over to the abbot. However, he has now heard something from others about this document and thus wanted to strike against my brother. I truly have much to write to several of the councilors, asking them to assist me and remind the duke that he promised me, when I was in the land, that the old abbot would give me the letter. But he said he could not find it anywhere; I let it be a good matter, as I thought little that it would ever come to this, as it has; otherwise, I would have demanded a receipt from the old abbot. After his death, however, all the monastery's letters were taken to Stuttgart, and now this document has also been found among them, as I have now been informed, and I would like to have it, so that my dear brother and I do not have to pay out the 400 florins in addition to all other misfortunes. May God graciously protect us, for which I also earnestly ask, not to hold anything against me. I wanted to write much more to you.</p>
      <p>From Württemberg, nothing new is written, except that all pastors and preachers have been deposed from their preaching office; yet they are allowed to baptize, give the sacrament, and visit the sick, and they are allowed to continue to receive their salary. There are wonderful, strange things, which I cannot comprehend, as the Interim requires that one should also baptize according to papal custom, etc.</p>
      <p>I ask you to send the enclosed letter to Lady Eva von Schönau in Basel as soon as possible, but only when you have certain news; for it would be a disgrace to me if they were lost. It is of some importance to my dear brother and me.</p>
      <p>Everyone here sends you greetings with wishes for many thousands of good years and eternal heavenly joy. Oh, take everything in good part, my dearest brother and heart-golden man.</p>
      <p>I am sending you one writing back, I have copied it in haste, so that I can look into it and perhaps write to you more about it next time. I could not copy the other letter, it was too short for me, I will certainly send it with the next message.</p>
      <p>If the aforementioned intention to write to those in Bern, with the attached reason, which in my opinion is important, pleases you or if you have other suggestions on how to write to them, let me know with the next message, I will write to them. Consider that the delay in writing can be well justified and flows from the reason, namely that I always thought the matters should have been settled with us the expelled. You can also, if you have a message, perhaps mention this to Bern as for yourself, etc. I must stop; may the dear God eternally protect and preserve you and yours. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dated St. John's Day 1548.</p>
      <p>Burn all these letters.</p>
      <p>News: The legate, namely Hans Muntprot, has come from the king, bringing many good, gracious words, but nothing special, except that the troops in Constance are to be paid or will henceforth be maintained from the king's chamber. The current payment must be made by those from Constance, and in response to their great complaint, it was answered that an order from the king has come to Innsbruck, but it has not yet been opened. The king has now held a very large diet in Hungary.</p>
      <p>The young prince is said to have certainly arrived in Milan on St. Thomas's Day and is awaited with great preparations in Innsbruck. It is believed that when he comes out, new, fresh Spaniards will be stationed in Constance; there is complete certainty about this.</p>
      <p>Also, a nobleman has now come to Constance, bringing absolution from imperial ban; a council has given the royal commissioners thirty talers as a gift; but the commissioners have told the appointed council members that they consider it good for reasons that this absolution should not be published for a few more days; they have also not allowed the absolution to be seen nor given reasons why the absolution should be withheld. On the other hand, the people of Constance have recently been declared outlawed again in Wangen, Isny, and several other places, and when this was reported to the royal commissioners in Constance, they did not want to believe it. But it is found that this last outlawing is going very adventurously; namely, on the day when the people of Constance were first declared outlawed on August 5 in Augsburg, the abbot of Weingarten and several other great practitioners, to whom the emperor wanted to show great favor, requested 20,000 florins from the goods of those from Constance; they have not yet collected them and are dissatisfied that the king has taken the city and obtained absolution from the ban, arresting and detaining everywhere with the help of several imperial councilors, so that they might come to this money; it is always thievery upon thievery, etc.</p>
      <p>The new governing persons in Constance have already been appointed, but not yet opened. A commissioner told the current mayor that he must still do his best for a little while. Although the treasury is completely exhausted and there is no more cash available, the commissioners have not wanted a tax to be levied or the outstanding interest to be paid; there are all sorts of wonderful reasons why this happens. Those from Ulm have written to those from Constance and requested that they also pay their share to the one from Brunswick for his claim. In response, they have answered by order of the commissioners that they will leave it to their most gracious lord the king; he will answer for it, etc.</p>
      <p>The expelled have petitioned the commissioners, etc., so that they might pursue their case, etc., with true justification, that they have acted for no other people than those who were commanded to them, etc. Some have said the petitions are good, but lacking, yet not indicating in what or how; but according to all assumptions, it is believed that the intention is that they should request to be allowed to return to the city, etc., which is not at all their situation. No one knows what answer will be given to them; it is well believed that they can achieve nothing unless they do something that does not suit them, which they, I hope, will not do. May God confirm them!</p>
