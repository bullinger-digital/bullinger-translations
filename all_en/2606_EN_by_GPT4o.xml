      <p>Your letter dated the first of March was delivered to me yesterday along with two booklets. I respond to those matters which seem to require a response from me. I will not fail the English; I love their constancy and was deeply grieved that they were overlooked in the recent distribution. However, it was not the will of the Duke, which I solemnly affirm; if I had not been absent from the duchy at that time, as I left for certain reasons, they would not have been neglected.</p>
      <p>Greet them diligently for me and advise them, I pray, to pray for me, especially as I am ill. You will soon have the Pontifical, do not doubt; for I am not one who would willingly take away what was given to you as a gift.</p>
      <p>I now use this occasion, in which Satan changes the guise of his antichrist for us. I kiss the constancy of my Locarnese; may God strengthen them with His spirit, so that they can bear the hardships of exile. If there are any among you, I would like you to say that I have decided to visit them as soon as my health permits, meanwhile to pray that they pray for me.</p>
      <p>But what do you say, Heinrich Bullinger, that you have begun to examine more diligently, prompted by me, whether those booklets of Martin Bellius, Monfortius, etc., originated from us. Alas, what do I hear! I have indeed always brought water to this furnace: but if our people here knew that you suspect this of me, I would certainly bring oil. But beware, I beseech you, that they do not learn of it from elsewhere. I assure you that those booklets are hated by all our people, especially by the prince himself, who could not read two verses in the one that was addressed to him. For he recognized the spirit in which it was composed and rejected it immediately. But why do I excuse myself, as if you do not know from where they originated? Good God, what do I hear, I say?</p>
      <p>I would rather be a papist, and hope for some mercy for my ignorance there, than the author of those books, whom I know was driven by envy, hatred, and a guilty conscience to write, and entirely to defame good churches. For although we cannot endure those fires, we do not tear apart, nor do we try to make those who use them hated. Who does not see how much difference there is between us and those who slander you with scattered books? But may God do ill to Servetus and such monsters which the devil has seized upon as an opportunity, by which the minds of many would be divided, when otherwise they were united. Do you not know that Gratarolus sent me a book of repudiation, not because he thought me a Servetian, for he did not yet think so ill of me, but because I said and say, if I were a judge of such, I would spare their lives.</p>
      <p>But listen further: Lactantius, Martinengo, and the other Italians who live in Geneva are also alienated from me. Certainly, the love which our homeland and the similarity of studies and condition had joined has completely cooled. I can affirm nothing about Calvin's mind towards me, but he will scarcely persevere in his old benevolence with them accusing. But what should I do? Let the world, as great as it is, desert me, I do not know how to flatter, I do not want to speak against my conscience. It is enough for them if I do not cry out, if I do not incite anyone, if I do not cease to love them: only if I ask, which rarely happens, I modestly state my opinion. Should they therefore alienate their minds? The matter is such that I know no one in our churches here who does not feel what I feel, not indeed for the favor of the Duke. For we are not such, but because we also have our own reasons. And enough of this. I only wish to ask you, Heinrich Bullinger, to remove all suspicion that there are such minds among us who would support such books. Inquire more closely in Zürich and you will find out. Then do not think that charity should be broken if we disagree with you on that point.</p>
      <p>It remains for me to say a few words about the silence which I wrote that I approve of on the other point. The booklet of Westphal, the letters of some, did not seem to me of such importance that new booklets should be published by you because of them, especially in this tempestuous time. This is what I felt and still feel. But you thought otherwise, and published a booklet: but you will see what will follow, with me indeed weeping. For I suspect that first those will emerge who will respond most sharply and renew the whole dispute. Then I fear something else as well. But such an inconvenience could have been avoided (in my judgment). But it did not seem so to you. Therefore, it remains to pray to God that all things turn out for the good.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I do not cease to love and esteem you greatly. It will be allowed to say what I feel.</p>
      <p>In the assembly, I hope our affairs will succeed rightly. God has strengthened the minds of many, who have terrified the adversaries with their constancy. In time, even the legate of the antichrist was forced to return to his Babylon.</p>
      <p>I am ill (as I wrote) and could scarcely write this. I hope to come to you soon, and if adverse health did not prevent it, I would have celebrated Easter there. I bid Zwingli, Lavater, Josias, and the other brothers farewell. Help me with your prayers. Stuttgart, April 7, 1555.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>I detained the letters until this day, April 9. Meanwhile, I read the booklet. The doctrine never displeased me. Your letter is much more approved by me, as it is more modest than Calvin's. He certainly seems to speak too virulently in this matter. May God direct it for the good.</p>
      <p>From the assembly (I add again not without reason) many things are better than we hoped. On March 27, a clear indication was given that God wishes to conquer by some miraculous occasion. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Stuttgart, April 9.</p>
      <p>Postscript. I was with Mr. Brenz for a long time, who sincerely groaned, reproaching that Westphal who published the booklet, and all who renew the dispute, and added that God would find a remedy for this evil in due time: therefore, it should not have been agitated. Then I said: But Calvin has already responded. This indeed tormented Brenz more, and he certainly almost wept with grief, which I solemnly affirm.</p>
      <p>For as he greatly desires concord, it seemed to him that it could be mended by silence, not by contentions.</p>
      <p>There is no counsel for the past, but I would greatly redeem that the booklet was not published there. From this duchy, no one will respond to you, which you may know for certain: but the Saxons are shouting and will stir up new wars. I wanted you to know this as well.</p>
      <p>[To the] most illustrious man, Lord [Heinrich] Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, honorable brother.</p>
