    <p xml:id="regest1">Does not know if Bullinger has received his letter from November 15 [No. 1198]; therefore writes again through a nephew of Martin Peyer, so that his benefactor cannot accuse him of negligence. Except for a few insignificant opponents of the Zurich church, everyone shows him much kindness, especially Capito, while Bucer, who has traveled to Wittenberg, is expected back; only the high cost of living troubles him. The fear of war is great, yet he trusts in God. Count [Georg] of Württemberg is said to have abolished images and mass in Mömpelgard; a rumor says that followers of Wilhelm Arsent were captured in Lorraine when they wanted to raid a village; the English king [Henry VIII] is said to have removed the shrine of Thomas [Becket] - whether this is true will be reported by Reyner [Wolfe], who is likely to come to Strasbourg this winter. Hardly believes that Camerarius will succeed in bringing Melanchthon to Tübingen; the University of Wittenberg is far superior, as confirmed by a recently returned Strasbourger, who especially praises Melanchthon's tirelessness. Is ready to send Sturm's book on the establishment of schools, which gives an impression of the school system of Strasbourg - exemplary even for Zurich - and announces further works by Sturm. Some take offense that a "Prognostik" by Matthias Brotbeihel with remarks about the reform intentions of the Emperor and the Pope was printed by Froschauer; excuses his open criticism by saying that it pains him when Zurich falls into disrepute - somewhat like Basel because of the printing of Erasmus' letters. Uses Bullinger's commentary with profit in his reading of the Epistle to the Romans and asks for guidance on the study of scripture. Encloses a letter to Johann [Wilhelm] Reiffenstein. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>On the fifteenth of November, I sent a letter to you, most kind teacher, in which I explained quite extensively, as I believe, the current state of my affairs, the method and order of my studies, and the magnitude of my expenses. However, I am uncertain whether these have reached your hands. For in this present age, since no one can find anything entirely intact and perfect, and since I see everything teeming with deceit and imposture, I cannot trust even those couriers who carry themselves with a certain gravity of demeanor, let alone sailors and coachmen, the most audacious of men, with whom I must deal if I wish to send my letters to you or to Basel. However, now that a very convenient opportunity has arisen with Martin Peyer's nephew coming to us from his brother and returning to Schaffhausen, I have willingly entrusted him with the task of delivering this letter of mine from my homeland to you. I have done this mainly so that, if perhaps other letters have been intercepted, you cannot accuse me of negligence. Since you have instructed me in the knowledge of true doctrine from my earliest days, as the saying goes, and have even made me a part of your family at great expense, I think it would be unjust if I did not inform you daily of my status. Your humanity, which I have long experienced, alleviates all the burden of writing, and relying on it, I do not think that the letters of your Rudolf are burdensome to you, whom you have embraced with such humanity for so long.</p>
      <p>As for the state of my affairs, about which I do not doubt you are concerned, everything is well; for the most excellent and greatest God still preserves me unharmed and protects me with His spirit, who is never absent from me with His grace. Almost everyone shows me acts of kindness, except for some who are not sincerely affectionate towards the Zurich church. But there is no need to speak much about them, as they are such that they can neither harm me with their spurs of envy nor benefit me with their favor. All others (as far as I can judge from external signs), on whose nod the arrangements of the school depend, are very kind to me, especially Doctor Capito, who always offers himself ready to assist me in every matter, and who sometimes, for the sake of friendship, makes me a part of his table. Bucer has long since departed for Wittenberg; they expect his return daily.</p>
      <p>I have companions who are both good and learned, from whose company I can be greatly benefited. I desire nothing more now than for the high cost of living to decrease, which everyone feels increasing daily. But God will also put an end to this.</p>
      <p>Everyone fears war and trembles at its mention; I also hear more who despair of all success than those who acknowledge God's powerful and merciful hand. I firmly hope with a steadfast heart that the same God still lives and reigns, who drowned Pharaoh in the whirlpools of the Red Sea, broke the impious forces of Saul, weakened the invincible hand of Sennacherib, and who so often assisted our ancestors with His grace and presence. This God, as I trust, will not allow those who hope in Him to succumb to the pride of their enemies.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us, except that they consistently affirm that Count [Georg] of Württemberg, having returned to Mömpelgard, has overthrown all idols and papal worship, which I believe is not unknown to you. Furthermore, there is a constant rumor with us that several seditious and impious men, who swore allegiance to Wilhelm Arsent, have been captured in Lorraine while they wanted to capture and plunder a small town subject to French domination. They also say that the King of England [Henry VIII] has removed the golden shrine of Thomas [Becket] and consigned the exhumed bones to the fire. Whether these things are true or not, I think we will soon find out; for I believe Reyner [Wolfe] will come to us this winter.</p>
      <p>Joachim Camerarius, a professor from Tübingen, has been sent to Wittenberg by the Duke of Württemberg to bring Philipp Melanchthon to Tübingen with a very generous stipend. But I entirely believe that he will lose his effort and oil; for it seems incredible that Philipp would exchange such a distinguished academy for a very inferior one, and that the Duke of Saxony and Luther himself would grant this to him with good grace. A certain man from Strasbourg came from Wittenberg these days, who will return at the next fair; he extols the order and studies of this school in a wonderful manner, praising the astonishing tolerance of Philipp in enduring labors, etc.</p>
      <p>I do not know whether Sturm's book "On the Proper Opening of Schools" has reached you; if I knew it had not been seen by you, I would send it to you now. From it, you can form a judgment of the Strasbourg school, which is said to be established with a certain divine order by all. Oh, how I wish the same zeal for promoting studies existed among the leaders of the city of Zurich! We would certainly soon see from this republic (which is otherwise endowed with the happiest talents) learned and pious groups of learned men emerge. But I hope they will bring their good beginnings to an end as they have decided, and I do not think you will be idle in this matter, who have almost alone been the promoter of studies and the patron of students. Sturm's "Dialectical Partitions" and "Commentaries on Cicero's Oratorical Partitions" are being printed with us, which, if completed, will be sent to you.</p>
      <p>Our Froschauer has printed the "Prognostica" or "Practica," as they call it, of Matthias Brotbeihel, in which some magnificent things are trumpeted about the diligence and zeal for reform of the imperial majesty and papal sanctity (if I may speak so), which it is amazing how much they offend the simpler ones and are criticized by the more learned, when they see these things printed in Zurich, although I certainly know that these were printed by Froschauer himself with a simple mind and perhaps never read by him. But you yourself know, most beloved teacher, with what caution and diligence you need to act, since so many Momi suspect you from all sides, who seize the opportunity to cavil at even the smallest things. I thought it best to write this to you, not because I wish to teach you diligence, who excel in acumen of learning and judgment, but to express to you my own pain, which I feel when I see you being spoken ill of by others. For I am not unaware of that saying of Plato, who says in the first book of the Laws: "One of the most beautiful laws would be not to seek or allow any of the young to inquire whether their affairs are well or not well." Just as it is the duty of a foreigner not to be meddlesome in another's republic, so it is also the duty of a young man not to curiously criticize the deeds of elders. But truly and candidly, I confess what I feel: I am a Zurich citizen, I am led by zeal and love for the city of Zurich, and for this reason, I hear with the greatest indignation the cavillations of foreigners about my homeland, especially those whom I know are entirely devoted to corroding us and our institutions with a Theonine tooth. Therefore, I would very much wish that not even the smallest occasion for calumny be given to them. However, I have also experienced in England how much these things, published in public prints, offend, where not a few are offended that Erasmus' letters were printed in Basel. But I will cease speaking of these things now. I ask you not to think that I have written these things with some private and arrogant affection, as if I were trying to criticize my elders; for I, having all the circumstances of this matter clearly in view and knowing that simplicity, not malice, is involved, am not offended by these things, but I am grieved that an opportunity for calumny has been given to otherwise querulous men, etc.</p>
      <p>In these days, I have begun to read Paul's Epistle to the Romans, for the understanding of which your annotations bring me much light, which I always use. I beseech you, most esteemed patron, to deign to write to me some method of reading the sacred texts and to explain to me in very few words which books of the New Testament I should read first and in what order, and also what I should especially observe. For I see many who, while observing these things carelessly, err and stumble gravely, so that, reading much, they understand and retain little, and, flying through the whole Bible, they are so overwhelmed by the confusion of reading that, as if placed in a vast sea with no land in sight, they despair.</p>
      <p>Deliver this letter of mine to Johann Wilhelm Reiffenstein, a boy of very keen intellect, and keep him commended to you.</p>
      <p>Greet my mother and your wife, the foremost of matrons, and your entire family in my name as warmly as possible, from whom I would like to hear something about their well-being; for it seems a year has passed since I received any letters from you. Also greet all the presidents of our college, as well as Georg Binder, Sebastian, and Wolphius, to whom I would have written now along with Christian, if the shortage of time had not hindered my efforts. Farewell, most kind patron and teacher, and may God keep you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, from the house of Mr. Bedrot, November 26, 1538. Rudolf Gwalther, your most observant.</p>
      <p>Forgive, I pray, the blots; for there was scarcely time to reread, let alone rewrite.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Zurich church, his uniquely esteemed teacher and patron. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
