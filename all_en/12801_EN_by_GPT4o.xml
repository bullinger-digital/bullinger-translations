    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Unfortunately, Bullinger cannot respond in detail to Haller's three letters from December 10, 23, and 27 [HBBW XVIII, No. 2712; No. 2723; No. 2726]. He must limit himself to the most important points.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In light of the capitulation of so many cities [to Emperor Charles V], Haller has asked what should be done. Bullinger advises him to endure in Augsburg as long as possible; he himself would still be able to stay there at present. However, if it were no longer possible to practice his faith and live there, he would inform the best council members of his departure and try to obtain a good testimonial from them. Meanwhile, he has spoken with Haller's relatives. They will ensure that the Zurich council especially recommends Haller to the Augsburg authorities with a letter. Georg Frölich will also only leave Augsburg if he realizes that all is lost. Bullinger firmly hopes in God. Haller [and the other Zurichers in Augsburg] should do the same!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The submission of Ulm and other cities to the Emperor will have dire consequences.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Yesterday, Wilhelm Frölich wrote from Solothurn about the plan of the French King Francis I to invade Italy. He already has 18,000 French soldiers, is recruiting 6,000 Italians, and desires another 14,000 Swiss. However, if he hears how "bravely" the Germans have surrendered to the Emperor without a fight, he will probably abandon his plan! Either way, it is not this "Egyptian king" but Christ alone who is to be trusted.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings. Haller, remain steadfast!</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I received three letters from you, Haller, the first dated December 10, the second December 23, and the third December 27. I was not able to respond to them in order. I will address the most important matters:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You seek advice on what to do in these troubled times with many cities capitulating. I would remain in Augsburg as long as possible; and I could certainly stay there. If I could no longer remain there due to religion and life, I would leave with the knowledge (Wissen) of the best members of the council, so that, if possible, I would at least take with me a good testimonial from the good people. Meanwhile, I have advised your relatives. They will obtain letters from our council to recommend you to the Augsburg council, so they do not neglect you. Frölich will not leave unless he sees everything as hopeless. I trust in God more. Be honest and trust in God, etc. Whoever trusts in men will fall.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We have heard here that Ulm and many cities along with Württemberg have submitted to the Emperor's grace, etc. From this will come later a disgrace from God and men!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Yesterday, Frölich wrote from Solothurn that the King of France will request 14,000 Swiss. He has prepared 18,000 Frenchmen. He is taking on 6,000 Italians. He will invade Italy, etc. It is to be feared that when he understands the clever courage of the Germans, who submit without battle, he will also give up, although I do not trust the Egyptian king at all. I trust in the Lord.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In this, farewell forever. Be steadfast and strong in the Lord.</p>
