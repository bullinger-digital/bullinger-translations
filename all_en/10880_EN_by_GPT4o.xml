    <p xml:id="regest1">Shares the grave concern evidenced by Myconius' letter [No. 835], as hardly anyone recognizes the great danger threatening all of Europe; particularly the Bernese, by supporting the criminal King of France [Francis I], are provoking God's judgment. In the Five Places, the government's prohibition against joining the king has angered his supporters; the people of Uri and Toggenburg are divided, and the stance of the people of Glarus and Schaffhausen has also hardened. The people of Zurich are watching over their territory and have expelled Ägidius Tschudi and his followers, as well as prevented the passage of mercenaries from Schwyz and Toggenburg, yet Bern allows the treacherous adventurers to proceed. Whether the Eisenach theologians' convention will lead to an agreement on the doctrine of the sacraments seems doubtful, but deviating from the simple truth is out of the question. Bullinger has also criticized the Württemberg church order, as mentioned by Myconius, in a letter to [Ambrosius] Blarer and cites his response. He has previously explained the position of the Zurich theologians on the Confessio Tetrapolitana [No. 813f]. He also finds some aspects of the agreement reached with the Solothurn ["bandits"] displeasing. The booklet [from Zurich] mentioned by Myconius, which some Anabaptists refer to, is not his work; perhaps the writing by [Konrad] Grebel is meant, to which Zwingli responded in the "Elenchus." Urges trust in God. Sends greetings to Grynaeus. Requests to show this letter to [Ulrich] Schuler. Only integrity can help now.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letter, Myconius, beloved and venerable brother in the Lord, shows that your mind is quite entangled and anxious. And no wonder, given such great turmoil. But be of good cheer, my brother; He lives who will deliver us, even if the heavens fall. I freely admit this: there have not been more dangerous times in a thousand years. Nothing in my life has tormented or wounded my spirit more severely, especially as I see the utter negligence of all and the ripe harvest ready for the sickle. An astonishing change threatens all of Europe, and I hope it is not a most cruel destruction. Yet here, no one lifts their head. Meanwhile, we are proud, we argue, we are swollen with gluttony, entangled in business, and scarcely one in a hundred prays to the Lord or recognizes that the day of visitation is at the door. Therefore, may God rule rightly and shorten for us the miserable days of our wretched life. Enough indulgence has been given to us so far. We have provoked God's long-suffering long enough, despised His patience, and with necks outstretched, we have roamed the field of all crimes, and with a reckless course, we have foamed out wickedness. Now the avenger is at hand, and we offer him the occasion to attack us. I speak of the Bernese and also of the other supporters of the French. The French king is openly impious, an adulterer, a perjurer, and no king lives today more criminal. His hands are still stained with Christian blood. He has polluted his entire kingdom with adulteries and debaucheries, and no virgin or matron has ever been safe from his violence and arts. He has corrupted all the dynasties and republics of Europe with his gold. He has shed more native and Swiss blood than any king. He is the one who has disturbed all of Europe for more than 23 years, allied himself with the Turk by treaty, and now, indeed, against right and justice and the given oath, invades the borders of Lombardy. Yet today, some cultivate him as a friend and ally, support his cause, and favor his armies. Meanwhile, we know how much danger the pious king Jehoshaphat fell into because he supported the cause of Ahab. The alliance of the kings of Egypt and Assyria never turned out well for Israel. I wish we may not be forced someday to witness the miserable fate of our homeland and to pronounce happy (as they are indeed most happy) those who bravely fell for hearth and home at Kappel.</p>
      <p>The Five Places are now almost tearing each other apart with mutual wounds. The magistrate openly declares that no one should follow the French military. Meanwhile, the common people and the Catiline gang protest. They say that Caesar has put a bridle on the tongues of those more powerful. These, on the other hand, deny it, and they have a market at Pentecost in Lucerne where they have cut down one another over five mills. The people of Uri and Toggenburg are cruelly at odds with each other and with mutual hatreds. The situation is miserable. The people of Glarus and Schaffhausen have completely hardened their hearts. Ägidius Tschudi came to Zurich with his leaders, but he and his followers were immediately forced by oath to leave the borders of Zurich. Here you would have seen and heard amazing things. And it was almost to the point that the citizens would have finished them off to a man. Our people have so far steadfastly taken care not to get involved in this evil. Meanwhile, a few scoundrels break out, but they are few. It is such a miserable lament, as I have seen in my lifetime. Great expenses are incurred for watches and guards both in the city and in the countryside. There were soldiers from Schwyz and Toggenburg and I don't know from which other places who wanted to cross our lake by boat to Baden, but that night 130 armed citizens kept watch to catch them when they came. For the night before, some had secretly crept through the borders of Zurich. And all these scoundrels and perjurers find and have a safe harbor with the Bernese. But let this be the limit and end of complaining. I have never been more confused in my life.</p>
      <p>As for the convention in Eisenach, I do not know what to promise. If the opposing party continues to attribute too much to the sacraments, we will not deviate from the rule of truth. The speech of truth is simple.</p>
      <p>What you desire in the Württemberg reformation, I also desire, and I have testified this in letters to Blaurer. He responded in these words: "What you desire in the rites of the Württemberg churches and what you wish to be changed, I have received with a grateful mind. But if you consider more carefully the position I am in, you will easily understand by what counsel and by whose authority everything has been done. I seemed to have achieved a great deal when, by my admonition, some things far more superstitious were cut away, which some even outside of Schnepf had attached. We hope by the Lord's benefit to give more solid things someday to the princes." This is Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Regarding the agreement on the confession of the four cities, we have recently deposited a written account with you when the convention was held in Aarau. We have not yet agreed on anything (thank God) that is not fair.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to say about the reconciliation of the Solothurners. There are many things that displease me in every respect.</p>
      <p>The news you write about the Anabaptists is new. I have never written a letter that could support them. I have written many things against them. However, Grebel wrote a little work together with the dregs of his followers, to which Zwingli responded in the "Elenchus." Perhaps they are recalling him from the dead. If you lack the book I wrote against the Anabaptists, I will send it. Be strong and fight the Lord's battles manfully.</p>
      <p>I believe I have written quite extensively. Pray to God for the churches entrusted to us. All our protection is in God. He will deliver us. Let us trust Him; let us act confidently. If things go badly, it is only a matter of dying. Let us strive to die with glory and in the service of our God. May He be blessed forever.</p>
      <p>Greet our Grynaeus, that apostolic heart and dearest of mortals, and share with him the torments of my soul.</p>
      <p>Please, present this letter to the Scholastic. And speak the best to it.</p>
      <p>I did not have time to reread. Business and the brevity of time, and then the amazing turmoil of things, prevented me from being longer.</p>
      <p>I still find nothing but all honest people among ours. Praying to God for us. They are also honest and consider how they maintain their religion, wives and children, liberty, land, and people. May God have mercy on us. Nothing but being pious, brave, and honest will be our comfort.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, June 9, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, dearest brother.</p>
