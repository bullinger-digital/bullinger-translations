      <p>I am now overwhelmed with such great occupations, most holy man, that I cannot write to you about the things I most wish you to know; but within a few days, I will write to Martyr and then also more to you. I am sending you a booklet newly published by me, so that you may read and judge it. Westphal has written very virulently against Calvin; I have skimmed part of the booklet, but have not yet had the time to read it thoroughly; but some who have read it and favor Calvin think it necessary for Calvin to refute those slanders on some occasion, not indeed by responding with a particular booklet, but by incidentally tearing apart Westphal's slanders without naming him, especially where he tries to press Calvin with Calvin's own words. Your son Heinrich was with us when Philipp Melanchthon's son-in-law was with me. I therefore joined him to this one, and they have now set out together for Wittenberg with my recommendation to Philipp.</p>
      <p>There are also great disturbances among the Saxons themselves concerning doctrine, which may perhaps cause the Wittenbergers to be somewhat more favorable to us. Here, by divine favor, we have now also obtained the Flemish church, for the establishment of which our Micronius has come here to me from Friesland, but will return again to Friesland after the ministry of the church is established, in the same manner as we had established in England.</p>
      <p>And it is truly a great blessing from God that we have such a favorable magistrate here. I can no longer write more due to lack of time. I commend myself most diligently to your prayers and bid all the brothers there most dutifully farewell. Hastily, in Frankfurt, September 19, 1555.</p>
      <p>Micronius wanted to send many greetings to all of you there.</p>
      <p>Johannes a Lasco by my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the most holy and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
