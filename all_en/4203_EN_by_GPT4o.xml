      <p>Ludwig Quadrio to Heinrich Bullinger, Greetings.</p>
      <p>Although there is no familiarity or other reason between us that compels me to recommend my son Julius to you, nevertheless, because Christian piety, which we profess, is everywhere the most honorable and closest bond of relationship, I thought I could, as if by my right, make use of your help and support. It is also not foreign to a parent's duty for bishops to entrust their children to be cared for. He lives in Zürich with Johann Volvius, a man both learned and especially pious, and I do not recommend him to you because I fear that Volvius is not sufficiently recommended, since from the letters of the boy and many others who depart from there, I have heard that he is considered as a son, lacking nothing that pertains to sustenance and comfort. Nor do I demand your recommendation to make Volvius more commendable, which is not possible, but so that Volvius knows that the bishop also cares for my son and that he is not only doing me a favor if he takes care of him, but also his bishop. Therefore, you would do me a great favor, most learned and pious Bullinger, if you would recommend him to Volvius, and if you would encourage the boy himself, whenever it is convenient for you, towards piety and studies; for that age needs the examples and encouragements of elders. I desire that he returns so strengthened that, when he happens to go to Italy for studies, he conducts his life in such a way that his mind is not swayed by vices and impiety, which happens to those who contend with evil minds. However, I hope it will turn out well for you if he is also commended to you in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I offer you what I can, my service, effort, and dedication in whatever matters you may need; if you use me familiarly for everything, you would do me a great favor, and if I do not return equal gratitude, our Lord Jesus Christ will. Take care to be well.</p>
      <p>Tirano, the fifth day before the calends of February, in the year 60. To the most learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the city of Zürich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
