    <p xml:id="regest1">In his manifold distress, he missed Bullinger's support; now the magistrate has also imposed a new synodal and ban ordinance on the pastors, yet Bullinger's latest letter has given him hope again, and he would like to hear his judgment on the council's actions. He intends to write more later.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It greatly saddened me that you seemed to neglect me for so long amidst such great calamities; for until now I have been harassed by the university, the senate, the plague, and diseases. And we are still being harassed; for the magistrate is attempting to prescribe the manner of the synod and excommunication to us without our input, indeed, it has already been prescribed. Nothing more serious has ever happened, not indeed because of me, but because of the church, as the magistrate seems to be following the footsteps of papism. Good God, how miserable we are as disciples of the great teacher! However, after I received your latest letters, I have been restored to myself and I hope for you as I have until now. Make sure you continue in this way until the end. I ask you, however, to write through this messenger what you think, whether the senate is allowed to do what it has assumed.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in the Lord always. I found a messenger later than expected, therefore I am unable to write more. I will write more fully in the future.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, December 22, 1539. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
