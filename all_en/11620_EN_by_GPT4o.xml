Rejoices over the retreat of the Turkish army to Greece, even though the danger remains; returns the report from [Peter] Buffler. The plague is still limited in Zurich; the people are successfully exhorted to piety; the pastors and their families are still well. Greetings. Request for news about the consequences of the Regensburg Imperial Diet.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The messenger hurried, and I lacked the time and leisure to write; therefore, I wanted to indicate only this, lest I write nothing, that your judgment about the Dean of Passau pleases me, and I am displeased with what he proposes, entangled in new monstrous words rather rashly. But the church must be exercised in this way, so that those who are approved may be revealed.</p>
      <p>I rejoice that the Turkish army has been withdrawn to Greece, although I do not doubt that this interval has been given to us for repentance, which, when we do not perform it worthily, divine judgments will soon be present and executed upon us. For those things you sent, I give thanks and return the hand of Buffler, a very good man.</p>
      <p>The plague has not yet subsided; but the rumor is greater than the plague, although it is dangerous enough; however, for the size of the city and the number of inhabitants, it has been tolerable so far. We encourage the people to solid hope in the Lord, and those who pass away, it is amazing with how much piety they pass away; they inspire the weak and fearful with their religion and firm hope, so that many now fear less. Otherwise, we are all well, to whom the ministry of the church has been entrusted; and our families are well by the grace of the Lord. May He always be with us. Farewell with all yours, your beloved wife, dear children, with your brother and sister Margaretha, finally with the Zwickis, my most esteemed brothers. If you have anything about the matters of religion from the outcome of the Regensburg Imperial Diet, please let me know, I beg, or if there is anything else that you think is worth my knowing.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 1, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Ambrosius Blarer, most esteemed friend and brother. Konstanz.</p>
