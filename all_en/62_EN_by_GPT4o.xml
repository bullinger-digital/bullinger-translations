    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer thanks Bullinger sincerely for Bullinger's greetings, which his cousin Konrad Zwick conveyed to him when he returned to Constance the day before yesterday [on March 1, 1548].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">However, there is no news: There is still great tension regarding the decision that Emperor Charles V (or more accurately God through the Emperor) will make about [the reconciliation request] of the people of Constance. The people of Zurich should pray that the church of Constance remains preserved against all the forces of hell.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">The enclosed [letter addressed to Bullinger, not preserved] from Hans Schöner must have been written some time ago, as his letter to Blarer, [to which the letter was attached], was already written on January 1. Blarer pities the poor old man very much. However, his situation in Augsburg is unlikely to improve. His sister, Sabina Schöner, sends her kind regards to Bullinger. She has sent some medicines for Bullinger [to Blarer], which he will deliver as soon as he receives them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Just now, a rumor has arisen that the Thurgau governor [Leonhard Holzhalb] will announce mandates tomorrow, Sunday, [March 4, 1548], prohibiting trade from Thurgau with the city of Constance. The council of Constance approached Holzhalb in Frauenfeld to learn more and to ask him (if the rumor is true) to delay the announcement of the decrees until the people of Constance have discussed this with the council of Zurich or [at a diet] with all the Confederates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">The Bishop of Constance, Johann von Weeze, is involved in very serious machinations [against Constance] and is supposed to come to the city tomorrow, [March 4, 1548]. Where will this lead? May the people of Zurich pray for the steadfastness of the people of Constance! It is said to be a matter of life and death!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Greetings from the people of Constance. Blessings for Bullinger's family, the Zurich pastoral colleagues, and friends.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my dearest and best brother by far. The day before yesterday, my dear cousin Konrad Zwick returned, conveying many greetings from you, for which I am very grateful to you in return.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As for news to write to you, I have absolutely nothing: There is great anticipation among us about what the Emperor, or rather the Lord himself through the Emperor, will decide about us. Pray for us and our church, that it may be preserved in Him for the glory of His name against all the gates of hell.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am sending letters from our Schöner, but if I am not mistaken, they were written some time ago, since those he sent to me were written on the first of January. I pity the poor old man very much, and yet I see nothing that he can hope for conveniently from the people of Augsburg. His sister Sabina sends her most dutiful greetings to you. She has sent you some medicinal tablets, which I will ensure you receive as soon as I get them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Otherwise, nothing, except now there is a rumor that the governor of Thurgau will announce mandates tomorrow, Sunday, that nothing from Thurgau will be allowed into our city, etc., and more related to this. My lords have immediately sent to Frauenfeld to learn from the governor and to ask him, if this is the case, to hold off on this until my lords can send their delegation to Zurich or the common Confederates.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Our bishop is involved in strong, significant practices. He is supposed to come the next day. Oh God, what will come of this? Praying to God earnestly for us, that we remain faithful, upright, and honest in Him. Whether it leads to head or bowl, it concerns life or death!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Our people greet you. May your household be well with all brothers and friends. March 3, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
