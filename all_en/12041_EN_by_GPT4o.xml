    <p xml:id="regest1">In Blarer's absence, Bullinger's letter was entrusted to his nephew [Josua], son of [Johannes Reinhart], by the maid [...]; Blarer will have [Josua] sought out and will gladly render the service requested by Bullinger. The news about the Emperor [Charles V] conveyed in Blarer's letter [above No. 1988] is not correct; this is evident from a letter from an Augsburg resident [...] and the conversation with an Italian [...] who came from the Emperor's camp; in the letter from Augsburg, it is learned that the Emperor has left Châlons-en-Champagne and Troyes and has moved to Paris, and that Wilhelm von Fürstenberg has been captured and may possibly be exchanged for prisoners from [Francis I's] camp; the Emperor is said to have tried everything to provoke [Francis I] into battle. The [letters from Bullinger to Wolfgang Musculus and Adam Bartholomäus] have already been sent to Augsburg; Blarer does not have time to be more detailed; he will write to Gwalther soon. Bucer writes that Melanchthon told [Gregor] Brück that he would look for another place to live if [Luther] continues like this.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Your nephew, the son of your brother, delivered your letter to my maid while I was not at home, promising to return, which he has not yet done. I will make sure to find out where he is and will assist him in any way I can, as nothing is more important to me than to please you in all things.</p>
      <p>I believe you have received the letters I sent three days ago, in which I wrote about the rumors concerning the Emperor. Know that these are false; a friend from Augsburg now writes to me: "We have news that the Emperor has left Châlons-en-Champagne and Troyes and has moved towards Paris, and that in a skirmish, Count Wilhelm von Fürstenberg was captured, but in return, some good men from the King's side were also captured; it is expected that they will be exchanged." The same was told to me three days ago at dinner by an Italian who claimed to have come directly from the Emperor's camp, adding that the Emperor is provoking the King to battle and combat.</p>
      <p>May the Lord, the author of peace, soon put an end to these bloody endeavors! The letters you sent have already been delivered to Augsburg. I have no time to write more now. Please commend us to the Lord and greet our friends, especially your household. Tell Gwalther that I will write to him in the next few days; I would be lost if I could do anything now. September 20, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer. Bucer wrote to me yesterday, among other things: "Philipp is in danger and told Pontano that if things continue like this, he will look for another place to stay."</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a friend cherished like a brother.</p>
