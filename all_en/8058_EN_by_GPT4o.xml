      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most esteemed lord, written on the 30th of September; however, you report quite different, indeed almost contrary things from France compared to what is being reported here, as you will understand from the attached note and some other matters. The Transylvanian (Septemcastrensis) is to be praised, who himself undertakes the knowledge of religion and does not postpone the matter day by day. There must be conflicts in religion, as there always have been; woe to those who rashly stir them up. Meanwhile, you know that the Lord has always been misused for the advancement of their own. The Bavarian (Bavarus) sent envoys four weeks ago to console the sons of the Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken (Bipontini) on account of their parent's death; they were indeed rejected with contempt, as they claimed to know nothing of their parent's death. The Moors (Mauri) are pressing the Spaniard (Hispanum) more and more every day; the Turk (Turca) sends them aid. Although everything is easily calm with us, they are so arranged that with even the slightest disturbance, we will see everything move up and down. There is a great scarcity of grain in Spain, Italy, many places in Germany, and even in Constantinople, as they say. I wanted to inform you of these things briefly; with the messenger hastening, who often presents himself rashly and unexpectedly, I too had to hurry. Farewell. Given in Augsburg on the 26th of October in the year 69.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten. To the reverend, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
