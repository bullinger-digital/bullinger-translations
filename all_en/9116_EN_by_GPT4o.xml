      <p>Greetings. Even after I had sealed this letter of mine, behold, Mr. Haller sends me a rather long letter from Mr. Campell about your case with Gantner, asking for my advice. But what else could I advise than that you should again approach the most honorable council and demonstrate that Gantner's actions do not align with the agreements, and indeed demand that nothing contrary to the decrees established long ago be enacted, unless he prefers to overthrow Anabaptism and the church and the republic.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Campell. I am entirely yours. Therefore, if I can be of any help to you, I am at your service. Hastily.</p>
