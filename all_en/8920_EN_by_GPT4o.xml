      <p>Greetings. Since you have not written to us until today nor for the past eight days, we entirely believed you would come to us; but now, seeing that our hope was in vain, we think there must be an unusual reason that has kept you. Whatever the case, as long as you are well and all your affairs are in order, we gladly expect you to come at another time. Now, I have nothing worth mentioning to write except this: it is written from France that the Synod of Nîmes has ended not unsuccessfully, although I cannot confirm anything for certain here, as no letters from Beza have yet arrived. He has not yet returned home from the synod; however, there is someone who claims to have been present and testifies that all the brothers parted with good grace; about which, when I have more certain information, I will write more certainly.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is written that the Protestant cities in France have freely returned the cities to the king, which they had received for the assurance of peace; for they no longer wish to hold them, as if they mistrust the king. The king is said to have received this with high thanks and great grace and said: one must experience all loyalty and grace; he also summoned the prominent rulers and swore them to maintain peace and protect the Protestants and grant them good rights. It is also said that one should no longer say: the reformed religion, but: the evangelical religion, and it should stand well in France. May God grant that it remains so. - Some cardinals, in suspicious haste, wanted a pope, the Cardinal of Bologna, Bon Compagni (Good Luck, now it will be sung: 'Farewell, good luck, from here, my stay is no longer here'). Against this, the Cardinal of Florence and all the French cardinals protested, because they rushed too much and did not expect their arrival, which was dangerous, etc. You will know more about this from Italy.</p>
      <p>In the Netherlands, there is a great arming by the Duke of Alba to bring the rebellious cities in Zeeland, Holland, and elsewhere to obedience (that is, Spanish tyranny). May God deliver the captives and oppressed! The hail has struck near Strasbourg, also near Zug miserably; the lightning struck the cathedral in Strasbourg and a church in Colmar, near Strasbourg a papal church, tower and everything inside, burned to the ground.</p>
      <p>At the time our tower burned here, a significant storm passed over Prague in Bohemia, which made everyone expect the end. In Fribourg in Üechtland, it is said that the lightning also struck terribly on the same evening, etc. These are omens, I fear, of future misery. May God protect us, for otherwise, things are turning too much towards disaster; may God be gracious to us! etc. I wanted to write these brief things to you, so I would not write nothing and you would accuse me of ungrateful silence. Live well, farewell. May the Lord keep you, your wife, and children! Yesterday, Mr. Johannes Jacob Haller, the son of our Haller, celebrated his wedding with the daughter of Mr. Johannes Wolph. May the Lord bless them!</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 6, 1572.</p>
      <p>Greet in order all those you know, including Mr. Johannes Müller, etc. In haste.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I ask you to take care of the attached letters addressed to Mr. Perisotto along with my book against the Anabaptists; for since he is poor, he asked me by letter to send it as a gift, which I now do.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished minister of Christ, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
