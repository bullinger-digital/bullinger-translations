      <p>Through Christ Jesus, greetings. I thank you for the holy and benevolent gift; for I can in no way promise to repay you. I have returned your gift to Hospinianus, our colleague and mutual friend, and shared the letters. However, the fact that you love me above others, I consider both most dear and honorable. As for allowing us to review your sermons, I must say, most excellent and learned Bullinger, that I do not possess the gifts that would allow me to dare to pass judgment on matters of this kind, especially those that originate from you and your peers. I praise and approve them to the extent of my limited knowledge of divine matters, wishing that there were many in our Italy and elsewhere who would write such solid and thoroughly complete works. I omit the fact that it is dangerous and full of envy at this time to mutter anything about those things which are published in the cause of religion, not only of others but also of our own more sincere one. For what you have said or written with great simplicity and candor of spirit will be received so unfavorably that even by those who have asked for your judgment, you will be criticized in writing, and it does not matter how openly, as long as it satisfies the disdain and anger of some. Farewell through the Lord Jesus Christ, most excellent and beloved brother, and continue to love and honor me as you do. Basel, 13th day before the calends of April, 1550.</p>
      <p>Celio Secondo Curione, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the wisest pastor of the Church of Zürich, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed friend and brother through Christ. In Zürich.</p>
