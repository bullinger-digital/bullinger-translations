      <p>Recently, sad news was described to me by friends from England, which, although I do not doubt that they have also spread among you and have been distorted and exaggerated by more horrible emotions, I will certainly communicate to your lordship with a true but succinct account of the sad events. The nobles of the Kingdom of England, with great sorrow and distress of mind, seeing that the fortifications which the late King Henry VIII of pious memory had constructed at great expense for the fortification and preservation of Boulogne, have now been captured by the King of France with little struggle, and that this loss and destruction of the fortifications occurred due to the negligence and filth of the Lord Protector, on October 8th in London, ordered heralds to proclaim to the people, summoned by trumpeters, that no one should henceforth show any obedience or loyalty to any letters or mandates published by the Duke of Somerset, the recently mentioned Protector, even if such mandates appear to be confirmed by the royal hand and seal; for his administration, being most negligent, has brought the greatest disgrace and irreparable damage to the kingdom, as he, having disregarded the mature and diligent warnings of the nobles and royal counselors, and also those of the commanders who were entrusted with regions beyond the sea, neglected to fortify and equip those fortifications, which he ought to have done with care and diligence as his duty required.</p>
      <p>And so, due to his negligence and omission, they were captured by the French, to the perpetual disgrace and detriment of the kingdom. Moreover, he squandered the royal money, which should have been spent on the defense and fortification of the kingdom, on the construction of the most extravagant buildings during these times of war, and defrauded the royal soldiers, who were eager to fight both against the Scots and the French, both within and outside the kingdom, at their own peril and blood, to defend the royal majesty and preserve and expand the honor of the kingdom, of their due pay for many months. Thus, they are compelled, as the nobles of the kingdom and those appointed as guardians by the father for the son, by their duty and given faith, to take over the administration of the kingdom with due diligence and care, with the Protector removed from the administration of the kingdom, lest they be called to account for their guardianship in the future and be forced to bear a heavier burden of explanation than they could provide, and thus they declare to all the subjects of the most serene king that no one should intervene or be disturbed; for this change is made for no other reason than the pursuit of the public good. After this proclamation was made known to the people, tranquility followed throughout the kingdom.</p>
      <p>At that time, while these things were happening in London, the Protector, who had the king with him in Windsor Castle, was first deserted by all the nobility, and then, after the king was brought to London by the nobles of the kingdom, the Protector himself was finally taken to the Tower of London on October 16th to be kept there, along with three other associates and censors of all his actions.</p>
      <p>This is the true and succinct occasion of the English change, and I know from the letters of friends, then from the edicts published under the king's secret and confirmed by the subscription of all the nobles of the kingdom and royal counselors, that this change was instituted with no ambition or disdain or hatred of religion, but with just sorrow and indignation at the loss of the fortifications and bulwarks, which had been built at great expense by King Henry of pious memory for the preservation of Boulogne, and thus the necessity and utility of the kingdom compelled them to establish a more accurate order for the administration of affairs, which private and public faith and the burden of entrusted guardianship obliges them to hold. With this true explanation of the change, you can console yourself and your friends; for I know that the most vain and false things are spread everywhere about this change, as each one's desire dictates.</p>
      <p>Since the royal majesty has noticed that due to the Duke of Somerset, who was recently taken into custody, whose deeds and deposition and imprisonment he deserved, unless we wish to allow the kingdom, gravely weakened by his fault, to fall into extreme dangers, some malevolent men, more devoted to the said duke than dutiful towards the royal majesty and the love of the fatherland, have dared to spread among the people that the pious laws enacted for the expiation and reformation of religion are now to be repealed and abolished, and papist rites, ceremonies, and the mass are to be reinstated... he deemed it appropriate to make it known and well-known to all his subjects that neither his majesty nor any of his counselors have in any way entertained any such alteration in mind, but wishes to preserve and protect the pious laws now enacted and confirmed for religion and henceforth, whatever can advance the glory of God and the progress of His word, to diligently pursue the opportunity. Therefore, with the consent of the entire council, his majesty commands all magistrates of whatever dignity and order to apprehend and hold in custody the sowers and spreaders of such rumors, until they have been informed of the judgment of the most serene king, who will decree the penalty according to the nature of the crime against such seducers and agitators of the people. Proclaimed in London on October 30th in the third year of Edward VI, King of England, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith and Supreme Head of the Church of England and Ireland on Earth, subscribed by the nobles of the kingdom and others of the privy council, whose names follow: Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury, etc.</p>
