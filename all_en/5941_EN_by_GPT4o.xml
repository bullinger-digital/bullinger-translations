      <p>From France, my dear lord and friend Coignet writes from Paris on October 13th, he has written to me for some time; but I have received nothing. Now, things are going peacefully in France and in many places well with the gospel, and there is great hope. Praise be to God.</p>
      <p>Benedict Stocker [Stokar, Stockar] writes from Lyon that he has seen 6000 people in a sermon; when 100 go to mass, 1000 go to the sermon; they are quiet and calm. The king will keep 2000 Swiss mercenaries for his protection; he will let all the others go home. They are being mustered and paid.</p>
      <p>November. The priests must sell their goods so that there is money to pay the Swiss mercenaries, and they are present to be paid.</p>
      <p>Nothing further otherwise.</p>
      <p>I am very surprised that less than nothing is being reported about the council, about which it is said that they are thinking of returning home soon with a conclusion promulgated and committing the execution to I don't know whom. I wonder if the French delegation, along with the learned men of France, have returned to France after leaving Trent.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, excellent brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 12, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my most esteemed and dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
