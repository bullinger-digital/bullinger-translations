      <p>To the illustrious and noble lord, Lord Ludwig von Sayn, Count of Wittgenstein, Lord of Homburg, my lord, to be honored with the utmost respect.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus, our only savior and the savior of the whole world, bless you and all yours and keep you from all evil. Illustrious man, noble count and lord, always to be honored with the utmost respect by me. I received the letters of your excellency written on the Ides of August in the past year promptly, but in the meantime, I had no opportunity to respond to them. And now I doubt whether I have responded as you might have expected. For my response, which I have attached here, is very brief. I therefore ask that you consider this small duty of mine favorably. I am glad that my little work on the persecutions of the Church of Christ, published last year, was not displeasing to you.</p>
      <p>I hope that these booklets, which I now send to you, will not be disapproved by you. The first contains a brief commentary comprised of two homilies on Psalm 130 and 133.</p>
      <p>The latter is apologetic, and indeed I would prefer in this my rather serious and troublesome old age, now living my 70th year and being very busy with so many other matters, to abstain from polemics. But the wickedness of certain slanderers and calumniators, who are not ashamed to pour out such insults and reproaches upon us, does not allow me to do so, for if we were to remain silent, as we have done for a long time, we might seem to betray both the truth and the churches entrusted to our faith. For most malicious and slanderous books have been published against us, against our doctrine, and against our churches, not from one place nor communicated by one or two, but by many. Therefore, we have divided the burden of responding among ourselves, my son-in-law Dr. Josias Simler, professor of theology in our school, and I, so that he would respond in Latin to each adverse argument and somewhat more extensively, summarizing the main points of these controversies for the understanding of the common people. Pious men will judge how well we have persisted in this; we have responded to matters, not to persons, abstaining from insults.</p>
      <p>I send you a copy of both works, both mine and my son-in-law's, in Latin and German, and I ask that you kindly accept them from me and read them when you have the opportunity. - I am as well as old men and those exhausted by labors usually are, with the Lord strengthening me so far that I can fulfill my very laborious ministry. May the Lord continue to bless me and, when it pleases Him, free me from this prison and transfer me to His glory.</p>
      <p>I hear that you have been summoned by the most illustrious Elector Palatine and made the prefect or master of the great court. If this is so, I sincerely pray to the Lord to bless you, and that this may be fortunate and happy for you, your prince, and all subjects. I will pour something into your bosom and pray to the Lord that whatever it is, you consider it written for you alone.</p>
      <p>I believe this pertains to preserving our friendship intact and to prevent anything from being instilled in your mind that would alienate you from me, who loves you dearly, and mine. For I fear that the mind of the illustrious prince has been somewhat alienated from us by the whispers of certain people.</p>
      <p>This is the situation.</p>
      <p>An Englishman came to Heidelberg from among those who continually stir up new things in their homeland. He was given a public place for disputation.</p>
      <p>He disputed, among other things, about excommunication, to which he also subjected the prince himself. On this occasion, a dispute began among the learned, and the disputation flared up into contention. The most learned and pious man, Dr. Thomas Erastus, came to Heidelberg, and I doubt whether Germany now has a more learned and skilled man. He was very dear to the prince at the beginning and was a major part of the reformation. Nor... would they have succeeded him, I mean, whom they succeeded, who later became his adversaries. He wrote propositions on that matter.</p>
      <p>His adversaries did not want to confer with him, but our Beza refuted them. Again, Erastus responded to him most learnedly. We saw here where this matter would erupt, and because both were very dear to us, we implored both not to publish their writings and worked to the best of our ability to prevent this controversy from erupting into a public conflagration. But we also thought it our duty to implore the help of the illustrious prince here. We wrote to the prince, and so that you may see what we wrote about the matter and what we retained from the illustrious prince, here is a copy, as they call it, of those letters which we send to you. I solemnly testify to you that we have never communicated them to any mortal. Hence, I ask that, having read them, if it seems right, you destroy them so that they do not fall into the hands of anyone else.</p>
      <p>For I know that letters written privately to princes are to be suppressed and not published. However, with these letters, we offended some of the ministers and counselors, so that those who were previously very friendly to us have now become alienated from us. And although I know well that your noble mind is not easily swayed to this or that side and does not now hate those whom you previously loved, I wanted to explain this matter to you as it truly is and pour it into your bosom, and that for the purpose that you may not easily lend an ear to those who unjustly hate both Dr. Erastus and us. If there is any other man who is faithful, prudent, experienced in affairs, and renowned for learning, it is Erastus. If you confer with the man amicably, you will find that I am not fabricating anything here for the sake of favor or hatred of anyone. As for what kind of people we are, you have long experienced, and I think all good people know. I therefore ask your kindness to have Dr. Erastus recommended to you and to love us as you have been accustomed to. You will find us faithful to you and most observant of you, venerating the most illustrious prince himself as holy and having no equal today in piety and justice, and we wish to serve him in all things. We pray to the Lord to keep him safe for a long time for His church.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 12, 1574.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your excellency,</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
