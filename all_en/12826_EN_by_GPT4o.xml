    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Altieri does not know whether Bullinger and Gessner have received his letter written a few days ago and sent via Basel. In it, he urged the [Protestant regions of the Swiss Confederation] to view the conflict between the German [Protestants] and Emperor Charles V as their own and to provide support. For in the event of Germany's defeat, the Emperor would also subjugate the Swiss and never tolerate the Gospel in Helvetia! It might even be that the Swiss face even greater dangers than the Germans. The Emperor hates the Swiss, whom he claims as a hereditary part of Austria, even more than the Germans obligated to the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] But even if the Swiss were spared from this war, it would not be justifiable to indifferently watch the oppression of the innocent. Moreover, it is essential to maintain the bond formed in Jesus Christ between them and the Germans, even if it costs them their lives! Undoubtedly, the Swiss will be ready for this, especially since there are reports in Venice of troop gatherings in the Swiss Confederation intended for Germany. If this is true, it would be commendable. Otherwise, the Swiss should intervene and not wait for the remaining [German Protestants] to have to surrender.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It is the task of the [Protestant regions of the Swiss Confederation] to defend the interests of the Germans, or rather the interests of Christ and the entire Church. A victory [of the Protestants] would be a great beacon of hope for the Italians who long for liberation from [papal] captivity. Moreover, such a victory would also benefit those Italians who have not recognized the Gospel but hate the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger and Gessner should share any news. And if Altieri can assist them in any way, they can count on him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Most excellent men. I wrote a few days ago to both of you in one letter, which I do not yet know if it has been delivered; I had sent it to Basel to be carried there and it contained, among other things, that you should take up this cause, which the Germans have against the Emperor, as if it were your own and support it in whatever way you can. For if the Emperor oppresses the Germans, he will also put you under the yoke and, having expelled Christ from Germany, will he allow Him to dwell among the Swiss? Therefore, consider the causes of this war as leading to the same dangers awaiting you, which now threaten the Germans, and perhaps even graver ones, unless precautions are taken. For the Emperor does not hate the Swiss (whom he claims as a patrimony of Austria, as you know) any less than the Germans, whom he retains and treats as co-partners of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>

      <p>But even if nothing from this war should bring you harm, would it not be a grave error if, when you can repel an injury from someone, you do not do so, nor care if the innocent are oppressed? But these things are nothing if compared to that most holy right and bond of eternal kinship, by which you are united with the Germans in Christ Jesus! And to maintain and preserve this, neither resources nor life should be spared. I do not fear that you will do this; for it is commonly said among us that many troops are being gathered in the Swiss Confederation to be sent to Germany. If this is so, we extol your charity with the highest praises; if not, we earnestly ask you and urge you in the Lord to provide assistance and not wait for the others, who are now safe, to be solicited and compelled to surrender. Which I strongly suspect will happen unless their afflicted situation is immediately relieved.</p>

      <p>But to you, who have great influence and authority there, this care falls, and to those whose hearts God has inflamed with His spirit, to watch over the salvation of others day and night! For it is not necessary to urge the pious, who are placed in this position, to benefit whom they can and harm no one. But if this cause of the Germans, indeed of Christ and the whole Church, as I hope, will be taken up by you to be defended, it will be of the greatest consolation to us Italians, who anticipate future freedom through your and their efforts, if things turn out well, from this spiritual captivity by which we are oppressed, and then to others who do not recognize Christ but pursue the Emperor with the greatest hatred, you will do a very pleasing thing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>But if there is anything, please, let me know. Moreover, if I can offer you my service in any matter, you can use and enjoy it as familiarly as if it were your own.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, farewell in the Lord and love me mutually, and greet the rest of the church not so much in my name as in the name of all the faithful. Given in Venice, on the fourth day before the calends of February 1547. Your excellencies' most devoted Balthasar Altieri.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned men, Lord Heinrich Bullinger and Lord Conrad Gessner, physician, honorable lords and brothers. Zurich.</p>
