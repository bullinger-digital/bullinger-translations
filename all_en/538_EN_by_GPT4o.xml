      <p>God's grace be with you, dear friend and godfather. I have nothing special to write to you about this time except for the matter for which this messenger is sent; it concerns my vocation. May God arrange it for His honor and the church's well-being. However, what particularly troubles me this time is that my lords here are sending this messenger and writing, yet they have not spoken a word to me, nor have they sought to understand my will. I have indeed informed the mayor Nägeli about my year and calling; he brought it before the council today, where I thought they would send for me, understand my will, and also my grievances. But not a word; if the messenger had not informed me, I would have known nothing about it. Therefore, it is no wonder if there is some displeasure, seeing how things are handled so carelessly; for I notice that it is happening because they hope to obtain me from the lords of Zürich, and if I am then bound by their consent, they would not have to help me with any of my grievances. For they have not even once sought to understand my will; nor has anyone said to me:</p>
      <p>"Do you need anything, do you lack anything, is something concerning you?" but rather they expect work and labor day and night, without asking if I have anything to eat or drink.</p>
      <p>I was willing, had they sent for me, to inform them in a friendly manner that I was inclined to serve where God wills; yet I would also have revealed my grievances to them, hoping that through this means and occasion, some might have been helped. However, since they have thus run ahead of me, I sense that they are not inclined to consider my grievances; therefore, the matter becomes more burdensome for me the longer it lasts. Nevertheless, I have written to my lords in Zürich in such a manner that I hope it will not displease anyone. Whatever they answer me, I shall and will adhere to. I hope my grievances are not hidden from them; therefore, they will not lead and entangle me in a blind matter. May God direct it according to His will and pleasure.</p>
      <p>I hear Calvin is in Zürich; let me know what he is doing. Matthias Erb is here again these days, praise be! He went to Valais, where his prince, Count Jörg, summoned him; he sends him back to the country to Richenwyl. He sends you many greetings. I cannot write more this time; thus, the unforeseen matter has overtaken me. My dear godfather, let me and my children be commended to you. God be with you. All my household and Musculus greet you, who is exceedingly unwell.</p>
      <p>Dated the last of May, Bern, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zürich, his lord to be honored as a father. M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
