      <p>Dear beloved brother, know that Christ has once again placed his cause entirely behind in Solothurn, a more miserable state than ever before. I understand that the matter has been arranged in such a way that the citizens, due to sedition, have taken the punishment into their own hands and have once again submitted to obedience, yet concerning faith, nothing has been defended here, but a truce has been made for 14 days. If they are then urged, they may appear the next day in Baden. Meanwhile, Schultheiss Hug, in the name of the six places and Valais, has advocated for the evangelicals, saying they are willing to risk life and property and help protect those from Solothurn from the sea (vote).</p>
      <p>Now you understand what is meant by the sea. Here they say that our treasurer, but in his own name, has added certain things, which have frightened all the pious and divided them from each other. This is how it goes when we place our flesh as our arm. The peasants have been punished nowhere, left free at home, as long as they swear allegiance to the city. The oath includes: First, they swear to obey the banner and the sea, which few of the more ignorant understand, or do not want to understand out of cowardice. Thus almost all, also in the city, have sworn, will drive to the land for it, and it goes miserably. The eight men have not yet been pardoned. Today they appear before our council. In summary: Christ has been expelled and driven out of Solothurn. I have no more hope. But we have made friends into enemies and expect nothing else than that we are the next who must bear the bath. We will be attacked everywhere, offered the fight. We are so cowardly, frightened, and of unequal mind that if they offer us the papacy and war, many of us will reach for the papacy, or if it comes to war, the best will give their necks as with you and the rest will be forced into the papacy and servitude of the Antronians. For we know that we are supposed to be defeated. Some let it be noticed, but very quietly, what it would be if one were to hold a mass in the city, one would still let the gospel be preached.</p>
      <p>About your legates, I know nothing special: Ron has spoken honestly about it, Habius has little. Ours and the Glareans are situated together. The six places have not wanted to get involved in matters of faith, yes (namely) to promote it, but rather to destroy it, which they also bear good will. They have also reproached my lords, they have written to some places for help. But what has been answered to them (they speak of you), they know well. So there is nothing secret anymore.</p>
      <p>One thing I want, that you write me your epichiremata, with which I could hardly dissuade from war, because, if they were attacked, how I could comfort them. For I think, because of God's word, wars have never been well shot. To protect God's word, it hits the devil. He is fought with spiritual arms, innocence of life, sincere faith, and prayer.</p>
      <p>Regarding your letter, I cannot get a copy. They extract from two letters what I wrote, even if not in such clear words. It is also murmured among us that our letter was not read to you all, not everyone knows about your writing. So it goes! I fear, I fear, the devil wants to deceive us. We have acquaintances, the one from Müs wants to come to us too. It will snow enemies.</p>
      <p>About the French and the pope, someone told me, who saw them both in Marseille, 18 cardinals, 35 bishops, they have made a wedding between the king's son and the pope's niece. They are supposed to have another one. The pope gave his niece Plesentz, Parma, Faventz as a gift, which annoyed the emperor, for he fears the king will take Milan, and has therefore taken Rome through his agents. Wants to be pope himself. The pope does not dare to come home. That is the story with us.</p>
      <p>I ask you, burn all these letters. I have the letter from Imm Hag behind me. If you want, it must be returned to you, or kept by me in earnest. I write everything in haste. Until God is entrusted. I am still waiting for an answer to my laboriousness.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>22nd of November.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. H.</p>
      <p>At the 4th hour in the afternoon, your letter was read to me. It states, as they report, our envoys are lying in the suburb with the departed. If this were the case, our lords do not want to make themselves so partisan, but consider mediating the matter according to the power of the confederates. This is the summary: From the reading, they will hold themselves against the Solothurners in this matter according to the sound and saying of the confederates, as they remind us of this. It was said to me more heatedly than the letter itself can. Our envoys have also never been in the suburb, also ours, who ran to them, have been admonished. Dear, do not spread my writing further.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his beloved lord and brother.</p>
