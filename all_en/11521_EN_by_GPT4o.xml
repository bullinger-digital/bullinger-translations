    <p xml:id="regest1">The printer [Mathias Apiarius] has reprinted the [catechism edited by Bucer] against an order, while the [Zwinglian] opposing party has initiated a reprint of the agenda, in which the original wording was retained; if Bullinger writes soon, this could achieve a lot. There is hope to get rid of the innovators with the help of Zurich.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write, because I have already responded to what you once inquired about, namely what was being printed, etc., by saying that the printer had been ordered to stop. But in the meantime, relying on some unknown advice, he proceeded and reprinted the catechism. Meanwhile, the opposing party also ordered that the agenda booklet be printed immediately, which retains the old way of speaking, and therefore we will publish both hot and cold from one press. But I earnestly ask that I may obtain from you not to delay your writings to those you were reminded of, because you do not believe how much benefit you can bring to our church.</p>
      <p>Farewell, from [Bern], March 14, 1541. Things would be going very well if you would join your efforts; I do not doubt that soon we would be freed from those innovators, etc.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and good friend.</p>
