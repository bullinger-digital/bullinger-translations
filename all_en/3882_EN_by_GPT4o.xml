      <p>Greetings. Honorable lord, your kindness, which is almost universally known and personally experienced by me, encourages me to once again appeal to you on behalf of certain pious and distinguished individuals. This matter is not trivial, as it concerns the conscience, which is sensitive even in the best of people and particularly prone to offense. It requires a remedy that is primarily derived from the divine word and administered by a learned man skilled in treating such ailments. Since trust in the physician is crucial for alleviating and curing the ailment, your involvement and assistance in this matter can certainly achieve much. All those involved, due to the reputation of your singular kindness, as reported by many, and your exceptional status and expertise in sacred literature, as evidenced by the reading of your books, have placed their utmost hope in your counsel and help. I would ask that this hope not be disappointed, but I am well aware of your divinely inspired zeal to do good for all. You will learn about the entire matter from the attached letters, which a certain pious and noble man, an admirer of your name, writes to you. He has taken it upon himself to recommend the cause of a very close friend; for the person concerned wishes to remain unknown for certain serious reasons. When it seems appropriate and convenient for your kindness to write down your advice and send it to us, you will send the carefully sealed letter to the "Fat Hen" office in Cologne, addressed to the bookseller Arnold Birckmann or his brother Johann, or in their absence, to the person in charge of the office. On the inner page of this paper, write in three words that this letter should be delivered to Mr. Adolph Baers or, if he is far away, to Georg Cassander for forwarding to him. I have written this to you out of gratitude for a friend who has deserved well of me, with a trembling hand, afflicted and almost consumed by an illness of nearly eight months. Farewell, honorable lord, and do not disdain to assist us with your prayers and those of your church. Duisburg, Cleves, March 3, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Georg Cassander. To the venerable lord and most learned in sacred literature, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent minister of the divine word, in ZÃ¼rich, to his own hands.</p>
