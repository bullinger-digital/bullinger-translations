      <p>Greetings. The very serious and most dangerous matters, with which our adversaries attempt to oppress us along with Christ, are many and varied. And now they are almost at the door, so that it would be necessary to consult on how, with the help of the Lord, if matters were brought to war, we might defend ourselves and our possessions by resisting. Therefore, I have been instructed, my dear Bullinger, to secretly inquire from you, as a faithful, discreet, and good man, by what means we should act with your people of Zurich, so that the plans that will be discussed remain secret. For you know what precautions are necessary after that disastrous war regarding not conducting secret consultations of the republic among you. And yet, those matters which are currently at hand are such that they demand nothing more than silence, and nothing would be more harmful than for them to be known to the public. However, our people absolutely wish to share those matters with you. Therefore, you alone should find a way to satisfy us. But if no way can be found, I would like to know this through you. And if you respond, please write in German, so that I can present your words to those who request what I am doing.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in the Lord always.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 16, 1539.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>The house of Grynaeus has been newly infected with the plague.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
