      <p>S. I cannot express in words, reverend father in Christ, how much I acknowledge myself to owe you for your kindness and humanity towards me. For if it were not for you, we would live here ignorant of all things; moreover, your letters wonderfully affect me. These days I have felt a particular heaviness of both mind and body, which I must necessarily contract more severely, as I lack the company and familiarity of learned men, which alone is enough to blunt the vigor of the mind. There are also six hundred other things here besides.</p>
      <p>Your letters alone restore me to myself. But what do I have with which to repay you?</p>
      <p>You have heard of the cessation of the Italians; but I will write and spur them on; in other matters, they are wonderfully officious and, as they are suspicious, sometimes they stir up great tragedies over the smallest matters; in such a grave and serious matter, they mutter and are silent. At the wedding (by der aabetschencke), the provost of this college sat next to me; he said that it was written to him that the pope had decided to send about 10,000 Italian foot soldiers to Trento, to which Philipp would add a thousand horsemen, and from this, the German princes would also take counsel, so that if any force were made, they might repel it in time. This he said; I have nothing certain.</p>
      <p>It is also written to Mr. Philipp, the colleague, that Philipp of Spain has lost the islands of the western Ocean and is therefore in great trepidation and expedition. If this were true, France would act more quietly.</p>
      <p>What is in your letters about the inconstancy of the King of Navarre, I heard most unwillingly and hardly dare to bring it up here among our people.</p>
      <p>If war were to break out, this matter alone would bring the greatest momentum to the enemies for victory. I speak in human terms.</p>
      <p>Aha said: "Lord, it does not matter to you whether you bring help to many or to those who have no strength. Help us, O Lord our God.</p>
      <p>You wish to know what I have done with the Prince of Württemberg; but recently I could not signify anything certain. Meanwhile, Vergerius wrote to Mr. Consul Ambrosius and to Mr. Philipp, the colleague.</p>
      <p>In Philipp's letters, these are: "I sent the letters of Hercules, Fabricius, Maynard, and Nigrus to the prince; for they themselves wrote to the prince." This he said; but I doubt whether mine were delivered to the prince, because at first everything came into the hands of Vergerius; but nevertheless, he affirms that everything was delivered and that the prince himself (that is, Vergerius), when he sent him to us, would respond to each one.</p>
      <p>Then in the progress, there were these: "You will obtain from Fabricius that he does not disclose what the princes are doing with the Rhaetians; for if the princes knew this, they would take it badly. But more of these in person" etc.</p>
      <p>Surely something emanated from Zürich, to which he alludes. Then there was added a copy of the prince's letter to Vergerius, of which this is the summary: "We are expecting letters from the King of Navarre, and then you will either go to France or to Rhaetia" etc. He wrote to the consul and asks that he be allowed to establish a printing press in Chur; he promised more to the poorer Rhaetian ministers in the name of the prince. You have everything, which you will keep to yourself and use cautiously; for I want these to be secret, so that I can find out more from time to time. Otherwise, if he knew I was sharing with you, he would not entrust secrets.</p>
      <p>But what that man seeks, the outcome will teach. You must be vigilant with Coignetius; I fear they may try to impose this smoke-seller on us by force. Farewell, reverend father, with all yours, as happily and for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Now I receive letters from Augustin Talpius, who wishes to be informed about his affairs; but I wrote to the community and have not yet received a response. But I ask you to tell him to come to Chur first, and in the meantime, I hope to have a response. Other conditions are also vacant etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>It was already evening when letters came from Glarus, in which I am ordered to warn P. P. Vergerius of the ambushes laid for him if he should again undertake a journey to the Rhaetians. I communicated with the consuls; for it also concerns them; I was ordered to write to Vergerius and warn him. This seems to be an opportunity offered by divine providence; for I see this as the only way to prevent him and keep him away from Rhaetia etc. The reason Coignetius did not come was the health of his wife, who was lying mortally ill. Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>I send everything back; I do not know, however, to whom I can give it. To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
