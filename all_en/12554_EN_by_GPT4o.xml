    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has certainly received Blarer's letter [No. 2505] from July 20 through [...], the son of [Heinrich] Herrliberger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Konrad Zwick, who was sent to Zurich [before dawn], has surely already spoken with the people of Zurich about various matters, especially regarding the [imperial] army near Salem.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Last night, a letter from the [Constance] envoy [...] arrived from Ulm: King [Ferdinand] is said to have besieged the pass [Ehrenberg] to reclaim it. If the people of Augsburg had not been so fearful, the [Schmalkaldic League] could have advanced as far as Innsbruck.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Hans Rych from Rapperswil has not yet been to see Blarer. He will report the receipt of the letter [No. 2493].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- He also thanks for the copy of the ordinance of public prayers in Zurich. Without God, the situation would be dire!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Landgrave [Philip of Hesse], in whom Blarer places great hopes, has supposedly moved to Nuremberg to obtain money there. He is also said to have occupied the territory of the Bishop of Bamberg [Weigand of Redwitz]. The people of Zurich should pray for the bravery of the Schmalkaldic League.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I wrote to you the day before yesterday everything I knew, through a boy, the late Herrliberger's son. I hope it has reached you well by now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>So my dear cousin Conrad Zwick was also dispatched last night and has surely been with you by now, before you receive this letter, and has spoken with you about various matters; which pleased me well, that he himself was sent to Zurich, undoubtedly it will be of good service, especially regarding the soldiers lying around Salem.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Otherwise, nothing new, except that last night, right after my cousin's departure, a letter from our envoy in Ulm arrived, stating that the pass is again besieged by the king with several thousand soldiers (mercenaries), and it is to be feared that it will be conquered before our people can return; such negligence! And if our people were now well in Innsbruck, those from Augsburg would not be so fearful. Well! God must make it better and carry it out, for if our plans are followed, otherwise it would be lost and gone.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Hans Rych from Rapperswil has not yet been to see me, perhaps not yet ready and on the way. As soon as I receive the letter, I will let you know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I thank you most diligently for the copy of the ordinance of public prayers among yours. May God be pleased with it and make it effective. We certainly need Him to be the supreme captain, otherwise, it will go badly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>There are rumors, but nothing certain, that the Landgrave has moved to Nuremberg and is there for money. He is also said to have taken the city and dominion of the Bishop of Bamberg. We will soon find out. I always hope, whatever happens, God will accomplish something great through this prince. Praying to God that on our side we are not negligent and bravely use the good means.</p>
      <p>In haste, July 22, 1546.</p>
      <p>A. Bl.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and dearest H. Bullinger, his most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich.</p>
