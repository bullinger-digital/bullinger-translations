      <p>Today, namely April 14th, letters were brought to my merchants from Italy, which indicate that the Pope has handed over the entire administration of the papacy to Cardinal Carafa, retaining only the inquisition for himself. It is also said that he is about to create 20 new cardinals, all closely related to Carafa. Großmann, the intimate advisor of Emperor Ferdinand, has passed through Venice on his way to Rome to inform the Pope, by order of his master, to ensure that a general council is convened, which, if not done, will be called a national one by others.</p>
      <p>The Turkish fleet of 90 ships, which they call galleys, set sail from Constantinople on April 10th, and it is said that 40 other ships will follow, heading for Italy; but it is uncertain where they intend to land. In Picardy, on the part of the French, Cardinal of Lorraine is meeting with others, and on the part of the King of England, the Bishop of Arras with his own, to negotiate peace between the two kings. The French preparations are very great (as I said), such as never before; although the cavalry, who crossed the Rhine, as I said, are still lingering there, the matter is viewed with much suspicion. The Bishop of Würzburg, the noble Wilhelm von Grumbach, who is involved in the expedition, which is said to be quite large, still existing in Saxony, has declared war. The confederated Landgraves, who are now holding a meeting in Landsberg, will have much to do. I wanted to inform your kindness of these things and to add the letters, which I handed over to a student from Augsburg who was about to go to Basel, as I understood he had not yet left. Farewell.</p>
