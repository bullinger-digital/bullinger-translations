      <p>Pious, honorable, prudent and wise, especially kind lord and brother-in-law, my willing service and all good things are always ready for you from me. Philipp Aplanus had to leave his wife behind because she did not want to follow him here to the city of Zurich. However, she now possesses all the goods that are his, and she does not want to let him follow them. And if he wants to sell the goods according to his needs, so that he can pay those he owes and use the rest for his needs, she prevents him from doing so and claims it as her dowry, and he would have to go to ruin because of her. If she then does not want to follow him, he requests that she be provided for and satisfied with her dowry from all his goods, and that he be allowed to manage, handle, and dispose of the goods that are still his and remain with him, as necessary and as the judgment of the 12 places allows, as you may understand from his procurator. Here comes my very friendly request to you, that for God's sake you would help and advise the good man so that what is his may follow him, but that the scribe Roll does not notice that this has been written to you from Zurich. And do the best for the procurator so that he may come to an agreement with the woman, giving her what is hers and also giving Philipp what is his; it is not unreasonable. If I can earn this from you, I will do it. There is no news, except that it is believed a new uprising will happen for the king and that it is also beginning to go well with the holy gospel in the kingdom of Poland. Greet your honorable wife from us; all my people greet you. Thank God, all is well with us. God be with you. Dated Zurich, July 25, 1555.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, and wise Jesajas Reuchlin, bailiff of Luggaris, his dear lord and friendly brother-in-law. Luggaris.</p>
