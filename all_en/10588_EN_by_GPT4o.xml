    <p xml:id="regest1">His situation remains difficult. He asks Bullinger to find out something [about his naturalization?] from Mayor Röist and to report back to him. A servant of Konrad Zwick attempted to take his own life in the monastery area. According to Zwick, an alliance was formed at the Donauwörth meeting, which is also supposed to include Nuremberg and Duke George. There is much talk about the Bernese [Savoy policy] and about the behavior of Zurich. Hans Müller will forward Bullinger's reply letter.</p>

      <p>May God's grace preserve us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dear lord and brother, do not be angry that I often trouble you with my afflictions; for I do not know where else to turn or where to go; for I am weary, indeed, sitting here with much detriment to myself and my children. If I had set my mind to remain, I would be as content with God and the world as he is, etc. I seek help and advice from you; for you see the patience of God. In my opinion, it is not good to continue with such useless, even more harmful idleness.</p>
      <p>My lord, I wrote to you recently and asked if you had learned anything from my lord Röist or elsewhere. I ask you once again, for God's sake, to advise me and write to me for comfort as much as you think you have learned. For I am very restless within myself. If you can, be a father to my children. Do not let me regret my pleading.</p>
      <p>Item, Konrad Zwick from Constance was here these days, a servant with him, who left the stable and got lost. Thus, he went into the abbot's court, gave himself two stabs and another in the neck. There is concern he might die. He was, as I hear, comforted or assured by a monk. May God protect us.</p>
      <p>Item, Konrad Zwick tells me the day at Donauwörth has passed. There, some have formed an alliance; however, as he says, without detriment to us, since Nuremberg, the city, and Duke George are also involved. Here, people talk a lot about the Bernese, what they assure you.</p>
      <p>Praying to God for me; I earnestly desire that. And greet your wife and mother for me.</p>
      <p>What you wish to write to me, send to Hans Müller. He will give it to the messenger.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, quickly, Sunday after Gregory in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your willing</p>
      <p>H. Vogler in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and friend, M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher.</p>
