      <p>Greetings. I received your last letters, most distinguished and esteemed man, and in these, which you had previously written about the matters of Paracelsus, both of which were very pleasing to me. [...] The doctrine of Paracelsus is not only unjust in philosophy, monstrous in medicine, but also impious and blasphemous in theology. He denies the perfect creation by the true God, makes our creators some mortal craftsmen sitting in the stars, attributes the power of miracles to humans, herbs, stones, and specters. He derives the foresight of future events from some unknown demon to us; he attributes more than divine power to characters, words, and images fabricated under a certain position of the stars. He claims that our life is at our own discretion, that there is nothing from God's predestination, and that we can prolong it until the final judgment.</p>
      <p>He claims that the heavens are made by wicked men through error, who can in no way be good, etc. He presents other absurdities far more monstrous than these. I try to refute all these solidly in the first part of the confutation. I give great thanks for depicting Paracelsus to me. Oporinus, who served as his scribe for two years, did the same.</p>
      <p>You agree beautifully in all things. It is certain that he was a magician and allied with a cacodemon."</p>
