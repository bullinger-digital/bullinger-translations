      <p>Greetings. I did not think it necessary, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, to trouble you, who are already overwhelmed with numerous tasks and a thousand concerns, especially since there is nothing so urgent that I should inform you about.</p>
      <p>Whatever news is being spread back and forth, our Matthias here can easily explain to you, to whom I have also given some trifles to present to you, although they are almost unworthy for you to read, let alone believe, except that it is sometimes amusing to hear the strange inventions of the sons of men, however vain, among so many true things, which are too dreadful to hear.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Augsburg recently returned from Rome, burdened and adorned with the most ample priesthoods in Germany by his creator, the Pope, as he certainly sees it, affirming most piously that the new Pope is entirely committed to ending the long-standing and unfortunate dissensions in the cause of religion by the authority of a council as soon as possible, on which matter he agrees beautifully with the Emperor, I say, with a clearly inclined and more than paternal spirit, and therefore Charles is hastening the assembly soon to be held in Augsburg with great zeal for Christ and his church, so that he may have all the orders of the Roman Empire sworn to the future decrees of the council and then, aided by the hands of all, compel the disobedient and rebellious, whoever they may be, to either yield or be utterly destroyed. But there is no counsel against the Lord; if we prove our faith to Him, we will be quite safe from those phantoms and bulls. However, there is no small danger that the heavenly and most merciful Father, whose long patience we have long abused, may exact severe penalties for the execrable ingratitude of our people, who now stubbornly provoke Him against us. Ah, how vigilant we must be, how we must knock with faithful and fervent prayers, with a zeal for solid repentance, on our Christ, that He may have mercy on His little flock and command these waves and the stormy sea as soon as possible, for outside of His favorable gaze and the rebuke of His word, no human strength, no wisdom, nor anything human will be able to calm and pacify this most savage storm. Ah ah ah, how I fear for the once invincible and feared by all Helvetia (Switzerland), lest, after having so shamefully degenerated from the character and institutions of our ancestors, it may disgracefully fall from their happiness and freedom into the most miserable snare of servitude, to its own and many others' great harm.</p>
      <p>But I restrain myself, my brother, lest I do what I wrote at the beginning, that I would not trouble you, who are now otherwise occupied, with many things.</p>
      <p>Commend to you, if ever anyone, the young man of excellent hope, Lazarus Kölli, the son of Andreas Kölli, who in the year 42, during the cruel plague, served as a truly good pastor to the church at Bischofszell, the best son of the best father, who in appearance and the habit of his whole body, as well as in character, morals, and piety of life, resembles his very father. He is fourteen years old and is held by a wonderful love of studies. If nothing else, I beseech you, obtain this for him, that he may be received into the lowest condition of the students who are there. Believe me, you will have done a thing worthy of Christ and your office and most gratifying to me. Our Matthias will also remind you of this, who has seen him in person and who has promised to advocate his cause with you in good faith, as far as his influence with you extends. Farewell, my heart and soul in the Lord, to whom I diligently commend myself and mine in continuous prayers. I and mine reverently and most lovingly bid you and your most holy wife and your whole household to be well, desiring and hoping to be aided by your pious prayers to the Savior Christ. Greet all the brothers and friends, especially your fellow ministers in the work of the Lord, whom I have long been contemplating seeing in person and embracing in Christ, and I hope that soon, with the Lord's favor, what I am attempting here will succeed. Again and again, farewell. May 6, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>I received your recent letters, in which you defend your own. Strive as much as you can, so that the preaching of the word of grace is not extorted from the ministers and that, if necessary, they are paid from the public treasury, rather than allowing the subjects to be deprived of such a great good.</p>
      <p>Our Buttler will give you a crown of better note, that is, marked with the sun, in my name, with the Helvetic basin, when you have only to count out the spun coins. I also give you great thanks for this service.</p>
      <p>There is no need for me to commend our Matthias to you, since I ought to be commended to you by him, who, if I am not mistaken, was first enrolled in the list of your friends, and then also much more worthy of your love than I am. I love this excellent man greatly, not only for his venerable gray hair but also for a certain singular candor and a simplicity burning with divine zeal and rare faith in the ministry of the church. For he thunders, flashes, and even strikes when he urges repentance before the congregation; would that he did it as successfully as he does it bravely! But here, as elsewhere, they are accustomed to bravely despise these things and to boldly oppose these truly formidable thunders, as you will hear from him himself.</p>
      <p>At this very moment, I receive letters from my dearest relative Peter Schär, who, as he always does when writing to us, very officiously bids you and his wife and offspring to be well, diligently commending them to your holy intercessions at the throne of grace and affirming that he desires nothing more than to be able to greet you as a most welcome guest at his estate in Vinzel and to keep you with him for some time.</p>
      <p>[... to Heinrich] Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, as a friend to his brother.</p>
