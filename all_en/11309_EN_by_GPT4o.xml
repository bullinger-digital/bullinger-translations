      <p>Many greetings, father, etc.</p>
      <p>We urgently request your fatherly advice regarding the induction of the jurors. Disobedience in observing holidays has spread so widely among many people and places that it is difficult, indeed impossible, to impose penalties on individuals, as the argument and complaint of many and the community is that there is now a greater scandal in the countryside by not observing holidays.</p>
      <p>Our well-intentioned neighbors, the people of Bern, Basel, and (if we have understood correctly) the evangelical men in St. Gallen, have been moved to abolish all these holidays except for Sunday, except for foreigners, and they argue in a complaining manner (which I also support) that the harm always falls on the poor, because the rich and many craftsmen (such as shoemakers, tailors, etc.) always have an abundance of work to hide, which others lack. I have not been ashamed to offer these things to your charity in love, not because our wishes mean or should mean anything, but because we always strive to satisfy the oath and not to obey the magistrate. We urgently beg you, as a father, to advise us. Indulge and favor the clumsy Priscian and farewell happily with all yours.</p>
      <p>Georg Hoch, minister of the word in the church of Embrach.</p>
      <p>To the pious and honest man Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful overseer of the church of Zurich and his most beloved patron, these letters are owed.</p>
