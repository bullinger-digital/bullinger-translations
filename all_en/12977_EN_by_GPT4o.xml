    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Two messengers from the community of Langrickenbach have approached Mötteli with the request to write a letter to Bullinger regarding their [Zurich-born] pastor Johannes Gisling. He behaves so offensively and improperly that they would like to dismiss him. Unfortunately, this is prevented by Hans Vogel, the steward of the Constance cathedral chapter, as he protects Gisling and had employed him against the will of the community. Consequently, the [community elders] have ordered Gisling to provide a certificate from Zurich proving that he is suitable, learned, and skilled enough to hold a pastoral position. Presumably, he will soon come to Bullinger to obtain the said certificate. The community elders earnestly ask Bullinger to provide them with another pastor, as Gisling roams around with his violin, plays for the Papists to dance, participates in nightly gatherings, and associates with young girls. He is single, does not study, and behaves accordingly poorly, causing more trouble than improvement. Mötteli has also heard such things from Hans Stadelmann, [pastor in Altnau]. Overall, it looks bad, and the situation may be even worse than the honorable people of Langrickenbach openly admit.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger should act in the interest of all: For Gisling, it would certainly be better if he remained in Zurich under supervision and censorship until his youthful exuberance subsides, and the people of Langrickenbach need a more sensible and skilled pastor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger should keep an eye on Mötteli's son Joseph and review the notes he has compiled during his studies, so that he works diligently and respects Bullinger. Bullinger would be doing Mötteli a great service by doing so.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God beforehand, much beloved lord and brother. Two messengers from the community of Rickenbach have been with me and asked me to write to you regarding their pastor, who behaves offensively and so improperly that they would like to dismiss him. However, Hans Vogel, the steward of the cathedral chapter (who had employed him against the will of the community and also supports him), stands in their way, so they cannot do it. Therefore, they have ordered him to bring a certificate from Zurich proving that he is virtuous, learned, and skilled enough to hold a pastoral position. For this reason, they expect he will come to you to obtain the certificate, as he promised them. Therefore, they earnestly ask you to be diligent in finding them another pastor. For this Johannes Gisling (I believe that is his name) roams around with his violin, plays for the Papists to dance, participates in nightly gatherings, and associates with young girls. He has no wife, does not study, and behaves so poorly that they are more troubled by him than improved. Hans Stadelmann has also told me similar things about him, so I fear it is bad enough and perhaps worse than the honorable people are willing to admit.</p>

      <p>Do the best for them and for him. For it would be better for him to be with you, where there is supervision and censorship, until his youthful exuberance subsides, than here at home, where there is no censorship or supervision (as you well know, youth cannot master itself), and send the good people a more sensible and skilled pastor eventually. Let the honorable people be entrusted to you and do the best for them, if possible.</p>

      <p>Entrusted to God and do the best for my son Joseph and keep an eye on him. Review his notes, what he compiles in his studies and how. I ask you for this, so he will be more diligent and fear you. In doing so, you do a great service to God and me.</p>

      <p>Greet my dear wife, Doctor Gessner, Theodor, Gwalther, and all good friends. Dated June 22, in the year 1547. Martin Mötteli, your humble and willing servant always.</p>
      <p>To the pious and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, his especially beloved lord, to his hands.</p>
