    <p xml:id="regest1">Allows himself, as a stranger, to write to him in order to bring to his attention a pasquinade about the Wittenberg Convention. His brother-in-law, the Electoral Saxon councilor Bleikard Sindringer, has offered to relieve him from the arduous work in the printing house [of Christian Egenolff], but first demands from him - allegedly in accordance with the outcome of the convention - a confession to Luther's doctrine of the Lord's Supper, in order not to be immediately banished [from Saxony]. Sellarius disapproves of Luther's arrogance and assesses the convention differently, referring to the aforementioned writing; this cannot be printed in Frankfurt, where only Dionysius Melander and a few others have seen it, which is why he has hastily copied it for Bullinger, omitting inappropriate additions.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You may perhaps wonder, most learned Bullinger, who this untimely person is, who dares, unknown, to burden you with his unpolished writings and to divert you from better and more arduous studies. Therefore, I ask that you do not regret spending a little time. This little book gave me the occasion to write. The zeal for piety moved me, and the ease and candor of your intellect, as seen in various published books, encouraged me, so that I hope it will not be tedious for you.</p>
      <p>This summer, a rumor was flying around everywhere, promising great things about the Wittenberg Convention. Everyone who claims the name of the Gospel hoped that finally, the great rival of the Roman Pope would seek the glory of Christ more than his own, seeing so many distinguished men from Upper Germany coming to him for that reason. But how they were received by him and what they all accomplished with him, this pasquinade will inform you.</p>
      <p>About three months ago, my wife's brother, Doctor Bleikard Sindringer, a councilor to the Elector of Saxony, was with me. The prince uses his services in his most important affairs and embassies, and he was returning home from Andernach on the prince's business. As I hear, he has been studying in Wittenberg in the most splendid buildings for 16 years, sent there by his father for study, having been well instructed for seven years by the learned doctor of the Palatine prince, for which reason he was elevated to such honor in Wittenberg, a man otherwise pious and good. He, I say, was with me and promised me his help, namely to rescue me from the labors of the printing office and the mill, on the condition that I write to him my opinion on the Lord's Supper. For if I believed otherwise than is believed there and has now been established in the convention, I would immediately be expelled from their territories. However, they want to believe and teach Luther's faith among them all in the convention.</p>
      <p>Despite these words, although he is intimate and dear to the prince, I did not want to believe until this pasquinade was sent by a most zealous and honest man of piety, which is not safe to publish here among these ignorant people. Few have seen it, our Dionysius Melander and one or two other faithful worshippers of piety. However, I wanted to give it to you because I saw here your confession of faith sent to Wittenberg and not accepted by that supreme pontiff, as I hear, which I have heard sufficiently commended by the pious. And at least, what this tyrant intends, who so rejects and despises the writings of so many ancient doctors and pious men, from whose monuments we nevertheless see how much they have done in the church of God and with what labors, anxiety, and fervor. Luther did many things at first, but when he wanted to be something alone and despised others before him, I fear too much that he received the spirit of error and dizziness from the angry Lord, which I wish he would take away from him and open his eyes again, so that he may look deeper into himself! I pray to the Lord for this, that his Gospel may not be utterly destroyed by the adversaries, by whom it is most badly heard for this reason. You will know from this dialogue that there are still pious men in our places who seek and desire the true glory of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ to be safe. A certain defender of the mass brought it here. He added to it in some places, but I did not transcribe those spurious parts; for they did not fit well. I preferred to keep the original author's work pure. But I hope you will consider it kindly, even though it is so inelegantly described; for the occupations of the fairs prevented me from describing it otherwise. Therefore, I ask you to receive these letters with a good spirit and interpret them. For although I am of the lowest rank, I love learned, good, and pious men and, where I can, I serve them and above all desire the glory of God to emerge, to whom be honor, praise, and thanksgiving forever. May He abundantly increase the grace granted to you, so that you may continue to work in His vineyard with a strong and constant spirit and vindicate the glory of Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily in the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Frankfurt, at Christian Egenolff's, 12 days before the calends of October 1536.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you,</p>
      <p>Heinrich Sellarius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor, to be honored by him, greetings.</p>
