    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer hopes that Bullinger has received his letter [No. 3031]. Just last evening, he received Bullinger's letter [No. 3014] (which the young pastor from [Lang]rickenbach [Johannes Gisling] was supposed to deliver) from the hands of a butcher [...]. A response is only needed regarding Bullinger's question about the content of the message Blarer communicated to Count Georg of Württemberg-Mömpelgard. However, since this is now generally known, Blarer does not need to repeat it here.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Philipp Melanchthon is in Wittenberg and will not move to Tübingen. He has also declined an appointment to Leipzig. However, if the young Elector in Weimar [Duke Johann Friedrich II the Middle of Saxony] establishes a new school, he would be inclined to go there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Two people from the entourage of King Ferdinand I, who were recently in Konstanz, reported that 18,000 Italians are being prepared for a campaign against Konstanz and the Confederates. This was also mentioned in a letter sent from Munich to a nobleman in Konstanz [...]. The military campaign against the Confederates is planned for the coming spring.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger will know more than Blarer about the mission of the embassy [Louis Daugerant, Seigneur de Boisrigaut] of King Henry II of France. Everything indicates that the King of France and Emperor Charles V are in agreement. It also seems that the King intends to rehabilitate the Constable Anne de Montmorency, who fell out of favor under his father Francis I, and it is known that he stands on the side of the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger should pray unceasingly for the people of Konstanz, who are in an extremely complicated situation. Deceit, cunning, and betrayal prevail everywhere, and only with God is there security. If only the admonitions of the pastors to repentance would have some effect! For without this, all human effort is in vain, even harmful. Blarer and others have concluded that the world would rather do anything else than think about a Christian way of life, which is why all wise people know that the world is heading towards its end, even its imminent end. May Christ preserve the small band of his followers! Blessing wish.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to Bullinger's household, to colleagues and friends. Greetings from everyone, especially from Blarer's brother Thomas and from Konrad Zwick.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother, I recently wrote to you today. I hope you have received it. Just yesterday, I received a letter from you, which the young pastor from Rickenbach was supposed to deliver, but he gave it to a butcher, from whom I only received it last night, and found nothing to respond to in it except regarding Count Georg, and what I wrote to him; but you already know this, without the report, since it is now common knowledge.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding Philipp, there is nothing with Tübingen. He is not coming home. He is in Wittenberg. He did not want to accept the position in Leipzig. However, if the young Elector in Weimar were to establish a school, he would stay.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing certain to write to you. For there were two here today, coming from the king, saying that a fresh Italian force of 18,000 is being prepared against us and the Confederates. Similarly, a letter was written here to a prominent man from Munich. Several other letters agree with this. It is certain that something is planned against you for the coming spring.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>As for the French embassy riding around from place to place, and what their recruitment is, you know much better than I can thoroughly and well report to you. Everything seems to agree that he and the emperor are fundamentally one. And there are several conjectures that the old constable, who was dismissed by the old king, has now been completely taken back into favor by the young one and has come to his office, who is entirely good imperial, as you yourself well know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Furthermore, I have absolutely nothing to write, except to ask you not to fail us with your constant and fervent intercessions before the Lord, so that he may resolve and expedite our complicated affairs as soon as possible and successfully. Everything is surrounded by deceit, treachery, and betrayal, and nothing is safe anywhere, except that he is abundantly safe who dwells in the highest aid. If only our exhortations to Christian repentance could achieve something, since outside of it, we attempt everything not only in vain but to our great harm. And yet the nature of this world seems to be such, both to many and to me, that it seems to contemplate anything sooner than another, that is, a life worthy of Christian people, which certainly must be the case, so that those who judge more precisely rightly pronounce that nothing else but the ultimate destruction, and that sudden, is imminent for it. May Christ preserve us, enrolled among his little flock, whole and rightly thinking and living through all these evils! In him, my soul, live eternally and farewell!</p>

      <p>In Konstanz, October 10, 1547. May your household, along with all our colleagues and friends in the Lord, be well. All of ours, and among them especially my brother Thomas and Zwick, send you their most dutiful greetings. Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother in Christ the Savior, most closely connected. Zurich.</p>
