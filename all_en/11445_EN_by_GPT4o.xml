      <p>My friendly greetings and good will are always with you, honorable, pious, well-learned, beloved sir.</p>
      <p>Since the chaplaincy endowment in Pfäffikon, originally established by Hermann von Landenberg, is now entrusted to me in the name of my children, who are rightfully heirs to this foundation and its patronage rights, I have promised it to the honorable, well-learned Jakob Frömbd from Constance, former schoolmaster in Aarau, the bearer of this letter, with the condition that he should present himself to you and be examined by you. If he passes and is found agreeable, capable, and suitable by you, I will then confirm my promise and grant it, etc. And since I have also requested the good will of the dean and chapter of Aarau along with other honorable people, I extend my friendly request to you, that you may also recommend the bearer of this letter for my sake, and show him your favorable and kind will. I ask this to earn your favor, and hereby commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Dated Tuesday, the first of June, in the year 1540. Your well-wisher, Caspar von Hallwyl in Hallwil.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the divine word, along with his fellow workers in the word and other such matters appointed and ordained by the city of Zürich, my especially gracious, dear sir.</p>
