    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the letter, money, and New Year's gift; he intends to return the borrowed coin and sends the requested manuscript. He is doing well, but would like to change his place of study soon, so he gladly follows the request to outline his plans. He does not need to remind Bullinger how beneficial a stay abroad is. Among the most significant cities, Paris and Venice stand out; Paris is superior in the sciences, and staying there would probably be less dangerous, but the decision, which will hopefully be made quickly, lies with [the school authorities]; he himself prefers France because he already knows Germany and wants to improve his French skills. It would be good if a compatriot could accompany him as a companion, but he can also join others. Additionally, he requests an increase in his scholarship to avoid having to enter foreign service. Bullinger's book "De origine erroris" is well-received and is to be published in Geneva in a French translation, although it is reportedly displeasing to some Bernese. In Paris, a royal professor of Arabic [Guillaume Postel] has published a grammar for twelve languages; since the only available copy went to Viret, he cannot provide him with one yet, but he will continue to try. Sends a poem about the [upcoming] solar eclipse. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letter, most kind father, along with the money, was faithfully delivered by the courier. For these and other previous benefits bestowed upon me, I give thanks, ready to reciprocate if I have the means to do so. I will never be able to give adequate thanks for the New Year's gift sent by you and mother; please, convey my most heartfelt thanks to her on my behalf. I had decided to send her something useful, but at this time nothing worthy presented itself; however, I will not forget her. I received the crown that you lent to the young man from Lausanne, as the letter written to Conrad instructed; you may reclaim it from my funds. I am sending the manuscript as you requested.</p>
      <p>As for other matters, everything is well. We are all in good health here; I wish the same for you. However, I would like to be informed about what the future holds for my situation. For it is not advisable for someone who desires to learn about various cities and customs to remain in an insignificant and obscure place for too long.</p>
      <p>You asked me to outline my plan and describe the cities I intend to visit, which I will gladly do for you, whose help and advice I seek in this matter.</p>
      <p>It would not be necessary to elaborate on how much benefit, what fruits and advantages the knowledge of various places and the experience of different customs and laws bring to someone involved in both the church and the republic, as we know that you yourself have learned from this experience, and we are certain that such plans do not displease you. Therefore, it remains only to seek your advice on which cities I should visit.</p>
      <p>As you know, there are two cities in the world that shine like lights, namely Paris and Venice, and whichever of these you permit me to visit, I will undertake the journey with a ready mind. Paris flourishes especially in the study of letters, while Venice flourishes in the experience of various matters, so that there you can indeed pursue letters, and here, along with letters, almost everything that our world has to offer. Certainly, as far as letters are concerned, you would say that they flourish nowhere more than in Paris, which is why I have set my mind on going there, if I perceive that my plan is not disapproved by you. It is also the case that it might be safer to stay in Paris than in Venice. However, I leave this to you and the others to decide. I only ask and earnestly pray that the delay here is not prolonged. As you know, I am advancing in years day by day, and now is the time that should be spent visiting foreign lands, and it cannot be postponed to a more convenient time.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I do not doubt that you will not disapprove of my plan. For my preference for France over Germany is not without reason; the largest and most illustrious part of Germany has already been seen, while I have not yet even begun to taste France, and I would like to fully acquire the knowledge of its language, the foundations of which we have now laid. Therefore, I earnestly request that this be granted to me; as much as it is in my power, I will diligently ensure that neither you nor I regret this plan.</p>
      <p>As for what is necessary for this journey, I do not think you or others are unaware. Above all, I would like a faithful friend as a companion; for it would be more prudent and safer to seek foreign lands accompanied by a fellow countryman.</p>
      <p>However, if this is denied, it should not be a sufficient reason to hinder this plan. It will be easy to find others with whom it is safe to travel to Paris.</p>
      <p>The second thing I ask for is a larger stipend; for the current one, as you can judge, is by no means sufficient for this purpose, especially since you do not allow (as I understood from your letters) that I offer my services to others, which, however, would be absolutely necessary wherever I am, unless you assist me. Therefore, if I may obtain anything from you through my prayers, I earnestly beseech you not to be too harsh in this matter, so that I am not forced to waste time, the most noble of all things and irrecoverable by any treasures, on the labors of others that are not as beneficial to me, which we see happening to many today not without great inconvenience. You are not unaware of my circumstances: I am poor, and I have no one but you, who have been and are like a father to me; I consider the other heads of our college as fathers and think I should turn to them alone.</p>
      <p>If they refuse their help, there is no one to whom I can turn, unless perhaps I offer myself to others, which I will never do against your wishes. Many may perhaps think that what is currently being paid is too much, let alone that any increase should be added; but you know how ill-advised such a statement is. It is indeed a lot, which I also admit; but a lot must also be spent by me, indeed almost all of what is given is to be spent on the purchase of sustenance. But from where should the rest, which is necessary for a student of letters, be obtained? Therefore, most kind father, I ask this one thing from you, that you deign to take up my cause with them, so that I am not prevented by poverty from reaching the fruit that I could otherwise achieve. But if they refuse, at least ask that they pay more for one or two years, and then recall me home and pay less, so that this time and leisure, which they have granted me, is not ruined by want. Since you yourself perceive these things with the judgment of your mind, it does not seem worthwhile to urge them further; I commend myself and my fortunes to you. I write to you more freely because I understand that you truly care about my affairs and I know no one else to whom I can turn. Therefore, I beseech you to consider my matters with fairness and kindness. Also, ensure that a response is sent as soon as possible, so that the delay here is not prolonged, and that I may set out at the beginning of spring.</p>
      <p>Your book "De origine erroris" is greatly admired here, and is in everyone's hands. It is also being translated into French in Geneva, so that it may be published in that language as well. Although I have been told by some that certain Bernese criticize it as being written with less piety, I have not been able to ascertain anything certain or a definite author. But it would matter little if it happens today, since even Christ himself never spoke things that pleased everyone.</p>
      <p>A grammar of twelve different languages has been printed in Paris, written by the Arabic professor hired by the king. Only one copy has reached us, which Viret has. I have diligently inquired if I could obtain one to send to you, but I have not been able to find any. I will send it if I manage to acquire one.</p>
      <p>I am sending here what we recently played about the solar eclipse, which I ask you to consider with fairness and kindness. I will write more through the potter Morgenstern; he will soon come to you.</p>
      <p>Please ensure that my matters are not delayed any longer. Our Conrad and his wife wish you well. You will also greet your wife and mother with my name as warmly as possible, along with the whole family.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, January 24, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours most respectfully,</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
