      <p>We received your most courteous letters, Jewel and I, at the beginning of April; from which I understood that you intend to send your son Rudolf to the University of Oxford at the appointed time for the cultivation of his intellect. I would not advise you to do this (as things stand now).</p>
      <p>For it is still a den of darkness, of darklings, of robbers.</p>
      <p>There are few evangelicals there, but many papists. But when it has been reformed (which we both hope and wish will happen soon), then let your Rudolf come. I will say nothing now about how welcome his arrival in England will be to me.</p>
      <p>I would prefer to express my gratitude to him in deeds rather than words, etc. The Book of Common Prayer, used in the time of King Edward, is now again in use throughout all of England, [and] will be everywhere, despite the resistance and protests of the pseudo-bishops. The Queen does not want to be called the head of the Church of England, although this title has been offered to her, but she has gladly accepted the title of governor; which amounts to the same thing. The Pope has been expelled from England again, to the grief of the bishops and the entire rabble of the shaven. The Masses have been abolished. On May 8th, Parliament was concluded.</p>
      <p>The Earl of Bedford gave three crowns to our Wolfgang.</p>
      <p>In this, he is happier than many others.</p>
      <p>Those who will become bishops in the future will have no castles, estates, or villages.</p>
      <p>Those who are now, will enjoy what they have as long as they live: worthy to be not only removed from office but also hanged by the halter. For they are Davids (Danes?), disturbing everything.</p>
      <p>The monasteries will soon be dissolved.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more now.</p>
      <p>For within four days I must contend with the worst Arian beasts both from the pulpit and in mutual conversations in my native land: for which purpose I have diligently studied your most learned book on both natures in Christ. I hope to come well-prepared into the battle, and indeed to defeat the enemies of Christ. Christ lives, reigns, and will reign despite the Arians, Anabaptists, and Papists. Farewell, most excellent and dearest man to my heart! Overwhelm your excellent wife, sons, daughters, and your most noble sons-in-law with my greetings (if I may say so). Good Lavater has done me a most pleasing service by sending me such a good little book, and one entirely from Zürich. Greet for me Mr. Bibliander, Collin, Haller, Wolf, Wick, Frisius, Bernardin, Ammian, Meyer, Sebastian, Coler, Funck, Pellican, Froschauer, and all. My wife sends greetings to you, yours, and all.</p>
      <p>Tears often burst forth from her when the women of Zürich are mentioned. To your magnificent magistrates, the city, and indeed the entire Zürich dominion, I wish all the happiest things. City of Zürich, farewell: may all who do not wish you well fare badly.</p>
      <p>City of Zürich, farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>London, May 21, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours most truly, John Parkhurst.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
