    <p xml:id="regest1">Someone [...] wrote [to Basel] that there were three parties among the princes and cities [at the Imperial Diet] in Worms: Lutherans, Catholics, and the neutral party consisting of [Frederick II of the] Palatinate and [Hermann von Wied], Bishop of Cologne. [Charles V] is negotiating with the latter, hoping to find a solution to the religious conflict. But to what end? - Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] no longer tolerates the people of Cologne hosting [Henry of] Brunswick in a public inn. He wrote to them and admonished them not to give refuge to an enemy of the Empire, indeed of God, otherwise they would soon be punished for it. Out of fear of a popular uprising, the council has ordered the Brunswickian to seek another place; Cologne does not want any problems with the Landgrave and the Protestants. - The death of Luther has been fabricated by the Papists; perhaps Bullinger already knows the booklet they published? - Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander] and the others. - Bullinger should not worry about the cost of the books sent to him. If he needs more, Gast will take care of it. Bullinger should obtain an answer from Froschauer to the questions recently posed by Gast about Zwingli's works.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Someone wrote to us that the princes and cities are divided into three parts: Lutherans, Catholics, and neutrals, that is, the Palatinate and the Bishop of Cologne. They have separated from the others; with whom the Emperor is now negotiating, so that he might better resolve the matter of religion. What if this middle ground was found on the Emperor's advice, to better bring the dissenting parties into harmony?</p>
      <p>The people of Cologne supported the Brunswickian for several weeks, but in a public inn, which the Landgrave could not tolerate. He wrote to them not to harbor the enemy of all Germany, indeed of God, or they would soon experience the consequences.</p>
      <p>What he wrote to them the third time, I do not know; but sedition began to grow, and the senate was forced by the people to order the Brunswickian to seek a safer place; they did not want to have anything to do with the Landgrave and the Protestants.</p>
      <p>Regarding the death of Luther, which the Papists have fabricated, perhaps you have seen the booklet; ridiculous! The Pope knows nothing but how to lie and invent the most absurd and unbelievable things.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I wanted to write these few things to you amidst the business. Greet Master Theodor and the other excellent men.</p>
      <p>Do not be concerned about the price of the books I sent. If you want anything else taken care of, just let me know and I will see to it properly. As for Zwingli's works, as I recently wrote, ask Froschauer. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 25, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear, kind lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
