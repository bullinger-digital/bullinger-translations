He intends, as soon as his years are up, not to stay a day longer in Riquewihr; he will also inform [Count George of WÃ¼rttemberg] so that he can arrange for a successor in good time. He would like to leave his wife and children in Zurich, especially because they were ill and need recovery; he will undertake a cure with them in August in Baden and then return [to Riquewihr], where he will continue to perform his duties as before. If anyone takes offense at his behavior as a pastor or family man, he will justify himself before the council or the synod if necessary. He asks not to be further pressured; he has already achieved more than others. He did not make his decision without good advice from others and wishes that nothing will be held against him.</p>

      <p>Greetings and brotherly affection in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Dear sirs and brothers, I understand your intention, which was recently presented to me, in the best way possible. Therefore, it is my friendly and earnest request to you to accept this my response in the same manner and to consider it kindly.</p>
      <p>First of all, I say that as soon as my years are up, I do not intend to stay a single day longer in Riquewihr. I will also inform my gracious prince and lord, as soon as I come down, so that his grace may arrange for another in due time.</p>
      <p>Secondly, I do not wish to drag my wife and children along the far, long journey, but rather leave them at home in Zurich with my family. This is because, although there are many other reasons, which are not less important, but not necessary to mention here, they have all been very ill recently and have not yet fully recovered. Also, the stone (bladder stone) troubles me daily, and I intend, God willing, to travel with them to Baden in August, as my gracious lord has granted me permission to do.</p>
      <p>After that, I will arrange to return down there as soon as possible and continue to do my best as before, in the meantime, according to the church's schedule and my gracious lord's pleasure, occasionally visiting my family at home, etc.</p>
      <p>However, if there is anyone who would not want to let me stay there or otherwise thinks that I have not conducted myself honorably and honestly, as a Christian preacher and a pious, faithful man towards wife and children, or would not do so in the future, I am willing to answer before my gracious lords and superiors of Zurich, whether in the small or large council, or even before a general synod of all brothers, as may be deemed appropriate and as my lords see fit.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is my request to you, for the sake of God and all our old friendship, dear sirs and brothers, that you allow me to remain there and do not press me further. For I am certainly always willing to do what is proper for a pious man, and whatever I am capable of, to be found and used willingly at all times in the future as I have been until now. I believe that I have also done something and perhaps more than some others might have done.</p>
      <p>This decision has been made by me, but not without the counsel of good, prudent, and pious men, indeed also wise and senatorial men. Therefore, cease, most excellent and dearest men, to be troublesome to a brother who has been compliant in all things until now and more than sufficiently tested, and do not, as I believe, think so ill of me; lest, while you unjustly burden me with a matter, you create a matter for yourselves. I pray through Christ Jesus that you consider this response fairly and kindly. For I know most certainly that you would feel very differently if you were in the same position.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, most beloved and esteemed brothers, always. Your Erasmus.</p>
      <p>To Leo Jud, Konrad Pellikan, and Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed leaders, teachers, and brothers of the Zurich church.</p>
