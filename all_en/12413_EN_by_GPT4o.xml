    <p xml:id="regest1">Gallus Albertus, a compatriot [of the Zurichers], has arrived unexpectedly but is already traveling on, so Blarer can only report generalities and hardly anything new.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The [people of Konstanz] greatly appreciated Bullinger's news about [Jakob] Metzler and are happy to forgive him for everything. Blarer conveys a letter [from Georg] Frölich [No. 2351] received [on February 28] and a document that should be sent back with the next messenger. Blarer will read and return Bullinger's writing [“De sacramentis”].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- He hopes that Bullinger has received well the letters he sent on January 28 [No. 2335] through the butchers and on February 3 [No. 2344] through [Konrad Hofherr], as well as letter [No. 2354].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Theodor [Bibliander] is to manage the money that Hofherr received from [Hans Peter] von Wellenberg.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Gallus Albertus, a compatriot (Landsmann) of yours, has arrived here unexpectedly. As he is already prepared for his journey, he addresses me while I am very busy, so I can only report generalities, which I do not doubt you already know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>What you wrote about Metzler was very pleasing, and we easily forgive everything, since he has satisfied you. I am sending the letters which I received the day before yesterday from our Leto to be sent to you. Then you will also read the documents given to me here, which I ask you to return with the next messenger. I will read your book, faithfully kept, and return it to you as soon as I have read it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I wrote to you on January 28 through our butchers, and I do not know whether you have received those letters. For they are not the ones I sent through Curio on February 3, nor the ones I sent recently through our compatriot. Therefore, see if you can find them; I would not want them to be lost.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding what I mentioned about Curio, I strongly request that Theodor manage the money, 27 florins, which he received there from Wellenberg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Commend me to the Lord Jesus Christ with your family, whom you will greet most lovingly in my words. Greetings to all brothers and friends. Farewell. March 2, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother. In Zurich.</p>
