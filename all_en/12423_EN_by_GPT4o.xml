    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks Blarer for his three letters [No. 2366, No. 2370, and No. 2374].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Enclosed, he sends back the documents transmitted with the first letter of March 2 [No. 2366] with thanks. These show how [Mehmed Yahya] Pasha, in the manner of [Nebuzaradan], justifies the punishment of the pseudo-Christians carried out by God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- What Blarer reported about the Council [of Trent] and the [Second Regensburg Religious Discussion] shows that nothing can be expected from it. Such meetings only serve to suppress the truth and to increase the greed of the Antichrist.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The butchers delivered Blarer's letter of January 28 [No. 2335] as well as the accompanying attachment with excerpts from a letter written from Frankfurt [by Thomas Blarer] with news about [Frederick II of the] Palatinate, the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied], the Hungarians who arrived in Wittenberg, and Luther's writing [„To the Electors“] against the release of [Duke Henry of Brunswick].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- In the letter of March 6 [No. 2370], Blarer regretted not having properly taken care of [Johannes] Wolf. However, he praised the hospitality of the people of Constance and especially Blarer, for which Bullinger thanks him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger does not want to bother the very busy [Thomas Blarer] with his curiosity; perhaps Blarer can, despite his numerous obligations, share the most important [about the Frankfurt Diet].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [Konrad] Hofherr has not entrusted the money received from [Hans Peter von] Wellenberg to either [Theodor] Bibliander or Bullinger. He will soon have to give an account. However, Bullinger does not want to be burdened [with the management of Hofherr's money]. Bibliander, whom Hofherr probably respects, should take on this task, especially since he is less occupied. Bullinger is, however, ready to assist Bibliander. Blarer should inform him of this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Bullinger expects the return of his writing [„De sacramentis“] as well as Blarer's opinion on whether it is worthy of publication or not.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Allegedly, the interrupted [Second Regensburg] Religious Discussion was resumed through Bucer's zeal, which does not surprise Bullinger, especially since he knows well that [Bucer] has always encouraged such discussions. However, these are [costly and time] consuming and endanger the truth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Bullinger is inclined to believe that [Charles V] is planning war. If only he would meet a similar fate as once befell his ancestor [Charles the Bold], about which Bullinger wrote to Blarer earlier [not received]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- [In Zurich] there is a rumor that the Emperor has convened the Diet at Regensburg to prevent the extension of the [Schmalkaldic] League and to impose the decisions of the Council of Trent on everyone. Should the [Germans] refuse, he plans to attack Germany with Spaniards, Italians, Sicilians, Portuguese, and Austrians. But God lives, and the Germans should trust Him instead of believing the letters from [Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle, [Louis de Flandre, Lord] of Praet, and [Johann von] Naves! "The Emperor possesses [fast] ships [wordplay with Naves] and large sails [wordplay with Granvelle]. But through such advisors, the empire is ruined."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- As soon as Blarer learns of any news, he should share it, just as Bullinger would do. After all, everyone is in the same boat.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Blarer's letter of March 9 [No. 2374] contained [Hans] Welser's letter [No. 2369], which, as Blarer correctly suspected, reported on the machinations of Pope [Paul III]. The letter also contained the news of Luther's death and expressed hope for the restoration of the pure doctrine of the Lord's Supper.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- However, for this to happen, Bucer (who will now intervene even more in the Lord's Supper dispute) would also have to die!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Greetings to [Sebastian Gaisberg], [Konrad] Zwick, and [Jakob] Funcklin.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have three letters from you, most esteemed brother in the Lord, to which I now respond in order.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The first was dated March 2; I return the documents shared with me and give thanks. In them, it seems most excellent that [Mehmed Yahya] Pasha, in the manner of [Nebuzaradan], justifies God's judgments on the pseudo-Christians.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>What you sent about the council and the colloquy outlines what kind of fruit is to be expected from both: none. For all those institutions are established so that the truth may be oppressed or obscured by them, and so that the desires of the Antichristians may still have some power, indeed, may reign. I trust nothing to these men, whom I find to be utterly devoid of faith. The Lord says in the Gospel: "How can you believe, who seek glory from one another?" [John 5:44], etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You wrote on January 28 through the butchers. You ask whether I received it; I did. It contained some transcripts from your brother's letters sent from Frankfurt about the Palatinate, the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied], the Hungarians who finally went to Wittenberg, and Luther's booklet written to the princes about not releasing the Duke of Brunswick. Therefore, be assured and at peace; nothing was lost due to the butchers' negligence.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>You sent the latter on March 6. However much you complain that [Johannes] Wolf is treated, as they say, negligently, he nevertheless praises your services and especially your humanity greatly; for which I give you the greatest thanks.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I do not wish to burden your dearest brother, my most esteemed lord, with my curiosity. I know he is otherwise pressed with many affairs. However, you could outline the most important points for me on some paper, although I am not unaware that you too are distracted and vexed by various ecclesiastical, political, and domestic affairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>[Konrad] Hofherr has given neither Theodor nor me any money. As far as I understand, he has dispensed or consumed what he received from [Hans Peter von] Wellenberg at his own discretion. Therefore, he will be summoned by us in these days to give us an account.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8">
      <p>Therefore, in the next letters, we will write carefully about how his affairs stand. However, as you order his money to be given to me, I beg you not to burden me with that trouble. D. Theodor is indeed very busy with the study of letters, but he is not so caught up and whirled around by public and domestic affairs as I am. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to entrust that task to him. He indeed thinks his authority with Hofherr is quite low. But I know he is mistaken. Moreover, I will gladly join my efforts with his, wherever he thinks it necessary. Therefore, I beg you by the Lord, do not impose a new burden on him who is already more than sufficiently burdened. You can conveniently inform D. Theodor of this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I expect my book, but more eagerly your judgment, and that freely, whether it should be published or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest9">
      <p>There are those who claim that the colloquy, once indeed suspended, has been restored anew through Bucer's diligence (I would gladly say otherwise). And this also seems likely to me, since I know that all those colloquies that have been instituted so far flow from this source, partly with no fruit, but with the greatest expenses, partly with much loss and danger to the truth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest10">
      <p>It very easily finds belief with me that the emperor is planning new battles. If only it would happen to him as it did to his grandfather Charles the Bold, about whom you remember what I once wrote! But our sins are great, yet the mercy of the Lord is greater. Perhaps it will be useful for this rust to be purged by fire, which no preaching can cleanse. I see that we must be vigilant and pray.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest11">
      <p>There is a rumor among us that the emperor has suddenly convened the Diet at Regensburg, in which he will try to disturb the extension of the league and urge the conclusion of the council's decision, so that all may submit to him. If you refuse, he will have Germany itself as an enemy. Therefore, he will lead against you Spaniards, Italians, Sicilians, Portuguese, Austrians, and those nations listed in his title. Thus some threaten. However, He lives who said: "He who touches you, touches the apple of my eye" [Zechariah 2:8 (Vulgate)]. Therefore, be steadfast and strong in the Lord our God, and do not easily believe the letters of Granvelle and other courtiers, Prattensis and Navensis!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13">
      <p>The Emperor has fast ships and large sails. Through these advisors, the empire is sinking.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I beg you by our common friendship, that whatever certain information you learn about the colloquy, whether restored or dissolved, and whatever certain information you receive about the emperor's efforts and the Diet at Regensburg, you promptly inform me. This is not curiosity. For we sail in the same ship. Nor doubt my faith; if I learn anything that it would be useful for you to know, I will use it in good faith.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Your last letter dated March 9 contained nothing else but the enclosed letter from D. Welser. You rightly guessed that D. Welser would write to me about the pope's efforts; for so it is. He indicates that serious and clandestine plans are being made among the enemies against us. May the Lord protect us. He added that Luther migrated to the Lord on February 17, which he does not rashly believe will greatly contribute to the restoration and preservation of the purity of the doctrine of the Eucharist.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Indeed, I would begin to hope better if Bucer were also called by the Lord. For there is no one alive today who opens more hope to the papists and disputes more obscurely about the Lord's Supper than Bucer himself. Nor can I hope that he will change his opinion for the third time. But truth will ultimately prevail, however diligent, wicked, industrious, cunning, talkative, diligent, persistent, and insuperable men may seem. This is certain: If Luther is dead, Bucer will immerse himself more deeply in compositions, who until now miserably feared Luther in this matter. But you know more about these things than I do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Now farewell and always love me. Greet the most illustrious men, D. Consul and Zwick, Funcklin, and the rest. March 11, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. Ambrosius Blarer, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Constance, his brother in the Lord, far dearest.</p>
