      <p> Greetings. Honorable lord and father, you will learn about our situation here from the lord treasurer. Chur, along with other communities, has agreed to the proposed measures. However, a large part of the church has complained about them and does not consider the matter to be good. The unorthodox actions of the church cannot be justified in all respects, but I can say that if one were to clarify one or the other article more thoroughly while keeping the substance the same, one would already be at peace. Therefore, I did not wish in vain for Mr. de Cham. For Chamlius had no favor among them; they accused him of being too strict. But whatever it is: sins are committed both inside and outside the walls of Troy. If one approaches the matter with friendliness, not with defiance and boasting, as Mr. Treasurer Hans Lux Ã„scher, who is otherwise a man of such character, and, as I suspect, will help advise in this direction, then there is good hope for unity. Reasonable measures are always better than war and deprivation. I am entirely inclined to help and advise towards unity. If I were with you, I would say more, wherever it pleases. This is written in haste. You and yours, farewell most happily. </p>
      <p> Chur, June 25, 1566. </p>
      <p> Yours, Fabricius. </p>
