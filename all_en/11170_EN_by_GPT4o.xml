      <p>Greetings. Regarding friendship, my dear Bullinger, it is well; it is strengthened by the most excellent pledge, faith in Jesus Christ; as long as we worship Him, our Savior and God, with true spirit, as you say, the friendship once established between us will never be broken. Therefore, let us bind all the good men there in this bond of union and friendship as closely as possible, so that the more excellent the good of this charity and the holiness of Christian fellowship, the more common it may indeed be. Certainly, even if I do not write to each one of them, I still strive to embrace each one as much as possible.</p>
      <p>I greatly rejoice over the success of the concord. I indeed hope that the most excellent foundations have been laid, as we are drawn closer in spirit and now offer less to suspicions. Satan will be defeated if the fierce tumult in the church can be peacefully settled. We will soon see the deceit of the impostor Satan, by which our cruel enemy, not the matter itself, has so horribly set us against each other. There will be no doubt about our people; they will bring the matter to completion. I am very glad that the young man has been freed and restored. May the Lord Christ truly unite us, having been solidly led into the most luminous truth of such a great mystery.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>I earnestly pray that you will diligently convey my greetings to all the brothers. I also earnestly ask you to often and repeatedly exhort Megander. Let us not think that anyone should be alien to us, whoever professes Christ with us according to the gospel. The Zwinglians and Lutherans are all brothers, who boast in the same blood of Christ alone. May Satan perish, may useless quarrels perish. It is fitting for us to do and strive for everything for the glory of Christ, for the destruction, for the ruin of the Antichrist. Therefore, let us turn all alienation of mind towards the detestable crowd of Antichrists and, with the faithful forces united, let us liberate those captured under the tyranny of these with dire chains. Amen.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell, dearest and sweetest brother. Your Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest friend and brother. Zurich.</p>
