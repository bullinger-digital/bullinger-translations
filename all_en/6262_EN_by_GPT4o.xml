      <p>Two honest men have been sent to the next Swiss assembly by the church of Lipperswil, one of whom is here, a pious man burning with great zeal for promoting the truth of the Gospel.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I wish to ask you, my most esteemed relative, again and again, to hold the aforementioned church and its business, which he will report to you here, in the highest regard.</p>
      <p>By common vote... the church of Lipperswil decided not to accept any preacher unless examined and admitted by the leaders of the church of ZÃ¼rich, who bears testimony of a life worthy of a minister of the Gospel, and who moreover does not allow anything to be deducted from the old stipend by the donor of his position. Such a decree they obtained from the Swiss at this assembly. All of which this good man will narrate to you in more detail, of whose faith you should not doubt; for our consul (if he has returned from the assembly) will bear the same testimony, from which you will understand everything more correctly. Victor Fabritius will also report to you what he is attempting, so that I do not wish to trouble you, my most esteemed relative, who are very busy, with more details.</p>
      <p>I ask you to consider these things with your usual kindness and fairness. My mother sends her best regards to you and your wife along with the whole family.</p>
      <p>In haste, Gachnang, September 4, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Herter.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his always venerable father and patron.</p>
