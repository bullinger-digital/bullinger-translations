<letter xml:id="file13058"><summary><p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Myconius learned that if the Swiss Confederates and King Henry II of France were to protect the people of Strasbourg, the latter would not grant Emperor Charles V winter quarters, as they are well aware of the life-threatening danger associated with such an accommodation. Myconius has discussed this confidentially with the Basel Secret Councilors. They believe that the people of Strasbourg should ask the King to urge the Confederates to form an alliance with Strasbourg. For if the [Protestant] cities of the Confederation were to request this from the other Nine Places, they would be suspected, as so often in the past, of thinking only of their own advantage and not of the common good. Bullinger should discuss this only with councilors who can keep secrets, and otherwise remain silent. It is important to find out whether a protective alliance in partnership with France in favor of Strasbourg is conceivable among the Confederates, and to report this in due time. If the Emperor were to settle in the [Strasbourg] nest, it can be assumed that he will cause difficulties for the Confederates, even destroy them. This is confidential. </p><p xml:id="regest2"> [2] The nobleman [Heinrich von] Ostheim reported upon his return from Zurich that the Five Places are angry about the Emperor's tricks. Is that true? </p><p xml:id="regest3"> [3] A citizen of Basel who returned from Antwerp [...] assures that Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Buren, has been defeated, and it is said that he was killed by a bullet. </p><p xml:id="regest4"> [4] Even in Augsburg, the mercenaries complain about being inadequately paid. Johannes Haller wrote a short but substantial letter these days. It shows that where the Emperor is, all hell breaks loose. In Augsburg, his troops behave (not to mention the priests) even worse than the inhabitants of Sodom! If the Confederates want to be spared, fear of God and caution are required. The Emperor's expressions of friendship towards them serve only to deceive. Once calmed, the Emperor will attack them, just as he did with the Swabians during the last cold season. He pursues his goal with deceit and trickery. Beware of him! </p><p xml:id="regest5"> [5] The plague has broken out in Basel. Bullinger should pray! </p><p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Greetings. </p></summary><body><div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1"><p>S. I have learned that if the Swiss Confederates, together with the French King, were to take the people of Strasbourg under their protection, they would not allow the Emperor to have winter quarters. They know that if they do so, it would be disastrous for them. I have secretly discussed the matter with our councilors who handle confidential matters and found a very suitable response, namely, that if they urge the King to refer the matter to the Confederates, it would be more effective. For until now, whatever the evangelical cities have referred to the others in such matters has been suspected of being self-serving rather than for the common good. I am sharing this advice so that you can handle everything more correctly with your people, to whom secrets can be safely disclosed. If you do not find such people, it would be safer to remain silent. Therefore, I want you to secretly inquire whether any hope of defense together with the French can be expected, and then report back in time. It is certain that if the Emperor occupies that nest, he will cause us trouble, if not completely destroy us. This is for your innermost circle and those to whom you entrust the matter.</p></div><div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2"><p>A nobleman from your area, Ostheimer, has returned home and reported the anger of the Five Places against the Emperor's tricks. Please indicate what the matter is.</p></div><div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3"><p>A citizen of ours returned from Antwerp and certainly announced the defeat of Buren, adding the rumor that he perished by a bullet; he does not assert otherwise.</p></div><div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4"><p>The mercenaries complain that no money is being paid to them, which is also happening in Augsburg. Haller wrote briefly but extensively these days. Indeed, I see that where the Emperor is, there is also hell. It seems that in Sodom, things were not as disgracefully conducted as they are in Augsburg by soldiers of all kinds, not to mention the priests. Our Swiss need the fear of the Lord and great prudence if they want to remain unharmed. The Emperor seeks friendship only to deceive. He delays and makes us feel secure, only to crush and oppress us unprepared, as he did with the Swabians during the winter. He is full of deceit and trickery, and he mocks us until he achieves his goal. Let us beware in the Lord!</p></div><div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5"><p>The plague has come to us. Pray for us!</p></div><div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6"><p>Farewell in Christ with your people, etc. Basel, September 10, 1547. Yours, Os. Myc.</p><p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most excellent man, the best minister of Christ, his venerable lord in Christ.
