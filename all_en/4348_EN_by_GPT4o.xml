      <p>Greetings and best wishes. We give you, most esteemed lord and compater (godfather), our greatest thanks both for your favorable prayers, which we pray to have the same success from the Lord as they sound, and for deeming us worthy to be reminded of so many and such great matters, in which we can certainly achieve nothing or very little. We pray to the Lord that He may not fail His cause, which is the cause of truth, and that He may help with happy success, which pertains to His glory and the salvation of many. The news you shared, we have explained first of all to our lords, and then also, as you instructed, to Lord Nikolaus and Emanuel.</p>
      <p>They give you great thanks and wish you much health, and Lord Nikolaus further advises that you continue to be to the Bernese as you have been so far and consider the common cause to be treated on both sides. And to encourage you, he certainly advises that he has learned many things in such a way that he has them word for word and to the letter, just as you have communicated many things in your letters to him and others, about which, if the Lord wills, we will speak in person. What has been done in the assemblies so far, you have already known more certainly from previous reports. The matter of the Glarus people is proceeding slowly; a day has finally been named by those five Cantons for October 2nd, the third day after Michaelmas; an earlier day could not be obtained, nor could it be obtained that the remaining seven Cantons would agree to send their delegations on that very day, although they requested it. For the delegates of the Pagans objected that they could not promise this, because they had no mandate for it. Therefore, they are instructed to promptly inform their people of this request and to respond in time to the consuls and magistrates of Zurich, unless perhaps another assembly intervenes shortly. A serious mandate was also given by the remaining seven Cantons that they should not presume anything beyond the law before the day or on the very day and at the appointed time of the transaction or afterwards, with a sufficiently clear indication of their will, which they could easily observe. The matter is now placed in that position.</p>
      <p>There is news from the French about a council, and many think that the former royal orator S. Laurentianus, whom you know, after being heard by our people, is going to Vienna to Emperor Ferdinand, perhaps not without reason. The Savoyards are asking for the same alliance as before and are secretly spreading money, which they have obtained, with a certain report; they are believed to want to buy what cannot be obtained by request. You may hear shortly what was written to the Valaisians.</p>
      <p>I will tell you in person what that new Glarus Hessian has accomplished here. I wish for better things.</p>
      <p>My brother writes that the Bernese are not failing in their duty in the Valaisian matter; meanwhile, the others spare nothing and do not rest. May the Lord be present for His cause.</p>
      <p>I showed Lord Nikolaus both the protestation and the response; he had them before, nevertheless, he gave great thanks. I, in turn, give great thanks for these and these conclusions, but first, having shown them to the people of St. Gallen, I return them. The matter of Sebach is referred to the recesses.</p>
      <p>Our lords' delegates, as I have from the report of others, have done much for their duty and courage with an excellent invective against that former proconsul of Uri. As for our private matters, by the grace of the Lord, we are all well with all our people. We pray to the Lord to continue to grant the same.</p>
      <p>Wikius and Funkius remain safe so far, although they surpass me in washing hours; I, however, although I do not exceed five hours of washing each day, have now contracted a somewhat cauterized skin without thirst and any symptoms, praise be to the Lord. We all expect a happy outcome from the best and greatest Lord.</p>
      <p>I had written these things a little earlier, but since the messenger I wished for was lacking, I was not yet compelled to send them. Today, a new assembly was announced after the feast of Verena; as I perhaps not falsely conjecture, it seems to be for the cause of the Glarus people, so that those who are more favorable to this cause can conveniently meet. Today also, a certain pamphlet against the mass without the name of the author and place was objected to us in Zurich (as the Lucerne people proposed with a sent copy), to which they objected many things with a beautiful purgation, as you will learn from the lords' delegates along with some other things objected against Tobias Eglin of Gynopedia. Thus, those who are not at all touched by the care of true religion never strive for the peace of religious matters. May the Lord open their minds and make them at some point affected by the care of true as well as now false religion, as we all wish, briefly. These things hastily, most esteemed lord and compater, which I ask you to consider with fairness and goodness as my hands are now constituted. We wish all of you, beloved lords and brothers, Lord Martyr, Lord Gwalther, Bibliander, Wolphius, dear compater and brothers also Lord Lavater, Zwingli, Josiah, with our Lord Gesner and all the rest, to be safe. My mother with my wife and daughters greet you with your wife.</p>
      <p>Hastily at the Baths of the Swiss on the morning of July 13th. Farewell, most esteemed lord and father, with all yours.</p>
      <p>Our leaders departed sadly and furiously with no money brought as they had hoped. Your most observant and esteemed Wolfgang Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most to be observed and esteemed lord and compater. In Zurich.</p>
