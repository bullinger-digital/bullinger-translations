      <p>Greetings. Stapfer, who is about to come to you, requested my testimony about himself due to some accuser, who accused him to you, as your letter indicates, quite insultingly. I speak truthfully, as far as he is known to me and as I hear from the people of Zurich who are with us, he is an innocent and studious boy. I do not know who would complain about him; I know those who praise him for his character and studies.</p>
      <p>From conversation, you will discover how youthful he is and how much he has progressed in his studies for his age. Once misled by the French, I do not say he drank too much, but he returned the wine seasoned with salt through vomiting; however, thereafter he avoided both wine and the French. If anything of this perhaps reached you, believe it happened as I say, unless the witnesses lie, who freely confessed this to me. He has been with Hospinian, the head of our college and recently appointed head of the Pedagogium of the preachers, for about six weeks now; he testifies all good things about the boy. If he could remain with him, it would certainly be beneficial for him in an uncommon way; for he is such that the lords and the academy and the senate have already called him to both aforementioned duties with prayers and promises.</p>
      <p>If he were my son, I would not want another father for him in letters and morals. The boy is hurt that you met him more harshly; therefore, there was no rest until his plan to approach you, approved by others, was carried out so that he could defend himself in person. I would like you to have him recommended, especially as an orphan, so that he does not lose heart. There is hope that he will become the kind of person you can wish for.</p>
      <p>Beware of forcing him to return to the one he left; he will tell you the reasons himself. This to you; for if that irritable head were to learn something like this about me, our church would be in a worse state. I love peace, therefore I am forced to swallow many things that are quite bitter. However, in the meantime, I have thus preserved health in the heads of the church.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me. May your whole family and Mr. Pellicanus be safe. Basel, January 17, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most worthy Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most venerable lord of Zurich.</p>
