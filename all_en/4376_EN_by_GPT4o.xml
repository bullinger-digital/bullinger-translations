      <p>Greetings. I can add nothing now to what I wrote yesterday through your chief scribe.</p>
      <p>He finally departed today.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I received your letters sent through Tumisius.</p>
      <p>Their case was heard today, but nothing has been decided yet. The witnesses will be heard tomorrow.</p>
      <p>I fear that the young man may have committed himself too eloquently. However, nothing will be done except what is fair and just, and what our laws can support.</p>
      <p>You will hear the outcome from them.</p>
      <p>I am sending these letters through them, which were handed to me by Ludwig Zehender and Frisching; I could not send them through safer messengers.</p>
      <p>If you receive anything more in the meantime, I wish to know. Farewell.</p>
      <p>All our friends greet you, especially your and my Zehenders. Bern, August 2, 1560. I will depart for Lausanne next Monday or Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
