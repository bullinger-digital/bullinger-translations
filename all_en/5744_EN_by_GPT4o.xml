      <p>S. Before we came to Heidelberg, most esteemed father and revered lord, your most extensive letters had already been delivered there along with a bundle full of matters concerning the church and those serving us. And above all, we should express our gratitude to you in the most extensive words for your outstanding goodwill towards the poor Polish churches, if we did not already have a thousand proofs that you do not require such expressions of gratitude, nor could we, even if we wished to attempt it, achieve it with words. Therefore, God, for whose glory you endure so many troubles and labors, will reward you, His holy servant, with full recompense and will make you receive the unfading crown, which He promised to those who love Him so greatly. As for your private letters addressed to us, know that we read them with the greatest joy, from which we perceived traces of your paternal goodwill towards us and testified to our gratitude with tears, which arise from the fact that your benefits clearly surpass all our praise. But my father, may that heavenly Father preserve you with your whole family and confirm in your heart that you believe and are convinced that we are and will be, as long as we live, most grateful; if God grants us to demonstrate this by some means, it will make us blessed and happy in this matter. In Heidelberg, we encountered the Landgrave prince, who was returning from the Duke of Württemberg, but there was such inconvenience that it was not possible to speak with your son Christoph due to his occupations. However, we saw him standing at the table and serving the prince, safe and sound. The difficulty in meeting was that the prince was preparing for a sudden departure, which indeed was to happen the day before, if not for the intervention of Lady de Roya, whom he awaited for a whole day and, after having a conversation for several hours, departed around midnight. The Palatine prince accompanied her with the utmost humanity and kindness. We indeed perceived the clemency of such a great prince, which you used to praise constantly and wished everyone to have the best hopes for him, and not without reason: I have never seen a more benevolent prince. As for the news, it is certain from France, for yesterday Lady de Roya received letters that the Parisians have accepted the conditions of peace and have paid the soldiers five months' wages. The German soldiers are in Lorraine, eating and drinking on the properties of the Guises, consuming whatever there is, and even distributing food to the poor. You there, I do not doubt, have more certain information. We, henceforth, unless we hope to hear nothing from you, our most gracious lords, and we ask that if you ever wish to send us anything or if any letters pertaining to me have been delivered into your hands, you send them to Heidelberg to the house of Xylander to a certain Pole, Johann Laski, who will ensure they are delivered to us. Furthermore, here in Heidelberg are the sons of our count from Ostroróg, about whose father and his piety and love for the church of God you have undoubtedly heard from me and many others. For he is a man who defends and promotes the glory of Christ in our kingdom so that no one in those regions is found who holds more important roles in promoting the kingdom of God. The sons, not unlike their father, are endowed with uncommon piety, modesty, and all virtues, especially devoted to you, so that the elder (who is about 20 years old) declared himself inflamed by the preaching of your piety and other holy virtues, so that he could no longer restrain himself from writing to you. I hope you will treat them with the same humanity, should they ever come to you, as you are accustomed to with all others. In the meantime, if you write back to him, you will, as I see, bestow a great favor upon him. Furthermore, I ask you, my most esteemed father, that you write to Lord Jonville on my behalf, if it is not possible to write to Mr. Calvin, since their letters were delivered to me at my departure, to which I could not reply and express my gratitude. However, I promise to write diligently from the journey, once I reach either Marburg or Leipzig. For I am truly so occupied that, having attempted it several times, I could not accomplish it. Above all, I wish to be excused to the most illustrious men, Lord Josias Simler, Lavater, Wolphius, Gesner, and Haler, to whom I could not respond from Heidelberg. Their inclination and goodwill towards me are so great that I could not escape the mark of ingratitude if I did not express my thanks in Marburg for their benefits towards me. But what can I say? Zurich is for me the exemplar of all kindness. I will also make every effort at some point that Lord Josias will never regret having undertaken such labor for us, especially for me. In the meantime, I wish all my most esteemed lords, your most prudent wife, sons, daughters, and the whole family to be well in God, the best and greatest.</p>
      <p>Given in Heidelberg, May 24, 1563.</p>
      <p>The theological faculty of Heidelberg is very occupied in writing an apology against the calumnies of the enemies of Christ. They have also issued a brief writing to the Polish churches on the matter of the Gentiles. I ask that your excellence at some point indicates in your letters whether you have received our letters sent from Basel along with the book of our Orichovius, which I had sent. Most devoted and respectful to you, Christophorus Thretius. I wrote this hastily at the very moment of departure; our boys are being transported most comfortably by carriage... to the most esteemed and pious man... to the man Lord Heinrich [Bullinger], servant of Jesus Christ,... [T]he vigilant bishop of the [T]igurine church, lord and [most esteemed].</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
