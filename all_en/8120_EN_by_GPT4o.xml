      <p>Gracious lords, we are mindful of the matter that is ongoing between the old master Hans Muralto, physician and citizen of Zurich, and Philip Douada, resident of Lugano, concerning a field that Master Hans sold to Gotthard von Abundio from Schona, also residing in Lugano, where Master Hans reopened the case in Baden to exercise the right against Philipp Douada and to complete the sale of the field to the aforementioned von Abundio.</p>
      <p>Master Hans has conducted some legal proceedings in Lugano before the bailiff, Lord Walther Kr√§psinger of Lucerne, who has given the verdict in favor of Master Hans against the aforementioned Douada.</p>
      <p>However, Douada has taken it to Baden in the Aargau, etc., because in the decision of the lords of the Confederation issued last year in September, it was recognized that the party dissatisfied with the bailiff's judgment should appeal their case and concerns again to the Confederation in Baden. Here, Master Hans humbly requests, my gracious lords, that the envoys appointed for the day in Baden will assist Master Hans so that he may remain with the given judgment from the bailiff, and also receive costs and damages from his adversary, and not be forced by the power of his opponent from his right and verdict. He is willing to acknowledge and earn, where possible, with all loyalty.</p>
