    <p xml:id="regest1">The long silence [of the Bernese] does not correspond to any negligence or ingratitude, but rather to the effort to avoid the suspicion of partiality or a cunning effort to overthrow the opposing party; [the Bernese] also know that [the Zurichers] are informed about their situation, among others by Andreas Rappenstein. They received Luther's [“Short Confession”] from [the Zurichers]; it is being read by many significant people; now it is heard that even the opponents already have it; they defend it when questioned about it; they claim it is not so coarse, even if they did not want to speak that way; Luther's rods are thus musk for them; like Jews [they are not] affected by [Luther's curses] in his “Pig Book”! It would be desirable for [the Zurichers] to present to the [Bernese in a letter] how cunningly one has dealt under the guise of a concord [with the Confederates], and how clearly one now sees from Luther's [writing] what “the something more” [in the symbols of the Lord's Supper] means; no one should be able to hide behind the pretext of ignorance. Should the [Zurichers not write such a letter], the [opponents] will persuade many by relativizing [Luther's writing], and calm many by admitting that in [Bern] one should not speak so coarsely; as soon as this is conceded, people believe that [the opponents] agree with the [Bernese] Disputation [of 1528], and that the dissenting voices are merely expressions of the old quarrel, which one is so fed up with; [Bullinger's letter would be all the more desirable], as not everyone will immediately read or understand his response [to Luther’s writing]; the [Bernese] - as already evident [in 1538] towards Bucer and again on December 5, 1544 - do not want to deviate from their Disputation. May God help [the Zurichers] to defend His truth. The sent copy [of Luther's writing] is still kept by [the Bernese], so that it can be read further, perhaps even more effectively with the addition of the [requested letter]; such an evil spirit [as in Luther's writing] can only be expelled with seriousness and courage. [In his response to Luther] Bullinger should not forget the seven [evil] spirits “In, under, and with [the bread] is my body”! Regarding the Marburg Colloquy, Bucer's dedicatory letter at the beginning of his commentary on the Gospel of Matthew should be consulted.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Dear and gracious lords and brothers, if our silence were due to negligence, it would not only be surprising but also deserving of great reproach, especially from you, whose help we not only feel through your constant prayers to God for us but also through your active support, which we gratefully acknowledge with the promise of reciprocation as far as our abilities allow. However, we do not wish to conceal from you the reason for our prolonged silence, which is this: We strive to the utmost to dispel any suspicion of partisanship and intrigue from us, so that we do not fall into the mouth of the slanderer, as if we were trying to overthrow our opponents with cunning, but rather that everyone may perceive in us a simple, upright truth.</p>
      <p>And we are well aware that, just as you diligently watch over us and our church (for the Lord's sake), there are also pious people who inform you of our well-being, especially when brother Andreas Rappenstein was with us and intended to come to you, etc. Therefore, we ask you not to diminish your diligence towards us in writing and active support, but to increase it, even if we do not always respond, as much of our silence occurs, as mentioned now.</p>
      <p>We have received Luther's little book from you and hope for great benefit; for it is read with great eagerness and seriousness by many lords and honorable people. Meanwhile, it is now heard that our adversaries already have it. They can indeed dismiss it when they are accused by certain individuals of such shameless audacity of Luther; and they say it is not so coarse, even if they did not want to speak that way, etc. In short, what smells of Luther's rods is musk to his disciples and teachers, just as the Jews are not affected by the pig filth in Luther's pig book.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we would like to encourage you, if you are not otherwise so heavily burdened with business now, to also present to our gracious lords and citizens collectively the unfaithfulness in writing, which has been practiced with us for so long under the guise of a concord, that Luther is of one mind with us in understanding; that our resistance is nothing but a quarrel and a dispute of words; likewise, in the sacrament, not only is the spiritual eating, which is faith, required: there is something more; etc.; that one may see once how Luther has spat out this 'something more' here, and not only here, but in his great confession and many children's reports; that the learned may not escape with any pretext as ignorant of Luther's matter, as it has been defended so far with suppression of the truth and to our great detriment.</p>
      <p>For if this does not happen from you, it is to be feared that they (the opponents) will still be able to persuade pious people, as if it were not so bad, even if in our church it is not so coarse to speak. For as soon as they exclude the coarse way in their speech, the common man turns, it is now a spiritual eating and consequently only faith, also thus according to the word of God and the held Disputation; that, when we speak against it, it is considered to happen out of temptation and old quarrel; so much is a church in Bern tired and weary of the quarrel after so many years! So not everyone can immediately read your future response and even less understand it, as unfortunately many simple, I mean ignorant people are everywhere, and especially where the truth comes into a span. But if the matter were presented in short points and such gathered together, it would happen joyfully with great fruit, since also in Zurich in Bucer's presence the messenger from Bern answered: "Our lords do not want to deviate a finger's breadth from their Disputation"; as they also now, lastly on December 5, 1544, have again laid out and recognized our span, as you will find here, etc.</p>
      <p>Finally, we wish you divine help and support to defend the truth effectively against the gross audacity that Luther practices. It is not our place to show you the way and order, but to make earnest intercession to the Lord for you, that you may write according to His holy word and honor, for those who will read your response, that they may bring their minds to the aforementioned word and honor, etc. We will diligently send back to you the copy you sent us after the appointed time; we must still let it be read further, in case God might grant grace, that our gracious lords may especially notice from you with the writing of the false report that they may read it from the preceding, to better notice it; for without great seriousness and courage, this Satan (transformed into an angel of light) will not be driven out.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, December 29, 1544.</p>
      <p>Jo. Wäber, in both our names.</p>
      <p>Not forgetting the seven spirits: That 'In, under, with the is my body' etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Marburg Colloquy, Bucer is a peculiar witness in the dedicatory letter to the Marburg Academy, etc., at the beginning of the Explanations on the Gospel of Matthew.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful and vigilant ministers of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger and Caspar Megander, brothers in Christ most beloved in Zurich from the sacred sermons.</p>
