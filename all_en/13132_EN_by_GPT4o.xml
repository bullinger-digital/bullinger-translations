    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is reported both orally and in writing by reputable and well-informed people that Emperor Charles V (should he remain alive until spring) will definitely punish the Swiss Confederates and attack from several places.

      <p>At this moment, among other things, I receive this news from a very pious, zealous man, with these words:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>“I cannot withhold from you that it is spoken and written by reputable people, who are considered knowledgeable, that it should not be doubted, and one should prepare accordingly, that if His Imperial Majesty survives the spring, His Majesty will certainly undertake to punish the Swiss Confederates and attack them not in one or two, but in several places. And even now, the practice is being made that they themselves should be disunited and divided among each other.”</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Know that your writings from Seidensticker and the money have been received. I express my diligent thanks to you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Dear friend, let me know what my cousin recently replied to you regarding your conversation, about which I have written to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Also, the innkeeper at your place is said to have a brother-in-law who knows a very certain remedy for fever. I would like you to find out and write it down for me in due time.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>God be with you and yours forever. Amen. Dated at one o'clock, the 23rd of November.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
