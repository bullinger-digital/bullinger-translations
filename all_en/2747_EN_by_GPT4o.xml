      <p>Greetings, most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger. I am sending a special messenger there, specifically to inquire where in the world Mr. Gribaldo is staying, and I am writing to Lelio to send another further. It is strange where he has been lingering for so long. This, therefore, is the occasion for my writing now.</p>
      <p>I am doing well; I have completed the Slavic matters. I returned to the court, but soon I will return to the printing house. For I have translated Mr. Brentius's book, and the prince's orders will begin to groan under the press within 15 days. It seems very harsh to me; but I have mitigated it much by translating (if it is worthy of belief), truly I have added oil to the fire. The recess of the assemblies has been made and others have been announced for the first of March in Regensburg. As you possess, so may you possess, this in summary has brought forth for us what I have always hoped and written.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is compelled to go to Spain; may he go for a good purpose. Our Laski is very anxious about mending the concord on the article of the Eucharist; he leaves no stone unturned; he wrote to me very diligently recently. But he will achieve nothing, which I pronounce not without great pain of mind. I am here as if on a certain watchtower, I perceive many things that others cannot. I commend the cause to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Georg Morhard, who was with me in ZÃ¼rich, gave a crown in Frankfurt to Matthias Apiarius, the Bernese printer, for a certain image and asked him to send it to you as soon as possible (for so I had instructed). If it has been sent, I would like you to give it to this messenger to bring to me; if it has not yet been sent, I beg and implore you, as soon as it is sent, ensure it is sent to me. If you wish to have some there, I fully agree. The Pope gives birth to a harlot in a procession, that is, in a very elegant image. I suppose you have heard what is happening in Rome now; for he disturbs everything with war, poison, perjuries, etc. These are papal fruits.</p>
      <p>I bid greetings to the three noblemen, Mr. Gwalter and the other brothers. The Duke of Prussia has begun to act manfully and no longer wishes to endure the Osiandrists. Melanchthon was in Nuremberg for that reason. Good God, we fight among ourselves, as if we lack enemies; what negligence or perverse judgment.</p>
      <p>Stuttgart, 8th October 1555.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
