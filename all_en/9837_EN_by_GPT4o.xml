      <p>Venerable lord and father in Christ, I humbly desire to know from your reverence, since the matter now concerns you individually as well as previously the people of Heidelberg, whether you would allow my previously sent confession and response to be printed with you according to your given promise. As you wrote to me, occasione oblata it shall happen, eam vero iam plenissimam esse puto, so I will send it again to your reverence or, if upon your correction at least this time the sent booklets alone for the edification of my church might be printed as soon as possible. Years ago, you assisted B. Funken in a similar manner, who now so shamefully denies, suppresses, and persecutes the truth; so I hope that I have deserved the same and better than he, Funken, for the truth. What I write, I draw either from the sources of Holy Scripture or from the authority of the holy fathers, or they are entirely my own; I transcribe nothing from others, not even the least. God is my witness, and those who are at my side testify.</p>
      <p>Yours, Eusebius Kleber.</p>
      <p>To the venerable lord Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his beloved father in holy Christ.</p>
