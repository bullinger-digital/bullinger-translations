      <p>Greetings. A few days ago, I sent you, most illustrious man, a letter when the Englishman, whom I recommended to you, was departing for your place. And now, so as not to abandon the most beautiful and truly Christian duty, I am compelled to write again, to gratify this servant of God, also an Englishman and a very necessary member of the English church, in the most honorable matter. So that you are not unaware, when the doctrine of the gospel flourished in Britain under King Edward, he labored with the greatest industry and diligence for a long time, so that the studies of young men, whose resources were limited, might grow and be nurtured both at Oxford and Cambridge, so that later the church would not lack learned men, whose work could be used in sacred ministry, and his tireless labors happily progressed to this end. But now, when almost everything in that kingdom is overturned, although he cannot pursue his institution there, he is not so broken in spirit as to want to desist from his undertaking. Therefore, he gathered from such a shipwreck twelve or thirteen, whom he found not only to excel in uncommon learning but also to burn with a great desire for purer religion, and he decided to support them in Germany during this difficult time, like another Obadiah, as long as God allows Ahab and Jezebel to rage unholy at their pleasure. Pious merchants assist these efforts, who provide alms to be spent on their sustenance. For they easily see that it may happen that after these ruins, the English church will be restored. Therefore, they would like to have these reserves, whom they could send into the Lord's field when the opportunity arises and immediately summon to resume the interrupted works. And for many reasons, and these not to be despised, it seemed that your city would be very suitable for hosting them. Therefore, I would like to ask you again and again, since this undertaking is of such importance and is attempted at no cost to you, to support it with your authority, help, and intercession with your magistrate, from whom nothing else is requested than that they be allowed to rent houses in the city, where they can all have their own administration of domestic affairs, and then that they be allowed to have their own church, where they can use their own language and retain a discipline consistent with the word of God among themselves. I do not doubt that you (whose judgment in religion is sound) will strongly approve of these things and will do everything possible to ensure that your magistrate makes a good decision. Indeed, the matter will be most pleasing to God, honorable to you, and will secure eternal goodwill and friendship for your church with that kingdom of the English, if it is ever restored. Therefore, I do not think there is a need for a longer exhortation with you, especially since you understand the matter well. For this reason, I will only add one thing, that you also ensure in this matter that these good brothers feel that my letters have had proper weight with you, and persuade yourself that, when you have accomplished this for me, although nothing can be added to the love and charity with which I pursue you, yet in these things I will daily delight myself more and more.</p>
      <p>I write nothing about English affairs; for they will explain in person and will tell more evils than you would wish. As for the book you sent me, I give thanks as I ought, I will read it most gladly; I am already having it bound for myself. But in that you claim to have been helped by me, as I recognize the modesty of your spirit, so I am not led to believe that my writings have supplied you with anything that you did not already have perceived by yourself. I will remember your son. Upon the return of your merchants, you will have letters from me again. May God keep you safe for us for a long time. I gave your book to Master Zanchi, as you ordered, which was indeed most pleasing to him, whence he sends you greetings and gives great thanks. To all the fellow students and good brothers, convey my greetings in my name. Strasbourg, March 13, 1554.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
