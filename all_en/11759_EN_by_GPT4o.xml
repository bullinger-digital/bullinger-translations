    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends three booklets requested by Bullinger; can order the fourth one in Frankfurt upon request. The [Quran printed by Oporin and confiscated by the council] was released, but when Markus [Bertschi] welcomed the publication in a sermon, the pastors were summoned before the council, where a decree was read to them prohibiting the mention of this publication from the pulpit; nevertheless, the books are now in Oporin's hands. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I am sending you three booklets, which you wrote about. The fourth one is not available, but if you need it, I will arrange for it to be brought from the Frankfurt fair; they cost 4 Schilling Basel currency. The Quran was released after many consultations, yet Satan does not rest. Markus skillfully addressed the topic of the hidden treasure in the field in a public sermon, mentioning the Quran. What happened? He was summoned by the consul to give an account of his statement about the Quran before the entire council.</p>
      <p>They said this was to disregard the decrees of the council, to stir up the people, to provoke the learned of the school, to sow discord among brothers; that there had been enough disputes already. Behold the conscience that is ill at ease. You may ask: "What did Markus say?" One must praise God that the Quran has come to light in our times, in which one can see what delusion the Turks are involved in. This statement has upset them greatly. The next day, all of us who are in the ministry of the word were summoned. A decree was read, prohibiting anyone from mentioning the Quran publicly from the pulpit, or else they would face an implacable council. We left not without amazement, even though our false brothers left cheerfully as the authors of that decree. I wanted to share this with you briefly. Let them burst and gnash their teeth, or rather bark like dogs - Oporinus has the Quran complete and unharmed.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and greet Theodor in my name. January 25, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church. In Zurich.</p>
