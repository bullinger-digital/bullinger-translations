      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>In recent days, most illustrious and excellent Bullinger, the Lord has called to Himself Maximilian Martinengo, the minister of our church. We cannot easily express in words the state to which the church has been brought because of this. While he was still ill, we deliberated long and hard among ourselves about appointing another pastor in his place. We realized how important it is for the propagation of Christ's kingdom among our people to have someone preside over this church, if possible, whose doctrine and other gifts of God, which are especially desired in a bishop, are easily recognized by our people. We unanimously agreed, as we all did, on no one other than Dr. Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>However, since we see that he is currently bound to you there and cannot leave your sacred academy to serve our church unless you kindly permit it, we, although we may seem bothersome or even importunate to you with such a request, have not hesitated to send one of our own to you (we have sent our dearest brother Nicolaus Balbanus, the senior of our church), to ask him from you in the name of us all. Indeed, most excellent Bullinger, we earnestly pray and beseech you by Christ not to hesitate to help us in this matter as much as you can, and to first grant us Dr. Peter Martyr, if our desire seems just and our request honorable to you, as we indeed believe it is, and then to encourage others both in the church and in the republic, who may be less inclined to do so, to do the same; for we know how much influence you have with both in grace and authority. We do not address more matters with you at present; the rest will be discussed in person by Nicolaus.</p>
      <p>We hope that, due to your singular piety towards the faithful and your great zeal for promoting the glory of Christ, with which you have always been fervent, you will not fail us in such a necessary matter. By this, you will bind us and our church to you perpetually with such a benefit.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, for whom we sincerely pray to the Lord for health and all good things, and we commend ourselves and our church, deprived of a pastor, to you in the highest degree. Geneva, on the calends of September 1557.</p>
      <p>Your most observant elders, deacons, and the entire church of the Italians gathered in Geneva. To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the primary pastor of the church in Zürich and especially esteemed by us. In Zürich.</p>
