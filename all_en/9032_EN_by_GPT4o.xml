      <p>God be with us, dearly beloved son, I thank you and Susanna most highly for the lovely and good gifts you have given me; I will soon repay you and do something in return; for at this time I am as penniless as I have not been for a long time. The mayor of Bern, along with his wife, was here yesterday around 4 o'clock, and with him a nobleman from Freiburg, near Ulm, along with his wife. The steward of Königsfelden, the bailiff of Schenkenberg, and company, about 16 people. I also invited him and his company, but he declined my invitation kindly; for he and his company are too many; he will also leave again tomorrow after a snack. When my lords invite him, I cannot know whether they will persuade him to have dinner or a snack tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Once he invited me and others to a snack at the Stork, that he wants and must leave again after the snack, especially because of the running, etc. Therefore, I have invited for tomorrow night Mr. Mayor Brämen, Mr. Treasurer Aescher, Secretary Aescher, Mr. Hans Meysen and their wives along with Mrs. Mother and Mrs. from Cham. I will inform you further later on how it went with the mayor and my hospitality. There is no further news since then, except that the great murder is described as significant and lamentable; perhaps more about that another time. Now, on this rainy day, I want to harvest my seeds; God grant that it yields much.</p>
      <p>God be with you; all my people and I send greetings to you and Susanna along with the children.</p>
      <p>Written in the morning around 5 o'clock, September 22, in the year 1572. I have gifted this with 5 [Greek], which he carries heavily. God thanks you truly.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Hansen and others of our household in Il.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Hans Rudolf Bullinger, my dear son, pastor at Berg.</p>
