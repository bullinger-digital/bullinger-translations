      <p>S. I wrote to you yesterday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, your messenger came with a swift journey; for he left Zurich on the 9th of August and was here around dinner time on the 10th of the same month. We hear that the people of Schwyz are still in turmoil; however, we pray to the Lord to quell them.</p>
      <p>He will return to you quickly; therefore, I cannot write much, nor do I have much to say, except that Beza writes to you about that French alliance.</p>
      <p>You know how much it is being urged and under what conditions; meanwhile, he shows that the king does not want us to have separate articles from the rest of the Swiss; indeed, we can privately preserve some conditions, especially to ensure that his edict on the freedom of evangelical doctrine remains intact.</p>
      <p>However, I fear that we may end up like the Schmalkaldic League, that while we wish to join sacred matters with these political alliances, we may lose both the purity of doctrine and a great part of our freedom.</p>
      <p>A certain marshal of France will come to Fribourg today for this matter, and they will meet him with great pomp.</p>
      <p>The same will soon come to us; for here too, much preparation is being made for him. I fear, therefore, that these foreign birds may eventually lead us away from the sincerity and simplicity of our doctrine and discipline.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I wish the best counsel for the pious in France; but while we place too much hope in men and seek the help of the flesh, we lose divine assistance.</p>
      <p>I know our people are dealing with you on this matter; but you beautifully conceal it. I therefore pray that you signify your judgment to me; for we need to be united, if anywhere, especially in this matter, especially since Beza urges both sides so much. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife, children, sons-in-law, and friends. Bern, 11th of August, at 12 noon.</p>
      <p>Your always, Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my lord and most highly esteemed compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
