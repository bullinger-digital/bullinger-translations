      <p>Franciscus Hotomannus.</p>
      <p>For a long time, I have been thinking about writing to you about your son. Now he comes to me more frequently than before and attends my lectures, especially those on Cicero, which he needs the most. He would not find it inconvenient to attend law lectures if he listened more diligently, not to immerse himself entirely in that study, but so that after 6 or 8 months of attending the institutions, he could not be said to be completely ignorant of civil law. I have seen many otherwise learned and educated men who thought that usufruct was the same as usucaption, and I know that you have some acquaintances among them. If your son had not recently moved from his home, it would have been much more advisable, and he would have better attended to his studies [Greek], if it were allowed, I would voluntarily offer myself to you and him, to receive him at my place. But he knows himself that I have sent away all my companions because of the incredible scarcity of meat, which we suffer from here. However, if you wish, I will place him with an honorable man, an old German, along with four young Frenchmen, two of whom are very learned in Greek and Latin, having also suffered much for the gospel and are commendable for their integrity of life. In their company, I hope, the young man would not become worse. Yesterday, it was written to me from Paris that the queen gave birth to a son and a daughter in one birth, that the cardinal, the pope's legate, left after receiving the bishopric. This was accomplished by the chancellor to obtain the galero. The Sorbonne scholars rushed to the king and, having sought the opportunity to meet him, requested the task of investigating the Lutherans, and when the king replied that he had entrusted that task, they responded that the entire court of the Paris Parliament had been investigated, and he angrily retorted: "What do you want me to do, or what advice should I take, should I replace you in their place and have you administer my republic?" It is also reported here for certain that the cardinal sent to the Emperor was ordered to leave before the Emperor approached. Farewell, most illustrious man and revered father.</p>
      <p>To the Lord Martyr, my venerable compatriot, greetings. Stra√üburg, 15 August 1556.</p>
