    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas has not received Bullinger's letter as well as the writing that Bullinger promised him when he visited Zurich, well preserved. According to Bullinger's request, he will read the writing, take good care of it, and return it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He sent greetings to all of Bullinger's friends and also inquired with Myconius about the suspicion Bullinger expressed regarding [Ulrich] of W端rttemberg. However, Myconius could not say anything specific about it. Enzinas gathered from a letter by Hieronymus Sailer that both the old and the young Duke of W端rttemberg have transferred their territory to King Francis I of France for a certain sum of money. Some believe (which is not at all far-fetched) that the Swiss Confederates will settle the area and Duke [Christoph] himself will govern as prefect with royal authority. If this is true, the power of the Helvetians will grow and the arrogance of their opponents will decrease.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] What does Bullinger think about Strasbourg, which is, so to speak, located in both regions and seems to want to join both sides? Yet these would only be human arrangements (even if they hardly contradict God's will). However, the pious man expects his salvation from God alone. Does Bullinger know anything more about this?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger is probably already informed about the deposition of the Archbishop of Cologne, Hermann von Wied, and the appointment of Adolf von Schaumburg in his place.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Enzinas believes that the peace treaties of the Swabian cities with the Emperor pose a real danger if his evil intentions are not thwarted by the many problems that particularly threaten him from abroad. Should Bullinger hear anything new, he should share it. Enzinas will do the same.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The sick Myconius is now doing better.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bernardino Ochino, whom Enzinas likes, sends his regards. He still lives with Johannes Oporin because it is very difficult to find an apartment in Basel. Although the city received him honorably, its inhabitants are rough and unfriendly. Ochino would have preferred to settle with the people of Zurich, whom Enzinas found to be learned, pious, and courteous. Enzinas would also like to live in Zurich if he did not have to account to his parents. Bullinger should inquire with his colleagues and the Zurich authorities whether they would be inclined to allow Ochino to settle in Zurich. He might then move there. He is upright, pious, unobtrusive, nice, and helpful. The people of Augsburg, under whose protection he stands in the Confederation, have also written to him that they would prefer if he lived in Zurich rather than elsewhere. Bullinger should take up this matter for the sake of Enzinas and Ochino and keep everything secret until the council's decision and Ochino's consent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings, also to the colleagues.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have received your letters and with them the writings which you promised to send when I was there; I will read them, keep them faithfully, and return them, just as you requested in your letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have conveyed your greetings to all your friends and inquired with Myconius about the suspicion you had regarding our W端rttemberg. However, he denied having learned anything certain from anyone, nor could he confirm your suspicion. I have clearly received in Sailer's letters that both the elder and the younger Duke of W端rttemberg have transferred their respective provinces to the power of the King of France for a certain price; and there are those here who believe that the Swiss Confederates will inhabit that province, with the Duke himself appointed as prefect in name and royal authority. If this happens, as it seems neither absurd nor far from the truth to a wise thinker, the power of the Helvetians will grow, and the arrogance of those who oppose them today will diminish.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>What do you think will happen to Strasbourg, which lies between both regions and seems to want to give its hand to both? But these are human arrangements, which, although they may not seem to be against God's will, a pious soul should depend on our sole savior and not live securely on such human defenses. Whatever it is, I wish to know more certainly from your letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding the deposed Archbishop of Cologne and the one who was previously designated being placed in his position, I assume you have already heard.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>From this fact, I suspect that the peace treaty established with the Swabian cities will be weak and deceitful unless the many and great dangerous affairs of foreign nations, which seem to be directed against the Emperor, impede his depraved will. If I receive any news of these matters from anywhere, I will share it with you, and I ask you to do the same.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Myconius has been suffering from poor health, but now he begins to be better.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Lord Bernardino sends you greetings, whose company I uniquely delight in; he still resides in the house of Oporin, as he has not yet been able to find his own home; such is the difficulty of finding a dwelling in this city. The city received him kindly and honorably. However, whenever I consider the harshness, not to say inhumanity, of this people, I often wish he had settled firmly among you, whom I have judged, to speak frankly, to be adorned with great learning, singular piety, and truly amiable sweetness of manners. If I did not have to consider my parents, I would think I could live more pleasantly with no one else (I testify to piety itself). Therefore, I would more wish that our Bernardino would enjoy this very convenience. If you think it would be pleasing to your brothers and your magistrate, which I do not doubt, I would like you to inform me privately about your judgment and the will of the governors. For if he were to be received with that goodwill which should be expected from your virtue and piety, perhaps the excellent Bernardino would move to your company. The man's virtue is well known, and by his innate piety, he is accustomed to be troublesome to no one, pleasing and useful to all. There are also other reasons that would encourage him to move into your fellowship: your humanity, learning, and religion, all of which he lacks here. Moreover, the people of Augsburg, under whose protection he is in the Confederation, have written to him, which I have seen, clearly indicating that they would be much more pleased if he remained with you in Zurich than elsewhere. Therefore, I earnestly ask you, most learned Bullinger, to diligently take care of this matter in both my name and Bernardino's, and I request from you in this matter what you asked of me in preserving the writings; namely, that the matter be communicated with no one at all until everything has been transacted with the magistrate and you have been informed by us of what Bernardino has decided to do.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell, most learned Bullinger, and diligently greet all the brothers in my words.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the first of March, 1547.</p>
      <p>Your Francis Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, teaching the gospel in the church of God, which is in Zurich.</p>
