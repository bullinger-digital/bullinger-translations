    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius is satisfied with Bullinger's statements [in a no longer preserved letter] about the [Glarus celestial] phenomenon. The desired edition of Persius will be provided.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] If only Emperor Charles V would die! That would be good for Germany. Today Johannes Gast read a letter from his son [Benjamin] from Freiburg [im Breisgau], which indicates that they are expecting the arrival of the Emperor there, as he intends to winter in Strasbourg. This has triggered the same feelings in Myconius as in Bullinger. Therefore, he wrote to the people of Strasbourg and urged them to secure their wives, daughters, and property from this godless tyrant and to ask God to protect His word. Some pastors there are already preparing for death.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger is thanked for the thorough report on the participation of the people of Lucerne and others in the [Zurich shooting] festival. This news, and especially the participation of the people of Constance, delighted Myconius! The fact that the people of Uri and Unterwalden did not come does not worry him too much, especially since they excused themselves. May God let the festival end well to the praise of His name and for the benefit of the common homeland!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] According to the letter from [Benjamin] Gast, the St. Clara Monastery in Freiburg burned down a few days ago. The chalices and images of Jesus did not contribute to the rescue! Down feathers worth 700 guilders, which were to be made into bedspreads for sale, went up in flames.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] A messenger who returned from Vienna [...] reported that there is no fear of Sultan Suleiman there; the city of Buda is said to be so well fortified that it is now impregnable; the Turks occasionally undertake small raids into Styria; between Passau and Deggendorf, countless locusts have fallen from the sky to the horror of humans and animals; in Alsace and in the land of Count George of Württemberg, [a cattle plague] is sweeping away cattle, horses, and pigs. When Beatus Rhenanus was lying ill in Strasbourg, he summoned the mayor of Sélestat [Gervasius Gebwiller] to him. As he was about to ride off, his horse suddenly collapsed. These are deserved punishments for our terrible sins.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Honorable people regret that some Confederates trust the Emperor too much due to some assurance given to them. They believe that one should be more cautious. Myconius is convinced that the Emperor will undertake something against the Confederates if he goes to Strasbourg. God help!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings, also to Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and Heinrich Buchter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [P.S.:] An honorable man [Martin Bucer] wrote the following: The astrologers prophesy a fate for your Confederates similar to that of the Genoese and Milanese [the four preceding words were written with partially incorrect Hebrew letters]. What does that mean? Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and Bullinger should explain it to Myconius. They are greeted!</p>

      <p>S. You have satisfied me regarding the vision. I have taken care of Persius.</p>

      <p>If only the Emperor would perish for the benefit of Germany! Today, Gastius read me a letter sent from Freiburg by his son: they are expecting the Emperor, as he intends to winter in Strasbourg. I share the same sentiment with you, which is why I wrote to the people of Strasbourg to protect their wives and daughters, to safeguard their treasury, and to pray to the Lord to protect His word; for all these are in danger if the godless tyrant comes. Some of the brothers are preparing for death.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I truly thank you for the diligence with which you informed me about the people of Lucerne and others who came to this festival. I am pleased with everything that is happening there, especially that you assert the people of Constance are present. I am not overly concerned about the people of Uri and Unterwalden, especially since they excused themselves. May the Lord grant that this well-organized festival ends well, namely for the glory of God and the benefit of the common homeland.</p>

      <p>A few days ago, the St. Clara Monastery in Freiburg was burned down. Neither the chalices nor the images of Jesus could help. Feathers worth seven hundred guilders, which were intended to be made into beds and sold, were lost. Gastius' son, who lives in Freiburg, testifies to this.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Recently, someone who was previously sent from Vienna came, reporting that there is peace there concerning the Turk; Buda is fortified to be impregnable; occasional raids occur in Styria, but not with large forces. He saw locusts fall from the sky in such numbers between Passau and Deggendorf that they terrified humans and animals. In Alsace and the domain of the Count of Württemberg, cattle, horses, pigs, etc., are suddenly dying. While Beatus Rhenanus was ill in Strasbourg, he called the consul of Sélestat to him; as he was leaving on horseback, his horse suddenly fell. Thus, the Lord presses us very heavily because of our sins, yet in a fitting manner: We are so enormously wicked!</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Good men complain that the Confederates trust the Emperor too much due to some unknown security; they wish they were a bit more diligent. I truly say, if he comes to Strasbourg, he will attempt something against us. May the Lord be with us!</p>

      <p>Farewell in the Lord with Theodor, Gwalther, Buchter, and the others. Basel, hastily, August 23, 1547. Yours, Os. Myco.</p>

      <p>A good man writes to me with these words: "Your Swiss, who know the course of the stars, promise nothing other than the condition of the Genoese and Milanese." I do not understand what he means: let Pellicanus and Theodorus explain to me with you what the meaning is! Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, a most learned man, his very esteemed brother and lord. Zurich.</p>
