      <p>Jodocus Weber M. to Heinrich Bullinger, Greetings.</p>
      <p>I would be embarrassed to discuss these matters with you in person, but a letter does not blush. Dearest father, with such splendor (to say nothing of your other good works and labors; for you have restored the early church to its original state with your clear writings, which shine brighter and clearer than the sun) you have adorned the epistle that Saint Paul addressed to the Romans with your commentary, by the power of the divine spirit, so that no one can doubt that the same spirit, which Paul drew from heaven, has descended upon you, revealing the mind of Paul or rather the divine spirit so clearly that your commentary does not seem to be a commentary. For who would not think that Paul himself wrote it or that it is the words of Paul himself? They have been explained and brought to light for us poor souls so clearly as never before. The highest, eternal, and most holy God will reward your labor. Since your writings benefit us so much for the true worship of God and are embraced with such love - which are not yours, but of God himself, whose work you are created for these tasks, whose glory is especially sought and the salvation of all people; for the greatest praise of God is that many may recognize him and enjoy his grace - why then do you keep us waiting so long for the commentaries on the saving doctrine of Christ, which we have long desired, having great hope that they will come to light, which has so far deceived many. Therefore, I would like you to remember that this grace, these riches, have been given and entrusted to you by God not only for yourself but also to benefit others with them. With what reason, then, do you wish to defend yourself before our judge, that you have not shared all the good things entrusted to you with us, especially since you know that all things of friends are common? Therefore, I beg you, do not bury and hide this precious talent in the ground. If you do not give it to us, you certainly exceed the limits of charity, as we are pressed by such hunger and need to feed on your goods. But charity, I hope, will impel you to share all your goods with us. For you know that everything is to be used for the honor of God and the love of neighbor. Therefore, display the talent entrusted to you, so that you may gain much profit for God.</p>
      <p>Farewell and take these letters not as from a stranger, but from a son who loves his father greatly. Therefore, I beg and beseech you, do not be angry with me, the least, who asks such great things from you.</p>
