      <p>My friendly greetings along with the offering of all honors, love, and goods beforehand. Venerable, highly learned, honorable, dear sir, I have a nephew, who on his mother's side is a Wittenbacher; he is nine years old. I would like to bring him to you in Zurich, so that he can learn both languages, Latin and German, together and grasp a foundation in the Latin language, although he has a decent beginning in the German language, and then I could place him with someone where he might be better off than with you. My friendly request reaches you, I would like you to inform me if it would be agreeable to you to accept him; then I would honestly and willingly satisfy you. The boy is otherwise delicate in himself; I have no doubt at all that you will be able to keep him, as you would know how to do in such a matter. Therefore, honorable, dear sir, knowing that we have a doctor with us who desires to be of use to you in Zurich and might be virtuous and sufficiently capable, to read a lecture. Since he has asked me to write to you on his behalf, he also writes to you in the letter enclosed here, which I send to you, it is my request to you to inform me of your will and opinion on this matter. Regarding this and the aforementioned matter concerning my nephew, awaiting your favorable and friendly response, sincerely praying to Almighty God that He may graciously protect you.</p>
      <p>Dated in Baden, August 4, 1548. Your ever willing servant Hans Wunderlich.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly learned sir Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the divine word in Zurich, my honorable, gracious, dear sir. Zurich.</p>
