      <p>Greetings. Certainly, I attributed your silence to your various affairs, including trade. But it is good when I understand that Beza's book has been returned to you. You will have returned it soon enough, once you have used it and can safely send it back. I eagerly wish to understand the outcome of the Ganthner case, if indeed it can be added. I hope well, relying on the Lord's goodness. He and his Franco will easily be refuted, as he was an inept rhapsodist without judgment and accumulated many things with no benefit, indeed to the detriment, and was not entirely free from the Anabaptist sect, being influenced by other sects. And it is clear what the judgments of the learned men of our age are about this Franco. The truth must be held in higher regard than all the Anabaptists, Francos, Witlings, and similar catenflianers, etc. I am sending back to you the letters of Mr. Campelli and I ask that you greet him most kindly in my name. May the Lord grant that you may have this pious, learned, and peaceful man as a colleague! I wrote about this matter long ago to Mr. Willius, the consul, whom you will also greet most diligently in my name, as well as Ambrosius, the consul, the city prefect, Mr. Carolus, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Bonetus, and our other friends. I will ensure that your letters to Mr. Zanchus are delivered to Heidelberg by the first available courier. The masons falsely reported to Mr. Campello about Emperor Maximilian; for he is still in Speyer, to leave after the assembly ends on the 4th of this month and to return to Prague, Bohemia. The reports about the Bavarian expedition are also false. I received letters from Augsburg dated the 21st of the past month; but not a word about it.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 1, 1570. On October 31, the sea was driven by the wind, so that with the flood it overwhelmed many cities, lands, and people in the Netherlands by night and terribly destroyed everything. Antwerp was badly affected by it. It tore down the city walls for 60 steps and caused unspeakable damage inside.</p>
      <p>It flowed out several miles before Antwerp. Bergen, the city, was destroyed, Armuyr, the beautiful city, was completely ruined, with few people surviving. In Zeeland, it took away 4 cities, including Rotterdam, otherwise about 70 cities, towns, and villages, and people, livestock, goods, and whatever was there perished. Many thousands of people are said to have drowned. It is said to be an unheard-of tragedy. Thus they write from Antwerp, Augsburg, and Strasbourg. If it is even half true, it is truly a tragedy that teaches us to open our eyes and prepare ourselves. For it is the certain sign of Luke 21: "There will be signs," etc. And what the Venetians are still dissimulating, they are said to have lost Cyprus, and the poor people there were either slaughtered or taken away captive, etc. The reward of the inquisition received, etc.</p>
      <p>In great haste. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, fellow priest and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>To the honorable pastor at St. Martin's.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
