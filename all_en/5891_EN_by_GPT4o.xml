      <p>Greetings. Since I hear from others, to my great sorrow, that you are already exhausted and yet overwhelmed with countless tasks, I rightly give you the greatest thanks, my lord and brother, for writing and sending me two letters for one: I rightly spare you and do not add trouble to trouble, but respond to you very briefly.</p>
      <p>I understood what happened with the king at Rouen.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord to imbue and guide him with His spirit and to free and protect him from wicked advisors.</p>
      <p>If the Bernese complain about the people of Zurich, that they never wanted to assist them with their advice for the salvation of France, they complain unjustly, and they turn against others what would more fittingly adhere to themselves.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I confess, little is done for France if we mutually accuse and excuse each other.</p>
      <p>The Bernese were assisted by our people in the Savoyard cause, as our people were instructed by them, and as much as they could indeed.</p>
      <p>I have always heard from our people that if they were in the place of the Bernese, they would never act with the Savoyard, unless the freedom, religion, and all rights of the city of Geneva were preserved.</p>
      <p>For a long time, my lord and brother, the subscription to the Augsburg Confession and Apology made by the three cities began to be discussed.</p>
      <p>Letters were recently written to the most honorable magistrate of the city of Basel, in which the three cities request that they deal with Sulcer, so that he may retract his subscription and do nothing against our common confession either in the city or outside the city.</p>
      <p>A response is now awaited.</p>
      <p>That shameless and ambitious man is arranging to be made a doctor this week.</p>
      <p>As if it were not enough that he previously acted as a doctor in the church when called to the ministry.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord Jesus to protect His church and keep us from evil.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>May the Lord strengthen you so that you may benefit His church and all of us for a long time.</p>
      <p>The brothers and all the fellow ministers greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet all your fellow ministers, our brothers, as well. Zurich, September 28, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I commend this young, pious, and diligent student to your kindness.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
