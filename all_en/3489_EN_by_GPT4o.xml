      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ the Savior, etc.</p>
      <p>Our Jacob, when he was recently with you, could not stop praising the wonderful and exceptional kindness you showed him upon his return. This is pleasing to us for two reasons: first, because you have consistently persevered in the goodwill and kindness you have shown us so far; second, because we are convinced that we have such influence with you that we will not be rejected in any fair and just matter. Having experienced this benevolence especially in you, most kind Bullinger, I desire to experience it more and more. Therefore, I wish not only for my affairs to be considered by you, but also those concerning my brothers, whom I love dearly. Among them is Thomas Alberti, whom I had previously recommended to you and who was assisted by your efforts. He fears that due to your various engagements, he may have slipped from your mind, and he has asked me to recommend him to you once again. He will need your intercession there.</p>
      <p>He will tell you the whole matter.</p>
      <p>I therefore pray, both in my name and his, that you will be willing to assist him.</p>
      <p>For in this way, when he feels that my recommendation to you has been effective, he will embrace both of us with greater affection. We have no news, except that the Bollwiler army, not yet paid, is raging like hornets. Duke Bollwiler has gone to Brussels.</p>
      <p>Some suspect that he is deliberately delaying the payment of salaries until spring, so that he can keep the soldiers in service and prevent them from defecting to the French, without having to recruit a new army.</p>
      <p>May God turn everything to the common peace of His church. Hastily, in Schaffhausen, on the 11th day before the calends of February, in the year 1558.</p>
      <p>Greet the learned men in my name.</p>
      <p>My fellow ministers greet you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, safe in the church of Christ for many years. Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his most dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>"Thomas Alberti."</p>
