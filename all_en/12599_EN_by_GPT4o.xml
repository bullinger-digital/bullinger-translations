      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter, a former official messenger of the city of Zurich, left without the knowledge of his superiors. Now, having been sent from the army with letters and money, he is very anxious that he might be detained again in Zurich. He asked me to write to you, so that you might advise him, to grant him this one thing, that he may always be free to go to the army and return. The cause is just. I do not think the authorities will refuse.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I commend this cause to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. 26th of August.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
