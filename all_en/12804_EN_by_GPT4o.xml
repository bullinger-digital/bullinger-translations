    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] In addition to the letter from the Konstanz council to the Zurich council, Zwick also wants to inform Bullinger about the alarming news that the envoys from Ravensburg, currently staying in Stuttgart, reported to their council: The [imperial captain] Francisco Guardin [correct: Duarte] repeatedly says that Konstanz and Lindau will not be spared. Consequently, the Ravensburg council has urged the Konstanz council to reconcile with Emperor Charles V as quickly as possible. Bullinger should also let [Georg] Müller know about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Furthermore, Zwick fears that if the Emperor or his army enters Ulm, the city will be at the mercy of the imperial troops. One can well imagine the misery this would bring.</p>

      <p>First, my service, dear sir and friend. I cannot withhold from you, alongside my lords' letter, that the envoys from Ravensburg have written to their lords in Stuttgart, reporting that they have heard from a certain Italian lord named Francisco Guardin, that Konstanz and Lindau will not be spared, with further details, etc. Therefore, the people of Ravensburg are urging my lords not to delay reconciliation, and they are making the matter seem grave. This also brings fear to many. I did not want to withhold this from you, with a request that you inform Lord Müller.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, I am concerned that if the Emperor or his troops come to Ulm, the city will become the property of the Italian troops. It is good to consider what kind of misery might follow from this. May God have mercy on us!</p>

      <p>A rumor is coming here that the Confederates have decided not to take the side of any city. If this is true, it would indeed not be good.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and God-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and friend.</p>
