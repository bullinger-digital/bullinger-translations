    <p xml:id="regest1">Informs Bullinger of [three] letters that Bern has transmitted to Biel: [1.] Basel's letter to Bern dated August 31, in which, with reference to an enclosed report from Strasbourg, the convening of a meeting to address the Concord issue is proposed. [2.] Bern's response to Basel dated September 7, in which, after reading [the Strasbourg] report, it authorizes Basel to call a meeting, following the friendly reception of the letters from the Swiss Reformed to Luther, [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony, and [Philipp] of Hesse. [3.] Bern's accompanying letter to Biel dated September 7, with which the copies of the correspondence are sent. Schnyder has learned from the mayor [Valerius GÃ¶uffi] that the Biel council will by no means deviate from the evangelical doctrine taught so far, even if others defect to Luther, as nothing more convincing has been presented so far. Fears that the Bernese may stray [confessionally] and hopes very much that [the people of Biel] will remain courageous and steadfast in the truth. Greetings.</p>

      <p>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ always go before us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Most illustrious man, brother, and much-esteemed lord, here you have what the people of Basel have admitted to the people of Bern, and also what the people of Bern have written to our council about restoring concord, etc.: "To the mayor and council of the city of Bern, etc.</p>
      <p>Our etc. As your and our good friend and trusted (friendly), dear neighbors, the appointed of the war, called the Thirteen, of the city of Strasbourg, have written to our secret council, the Thirteen, you can clearly perceive from the enclosed copy. Since we, on our part, are inclined to promote and further the concord begun with Doctor Luther as much as possible, and considering that you, as well as other of your and our co-religionists in our Confederation, are no less eager to promote and finally complete it than we are, we have particularly requested the secret council of the city of Strasbourg, and for ourselves, you, as well as your and our faithful, dear confederates in Zurich, to whom we have written the same opinion, not to withhold this, kindly requesting first and foremost, your and our good friend and trusted (friendly), dear confederates in Biel to report this missive in the same manner and then to inform us through this messenger sent solely for this purpose of your opinion, how now to bring the matter to a conclusive end and settlement, and whether (as in our opinion it might be very necessary and quite serviceable for the promotion of the matter) a meeting would be necessary, to inform us, so that we may know how to proceed. For we, on our part, are inclined to promote whatever may serve to maintain this goodwill and friendship and the begun concord, and at the same time to show you, as our faithful, dear confederates, friendly service to the best of our ability.</p>
      <p>Given on the last day of August in the year 38.</p>
      <p>Jacob Meyer, mayor and council of the city of Basel."</p>
      <p>Now follows what the people of Bern have responded to the writings and requests of the people of Basel:</p>
      <p>"To the mayor and council of Basel, etc., the mayor, council, and citizens of the city of Bern.</p>
      <p>Our etc. We have today taken note of your missive along with the enclosed copy of the Thirteen from Strasbourg, etc., and have had it read aloud. Since we have understood from the content of the same that the electoral highness of Saxony and the landgrave of Hesse, etc., along with Doctor Martin Luther, are well satisfied with the writings that have been sent to them from Zurich on the last day, we are willing to allow and have given you on our part the authority to set and announce a day, which we will visit with our delegation and give them the command to act according to the power and content of the decision of the aforementioned day, held in Zurich. But if otherwise, contrary to this, something should occur, our delegation will be instructed to do nothing further than to listen.</p>
      <p>Given on Saturday, September 7, in the year 38." "The mayor, council, and citizens of Bern.</p>
      <p>To the pious, prudent, honorable, and wise mayor and council of the city of Biel, our especially good friend and trusted, dear confederates.</p>
      <p>Our friendly greetings, along with whatever we are capable of in love and goodness, beforehand. Pious, prudent, honorable, wise, especially good friend and trusted, dear confederates, what our faithful, dear confederates from Basel have written to us and with what response we have met them, as can be learned here in the enclosed copies, which we want to report to you at their request, you have to deliberate on this.</p>
      <p>Given on September 7, 38." What has been further consulted by our council, I am not aware of, except that this one thing is on everyone's lips, that Luther has not responded to our writings, what further should be done in the assemblies in Basel or elsewhere, rather nothing more should be had to do with Luther or his teachers and those who are of their party.</p>
      <p>Neither the people of Basel nor the people of Bern have responded, what they intend to do. And as I have received from our mayor, the council persists in this opinion, that they will not move an iota from the received evangelical doctrine, in which they have been instructed from the beginning to this time, even if all were to defect from the taught, disputed, and confessed doctrine to the party of Luther, since in the meantime no one has ever presented anything better, more certain, except some weak things, namely to affirm according to the words of Christ "Take and eat" etc. the presence of Christ in the supper, which the guest is to take in the bread, with the bread, under the bread, all of which (says the mayor) are so uncertain that neither the words themselves (even if they have gnawed away all the prepositions, under, over, etc., from Donatus) nor the teachers themselves can withstand the clarity of truth, etc.</p>
      <p>Finally, brother in the Lord, much esteemed, you will see sometime into which parts the people of Bern will turn; I wish that my judgment would deceive me. Into which parts we will eventually turn (if we do not desist from the beginning), God knows. May He send forth that good spirit, who will lead us into all truth, make us strong, cheerful, and persevering to stand firm in it and to confess it manfully with heart and mouth. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and mother most dearly in my name and all the brothers. September 16, from Biel, in the year 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Peter.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich.</p>
