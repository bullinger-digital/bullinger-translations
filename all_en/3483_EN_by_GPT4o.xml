      <p>The fortress and city of Calais were captured on the ninth day of this month, the fortress by force, the city by surrender. By what means this was accomplished, you will be able to learn from the letters which I write to the distinguished gentlemen of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>A great deed indeed has been accomplished; may God grant success to the remainder of the war.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, January 19th.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sanlaurentius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished theologian, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
