      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I give immense thanks for such a precious gift that you sent, and you could not have chosen a more suitable subject for our century, nor one more pleasing to the papists. I will pray to the Lord that you complete the rest with such happiness and that you may benefit the church for a long time with your writings. I will soon repay your generosity with some small gift.</p>
      <p>It is surprising to our people that you in Z체rich do not want to give your name to that new alliance. You say: "The king is impious, he persecutes the pious, he burns many innocents." It is true. Why do you not annihilate the Swiss alliance? But I do not want to stir up trouble. Many predict that this will not happen without sedition. The sons of this age rejoice in their hearts that we are so separated, that each city has its own opinion. No one denies that there are many things to consider in forming alliances; but the times must be weighed and the strengths of some have increased. What if the cities could attach some condition, whereby the persecution in France would finally cease, which perhaps for that reason is going to be greater and more cruel? May the Lord give us His spirit, so that we do nothing and consult nothing against His word.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is acting in Brussels. There he received his son Philipp. He was given more than the value of 3 tons of gold. He is consulting on the matters of Germany to be settled. On May 1st, there will be a diet in Regensburg. Bucer and Fagius have left, I think to England; they made Spanish clothes for themselves, so that they would not be recognized.</p>
      <p>The city is consulting with the bishop on how they might conveniently introduce the detestable Interim without tumult. The remaining brothers are still uncertain, unaware of what the senate will do. They still preach the word of God and administer the sacraments.</p>
      <p>Brother Michael, a monk of the Augustinian sect, who acted as a preacher in Speyer, is with us and barely escaped the Emperor's power, and still some other brothers proscribed by the papists are staying with us, awaiting a church and legitimate calling.</p>
      <p>A certain peasant in the district of Thurgau in the village of Dunstat put a golden ring with wine around his neck, in which there were 4 measures of wine, which he brought to another peasant, who drank it; he then immediately lay dead at the table. The nobleman had this man thrown by the executioner into the Rhine in a barrel.</p>
      <p>You do not respond about the cause of the divorce of that Thomas, who married a nun in S채ckingen, who is still being watched by the guards. The rascal married another and throws all the blame for this divorce on you, and he did this before the senate in M체lhausen. Therefore, write to me the matter in order, so that I may defend you, if our senate could have apprehended him, I easily believe that he would already have been drowned in the Rhine for having taken two wives.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand has made a double addition to Vienna, fortifies the city, brings much artillery there, supplies and munitions; he undoubtedly fears a Turkish incursion. Margrave Albrecht harasses the cities of the Seestett and Saxony. I fear there will be a great war in the summer. Many nobles are now coming together in Burgundy on St. George's Day, although some say they come together there every year. The situation is complex; Satan does not rest. But tell me, when will you complete the second volume of your Decades? Myconius is in poor health and worn out by old age, sometimes the good father raves.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 8, 1549. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his perpetual esteemed teacher. Z체rich.</p>
