    <p xml:id="regest1">Feels compelled to give a brief response [to No. 1797]; recommends [the bishops] of Cologne and Münster [Hermann von Wied and Franz von Waldeck] for further intercession; the appearance of the already printed [Cologne] Reformation draft ["Einfaltigs bedencken"] is delayed because the prince-bishop residing in Westphalia wants to simultaneously release the Latin translation revised by Bucer; Bullinger and Vadian will receive a copy as soon as possible. Luther's letter [to Froschauer] pains Bucer greatly, yet he urgently asks for the sake of the church to keep silent about this matter; Myconius has also written to him about it, and he had already heard about the content of the letter from the Hessians coming from Zurich [Wigand Happel and Johannes Pincier?]; thanks to the communication of the letter, he can now send it to Philipp [Melanchthon], so that he can see how much one must be on guard against some agitators. Bucer's commitment to concord was based on the certainty that both sides agree on the substance of faith, including the sacraments; Luther simply wanted to emphasize that with the sacraments, Christ himself is received, which is consistent with the [First Helvetic] Confession and is best explained through biblical expressions - Luther also cares solely about the Word of God -; Bucer accepted personal attacks and reached an agreement with the Swabian and some [Swiss] churches, but faced rejection from [the Zurichers], whereupon he turned to other tasks, even though he remains connected to them in faith; despite hostilities, he must follow his God-given mission. Writes this to strengthen Bullinger's patience and to give an account; polemics against those who misunderstand Christ's presence in the Lord's Supper as a physical one affect Luther as little as the scholastic theologians, but it is perceived as if they were directed against him. May the Lord guide us in this difficult time, in which the enemies of Christ triumph - the Emperor now also suppresses the Gospel in Metz. Again asks to keep silent about Luther's letter, for a rekindling of the dispute would cause great harm to the church. Greetings from the pastors of Strasbourg to their fellow ministers [in Zurich].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, esteemed in the Lord and sincerely beloved fellow minister and brother.</p>
      <p>Many reasons compel me to briefly respond to your pious and most loving letters, although I would respond from abundant love. I urge you to continue to commend the churches of Cologne and Münster and those established by them to Christ the Lord with your constant prayers and those of your church, as you are doing. I do not yet have the complete book of reformation, from which I must correct the Latin version made by another, but in such a way that slightly less work is left for me than if this book were to be translated anew. The prince is now in Westphalia, mainly to restore the kingdom of Christ and that part of his dominions, and since the places are far apart, he wanted to publish the Latin version together with the German one, which went to press a month ago.</p>
      <p>As soon as I have a complete copy, I will ensure it is sent to you and our Vadianus; I trust you will not long desire it.</p>
      <p>I am deeply grieved by Luther's letters; for it is utterly contrary to our religion that the ministers of Christ's churches do not embrace each other with solid love and renew themselves with the sincere communication of Christ's doctrine.</p>
      <p>And these times demand the utmost union of all members of Christ, let alone the ministers of the churches, more than ever. But, because we want everything to be, do, and suffer for Christ and his church, as we ought, and what has been done cannot be undone, nor can this wound, privately received, be exacerbated by a public remedy of purification, I beseech, implore, and entreat you through the Lord Jesus, the bridegroom of his church, our head, through the church itself now laboring so perilously on all sides: Suppress this letter as much as you can. Our Myconius had warned about this matter with a grave lamentation of this calamity; but I first learned the subject of the letter from the Hessians, who recently came from you, and indeed with great consternation of mind. Although I read the letter now with the most bitter pain, I am grateful that you sent a copy of it. For I will send it to Master Philipp, so that he may see how necessary it is to be vigilant against certain foolish people and those, though very few in number, who bring forward accusations and incitements without any cause, to whom we owe these satanic machinations.</p>
      <p>Regarding the manner and success of concord, in which I have labored for so many years to reconcile and preserve in good faith - Christ knows this and will reveal it on that day - I am now neither free nor inclined to discuss. This one thing I confirm to you in the Lord, which I have confirmed not once before: unless I had been persuaded before the Lord that you both think the same concerning the substance of our religion, I would never have undertaken so much trouble in restoring this concord. I also consider the doctrine and use of the sacraments to pertain to the substance of religion. I know that Luther contended for nothing other than that not only the bread and wine, truly signs of the absent Christ, but also the body and blood, and thus Christ himself, are present, administered, and received in the holy supper by those receiving the sacraments, as instituted by the Lord; concerning the manner of presence, distribution, and reception, he defines nothing at all and expressly confesses that he does not think of such a manner that would in any way detract from either the nature or the glory of Christ, our Lord. Now, since you also clearly testify with the Basel Confession that you are not of the opinion that only the signs of the absent Christ are dispensed and received in the holy supper and not Christ himself, I have judged that you agree on the matter and only differ on the manner of explaining this mystery. And because this very mystery far, indeed infinitely, transcends the sharpness of our reason, and we cannot rightly think of it except from the very words of the Lord, I considered the best way to declare our agreement to be if we also agreed to speak of these sacraments as the Holy Spirit speaks of them in his scriptures. For who explains these mysteries more properly or clearly to those who believe in Christ from the faith of adoption? I know Luther, as far as the counsels of men can be known, seeks God with his whole heart in Christ the Lord and desires nothing else to prevail in the church than the word of God, and opposes you for no other reason than that he thinks you detract from the word of God. Therefore, what he sometimes judged harshly against me and published with the gravest infamy - I do not speak of my name (for let it perish and let the name of Christ be exalted), but of my ministry, which I know is Christ's, whatever I may be - Christian religion itself has commanded to attribute to human error, which coheres with the true spirit of Christ and zeal in him, not to the malice of a man alien to Christ, and to forgive Christ the Lord in him so much acting and accomplishing so excellently both by the preaching of his name and the explanation of his power in his life. Therefore, the same must be done and advised to others. The Lord has given such success to this endeavor in the churches of Swabia and some of yours, that with them peace is established with that man and without any, as I acknowledge, obscuration of the doctrine of Christ in any place. Your judgment of the man and the cause was different; therefore, what was accomplished with others was not accomplished with you. I attribute this to the just judgment of God upon us and the condition of your church. I have never doubted that you truly seek Christ and his kingdom with a true heart and great zeal. Therefore, I endeavored with Master Philipp and some others to suggest to Master Luther the best things we feel about you and to avert the attempts of those who press otherwise. When I understood that my effort could accomplish nothing more with you, and was also being drawn into the calumnies that were reported to me both at our last meeting and afterward - whether true or false, the Lord will see - I recognized that I had fulfilled my duty to you and turned to doing those things which were offered too abundantly at home and elsewhere. I have loved you in Christ and honor you as always, nor will I remit anything from this love and veneration. The Lord knows how I have sought nothing in this cause but his glory, as also in my other public actions. But whether the Lord loves me so, whom I do not doubt loves me, or whether my sins of inconsideration and untimely confidence deserve it, which is most certain, I may seem to be born to bear calumnies and hatreds. For what has been spread about my actions at Regensburg and in other places, and even about this very cause of concord, at Wittenberg and elsewhere, is not unknown to me. But what shall I do? I am the Lord's and cannot reject any opportunity of doing the business of Christ, which it is not lawful to doubt is divinely presented. I would certainly prefer to rest.</p>
      <p>I write this to you to strengthen your patience with whatever example of mine, and also to give an account of both my mind, which I have had and have towards you, and my actions, in which I have been engaged in the meantime, while the exchange of writing between us was interrupted. What I recently advised, that no occasion be given to Luther for anger by any unnecessary dispute, I did for the reason I explained in those letters. I sought to avert nothing other than what every right conscience rightly judges should be averted. I do not even suspect that Master Luther posits a bodily presence of the Lord in the holy supper that detracts from the truth of the human nature in Christ or his heavenly glory.</p>
      <p>The Papists, who indeed follow the scholastics, posit nothing other than the relation (as Thomas Aquinas speaks) of the Lord's body to the species of bread and wine; therefore, when it is disputed against those positing some bodily presence of Christ in the supper, which is contrary to the word of God, it is commonly believed that Luther is being targeted, whom I would not wish to be irritated for the good of the church of Christ, and I would wish not to offend him out of the duty of my office and the veneration of Christ's gifts in him.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus direct all his instruments, so that they labor and accomplish everything for the edification of the church, and avert everywhere the offenses that are presented by Satan and human weakness. You see what times these are, how the openly impious Epicureans and the disguised Stoics, the descendants of the Sadducees and Pharisees, the ancient enemies of Christ, prevail in everything, and how weak our affairs are, you lament with us. You piously dread the wrath of God raging now with both internal and Turkish wars. Our Emperor has now also suppressed the gospel in Metz these days. The church must be raised and governed by the cross. May the Lord grant that we rightly submit to this.</p>
      <p>The end is as the beginning in this my letter. If it can be done in any way, I implore that Luther's letter be suppressed, so that nothing more of this kind is written from there. If the Lord wills, we will strive with all our might to prevent it, as we certainly have not been asleep in this matter before. But things arise everywhere, which the Lord now in his just anger against us, now in his grace for Christ's sake, allows. I ask you to take this in good part and not to think that I desire any other response than that the received wound be discreetly healed, lest a more serious conflict break out, which, however it falls, will only be recalled to the great harm of the churches. It must also be religiously considered what the Lord has given to each in his church and whose words and deeds are more widely known. Forgive me this prolixity, which the cause, though unwilling, and indeed occupied, has extorted.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, October 20. All the fellow ministers greet you, to whom we commend ourselves and all ours in the Lord. 1543.</p>
      <p>M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished professor of Christian doctrine, the most diligent guardian of the church of Christ, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his fellow minister in the Lord and his most beloved brother in the Lord.</p>
