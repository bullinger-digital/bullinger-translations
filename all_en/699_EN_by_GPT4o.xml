      <p>Indeed, whenever I attempted to address these matters before you (most esteemed father and patron), a certain almost rustic shame always deterred me, and the pen, almost seized in my hands, would have been snatched away if not for your benevolence and singular favor towards those devoted to the liberal arts, which prevented it, and the thought of the light of eloquence occurring to me, not to blush at the letter. These and similar considerations have incited my mind, weighing them well, to express them now more boldly in my absence and to somewhat exclude youthful fear. Certainly, I am compelled to confess that I have hitherto drawn upon your great benefits with ingratitude, and have been too rebellious, disobedient, and plainly unruly to paternal admonitions, which, as I consider them daily, inject a great thorn into my heart and are accustomed to stir up heavy waves in my mind. If, as the common proverb goes, he does not entirely go astray who returns from the middle of his course, I would very much like you to think and persuade yourself thus about me. For although it has been difficult to leave the nuts (as it is said) until now, I am now ashamed and regretful of my former life, and I utterly abhor it, and as much as the gods will grant, I will strive for sanctity, purity, and innocence of life, and I will restore the good hope, of which I was almost deprived. Nor do I want you to think that I am moved by some sudden will or chance impulse, but that I have always been of the mind that the serious labors and expenses of patrons should not be in vain and that all expectations of me should not be disappointed. For now, at last, I see how I am bound by eternal memory for the benefits, how difficult it is to wish to repay justly [Greek]. Therefore, if there is any place for pardon, I testify and humbly pray that you forgive the former, which are quite great offenses, and do not entirely cast away your benevolent mind towards me, trusting in the good hope of my repentance; for henceforth, I will certainly apply myself to honorable studies with greater zeal, care, and diligence than before, especially with such an excellent man and most learned person as my mentor, whom I admire greatly, both for his supreme talent and his great learning and skill, and for his singular modesty. And I earnestly ask that you consider this letter favorably, and always hold me in your commendation.</p>
      <p>Farewell, glory of the fatherland.</p>

      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and father.</p>
