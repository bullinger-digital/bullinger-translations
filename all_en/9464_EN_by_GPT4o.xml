      <p> Greetings. I received your letter, most esteemed lord and godfather, along with the new matters enclosed within, and I promptly delivered them to Mr. Amman Schuler, who, like me, expressed immense gratitude to you and sends his most respectful regards to you and your entire household. In return, he gave me these articles of the pacification of the French kingdom, as Mr. Avienus translated them from the French language, asking me to send them to you for reading. Although I have gladly done so, I thought to myself that you have likely already seen them sufficiently, as everything of any significance reaches you sooner than it does us. However, since it seemed to me a small task that could be accomplished without great expense, I wanted to attach them to this letter, asking that if you have used them, you would kindly return them to me when convenient, so that we may also show them to those who are very curious whether that peace was composed for or against our brothers in Christ. </p>
      <p> I indeed wish they were better; but since it cannot yet be so, I pray to the Lord that, as was done before, they may not be broken by the treachery of the enemies of truth, and that those good men may be able to remain in the freedom of their soul and conscience, when they are not allowed to enjoy external and bodily freedom. May God mercifully assist His holy church and most graciously have mercy on us all. Amen. </p>
      <p> Mr. Quaestor and Mr. Elmer, the scribe, both from Beldi, who always visit me whenever they hear I have received letters, send their regards to you and are grateful for your immense labors, and indeed, always in my hearing, wish you all good fortune. My wife and the entire household also send their regards to you and your whole family. Farewell in Christ always. </p>
      <p> In Glarus, the last day of September, in the year 1573. </p>
      <p> Johannes Hugo, yours sincerely. </p>
      <p> To the pious, venerable, and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich, my faithful and very dear lord and godfather. </p>
      <p> Zurich. </p>
