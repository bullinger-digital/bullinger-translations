      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ. You wrote to us about a certain brother, an exile from Augsburg. We are faithfully handling his case with a certain church, from which a certain glutton is to be expelled. When this has been done, we will inform you. Our bishop came to Chur from Rome via Trento on November 8th, staying there only for three days, then again heading to Trento, as he had most solemnly promised to do, namely for the session which was held on St. Catherine's Day. He hurried there for two reasons: one, because he had promised this to the leaders of the council; the other, to obtain the regalia, which he has not yet acquired, from the Emperor with the work and help of the Cardinal of Trento. What you sent to Haimius, our consul, I have read; what concerned Traversius was immediately sent through a special messenger.</p>
      <p>What concerns you have been taken care of and are being watched over; the bishop has been advised not to promise to do anything, but to remember that he has no power, and that he would bring harm upon himself if he did anything of the sort. The leaders of our region are discontented that he went there without consulting them. They sent a courier to warn him not to act on their behalf in the council, and if he presumed to do anything, it would be considered worthless. He is the lord, and the peasants are the masters.</p>
      <p>His power is not extensive, but narrow and limited. What Vergerius sent to us, I return. He is anxiously striving to gain much from the council; but it seems to me that he is making expenses in vain. In the council, things are as follows: the Italian and Spanish bishops and cardinals despise the German bishops with such arrogance that the latter loathe them with great hatred, and this Satanic kingdom holds together very poorly, etc. The Emperor is said to be gravely ill at Innsbruck, as is reported to us. If you have anything, share it with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell. From the Court of Rhaetia, December 1st, 1551. Haimius, Tscharnerus, and Gallitius greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
