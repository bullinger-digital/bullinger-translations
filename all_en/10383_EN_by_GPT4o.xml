      <p>Greetings. Read the prince's letter yourself and act as you see fit for the republic and the glory of Christ. Philip of Hesse is planning to occupy the Duchy of Württemberg for Duke Christoph. It is believed that he will have his camp within the territory before Pentecost. The king is reportedly preparing against him. If the duke yields to the true heir under tolerable conditions and assures Hesse that he will not stir any further trouble, to whom he has so far threatened the most severe things, peace will return immediately. But if the king continues to reject a fair agreement and does not cease his threats against Hesse, it is rumored that he will prolong the war as long as he can. Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg is one of the leading commanders here recruiting soldiers. Everything necessary for war is being hastened.</p>
      <p>Greet Leo Jud, Pellican, and the brothers on my behalf. Farewell.</p>
      <p>April 6th.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Capito.</p>
      <p>If Hesse suffers a defeat, alas, how much loss we will face in the Gospel! But who will conquer, just one prince against a king? And yet those who do not play the least part in this tragedy are full of hope and predict the happiest outcomes. Our cause, money, artillery, and soldiers are superior, the enemy has experienced commanders, but there will be a need for common soldiers, for whom a great expense will be necessary. Johann Zápolya occupies all of Hungary again. Now you have the entire picture of the upcoming war to consider.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zurich, my brother to be respected in the Lord</p>
