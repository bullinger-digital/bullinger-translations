      <p>If we could do anything else, we would be ashamed to offer only thanks and nothing but thanks, since your frequent and ample benefits towards us demand that we repay in deeds whatever we can promise in words. But since our resources have turned out to be much narrower than our spirit, we do what we can, so as not to do nothing, which is what everyone does; although we certainly have the sincerest gratitude we can possibly have for the singular kindness you showed us both at other times and at our departure. Our journey to Bern was quite pleasant, except that the longing for you, a man most dear to us, sometimes tormented us. Those to whom you kindly recommended us in your letters treated us more than kindly: we attribute a large part of this kindness to you; who were not satisfied with treating us kindly yourself, but also ensured that the same was done to us by others. We recognize how great your kindness is; and therefore we confess that we are entirely yours, as long as we can be our own. There is nothing here that we can repay for your merits: consider everything we have in England to be as much yours as what is most truly yours. We hope you will not be burdened to diligently greet Leo Jud, Konrad Pellikan, and that exceptional ornament of Switzerland, indeed of the whole world, Theodor Bibliander, in our words; whose kindness and rare learning we so admire that we will never allow ourselves to forget them.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most dear to us in many respects, Mr. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his most learned man and esteemed teacher, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, let these letters be given.</p>
