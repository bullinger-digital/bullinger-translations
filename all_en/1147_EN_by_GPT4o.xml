      <p>Through Christ Jesus. Greetings. I give you thanks, my dearest and best brother, both in my name and in the name of that brother whom you have cared for so kindly and rather piously; I say, I give you immortal thanks and will do so as long as I live, and I beg you by our friendship and the love of Christ, which is the bond of our relationship, to use me and mine in whatever matters you wish; for we are all yours both in bond and in service. As for the rest, I would like to be informed whether that young man, namely Antonius Schneberger, whom you recently recommended to me, has delivered my letters to you. For I would wish them to have been delivered to you, so that you might understand my perpetual disposition towards you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most friendly Bullinger and most beloved brother, and forgive me if I impose business on you, a very busy man. I pray to God that He may keep you safe with your whole family, to whom you will convey greetings in the name of us all. Basel, January 8, 1551.</p>
      <p>Curio, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, evangelist and most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most beloved and esteemed brother. Zurich.</p>
