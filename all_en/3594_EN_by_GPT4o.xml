      <p>Greetings. I (reverend father in Christ) will not write at length.</p>
      <p>You have your son, Mr. Heinrich, as a living letter.</p>
      <p>He stayed with us for two days and saw some semblance of our republic; for he happened upon this assembly and, as the consuls were discussing at the table, he heard with his own ears what was being done. The matter has reached the outcome I predicted: now everything is somewhat calmed, and the matter has been postponed to the next assembly. In the meantime, they have decided that these innovators (as they themselves call them) should be restrained.</p>
      <p>What? The French party even threatens those others, unless they desist from their purpose, that they will eventually be forced to take harsher measures against them; they frighten them with that. In the meantime, I cannot deny that the other party is not motivated by love of the fatherland, but by the instigation of the imperialists. The leader, who cries out against the pensioners, is known to the council messengers to have received promises and assurances from the Stier (he is in exile in Milan) for 400 men, whom he is to lead from the PÃ¼nten to the imperialists, should a campaign begin.</p>
      <p>Thus, it seems to be of no use to both sides, and it is to be feared that it will not be able to last long. You will hear more from your son Heinrich, into whose bosom I have poured certain things that are not to be entrusted to letters. May God grant that your son enjoys you for a long time while you are alive and well, and that he may someday grow into his father's honors! Farewell, reverend father, with all your family.</p>
      <p>All of ours wish you well.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
      <p>Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant head of the church in Zurich, his lord and patron, to be greatly respected.</p>
