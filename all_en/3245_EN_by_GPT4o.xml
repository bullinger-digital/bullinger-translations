      <p>Our envoy has returned. I have explained the whole story to you through Johannes Liner from St. Gallen. The king received the envoys kindly and dismissed them, personally promising at last and at the final departure that he would act in this matter so that the cities would understand that the prayers or supplications of the envoys had been very effective. He had given a gift of 800 crowns. But the envoys refused. For, expressing their gratitude for the generosity, they testified that they did not accept gold or silver, so that the king might understand that they did not seek these things, but rather the safety of the brothers, who are our members and fellow believers of the same religion. Therefore, if the king wishes to show favor, let him spare our innocent and brotherly fellows; this would be very pleasing to all of us. Otherwise, the king had given a written response before departure, from which it could not be clearly understood what his will was; for he did not say that he would continue in his course nor did he say that he would spare them. The envoys of the princes, when ours came to Montbéliard, had already set out, as Count Georg of Württemberg told ours. The Palatinate, Hesse, Württemberg, and Baden are sending envoys. Please consider these things favorably, I implore you; I could not do more; but this is the sum of the whole matter. Farewell again and again.</p>
