    <p xml:id="regest1">Describes, at Bullinger's request, the procedure of the Lord's Supper celebration in Konstanz. Awaits his opinion on his proposed changes: The words of institution should be formulated in such a way that they cannot be misunderstood as an incantation. This should be followed by an admonition, as the old superstition is still deeply rooted. The wafers, the oral communion, and the kneeling at the communion table should be abolished as papist remnants. Awaits the judgment of Bullinger and Leo [Jud].</p>

      <p>You ask to be informed about the use of the Lord's Supper. But it is simple with us, although it does not lack certain papistic traces. First, in the evening, a sermon is given to the people. The next day, when the supper is to be celebrated, the same is done. After the sermon, men are separated from women, with the latter remaining in the church and the former entering the choir. The words of the supper are spoken according to Paul. Then, around the table, they receive the bread on bended knee from the minister and afterwards the cup from the same, after which others come forward as those leave. The words of the supper are not repeated. After the supper, what remains of the bread is kept in the minister's house, the wine is poured into a jug, and this is done without any offense to the church. During the supper, either "Te Deum Laudamus" or something about the passion and death of Christ is sung. When all is finished, the meal concludes with a very brief thanksgiving, and if time permits, a short song of thanks is also sung.</p>
      <p>But to speak freely with you: I would like the use of our supper to be changed in some respects. But you have conveniently reminded me to write to you about the manner of the supper; for I am eager to hear your judgment.</p>
      <p>First, I would prefer that the words of the supper not be spoken so superstitiously, lest they seem more like an incantation than an exhortation. Therefore, I would think the words of the supper should be spoken more extensively, and this to avoid the most harmful superstition of these words. Namely thus: Dear Christian people and believing children of God, we have learned and received from the Lord Jesus Christ (thus with some changes or additions the words would be spoken to vindicate Christian freedom and eradicate that most false opinion about the power of the words), namely, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when he was betrayed and sold [1 Cor 11:23], sat down at the table with the twelve, and he said to them: "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you, I will not eat it again" etc., as Luke has it [22:14-16]. While they were eating, Jesus took the bread, gave thanks and broke it, gave it to his disciples and said: "Take, eat, this is my body [Mt 26:26 par], which is given or broken for you, do this in remembrance of me [Lk 22:19]. Likewise, after the supper, he took the cup [Lk 22:20; 1 Cor 11:25], and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them and said: "Drink from it, all of you" [Mt 26:27]. And he said to them: "This is my blood of the new testament or covenant" [Mt 26:28; Mk 14:24], or: "This cup is the new testament in my blood" [Lk 22:20; 1 Cor 11:25] (I would vary these words for the reasons given), "which is poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins [Mt 26:28]. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me" [1 Cor 11:25]. "But truly, I tell you, I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of God, my Father" [Mt 26:29]. (I would also add these words, however there are those who refer them to the abolition of the Passover, not the institution of the sacrament.) "As often as you eat this bread" etc., as Paul has it [1 Cor 11:26].</p>
      <p>To these I would now add an exhortation: Here we see and recognize, dear brothers and sisters, what love Christ bears for us. He died so that we might live. He shed his blood so that our sins might be washed away. Therefore, everyone should believe that this also happened for him, and for this reason, thank God the Father from the heart, praise and glorify him, and as he recognizes that God has loved and served him, so everyone should love his neighbor and serve him in all good. Therefore, let no one deceive himself [1 Cor 3:18]; for as Saint Paul says: "Whoever eats unworthily," that is, without faith and love, etc. [1 Cor 11:27]. So now God wants a holy, brave people who are adorned with faith and love without hypocrisy. Whoever is truly minded of Christ Jesus and his community, let him go with joy of heart to the table of the Lord. And the faith in the death of the body of Christ, which he once gave into death on the cross for our sins, of which we are here in remembrance, may it nourish, renew, and satisfy your body and soul into eternal life. Likewise, the faith in the blood of Christ, which he once shed on the cross for our sins and of which we are here in remembrance by the Lord's drink, may it strengthen, refresh, and gladden your body and soul into eternal life. I would add something of this kind of exhortation in words, because the old superstition of the words still has deep roots in the minds of many.</p>
      <p>The bread with us is given round, not broken, which I would prefer; for this round portion does not lack its own superstitious thought. The bread is received by mouth, not by hand, by our people, which I would absolutely wish to be changed; for these are the most certain remnants of papistic abomination. Furthermore, I would like this to be changed, namely, that we do not eat the Lord's bread on bended knee, but with a certain progress and decent walking, so to speak, so that the bread is given to each one from one corner of the altar, and to those coming around the altar to the other corner, the drink is given. Men would be admitted first, then women, with the order beautifully maintained. I am concerned about these things; for I see that the devil would still like to keep something of the old idolatry.</p>
      <p>These things I write to you and to Leo, my dearest brother. But I await your judgment.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, I beg, because I was not at all able to reread.</p>
