      <p>Greetings. At the end of October, I finally received your letters addressed to me, which were undoubtedly broken open and read more than once and not by just one person, from Augsburg. I am very grateful to you for your faithful and brotherly advice, and I would prefer nothing more than to embrace it.</p>
      <p>But my personal affairs are currently such that I cannot embrace what you suggest without great loss; otherwise, neither fear nor danger would in any way hold me back from joining good men. Now I am where you know, and not without diligence, if it pleases God. There is nothing new except the complaints of many about the lost religion and freedom, which is peculiar to the Germans, that they begin to see only after the fact. There are also many who hope for the best. If I have received so much grace from the Lord, I will place all my trust in Him alone. The rumors are very harsh and dire; however, time will reveal where the thunderbolt is directed. Some say that the furies of Mars will not be very harmful this year. Italy is very pleased about the restoration of the church. The Saxons still resist the new ordinances. Duke Maurice and Cardinal of Augsburg have gone to Venice to see Italy and especially adorned Rome, perhaps to bring back new customs and virtues with them. In these days, Prince Philip of Spain, who arrived in Munich yesterday, will enter Augsburg with a grand procession, although I see no preparations made in his honor.</p>
      <p>I hear that many are not very joyful about his arrival. It is rumored here that the Swiss have forbidden Schertler from the province and that his affairs are in a deplorable state. I commend myself to your prayers and those of your people; if you can, convey my greetings to our exiled friends. You know how difficult it is for us to write now. If I could help the oppressed with my means, I would certainly do so, even at the expense of my own children.</p>
      <p>Greetings to all brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>I wrote to Christoph Froschauer three months ago about a defect in the Chronicles sold to me, namely the fourth folio; urge him to send it to me in Augsburg to Furtenbach the bookseller and write to him to give it to me. Farewell again, my soul. February 13, 1549.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my especially dear sir.</p>
