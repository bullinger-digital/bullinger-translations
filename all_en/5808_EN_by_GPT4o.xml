      <p>Greetings. We were very sorry, reverend father in Christ, to hear that you are not well; but because our own doctor, Gesner, instructed us to hope for the best, it somewhat alleviated our sorrow, and certainly, unless I were completely convinced that you had regained your health, I would refrain from writing in this manner.</p>
      <p>For what do I send except empty letters? Yet I send these very letters to make it clear to you that it was not the will but the material that was lacking for me.</p>
      <p>Mr. Vergerius, who stayed in Valtellina, came to you; from him, if there is anything about the council, you can understand it in person.</p>
      <p>It is written from Germany that Lord von Adre√ü has been freed and there is great hope that he will be fully restored.</p>
      <p>The same is written about the Fuggers in Venice.</p>
      <p>Those of our merchants who returned from Strasbourg affirm that peace has been made between the French and the English, but they are not clear on the conditions, because these things were first announced in Strasbourg as they were leaving.</p>
      <p>I have understood the state of the Glarus case from the acts and letters of the people of Glarus.</p>
      <p>I give great thanks to Mr. Lavater, a man who has deserved very well of me, who kindly noted those new things for our benefit.</p>
      <p>I do not write more now; next time, if I learn anything about Italian affairs, I will not fail in my duty.</p>
      <p>I pray to God that He may preserve you safe and sound for a long time for His church.</p>
      <p>Chur, July 19, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
