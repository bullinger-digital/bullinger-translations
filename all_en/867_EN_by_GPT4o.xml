      <p>My obedient, willing service, and whatever is in my power, is always ready and with utmost diligence for you. Gracious and especially beloved lord, I have gladly received your confidential letter along with the enclosed request from your son-in-law, my dear lord and friend, and I have accepted with heartfelt joy that you have also requested my humble services, even in such a small matter. And may God in heaven grant that I, in demonstration of true gratitude and filial highest love for your immeasurable great goodness and will, shown and proven to my friendly, dearly beloved father and me so manifoldly, etc., could and might show, repay, and reciprocate useful, brave, and beneficial service to you and yours, also with the help and extension of my goods and blood, so you would undoubtedly find and see that it requires no urging, but I would gladly and willingly do it for myself, of which you should always be certain of your high manifold merits towards me and expect nothing else.</p>
      <p>As for the matter for which your son-in-law is here, I hope it will be brought to a happy end in silence with his great benefit, but how and in what manner, you will be sufficiently informed by him.</p>
      <p>Finally, since I must not write to you at length, I hereby commend to your high loyalty and love the foolish, my pious dear father from heartfelt trust, likewise also myself, the poor little one, from a wholly well-meaning heart, further and urgently, with undoubted confidence that what you have done for us so friendly and faithfully so far, you will also do no less in the future out of special Christian love, and it will not go unrewarded before God the true, our heavenly Father, in whose fatherly protection I faithfully commend you along with your virtuous dear wife and all kin; to them, my humble service and friendly greetings. Dated March 21, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your willing and obedient Johann Vogler the Younger, etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and Christian lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, faithful leader of the church in Zurich, my very gracious and especially beloved lord.</p>
