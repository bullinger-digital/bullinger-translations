      <p> S. I give you, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, brother in our Savior Christ, most esteemed, if ever before, certainly now the greatest thanks for your truly sincere and Christian advice worthy of a man. You would not believe how much it has cheered me and undoubtedly also those in Memmingen in the Lord. I, while the messenger returned, thus tempered my opinion, which I intended to write to those brothers, so that I could easily yield entirely to yours (if it seemed to differ from mine). But everything turned out more fortunately than expected; although I did not conceal how much consideration should be given to the weak, if we see some being broken among these dangers, yet I said it is not fitting for anyone to teach or persuade such weakness, but rather to encourage everyone with invincible spirits to endure everything bravely for the confession of Christ, so that they may consider it far better and more glorious to die ten times than to concede anything alien to genuine Christianity to such pressing adversaries, and thus redeem even a little fortune or life itself for a few days, only to perish soon thereafter with great disgrace. My mind shudders to remember how much those who now call themselves evangelicals allow themselves and by what means they cast off the yoke of the cross of Christ, meanwhile flattering themselves most sweetly about their Christian prudence and moderation of spirit, about retaining, defending, and prolonging the kingdom of Christ in this way, which we will soon see utterly collapsed if it relies on such reed-like supports. Ah, let us pray to Christ, the author of our life and solid salvation, that we may despise and expend this fleeting and more than shadowy life with the most willing spirits for His cause, since He Himself first laid down His life for us, to pave the way for us again to the immortality of life by His death. </p>
      <p> We are indeed reserved for these times, in which, with the word of the gospel flourishing again, by which the new testament sealed with the blood of Christ is announced to us, our heavenly Father wants us to use our own blood to declare the power of the spirit given to us, triumphing most gloriously over the world and its prince through us, to whom we must show ourselves obedient and ready, lest we fall from that lot of the children of God, which may it not be, we wish, which although we experience here as hard in appearance, yet later and forever we will experience, so that this light and momentary affliction of the present may work for us an eternal weight of glory by the kindness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ. Ah, let us pray with the most fervent prayers, that for the glory of Christ we may both wish and be able to do and endure anything, where there is need. May the Lord preserve you with your whole household, whom you will lovingly greet with my words along with all good brothers and friends. </p>
      <p> All of ours greet you, especially my brother, sister, and wife. Farewell. Griesenberg, March 8, 1549. </p>
      <p> Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his far dearest friend. In Zurich, etc. </p>
