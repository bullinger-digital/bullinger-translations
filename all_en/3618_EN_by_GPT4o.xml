      <p>My willing service and all good things beforehand.</p>
      <p>Noble, steadfast, especially kind and beloved young lord, I assume the letter that I wrote to you and also to one of your brothers, young lord Caspar von Salis, and entrusted to Lienhart Lindiner, our school stipend holder, the schoolmaster Lindiner with you in Chur, to deliver to you, was given yesterday and seriously instructed, they have reached you, and if not, then inquire with the schoolmaster; for he has traveled up to his father, and since there are some circumstances that make me suspect, the aforementioned Lindiner has good knowledge of your boys' running away, I must worry that he has not delivered the letters to you and your brother. If that were the case or if he claimed he had lost the letter, the meaning contained therein is this: Hans and Hector came to me yesterday afternoon and requested that I allow them to travel up to Chur. I asked if they had your writing and command for it.</p>
      <p>They said no; but Caspar had written to them.</p>
      <p>And when I demanded the letter, it had no signet or seal, which made me suspicious, especially since the letter also stated that Hector requested that they be sent up to Chur to have joy; for I thought of what his mother's brother had shown me, how Hector, so thoroughly bad from the Etsch, where he had been sent, wanted to ride back home, etc. Since you also instructed me not to send the boys anywhere unless a priest fell ill and you wrote to me with your hand, then I should send them to Chur by a special messenger, and since there was no one present to whom I could entrust the boys, and I had to worry that something might happen to them on the road, especially in such a bad, unfaithful world, I told them they should stay at home; for I could not and would not allow it; yet I would write to you and young lord Caspar. If it was important to you that you desired it, and the matter was not false, you would write within eight days, I would let them go, yes, the way and manner as I would receive a report from you. So much has transpired between us and is partly contained in my two letters to you. With this, I intended that they should obediently wait for your decision and be content. But as I had eaten at night and went out with my two sons-in-law to take care of some business and returned home at night, my wife and people informed me that the two had boarded a ship, sailed up the lake, and sent a little letter to me through a maid of a baker, announcing their departure, etc. Dosy, who is with my son-in-law, Mr. Lavater, has also joined them, against and despite his master's will. And although I have always had to fear that Hector, due to his usual wickedness, would still cause some trouble as a remarkable Danus interturbator, I trusted Hans so well that I did not think he would engage in such reckless disobedience, but be more sensible (as he has enough understanding), than that he would cause all sorts of suspicion against them and us by such a reckless running away, etc. And if they preferred to express their disobedience in this way rather than wait eight days for your decision and my permission, I must let it happen, although I wish it had not happened and they had come to me in a different manner.</p>
      <p>For I will not withhold from you that if you perhaps intend to send the boys back down and entrust them to me, I will not take them into my house and care anymore. I kindly ask you to have satisfaction with my diligence, effort, and work that I have put into them; also consider that the boys, if they tell the truth, will say all good things about me and nothing bad about my people, unless they complain that we sometimes treated them harshly, but only to keep them in honor and discipline. I have never acted harshly, except that I have kept the right to act harshly, but not especially against Hans, but certainly against Hector. Yet I say no dishonor of him, except that he is a restless, very bad boy who needs much discipline, learning, work, and mastery, and so much that I am tired of it and it is too much for me, etc. However, I will in the coming days find out as efficiently as possible what they owe to the clothier, tailor, shoemaker, etc., also what they owe me or I owe you (since you have given me money for the matter). I will record all this, send it to you, in good hope that we will come to an agreement on the matter and remain good friends as before and not be idle about this. Their belongings will also be well kept until you indicate to whom they should be given. Finally, dear young lord, I ask you not to take offense at what I hereby show you with good intentions. You know that it is not good at all when children, raised tenderly, first also, when they come to other people, whom they like to follow, can notice that they have support among their own and follow their own inclinations and willingly comply with them. For in such a case, all discipline is unfruitful and spoils more in a short time on the masterless children than seriousness and proper discipline can often bring back to honor and right. When Hector thus desired to come up to Chur to have joy, it would have been much better if he had been given a more robust answer than being flattered and called, etc. I can tell you that, since he is with Hans, Hans has not improved much, also less diligent than before. I have indeed had to have more work and care; they have been out of the house a lot; for Hector cannot be still nor have peace.</p>
      <p>I had forbidden them many times to associate especially with the Welschen (some of whom are cheeky and unruly here); but Hector never left it and drew Hans after him, so that my wife often said to Hans: "I had hoped you would guide Hector; now I see well that he guides you," etc. And it will be necessary for you, dear young lord, to deal with the boys, especially with Hector, in such a way that when one deals with him rightly and properly, he does not have support from you or others who stand by him, but that he knows he must be obedient and do right; for otherwise, no one will willingly take care of him. For he is not yet of such a desperate sort that he cannot still be guided with effort and work, and I thought I had brought him on the right path, so he once again departs like a hare that sees the open sky. I also fear that my son-in-law, Mr. Ludwig Lavater, will not take Dosy back for such reckless disobedience.</p>
      <p>He also has much to deal with and work on with our people, so I worry that each one may make the other worse. And indeed, it is necessary to deal and speak with them seriously; for otherwise, they act like ignorant, misleading each other. Understand this well from me; for I do it with good intentions.</p>
      <p>God be with you and all yours!</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, 11th of June, in the year 1558.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I do not have the time, in many of my affairs, to copy the letter; take it as good. To the noble, steadfast Friedrich von Salis, and if he is not in Chur, to Caspar von Salis in Chur, his kind, dear young lord. Chur.</p>
