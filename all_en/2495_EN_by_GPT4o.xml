      <p>Greetings. When our Englishman here, an exceptional man and most revered in Christ to me, now returns to you, I did not want to delay further in writing to you. However, I regret that no joyful subject could be found, although I eagerly sought it. Sad news is reported from all sides; we seem to have fallen into iron ages; no good news is reported from anywhere. Impiety, sins, and wars prevail everywhere. Now, if ever, it is true: The world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful. What then should be done? Let us flee from here as much as possible, at least in spirit, since we cannot in body. But where does the wretched one flee? To the same one who strikes; nowhere else can these wounds be mitigated. I do not say this, man of God, to either teach or advise you, who through yourself breathe and understand Christ himself, but I return to this so that I may complain with you, indeed with God, about the evils that are happening. Cardinal Pole is in England and acts there as the legate of the antichrist; he has been received with the greatest honors by the clergy and the people; he was met with silver crosses, and almost sacrifices were made to him as if to some indigenous god. He is now the Archbishop of Canterbury and has recovered his paternal inheritance. The Pope, inflamed with the desire to reclaim the lost tyranny, has settled concerning the goods alienated from the church in that kingdom, and through him, it has been granted to profane men that those who have hitherto usurped them may possess them in peace and tranquility in the future. Now, as far as piety is concerned, I see that it is over for that church or kingdom. O wretched us, the vineyard, which was recently the Lord's, how it has been transferred to strangers! Would that this evil does not spread more widely.</p>
      <p>How many and what kind of spirits, I beseech you, do you think have joined the antichrists? What one woman has done, will the emperor not be able to do?</p>
      <p>Hitherto, it has not been done seriously; now, now at last, forces must be gathered, this evil must be conquered with force and violence, not with leniency or delay. Believe me, this is what the Roman Lucifer now instills in monarchs. But I cannot say more about these things due to pain; I earnestly commend those captive bishops to your private prayers and the church's; for I suspect that they will soon seal with their blood the truth they have confessed and preached. Thus far, the queen has not allowed, according to papal laws, that ecclesiastical men be judged by profane authority; they will now be handed over to the tribunal of the pope (as I suppose), and thus the impious will devour the more righteous. Let us therefore pray for Christian fortitude and constancy for those our best brothers. The affairs of the Sienese in Italy are most afflicted. Lord a Lasco in Friesland has been gravely attacked over the sacramentarian matter, yet he has conducted himself bravely and thus far stands firm by God's favor. Our senate has given no response to the ministers of the church about whether the Jebusites should be expelled from here or tolerated in the future.</p>
      <p>I suspect that nothing should be attempted while the Emperor lives. I beseech you, greet all my fellow ministers in my name. Our Zanchus sends you many greetings. Live in Christ and farewell. December 10, 1554, in Straßburg.</p>
      <p>Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and holy man, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the word of God.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
