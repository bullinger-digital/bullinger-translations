      <p>My poor means are at your disposal, etc.</p>
      <p>My lord, beloved brother. I recently wrote to you about the Appenzeller matter, regarding the prisoner Ulrich Eisenhut and another one who was accused alongside him, of having taken some money from the French years ago (although Ulrich Eisenhut had rightfully obtained it years ago) etc. Thus, they were both held in irons in a room. So, on the past Sunday evening, they let three women and a man in to drink with him. After the drink, he, in irons, gave them the slip at the door. The guards were standing inside the door, not paying attention. So, as he says, he opened one iron on his leg and thus pulled it up on one leg, and came through the mountain to Altstätten at around 10 o'clock at night, knocking on the gate. The watchman did not want to let him in. He requested to fetch the bailiff. Thus, he was let in, and the locksmith removed the iron from one of his shins. The people of Appenzell sent out 12 men to search, 3 to St. Gallen. When they came to Altstätten, he went to them on the street and greeted them, also telling the Appenzellers that they should not accuse anyone, but that God had helped him out by himself; and sent them the iron etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, yesterday, the Appenzellers sent 4 envoys here before the honorable council of the city of St. Gallen, Ulrich Broger, Bartholomäus Berweger, and two others, regarding the banner, to deny the rumors that have spread in their land, as they are aware, to mitigate the investigation.</p>
      <p>Also, the other prisoner was released on bail, and today, I believe, the judgment over Eisenhut will go to Appenzell etc.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I sent to Wil to arrange for my belongings to be transported to Zurich. And if nothing hinders, God willing, I will finally be with you before Christmas. The transport will be arranged in the week before Christmas. I have already held a gathering with my father Vadian and others in my house. Therefore, I will come. I ask you with my beloved ones, Rordorf and Hans Müller, to remind me not to forget my corn and oats along with wood. For I believe, on St. Thomas's Day at night, to be there.</p>
      <p>Whatever you have from Geneva or elsewhere, inform us, and greet us both, your wife and mother. May the Lord keep you. If you tell my lord Rösten about the Appenzeller matter, greet him for me.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, on Wednesday after Othmar's Day in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>A notable person, named Kaspar Zollikofer, former treasurer, who was with Vadian in Bremgarten and was in your house, sends many friendly greetings to you. He hesitates a little.</p>
      <p>To my especially beloved lord and benefactor M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
