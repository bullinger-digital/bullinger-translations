      <p>News came to me at night.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, it is written to me that the emperor is fresh and in good health, but has been in serious deliberations for some time, as is his custom. Also, Mr. Zangmeister writes to me, who has a son with the Elector in his chancellery, that the old pious Elector of Saxony is quite resolute and brave, and has also completely resigned himself to the fact that he will not be free again; for he does not want to accept the Interim, etc. However, he otherwise has a very princely imprisonment and free access, also great favor from the Spaniards and many others.</p>
      <p>Secretly, many soldiers are being recruited around Esslingen, Ulm, and in Württemberg, also many horsemen, and there is a common rumor that it is against the Confederates; yet nothing certain is known about this. My brother-in-law from Esslingen writes to me, also my dear brother-in-law Peter Schär; he has truly written to me at night, among other things, to offer you his very friendly greetings and willing service with heartfelt desire, that you would faithfully pray to God for him, etc.</p>
      <p>From Rheinfelden, it is written that the Interim was recently proclaimed at Richenau, where Count Jörg resides. It is a pity that one after another falls and for God's sake no one wants to risk anything more or become a martyr. Such lamentation is written about the apostasy from Esslingen and Württemberg, how all idolatry breaks in and takes over; if there were a hundred Jeremiahs, they could not sufficiently lament the misery.</p>
      <p>The world acts as if it had never seen or heard the gospel. Therefore, the end of their godless ways must come very soon, and God's rod hastens.</p>
      <p>Doctor Veltin in Constance is not at all the one you mean according to your description. He is quite a straightforward man, a very upright man, has been an organist in Freiburg, named Valentinus Fabri; cannot find that he has ever been in the Confederation. He has now completely obtained the preaching position in the cathedral, moves into the same house, has set his foot to stay in Constance. You have probably heard by now what happened between him and Öchsle before the governor in Constance.</p>
      <p>Last Wednesday evening at midnight, a courier arrived at the Rhine Gate in Constance; after a long time, he was let in and dispatched again at four in the morning; immediately rented another horse at Tägerwilen for many coins up to Merstetten and then gave several crowns to a peasant to take him to Baden as soon as possible. What he is doing there, one cannot know; the courier was still in Augsburg on Wednesday morning, rode off with several horses, etc.</p>
      <p>Our cathedral canons, when they give the corpus to the pastors in Thurgau and now need new pastors, have refused to provide the corpus, but have only agreed to give half a florin weekly, the same also now until St. John's Day; have openly let it be known that it will be different by then; they are so defiant, everyone is suspicious.</p>
      <p>So last Sunday, the 14th, the governor had the churches outside the city closed to the poor people in Thurgau in the morning by several of his servants, so that no one could preach there, and our Mr. Hans Jung, who wanted to preach there, had to leave. It is strongly believed that the governor is in league with the abbot of Kreuzlingen(?), without whose foreknowledge he could not have done such a thing. However, the peasants of Rickenbach and Egelschofen, who always went to the poor people's sermons and otherwise belonged to the parish of Kreuzlingen, have approached the abbot, asking him to provide and pay a preacher for them according to the peace of the land; he refused and said he has a good preacher and pastor in Kreuzlingen; they should go there, which the poor people strongly complain about; they want to go to the governor, and if they are not helped there (as they fear), they want to go to Baden before the common Confederates. Everything is gathering around the adversaries, whatever they know or hope; but everything will go, not as their evil minds, but as God wills.</p>
      <p>Given in great haste on the 17th of June, anno 1549.</p>
