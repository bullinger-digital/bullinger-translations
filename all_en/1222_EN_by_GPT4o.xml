      <p>It is true, venerable and beloved brother, that I wrote rather briefly recently; for I could hardly do more, as the messenger was in such a hurry to pass by my house that I could barely express that very thing, for which my mind was especially held in desire, nor did you... However, in very few words, I indicated those things which I was eager to know.</p>
      <p>As for the matter concerning a certain good man from Cremona, whether he came to me, you can justly attribute it to my tardiness; cease to doubt: the most excellent man responded very faithfully in this part to your will; he dined with me and delivered both your letters and the fifth Decade (a gift of great esteem to me) very diligently, for which gift I give you great thanks, my Bullinger; a heap of gold does not delight me as much as your writings do; gold perishes, from your writings I acquire a treasure that will last eternally. I have compiled an index for all the Decades, I am waiting at least to see if you will publish the sixth, so that by completing the index I may arrange it in alphabetical order.</p>
      <p>When my occupations allow, my incomparable brother and friend, write back; I sincerely wish that you would share with me what remains of your thoughts written on the Epistle to the Hebrews. Perhaps, unless forgetfulness delays me, I will send it back at leisure. From the people of Bern, I hear that the Turk is preparing a serious expedition against the Hungarians, and I do not wonder that the Lord is in this, to punish our ingratitude on one side, and the insane rage of the papists on the other, and to exact deserved penalties. I also hear that in Ghent there are envoys from the kings of England, Poland, and Denmark, who are faithfully advocating the cause of the Magdeburgers. But cursed is he who trusts in man. As for the Council of Trent, I can predict nothing good; but between the cup and the lip, many things fall, as they say.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ, King of Kings, strengthen our hearts with His spirit, so that we may stand firm in the solid knowledge of Him once conceived until the day of the Lord. I and mine are well through the Lord. Your uncle has somewhat recovered, by the grace of God; he was gravely ill, from which he can barely stand on his feet. What you ordered to be sent to Haller, I have sent; continue to order what you wish; I will comply to the best of my ability. Farewell. Nicholas von Diesbach, the president, Hemmann Haber, and especially your uncle greet you. Given at Lenzburg on the 25th day of March in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gervasius Scholasticus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, lord and brother in Christ, most dear by far.</p>
