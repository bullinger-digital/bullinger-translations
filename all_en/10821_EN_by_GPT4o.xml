    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the undeserved kindness shown to him during his visit, and for Bullinger's willingness to take care of his niece's [Dorothea Wirz] [marriage] matter. If the mayor [Heinrich Walder] is still of the same mind, swift action must be taken, as [Peter?] Stürler may be up to something.</p>

      <p>Ulrich Wirz to his Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Benevolence and peace from the Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>If it were not for your almost inexhaustible kindness, by which you attract and embrace everyone, known and experienced by me, I would never have taken on the task of writing to you, a truly learned man, but, conscious of my own laziness or ignorance, I would have rather remained quiet in my own skin. However, since you treated me with every kind of humanity when I was there, not only greeting me kindly but also receiving me with a most splendid banquet, and finally, in the matter of my niece, you did not wait to be asked but voluntarily offered and provided your support, effort, and diligence. You clearly demonstrated that you are not of the kind who help those who can give the most - whom Pliny in a certain letter thinks "do not bring forth their own gifts with sticky and barbed hooks, but seize others'" - since you, without any services from me, were so ready in spirit towards me and mine that you seemed to have received a benefit when you provided one. How, I ask, could I pass over your kindness to me in silence and not acknowledge it? Thinking that nothing is so ungrateful as to conceal what you owe when you cannot repay it, I decided to write these letters to you, however they may be, to testify my feelings and conscience towards you. And although if a contest of giving and returning thanks were to arise between us, I would certainly have immediately surrendered to you, as indeed the Graces themselves dwell in your house. But since you are greater than our efforts can aspire to, we repay you with imaginary services, as it were, by thinking well of you, speaking well of you, favoring you, and wishing you all good things. But if services are measured only by services and not rather by will and spirit, I confess I am not able to repay. But if gratitude is also returned in the very act of being grateful, I do not fear that I will at least repay what I owe in spirit itself. Since this spirit is entirely owed to you by the merit of your kindness, I now dedicate it entirely to you with the condition that it will never be freed.</p>
      <p>I now finally come to the matter discussed between us, about which I truly wonder why no mention is made of it anymore. I am eager to know whether it was begun under the wrath of Juno or whatever else it may be. For if your mayor is still of the same mind as before, I think swift action is necessary. For what that Bernese baron Stürler is plotting is uncertain. I certainly fear that he may be nurturing some monster.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue to love me as you have begun.</p>
      <p>Given on the 2nd of April in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor and ecclesiastic of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed lord.</p>
