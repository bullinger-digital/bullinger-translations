    <p xml:id="regest1">The letters he received from Bullinger concerning the Diet of Regensburg raise great hope; may God enlighten the heart of Emperor Charles [V.]. The Turkish army has taken parts of Hungary, even Vienna is in danger; everywhere attempts are being made to recruit troops, but the necessary means are lacking; Vadian foresaw this situation; misguided war tactics against this overpowering opponent, which can only be countered with united forces; Venice realizes this after negative experiences, as does [Francis I.]; if only King Ferdinand [I.] had learned his lessons from this in the last ten years! Vadian fears the worst and prays to God that He does not withdraw His favor and grace. The French King [Francis I.] is fortifying Turin; the Turkish fleet threatens Italy. Vogler [Hans the Elder?] will report further upon his return; has instructed Vogler to speak with him regarding Bucer. Greetings, also to the mayor [Diethelm] Röist and to [Hans Rudolf] Lavater. If Bullinger no longer needs the books sent to him, he should return them at Vadian's expense.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The letters you sent me concerning the Diet of Regensburg have given me great hope for the successful resolution of matters, which I believe were written for our consolation. You sent them to me through the master of the donkey, Andronius. We are also reminded that there is nothing to fear in Emperor Charles, provided that there are wise and prudent men among us who can advise him with great freedom and, as much as they can, guide him with counsel to promote the peace of Germany and to maintain the old dignity of this nation, which has been well deserved by his ancestors. May the Lord fill his heart with the spirit of knowledge and love, so that he seeks not his own glory or that of the popes, but the glory of God. Meanwhile, we receive sad and very certain news about the Turkish army, which has invaded parts of Hungary and is about to invade others, causing such a great dejection of spirits that even Vienna, that most splendid and vast city, urges the Emperor and his brother the king, as well as the estates, not to abandon it in its peril. Almost all the cities of the empire are sending out recruiters for soldiers; but they lack the money, which is the sinew of war, not to mention that the troops of Ferdinand are burdened with suspicion of bad faith and proven negligence, as they complain of neither receiving pay nor provisions. The mercenary soldiers have experienced this so much that it is certain that no strength can be recruited by his agents unless either the Emperor's brother or the princes and cities of the empire finally select auxiliaries at their own expense and send them to Hungary under their own auspices. I predicted in my letters to you some time ago that this would happen, which is now at hand; for to wage war with such plans as some have hitherto done against so powerful and terrible a tyrant is nothing other than to stir up hornets, as they say, and to make things worse. The Venetians see this, having been drawn away by some hopes from the faith they had given to the Turk, but they have reconciled with him again under the harshest conditions. The French King also sees this, who prefers to have the Turk as a friend rather than an enemy. If only the illustrious King Ferdinand of the Romans had done the same in the past ten years, he could have flourished in the name of the richest princes of Germany and with the highest authority and dignity towards his own, if he had deliberately abstained from the kingdom of Hungary and meanwhile used and enjoyed it as his own under the best conditions. I pity the vast kingdom and the heads that have hitherto held power in it, I pity the Christian blood, and I am weary that our inertia has opened such a window of license and hope to the Turk, that he holds the fortunes of both Hungarys in his hand, unless the Christian world deliberates with unanimous consent on restraining him and finally vindicating Europe. For as Germany holds the leadership among all nations with arms and soldiers, so certainly it will not suffice to bear the weight of this burden unless it is aided by the resources of other nations and peoples in the meantime. How coldly they promise us this in such great dissension of all orders, I can hardly say. In this great anxiety of affairs, I only pray to the Lord, by whose word he does not fail, and that he may cherish and protect us miserable sinners, who nevertheless desire to consult his glory, under the shadow of the wings of grace and power. For unless my mind deceives me, I see that this worldly scene will be changed by horrible events, unless we who remain are preserved by the help and grace of the Lord, who are lovers of the doctrine of Christ. But enough of this; for we understand from the letters of our people that the French King is fortifying the city of Turin in the Piedmont region with very costly works and surrounding it with new ditches and embankments, employing almost two thousand men in continuous work every day. Our people say that the Turk threatens Italy with a very well-equipped fleet; but the event itself will make us more certain of this. I did not want to keep this from you, my dear Bullinger, although Vogler could have reported more in person; but I have given him some instructions to discuss Bucer's business with you in my name. Farewell with all yours and ours; I wish to greet by name the consul Röist and my Lavater. In St. Gallen, April 11, 1541.</p>
      <p>Vadianus, yours in good faith.</p>
      <p>When you have used the books sent to you, choose a reliable person to return them, even at my expense.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious church of Zurich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
