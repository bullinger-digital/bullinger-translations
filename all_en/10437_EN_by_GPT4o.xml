      <p>To the honorable, pious, and well-learned Florus, dean of the chapter of Winterthur, our kind and dear friend.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, you will remember how at the recently held synod many inappropriate articles were brought against Mr. Hans, the city clerk. His written defense (justification) was heard, and we were appointed to review the proceedings. This has now been done. Therefore, it is our will and intention that you go to Winterthur, take the pastor there with you, and request the city clerk there to stand by you. Then, you three should act according to the attached instructions, as we trust you will.</p>
      <p>With this, we commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, July 1, 1534.</p>
      <p>Appointed by the councils and preachers of the synod.</p>
      <p>Florus, the dean in the Winterthur chapter, Matthias Hirsgarter, pastor in Winterthur, and the city clerk there should summon Mr. Hans, the city clerk, and earnestly, as necessary for peace, present the following opinion:</p>
      <p>The appointees of an honorable synod of councils, citizens, and preachers have little satisfaction and pleasure in his written defense (justification), especially due to his and particularly his wife's inappropriate behavior, which has been thoroughly and well reported, and they bear great displeasure because of it. However, since he was recently reprimanded by an honorable council or disciplinary authority in Winterthur, they will let it rest for now, trusting that the aforementioned honorable council will also diligently oversee him.</p>
      <p>We let him know earnestly that he and his wife should attend church and sermons more earnestly and diligently, avoid gatherings, especially those contrary to our true, holy, and well-founded Christian faith, and refrain from speaking ill, except when it happens in a harmless manner with honorable people or against poor or foreign respectable people, that he always strives for truth, avoids frivolous words, and also holds himself decently in terms of clothing, not going around in a red cap (headgear) and a short jacket, but especially in conversation with women, that she should be modest and chaste in her words, wear clothes that are appropriate for her, and lay aside vanity, remembering that they live from the sweat of the poor, from church property, and that my lords will not tolerate pride and vanity. And if he and she do not adhere to this, they should not expect anything else than that it will not be allowed in the future, as an honorable authority will not tolerate such vanity with church property.</p>
      <p>The dean and pastor in Winterthur should also pay attention to this, and if no apparent improvement follows, report it at the next synod, and Mr. Hans, the city clerk, should appear to justify himself. Everything should be done in good faith.</p>
      <p>Appointed by the synod: Master Conrad Escher, Master Itelhans Dumysen, Doctor Christoph Klauser, Heinrich Bullinger, Leo Jud.</p>
