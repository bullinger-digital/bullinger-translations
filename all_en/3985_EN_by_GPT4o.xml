      <p>S. Polonus, the bearer of this letter, is about to set out for your place and wished to be commended to your kindness, which he easily obtained from me. He is an excellent man, as far as I have been able to discern, with commendable learning, endowed with singular candor and sincerity. He pursues theological studies religiously, so that he may one day become a minister of the church without shame. Therefore, you will receive him according to your usual kindness and piety.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the Davidists of Brabant abjured their error and impiety before a very full assembly of the church and were reconciled to the church.</p>
      <p>You will learn the history of the event in detail from this man, whom I commend, if you wish, as he was an eyewitness. I had intended to send articles copied here and there from the author's books, but they were not at hand at the moment; when I receive them, I will send them at the first opportunity. We have heard nothing certain from the Diet; rumor had it that the French would restore Metz and other places taken from the Empire; but what will happen is unknown. Philip still has troops and they are not paid; they think the delay in payment is a pretext for devising new plans. If you have any news from friends, I ask you to share it.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with your wife and all yours. Basel, June 7, 1559.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter will communicate the Davidist articles. Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed and dear lord and brother.</p>
