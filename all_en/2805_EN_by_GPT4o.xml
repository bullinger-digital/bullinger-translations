      <p>Greetings. May God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, allow you, most kind sir, to spend this entire year happily and safely with your family. Although I have not received any letters from you for a long time, nor have I sent any, it seemed appropriate, when sending those of Vergerius to you, to add a few lines, so that my silence does not give you further reason to remain silent, especially in this dangerous time, in which, however, no new events are to be experienced. For among our people, it is customary, this is the only certain art, that the ministers of the church do not experience anything, although it would be in their interest to know certain things, so that they might better console, encourage, or dissuade, and if it were not for your great kindness towards us, by which you inform us of some things through letters (as has been done in the matter of the oath and in other things), many difficult matters would often be transacted without our knowledge, and we would be accused of negligence and overwhelmed by many things as unprepared and unadvised. However, having been warned and informed of many things through letters, we have been able to act more cautiously and wisely according to our limited ability. There is no danger here of perhaps revealing things that should be kept silent; for what Mr. Simpert once let slip in the case of the Locarnese was not done with the intention that others have seized upon. Therefore, both I and other fellow ministers ask you not to cease in your efforts, but to inform us of the present and future state of affairs according to your kindness, and to always commend us and our church. If we can do nothing else, we will assist you with constant prayers.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new to write about. We have heard nothing certain about the recent diet in Regensburg, except that Ferdinand requested auxiliary troops from the princes and states of the empire against the Turk, who is approaching Vienna, and that there are again remarkable negotiations between the French and the German princes, and that the Emperor's envoys have anticipated the French at the Roman pontiff, seeking his friendship, from which the French had to depart from Rome with their business unfinished, and that they later captured some of the Emperor's largest Spanish ships.</p>
      <p>In Zug, the Gospel is said to have been preached somewhat more freely by a certain priest, which seemed intolerable to the other cantons, who therefore appealed to the Zug council to prohibit it. Although they initially refused, the cantons eventually succeeded in having all books printed in Zurich, Basel, Strasbourg, etc., banned. The adoption of the Mechlinian into the cardinalate frightens us and threatens great evil (about which Mr. Gualther wrote to us briefly recently), namely discord in Switzerland, since the Pope and the Emperor have become friends, which will also be intolerable for the French, will cost much gold, etc. But we think you know more about this matter. There are rumors, God grant, what will ultimately come of it; either the Lord will punish our ingratitude or completely confound the wicked, which we have deserved from both sides.</p>
      <p>The great pastor of the church in Rottweil is about to renounce the pontificate and seeks that our magistrate receive him, which they will not deny, and therefore he will soon be with us; may the Lord grant that he truly and sincerely converts to the Lord with genuine repentance, lest, having put his hand to the plow, he looks back, not finding the wealth and honors under the Gospel as great as he had before, and is not fit for the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is a rumor among us that the Zurichers treat the preachers of the word excellently and with dignity, for they do not tolerate more severe rebukes, indeed they even imprison them; for the cases of Balthasar from Flach and finally Rudolf Hüsli have become somewhat known to our people. Hence we also fear that the malevolent among us will attempt something similar; for they have often tried to remove corrections from the church and even the preaching of repentance, even those of whom nothing of the sort was feared; but the French prevail among us in many things. Now the evangelicals and the French do not agree nor remain in one seat. People are very sensitive and intolerant of punishment, since we have become very anti-French, and they think even necessary and paternal rebukes are less bearable, since the Zurichers do not tolerate them. And it seems unworthy of the ministers and the ministry to immediately imprison ministers among nocturnal thieves, where they must hide, so that afterwards both they and the ministry are less effective, are a mockery to all, and everything is reproached to them; are there not other means by which those deserving punishment could be punished. Interpret these things in the best way, my Mr. Bullinger; for when they were discussing this matter these days, I said I would write to you about it; for from this occasion we fear a more serious attempt by the malevolent, although the causes may have required something else with you. But they now have this: "See, where other lords are so lenient with their priests," etc., although we object to your constancy in correcting sins. If it would not be troublesome, I would like to hear something about this as well. Finally, most learned sir, I ask you to send us that writing about... the Genevans; I will return it faithfully and immediately copied, and if there are any other such things to be copied. But I will cease to be a burden to you. Farewell, most kind Bullinger, and keep me commended to you.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, January 3, 1556.</p>
      <p>Jakob Rüeger, most devoted to your kindness.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich, his friendly, dear lord and fellow brother, in Zurich.</p>
