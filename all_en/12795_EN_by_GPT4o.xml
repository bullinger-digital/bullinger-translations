    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received]. He is confident that after God's chastisement, His grace will prevail. Without suffering and tribulation, people do not improve. Therefore, God must first punish them with the rod. It is also certain that the enemies will not escape the wrath of God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] All the cities have surrendered, only Lindau is still negotiating and will probably also give in. Frankfurt was taken by Emperor Charles V. News from Augsburg is expected hourly. The city, pressured to surrender, will probably also have to relent. Georg Frölich is completely uncomfortable there. The successes of the Emperor cause him and others much worry. Perhaps he will soon have to retreat to Konstanz. What a pity!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] On January 6, Tübingen (except for the castle) along with the bailiwick surrendered. However, the imperial occupation troops have not yet arrived. Erhard Schnepf was informed that a peace [between Duke Ulrich of Württemberg and the Emperor] was agreed upon. More will probably be known about this soon. The day before, the Konstanz council, as well as Blarer himself, wrote again to Hohentwiel, after the messenger sent to the Duke on [January 3] has still not returned. It is unclear why the Duke is holding him for so long. Perhaps he wanted to wait for the completion of the peace treaty.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The people of Ulm claim that Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse were the first, even two weeks before their withdrawal [from southern Germany], to negotiate peace with the Emperor and even offered him a large sum of money, which they intended to finance through a special tax of three pfennigs per subject. They are also said to have negotiated with Sultan Suleiman. Blarer cannot believe this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It is said of Duke Ulrich that he humbly pleaded for mercy with the Emperor, emphasizing that he had not behaved as badly towards him as Wilhelm of Cleves [during the Guelders Feud]. Moreover, he is said to have offered the Emperor four tons of gold!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] If what the people of Ulm report is indeed true, it shows how God has taken courage from the princes. What a disgrace! The peace treaties will certainly entail a prohibition on proclaiming God's word. Moreover, no one will be allowed to form alliances without the consent of the Emperor and King Ferdinand I: A clear violation of Germany's freedoms and the imperial order! One will also be forced to submit to the Imperial Chamber Court. Then all would be lost, for this would mean the complete restitution [of church property] and the reinstatement of priests and the mass. And even if [the Protestants] were allowed to keep their faith, what a miserable state that would be! Better to die!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Regarding religion, the Emperor has conceded nothing to the people of Ulm. His councilors have [only verbally] assured them that they may well remain with their religion or with the religion practiced by Duke Maurice of Saxony. However, the latter adheres to the [objectionable form of religion] of the Nurembergers; indeed, he is even said to have agreed to the Council of Trent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The situation is extremely bad. They are trying to eradicate the true religion and God's word, even if they do not admit it. It is pitiful!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Nothing certain is heard from the Elector and the Landgrave. On the previous evening, someone [...] from Augsburg reported that the Landgrave is pleading for mercy with the Emperor through Duke Maurice, but the latter will only grant it if the Landgrave appears in person. He will probably have to do so. How terrible!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Perhaps the current Emperor acts as a rod appointed by God (like the Babylonian King [Nebuchadnezzar] once did), which will punish and subdue all nations. But in the end, it too will be thrown into the fire.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The enemies are already rejoicing excessively, especially in [Habsburg Radolfzell], where they even announce that they will soon be in Konstanz. The servant [...] of a Konstanz glazier, Caspar [Stillhart], installed windows there for a canon [...]. When he demanded the money, the canon said: "I will not give you a penny! Rather, tell your master that I will soon come to Konstanz and pay him with a bloody head!" It keeps getting worse! But it is also said that "the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment" [Job 20:5] and that "pride goes before a fall" [Proverbs 16:18]. Now is the hour of darkness, but the situation will surely soon turn around.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] What was achieved [at the Diet] in Baden? Allegedly, the Emperor is in contact with the Five Places and has convinced them that he is wrongly accused of intentions he does not have. Therefore, it is feared that the people of Zurich will not achieve anything [for the cause of Konstanz] in Baden.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Just now, the Konstanz messenger sent to Hohentwiel on [January 3] arrived, albeit without a letter from Johannes Knoder to Blarer, but with a letter from Duke Ulrich to the council. The Duke writes that he held up the messenger with the intention of arranging a meeting of his councilors with the people of Konstanz in Stein am Rhein, so that the latter could express their concerns [regarding a peace treaty]. But everything has now turned out differently. Now he will return to his principality. From this, one can conclude that he has accepted a peace and does not want to disclose the associated conditions, even though the Konstanz council has asked about them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Several sources are currently reporting that the Landgrave is pleading for mercy with the Emperor through Duke Maurice. However, the Emperor will only grant it if the Landgrave presents himself in person, frees Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, and reinstates him in his duchy. Hopefully, it will not come to that!</p>

      <p>Friendly, dear lord and brother. I have received your letter well. I express my deepest thanks for your diligence and Christian care. I am well comforted and without doubt, the Lord will not abandon us in the end, and after enduring His chastisement, He will let His gracious face shine upon us for all good. These are long-standing and well-deserved matters: True earnestness for improvement does not come without heavy crosses and temptations in us. Therefore, it is for our best that the Lord keeps us under the rod. Our enemies will ultimately drink the dregs of the cup of His wrath. Praise be to the Lord forever!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>All the cities have surrendered, except for Lindau. It is still in deliberation, but it is to be feared that it will not hold. Frankfurt has also been taken by the Emperor. We are still waiting to hear from Augsburg at any moment about its status. They are being seriously pressured to act like the others; otherwise, they will regret it bitterly. It seems likely that they will comply. Letus is in great distress and temptation. It is expected that he should come up to us these days. He and several others do not trust the situation, as the Emperor gains the upper hand. They desire that we earnestly call upon God. It is indeed a lamentable misery that God makes us so ashamed before our enemies, although He can turn everything to honor again. Oh, that He would do so soon!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Tübingen, along with the entire bailiwick, swore allegiance to the Emperor on the next Tuesday, although the castle has not surrendered. No troops have arrived there yet. However, it is written to Schnepf that a peace has been made and already sealed. This will be announced in the coming days; how and in what form, we will soon learn. My lords have written again to Hohentwiel, as have I, because they sent a messenger there eight days ago to the Duke, who has not yet returned. We cannot think why the Duke is delaying so long, unless he perhaps wants to wait until the peace is concluded and everything is settled. We are waiting every moment.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The people of Ulm say much about Saxony and Hesse, how they were the first, and well 14 days before they left the land, to seek peace and negotiate with the Emperor, offering a large sum of money, namely 3 common pfennigs (which is a significant amount in their principalities); they have also called upon the Turks and negotiated with them, etc. But it is by no means credible in my heart for many reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It is also said of Württemberg that the Duke has most humbly sought mercy from the Emperor, invoking the mercy of God, who has never denied grace to any sinner; he has not acted as badly towards the Emperor as Cleves has; he has also offered 4 tons of gold to the Emperor!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>If it is true, as Ulm says, we must indeed see how God takes courage from the princes. Oh, what great shame and disgrace! Yet it would all be bearable if one did not also accept other conditions, through which one would certainly be driven away from God's word, unless God miraculously prevents it with grace. One must never make any alliances with anyone, unless the Emperor and King are also included! This is entirely against our freedom of Germany and the order of the empire. One must henceforth be obedient to the Imperial Chamber Court, which alone breaks the neck of all matters. For it already includes all restitution in full and the reinstatement of all priests and their worship, etc. Even if we were allowed to remain in our faith, God help us, what a misery it would be! Should one not rather die a thousand times than see such a thing!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Regarding religion, the Emperor has not conceded anything to Ulm. His councilors have assured them that they will be allowed to remain with their religion (as Duke Maurice holds). He adheres to the Nuremberg form. And it is said that he has consented to the Council of Trent.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>In summary: The situation is entirely precarious. They seek to eradicate the true religion and God's word; they only give it another name, thus blinding and allowing themselves to be blinded, which is pitiful.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Nothing certain is heard from Saxony and Hesse. Last night someone from Augsburg told me it is certain that the Landgrave is earnestly pleading for mercy with the Emperor through Duke Maurice, but the Emperor will not grant it unless he presents himself in person; and it is also believed that he will do so. These are indeed terrifying matters! God wants to completely destroy us before this enemy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I often think to myself, this Emperor must perhaps be the rod with which he wants to punish all peoples and give them his power, as once the Babylonian king (Jeremiah 21), and yet he must afterwards also be thrown into the fire like the rod.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Our adversaries rage and rave, jubilating and triumphing excessively (especially in Radolfzell), boasting against ours, how soon they want to be here in the city. Master Caspar, a glazier here, made windows for a canon in Radolfzell. And when he sent them through his servant, also to install them and demand the money, the canon said to the servant: "I will not give you a penny! Go, tell your master, I will soon be in Konstanz myself and pay with a bloody head," etc. There is no end to this boasting and defiance! But it is said: "The joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment," etc. Also: "Pride goes before a fall." It is now their hour and the power of darkness. It will soon turn around. I am without doubt. Let us prepare the people for improvement before the Lord, so that He may show His glory and majesty with great honor upon us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I long to hear what will be decided in Baden. There is a rumor that the Emperor has great dealings with the Five Places and convinces them how wronged he is and how he is not at all of this intention, as he is accused, etc., so that perhaps his persuasion will be effective with them, and yours will not be able to achieve anything fruitful, although I still have some hope that the dear God will preserve something and not let the enemy devour everything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Now comes the messenger whom my lords sent to Hohentwiel and who has been delayed for so long. He brings me no letter from Doctor Hans Knoder, to whom I wrote. It is thought he did not dare to do so. But he brings my lords a letter from the Duke. The Duke writes that he held up the messenger with the intention of sending his councilors to Stein am Rhein and also inviting my lords there to hear some of their concerns. But things have turned out in such a way that it will not happen this time; and now he will return to his principality. From this, one can well conclude that he has accepted a peace; but he does not want to disclose with what conditions and agreements. For my lords have desired to hear such; he avoids it, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Say many, many services, good wishes, and greetings to all good lords and friends, and exhort everyone to pray to God for us. Dated January 11, 1547.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Letters are coming from several places that the Landgrave is also pleading for mercy with the Emperor through Duke Maurice, etc. But the Emperor will not grant it unless he presents himself, and above all, Duke Heinrich of Brunswick must be released and reinstated. Hope and trust in the dear God, it will not come to that! May He not pour out His wrath so that we must see this misery.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. To his own hands.</p>
