    <p xml:id="regest1">The situation in Bern is favorable for the evangelical cause. Fearlessly, preparations are being made for the confrontation with the enemies. Great achievements are also being heard from Zurich. In the crisis of Solothurn, Bern and Zurich proved to be truly magnificent fighters for Christ; they have achieved nothing! The plight of the persecuted fellow believers is great, many are fleeing, others are enduring and remain steadfast in their faith. The people of Zurich should mediate in the dispute between Peter Huber and Hans Edlibach. Greetings. Christoph Froschauer has not responded to Megander's inquiry regarding the printing of his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Regarding our affairs, there is not much more to write to you. Everything is being conducted with a sufficiently honest and pious appearance. We are preparing and arming ourselves daily against our enemies, whom everyone knows are numerous. Yet, with an intrepid and invincible spirit, I hope that we will accomplish everything, or rather, with the grace and help of Christ, we will overcome. For I see, unless I am mistaken, not only our senate and people but also the common folk of our land and dominion are plainly ready and equipped for the glory of Christ and the defense of the fatherland. Here, I want to inform you of what we continually hear about my fellow citizens in Zurich, deeds indeed brave, magnificent, and worthy of Christ.</p>
      <p>In the matter of Solothurn, on both sides, that is, both we and you have shown ourselves to be the most ardent patrons and defenders of Christ, especially if what is being said is true, our treasurer and Habius, those excellent orators. Thus it happens that the magistrate, a hypocrite, assumes the protection of Christ and the gospel. Christ suffers and is very miserably expelled and proscribed from the city at Solothurn, and his professors in a fair number are migrating to us, to Basel, to Biel, and to our countryside here and there. Oh misery, oh calamity! Woe to the man through whom these things have been done and neglected! Moreover, there are those, I say, who are accused of being authors of sedition, who do not want anything to be done about their affairs and cause, nor a day to be appointed for action, unless Christ has a place among the people of Solothurn. Such has been the constancy of men until now. This is finally to profess Christ. God must be prayed to, that he may strengthen and confirm those men.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, dearest brothers, Peter Huber, our assistant teacher - I do not know what cause or business he has with Hans Edlibach, the governor of Frauenfeld - earnestly asks and requests you, that if it can be done - it can indeed be done easily - you act and accomplish with your writings and prayers with the same, that if he has any right against the man, he may yield, lay down the cause, and settle the business, so that the poor man is not continually agitated in this way and forced to expend and consume his own, otherwise being extremely pressed by misery and poverty. I also ask you very much and earnestly on behalf of the man for this matter, and I commend it to you so much that you do what you can there. You can indeed do much. I ask that you allow nothing, nothing to be more important to you, so that he may feel that our writings to you have not been ordinary.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 23, 1533.</p>
      <p>Greet the custodian, Pellican, Theodor, and all the brothers. Our church brothers greet you very much.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Christopher has not yet responded to the request about printing the commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians written by us.</p>
      <p>To Leo and Bullinger, his dearest brothers in Zurich.</p>
