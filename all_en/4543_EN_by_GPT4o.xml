      <p>S. D. The Baden assembly has concluded.</p>
      <p>In this, with incredible stubbornness, insolence, and obstinacy, the people of the canton of Glarus renounced the alliance, declaring that they would have no more association with them. Mediators intervened; but these proud ones made light of it.</p>
      <p>Finally, articles were drafted by the mediators, the chief of which is that religion and the alliance should remain intact. Another assembly is scheduled for January 6th in Baden.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, peace should be maintained on both sides.</p>
      <p>We are now waiting to see what will happen. On the 8th of this month at 2 o'clock at night, a certain papist, driven by fury, seized a lance and ran from the village of Glarus to Schwanden; there he called to arms. Soon, with the banners raised, the evangelicals formed into a battle line, and because he shouted that the enemies of Glarus had suddenly attacked and slaughtered all the people of Glarus, they hurried to Glarus to fight against the enemies. In the meantime, they realized that everything was false.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he was captured and brought to Glarus in chains. There he lethally wounded three other men, among whom was the bailiff Hesse.</p>
      <p>Now he is thrown into prison.</p>
      <p>We do not know what will happen.</p>
      <p>In Swabia, Bavaria, and the emperor's territories, the Baalist priests are raging excessively and are promising themselves some kind of happiness soon, and certain seeds of war have begun to be sown in recent days between Schertlin and Ludwig, Count of Oettingen, etc. In Saxony, an assembly will be held in Naumburg by the princes for two main reasons: 1. to newly subscribe to the Augsburg Confession, 2. to deliberate on the response to be given to the council, which the pope, the emperor, the French, the Spanish, etc., are planning.</p>
      <p>The Elector of Saxony did not want to go there except under these conditions: 1. that no mention of any alliance be made, 2. that nothing other than religion be discussed, 3. that no one be condemned; he absolutely does not want good men to be condemned with such lust as has been done so far, etc. If a civil war were to arise between the Guise and Navarre, Navarre would act most wisely if he sent a legate and letters to the Swiss, through which he would explain his intentions. Good men have advised me to write this to you; if he does not do this, he will be considered a rebel and a traitor and an invader of the kingdom (as they call it) and thus a robber, etc. I earnestly ask you to share with me the most clear letters of Mr. Philipp on the matter of the supper written to you. I have decided to publish those he wrote to me at the urging of many good men; I would like yours to be included. Farewell.</p>
      <p>I wrote this very hastily.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you and all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 15.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, pastor of the church of Geneva, esteemed and dear lord and brother. [Geneva]</p>
