      <p>Greetings. The reason you have not yet received any letters, most illustrious man, is because of Peter Mechlin, who has long since received the items I recently wrote to you about, namely the Württemberg Confession, the booklet on neutrals, and the German-written booklets against those who have expelled ministers of the purer doctrine from their churches, the comparison of the papacy with other heresies that have ever crept into the Church of Christ. All of these, without a doubt, Froschauer will receive with the next shipment along with the rest pertaining to Theodor, Pellican, and Frisius. I have inscribed the names on each package so that Froschauer can see to whom they pertain. We have no certain news of new matters, as everything is full of vain rumors. However, it has been reported to our magistrate that Moritz, that good man, after making peace with the emperor, set fire to his camp near Frankfurt, in which he left more than 300 soldiers afflicted with illness and various diseases to perish in the fire, and also the war artillery, which came into the hands of the people of Frankfurt. Hence, they are said to be pressed by a new siege from the Margrave of Brandenburg, whom they say Schertlin is seeking from the French with a most select army, so that with combined forces he may safely attack the imperialists and finally put an end to the German war.</p>
      <p>Moritz, however, is said to be moving his army directly to Hungary, which is being troubled by the Turks. Vienna is being fortified with a German garrison against the Turkish incursion, about which we have heard nothing for several months from Wolfgang Lazius, whom we nonetheless do not doubt to be at the court of King Ferdinand.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Hastily given in Basel, August 17, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Conrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
