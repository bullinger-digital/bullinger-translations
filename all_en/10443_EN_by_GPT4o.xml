    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's commentary on the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians was received from the bookseller Christoph Froschauer; he would like to know when the commentary on the 2nd Epistle to the Corinthians will be published, in order to have the two works bound together. Bibliander's commentary on the Prophet Nahum demonstrates great scholarship, but Haller wished that he would not treat the prophets individually in pieces, but rather in biblical order. Captain Hans Junker was arrested in Aargau for slandering reformed Bern in the presence of the French envoy and his entourage and was supposed to be brought to Bern, but escaped from prison. How does Bullinger like the request of the letter bearer? Haller not at all.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>What I had requested through our messenger regarding the Corinthians, dearest Heinrich, the bookseller sent, namely the first epistle up to the end - I would be more pleased to know when the second will be given before the fair, as I would arrange to have it bound into a proper booklet. In chapter 11 of this, I read about the Eucharist, which I had reminded from Bucer's booklet, so that they do not need a response. Christophorus also sent Bibliander's work on Nahum, which certainly makes his uncommon scholarship known to the world. You should strive to treat the prophets not in fragments anymore, but in order, since he can do so with such great success.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is a certain captain from Rapperswil, called Hans Junker. When he had proclaimed in many ways and places that the Bernese have a heretical and dog-like faith, he happened to come to Aargau with the French envoy from the Baden assembly. When our senate learned of this, they ordered that the Aargauers bring the captive to our city. Since they could not do this safely due to the French entourage ("wherever the corpse is, there the eagles will gather" [Mt 24, 28]), they sent envoys to us to ensure that we take care of bringing him. Both French envoys came accompanied by 50 horsemen, and when they sought pardon with many pleas, the senate dismissed them (for they had already sent a cohort to bring him from Aargau): they would not forget their pleas while the case was being considered. Meanwhile, before the Aargau envoys and our cohort could arrive there in Aargau, he escaped from his chains, but by whose authority is still unknown. These are the news with us.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, whatever our messenger has done with you, write that it pleases you; for it displeases me. If there are any printed on the second epistle to the Corinthians, I wrote to Christophorus to ensure they are sent to me through you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>5th of July.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
