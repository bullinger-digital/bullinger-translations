      <p>The letter you sent to me from ZÃ¼rich, most honorable Bullinger, to be forwarded to Johann Birkmann, written on August 20th, was received and I ensured it was delivered to him in Frankfurt the following day. However, it reached me later, namely on September 8th. Around the same time, I sent one to your magnificence, in which, as much as my feverish afflictions allowed, I communicated to you what I knew about Saxon and English affairs. Later, we also wrote to John Butler, the Englishman residing with you, about the entire state of England or rather its conflicts, so that he might inform your magnificence and other excellent men concerned about the outcome of the English disturbances, of the most serene King of England's victory against the rebels and rioters, which is more convenient than desirable.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we also heard that those others, conspired in impious confederation to restore the old superstition, have paid the deserved penalties for their sacrilegious rebellion, namely about three thousand were slain in battle, and the remaining multitude fled in disarray, not pursued too persistently or far. The instigators and deceivers of the ignorant populace are being dragged to punishment with great vengeance and inquiry. In Scotland, there is such a scarcity of all things and such lust and greed of the French soldiers towards those they ought to protect, that the Scottish people trust they will obtain more compassion and integrity from the English enemies than from the French allies, and thus they expect the arrival of the English more eagerly than they fear it.</p>
      <p>Since I have received nothing certain from friends about the French efforts at Boulogne, I would like to ask you, as you are allied and connected with the French and partners in this war, to inform me of the facts.</p>
      <p>However, among such dissimilar persuasions and studies in religion, indeed against you prejudices and punishments sanctioned against those who feel with you in religion, I do not see how a consistent reputation of probity and faith, which is the foundation in all human actions, can exist. I offer all my duties to your magnificence; I ask that you greet Butler and Christopher Alesius, the Englishmen currently residing with you, in my name.</p>
      <p>May you fare excellently well.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, September 27th, 1549.</p>
      <p>Christopher Mont.</p>
