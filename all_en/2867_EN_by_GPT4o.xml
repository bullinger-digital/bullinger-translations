      <p>Greetings. I truly owe you, my father, great thanks for your golden little book, which you sent to me, in which I find nothing not worthy of the highest praise. For although you may perhaps seem to some to go beyond the argument in explaining the dual nature in Christ, yet because this is the foundation of the strongest and most solid argument against our adversaries, that is, the enemies of truth, the whole treatment seems to me not only very useful but also very necessary. Nor do I doubt that you have gained great gratitude from the whole church for this work of yours. But I also trust that even if our adversaries do not appreciate the matter itself, they will certainly find your singular modesty most pleasing. However it may be, whoever approaches this cause as fair judges, I hope, will support the truth. I have not yet seen the book of D. Bernardino. As for me, although I feel that I am one from whom nothing but very little can proceed, yet, if necessary, I will gladly contribute my part and hope to bring at least an excellent will. But may God grant better things. I wish, I say, that the Lord our God, having mercy on His church, may unite us in Himself, so that we may fight against common enemies rather than destroy each other mutually. To this end, it would contribute not a little if not everyone would rush into the field indiscriminately, but you veterans with your authority and fairness and modesty would temper and moderate the heat and fervor of the younger ones. For you know how many things are often said imprudently and inconsiderately in that rush, which have this one result, that minds are more and more irritated, and those who are weaker completely fall apart. The goodness of our cause is clear, open, and exposed to the eyes of all. It remains that we, with a certain modest and composed manner, win over those from our enemies who, fascinated by prejudices or error, have not yet been able to see the light. The rest will either be forced to be silent or will render themselves odious to all.</p>
      <p>But enough of these things. I have nothing new to write about our affairs, except this one thing. A certain Genevan, not the least of those exiles, had openly accused our Viret of a great crime, as if under the pretext of ministry he had solicited one of those wretched ones in the Genevan prison, who were subjected to punishment, to make a false accusation against some. He was summoned to court, and when he had in vain turned himself into all shapes to escape judgment, he was finally condemned by a just judgment, confessed his guilt, and pleaded before the leaders. Thus the Lord asserted the innocence of a very good man, and began to openly reveal the wickedness of those people. This matter will perhaps cause some to finally understand what kind of people they are whom they have undertaken to defend, and what kind of people they are from whom they so greatly abhor. May the Lord repay your most illustrious senate and all of you for the labors you have undertaken in such a pious cause, and further, as we hope, will undertake. May the same Lord our God, in whose hands are the hearts of princes, bless your most holy endeavors, and unite the minds of us all in Himself. These truces agreed upon between the Emperor and the king, although I do not doubt they will be little firm, yet, as I hope, will accomplish something towards obtaining this union on both sides.</p>
      <p>For why indeed has He who had separated them now joined them again, unless to attack Christ? Many sinister rumors about the Turk are also brought to us, which if true, I see all things brought to the utmost danger. But the judgments of the Lord are hidden and must be awaited by us with patience in fear and trembling. If He reconciled us when we were enemies, much more now being justified by His blood shall we be saved by Him from wrath. Let us only strive that, when His wrath is kindled, we may be found faithful, and these judgments of God in the world's perfidy will not only not overwhelm us, but will also raise and confirm us. In France, you can hardly believe how great the harvest is and how great the increase of churches. If you except three or at most four from their number, who have the most power, the rest almost openly testify that they abhor papism; many also from the adversaries are offended by past cruelty. Certainly, the state of affairs seems to be impending, so that a certain hope of holy liberty seems to appear from afar. If once it is obtained from the king, do not doubt that the tyranny of the pope will collapse there in a moment; so much has the number of the faithful increased in a few years. There is no doubt, however, that Satan is preparing his utmost, which is why it is fitting to be more solicitous and to pray more ardently, that he may crush him under our feet and complete the work he has begun. Farewell, my father, with your whole family. May the Lord Jesus preserve you and continue to bless your holy labors. I bid the whole church to be well and to fare well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, March 20th.</p>
      <p>Theodor Beza, truly yours.</p>
      <p>Our Wilhelm is well and is most commendable to us.</p>
