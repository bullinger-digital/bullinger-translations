      <p>Greetings. Certainly, the republic and your church have suffered a grave loss with the passing of the most illustrious man, Lavater, as with his death alone, many noble virtues have been extinguished; but by the singular grace of the Lord, it has happened that another, equally zealous in piety, has been appointed in his place; for he is known to many of us. Although he is unknown to me, I wish you to congratulate him on his office and dignity with my words and to pray for the blessing of the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>I infer that the imperial assemblies will proceed, as Margrave Karl is preparing to attend them. Ferdinand initially attempted to suspend the matter of religion with the priests; but since the other estates refuse any deliberation on the Turkish contribution unless the matter of religion is first settled, Ferdinand, having sent away the priests, joins the princes, aiming for a decision in the colloquy on this matter that would be desirable, unless he is doing this more as a pretext than out of a genuine desire to seek the truth. Margrave Albrecht has passed away, I do not know whether to the good or ill of Germany. Meanwhile, the papal war, like a fire, is gaining strength. The French king informed King Philipp by letter that he indeed intended to keep the truce made with the Pope; but because the Roman seat is now under pressure, he is compelled by ancestral religion to bring aid. Philipp replied briefly that he is quite content that the French king has preferred war to peace. Meanwhile, he attempted to seize Hedingen and some other places through cunning and treachery, but in vain, and now he makes incursions and raids into the garrison of Diettenhofen and the lands of Metz, and the poor farmers bear the blame of the princes.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with all your people. Basel, February 1, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
