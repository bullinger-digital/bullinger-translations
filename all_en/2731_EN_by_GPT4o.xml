      <p>I am writing now, most illustrious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, to open the way to your friendship for this brother of mine, a diligent student from Tübingen, subject to the most illustrious Lord Otto Heinrich; receive him, as you are accustomed to do with others who are commended to you in the name of piety; make him understand that I am loved by you.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greetings to you with your whole family, school, and church. Pray for me; I am still staying in Reutlingen and not idle; you will see soon.</p>
      <p>Reutlingen, 18th of September, 1555.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother. Zürich.</p>
