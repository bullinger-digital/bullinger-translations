    <p xml:id="regest1">Is reliably informed about the Bernese [and their attitude towards Bucer], but does not wish to comment further. Bucer returned without a response from Luther, although he followed the seriously ill man as far as Gotha; instead, a letter from Melanchthon is now expected. The Schmalkaldic League states reject the announced council and declare in their articles attached to the [Augsburg] Confession and its Apology the Roman Church as the realm of the Antichrist. Has learned that Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony], [Philipp of] Hesse, and [Ernst of Brunswick-] Lüneburg are well-disposed towards the [Swiss] churches, and is confident that nothing stands in the way of unity with Luther and Melanchthon, although there are unreasonable people on both sides. The Baselers do not necessarily want to be involved in the response requested by Bucer to his letter [No. 939] and are willing to overlook questionable aspects in his "Retractations" with patient love.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The matters of the Bernese are as certain to me as their truthful letters and what they have entrusted to be announced, confirmed by letters. What else can I say? I will remain silent on other matters. Indeed, I ask the Lord for a humble, upright, simple, and united spirit for us.</p>
      <p>Bucer, a man most diligent in establishing concord and seemingly most sincere to us, returned a few days ago again without a response, as Luther is so troubled by kidney stones that not only is his urine stopped for sometimes 10 whole days, but also his voice. The Elector was intent on resolving the matter, and for this reason, after Luther left Schmalkalden, he sent Bucer, who followed him as far as Gotha, finding him much weaker than before. Therefore, he had to leave with the matter unresolved. Then the task of writing to us was given to Philipp. We are therefore expecting this.</p>
      <p>Regarding that assembly: The princes and cities do not recognize the council convened by Paul III as a Christian and free council, as the churches had demanded. And they have responded to the legates of the emperor and the pope, writing to other monarchs that they will not fail those who are to deliberate on the proper establishment of church matters. Their agreement on doctrines is contained in the subscription to the original confession and apology and two newly added articles, one on the papacy, the other on the jurisdiction of bishops, where it is clearly demonstrated that the pope and bishops generally administer the kingdom of the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>We understand from the certain letters of good men that the Elector, Hesse, and Lüneburg are so favorable to our churches that this matter affects me wonderfully, especially when I compare this with the diligence they apply in restoring the church of Christ and advancing the kingdom of the Antichrist. And who among the pious would refuse to be part of such an excellent institution, whose foundation is in truth, especially after understanding that such pious men and lovers of Christ's truth desire nothing more? What kind of person Luther is in this matter, I think you have sufficiently understood from his letters, which I sent to you. He seems to me to be such a person with whom I could enter into an indissoluble pact and friendship concerning the truth he has professed so far. I do not feel much differently about Melanchthon. Then I see some rather coarse individuals, even among those who seem to think themselves something, who do not affect me equally. But such people are also found among us, who, if I could wish for anything, I would wish they had a better opinion of church concord. Let us hope.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Bucer asks that we respond to the letters he sent us when leaving Schmalkalden. Therefore, if you wish to respond by yourselves, you may indeed do so; but if together with us, you can briefly express your mind to us. What is contained in his letters does not concern the Basel brothers. We would indeed have preferred that the "Retractations" had never seen the light of day because of some overly irritable individuals, and because there are some things interspersed that we would not have wanted. But since what is done cannot be undone, all things seem to be considered in good spirit, and the friendship of good and pious men should not be broken or despised for that reason. You know that the wisdom which is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. Since this is true, I certainly see how it bears and overlooks in brothers, lest there be division. Therefore, whatever they may be, with whom we once had some fraternity, now even if they have offended, it is ours to overlook and endure, lest it be our fault if friendship breaks in the future, as we could have corrected their error through patience. If only you could see with your eyes and touch with your hands what kind of spirit I have here, which I cannot express in words. I know you would be moved to confirm my affection, not to say more. If evil is not to be returned for evil, but good for evil, where then will there be room for charity among even pious men? For we all fall and sometimes sin against our neighbors. What will happen then if one is not more sensible and placable than the other? Therefore, let charity bear the palm in our hearts, and we will never be forsaken by the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and the brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 27, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest.</p>
