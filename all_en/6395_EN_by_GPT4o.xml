      <p>S. D. You seem to be quite anxious, brother, because of your letters that were lost or sent elsewhere; but I advise you to be assured; for I think I have received them. They were dated February 10th and contained 3 pages. I inquired about all of yours, to be more certain, and I received more than you might know yourself, namely dated the 4th, 10th, 13th, 19th, 21st, and 25th of February.</p>
      <p>Therefore, from the letters, I think there is no danger to be created for you. If our magistrate received those addressed to the magistrate, I do not know, yet I do not think they received anything.</p>
      <p>Your letters dated February 10th were brought by the son of the host to the Sword; he said, when I asked from whom he had received them, that he did not know. As for the circumstances, however, I thought they were brought from Lucerne; but I affirm nothing certain here; it is enough for me that I received them intact, not unsealed, etc. (I would not want the enemies to have read your complaint).</p>
      <p>Now, as far as the business of Gallicius is concerned, I do not think it will be a harm to you or your ministry if you teach in that church, in which a colleague teaches... indeed accused, but with his case discussed, he was freed or absolved by the magistrate. Such cases often occur in our synods: someone is accused of a crime, is ordered to clear himself and defend his innocence before the magistrate. If he is absolved by the magistrate, even if a serious suspicion remains, he is not removed from office nor expelled from the synod.</p>
      <p>Legal satisfaction satisfies everyone. What else, I pray, would you do in a similar case?</p>
      <p>Recently, I wrote that a diet was convened by our people at Baden for March 4th, to consider calming the disturbances stirred up among you. May Christ grant that the matter is happily settled.</p>
      <p>In those letters, I asked to be informed by you, what you have concerning Italian affairs, and I am still waiting for what you will write about that matter. What we have here about French affairs from Geneva and about the business of the alliance from Bern, you will find enclosed in these of mine; return those sheets. From Germany, I have nothing after what was written to me, which I gave in my last to you dated the 23rd of this month.</p>
      <p>Yesterday letters were brought from England, dated in London on January 18th, that a parliament was held and thereupon decided to punish those who break the law and marriage with life and limb. The matter of adultery has also been established by the queen in Scotland.</p>
      <p>The English are settled with Philip and Antwerp, etc., and the goods are going again as of old, and they are always upright with the religion; they also have...</p>
