    <p xml:id="regest1">With his planned response to Cochläus, Bullinger might achieve more than the Lutherans with their polemics. [The Basel Cathedral Chapter in Freiburg] seeks support from Emperor [Charles V] and is represented [at the Diet in Speyer] by the Abbot of Murbach [Johann Rudolf Stör], whom Gast has known for years. That Myconius, in a sermon, tried to prove with a quote taken out of context that Oekolampadius taught nothing different than Luther, is probably due to his senility; when Gast pointed out to him that he would have been better off referring to Theodor [Bibliander's] preface [to the letters of Oekolampadius and Zwingli] or to Vadian to mediate the divergent views, he reacted irritably. Sends his Anabaptist book [“De anabaptismi exordio”] and announces his edition of Oekolampadius's sermons on some Psalms, to which he might add more. [The Apocalypse commentary by] Primasius is in print and will soon be delivered to Bibliander. The writings of Luther ordered by Bullinger are not available, but Gast can lend them to him upon request; he will send him the books still in print. Greetings. The Emperor is in Speyer, where abbots and bishops, but no princes yet, are gathering. Bucer also seems to have recently struggled in vain in Colmar. Further greetings and thanks.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>You act rightly and in a Christian manner by responding to Cochläus, an old and not bad man, whom I have known for many years. Who knows whether your modesty and gentle spirit might achieve more than all the Lutherans with their bitter remedies?</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write about our priests here. They adhere to the Emperor and seek assistance from him. The Abbot of Murbach, not a bad man and well-known to me for many years, is deputed to the colloquium. I do not know what they intend to do.</p>
      <p>I attribute much to the senility of Myconius, who, slightly provoked by someone over the Eucharist issue, publicly handled the matter with a heated spirit, wishing with good zeal to reconcile Luther and Oecolampadius - without any mention of Zwingli. He publicly read a passage from Oecolampadius's letters, saying: "See if Oecolampadius does not say the same as Luther wrote." He had brought up a passage from a letter - I do not recall which letter it was - but omitted the following words, which clarified the preceding ones. After the sermon, I approached him and asked what the purpose of this sermon was. He said, "I wanted to criticize the foolishness of some, whom I cannot satisfy." I said, "Why did you not bring up words from the preface of our Theodor, who also tries to reconcile almost all writings on this matter, or from our Vadian?" He soon began to argue with me, as if I were always disapproving of his sermons on this matter. I did not want to argue with him in words; for he often speaks very well on this matter and does so publicly. I attribute much to his old age; for he has a weak memory and is easily irritated. For one who listens to flatterers, it is not surprising that he often says things for which he later regrets.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am sending you my Anabaptists, partly taken from your books and those of others, partly I have seen and attended all those colloquiums. I translated them into Latin, wanting to exercise my style. I now have some sermons of Oecolampadius on the Psalms under the press, which I took from his mouth. If they do not displease you and others, I will attempt the same on other Psalms. I will soon send that little book as well.</p>
      <p>Our Theodor will soon have Primasius on the Apocalypse; for it is under the press.</p>
      <p>I believe the books of Luther, which you wanted, do not exist. If I do not find them, if you would like to use them, I would send mine, if they could be of use to you; for I have almost all of Luther's works published so far. You will soon have the books that are under the press and those that are published, once they are completed.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. February 15, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius. You will greet Theodor and Pellican in my words.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is in Speyer. He brought 150 horsemen with him. Abbots and bishops are riding in; no princes are present yet.</p>
      <p>What do you think Bucer did in Colmar these days? He initiated various practices, but almost nothing was completed, and he labors in vain.</p>
      <p>My wife is very grateful to you; she will soon send something to your wife as well, so as not to be ungrateful for so many benefits received.</p>
      <p>Farewell again with your wife and children, whom mine also greets.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
