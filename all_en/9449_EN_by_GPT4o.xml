      <p>Greetings. Since I missed the opportunity to send a message to you last week, I am now sending a letter along with the prodigy seen in Schuls. I played with these things in Latin and German at the baths and thus spent much time while others were shouting and singing the same... I sang. I admit that these are playful and more... to offer you this or to inquire into types. If you judge them worthy of print and light, you will do as you please. However, I would like the same to be read by Mr. Haller and Mr. Rudolf Gwalther. After seeing mine, our Mr. Campell also sang some things in the native language and translated the same into German. But who would read so many poems about one miracle, let alone print them? However, what I send is true, and it was presented by the minister of the Schuls church as an eyewitness, as the letter and description of it abundantly testify, from which I derived my own. I ask, most reverend sir, that you forgive me for interrupting you and your holy studies with such trivial matters; I will be more observant of you and more cautious in the future.</p>
      <p>All of ours are well and send their most respectful greetings to all of you, especially Mr. Consul Willius, who read this of mine and encouraged me to send it to you.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly. September 14, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your most humble servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, venerable, and widely renowned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zürich, my particularly honored and kind lord, to his hands.</p>
