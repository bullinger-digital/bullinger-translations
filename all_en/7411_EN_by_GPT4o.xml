      <p>To the Most Reverend, I read your letters with great sorrow, most esteemed man, when I understood that you were unwell. But it would not be surprising if you were completely exhausted, as you are like a vast and rich lake to which everyone rushes from all sides to draw from. May the Lord Jesus support you and preserve you safe and sound for the glory of His name and our salvation for as long as possible. Amen.</p>
      <p>The matter of the bishopric does not concern me; however, I give great thanks to you for advising me paternally and for having more certain knowledge of what harm might come to me from various sides if I were to involve myself hatefully. I will never fail to seek peace, as far as the word of God allows, especially in this troubled time, when we all must together seek the nurturing peace. It is certain that Bartholomäus von Salis has gone to Rome to stir up new disturbances. - From the minor prophets (as you most wisely suggest), I will see whom I should choose, and afterwards I will look for assistance. I give a thousand thanks for this voluntary goodwill. - It is reported from Italy that the king has suffered an incomparable defeat in his Italian territories by the Condé. They report that several thousand have perished; our priests also whisper the same, as do the French Rhaetians. - Today I was told for certain that our bishop is writing and convening a national council in Feldkirch, where all his sworn men will gather, where also Count Hannibal von Ems will be present.</p>
      <p>What they are to deliberate at this time will be made public in due course. From Italy, furthermore, nothing; for few have been able to travel due to the harshness and inclement weather.</p>
      <p>Farewell, greatest light of the whole world. All greet you, the consuls, Pontisella, Gantner, Carolus, and finally Bonettus.</p>
      <p>Chur, most swiftly, March 8, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Excellency's most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>I wrote to Campello; I saw the booklet, and Zanchi also saw it. But why does that Engadin man, after so many and such learned works of great men on the authority of the Holy Scripture, attempt to publish his theft?</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man Heinrich Bullinger, most celebrated pastor of the church in Zürich, his eternally honorable lord.</p>
