      <p>Greetings. I informed you about the death of King Francis, about which I am writing to the most honorable council.</p>
      <p>I received news that the dispute, which was between the Duke of W端rttemberg and the Margrave of Baden, about which I had written to you, has been settled and the Duke of W端rttemberg has regained the Herrenalb Monastery. If you have anything worth knowing, it would be most welcome if you would inform us.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends and love us.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 17th of December.</p>
      <p>Valentin will share the letters written in Italian from Venice before he sends them back.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Z端rich.</p>
      <p>In Z端rich.</p>
