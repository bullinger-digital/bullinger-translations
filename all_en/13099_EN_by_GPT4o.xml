    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has received Travers' letter [No. 3042] with the news about the unrest in Italy. What is happening there now is God's retribution for the war that these princes [Emperor Charles V and Pope Paul III] waged in Germany (a punishment that Germany also deserves). Now these princes are being punished for the blood they have shed, as God incites them against each other. But this is only the beginning of the end!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Travers wants to know what the Emperor and the princes are plotting at the Diet of Augsburg: The Emperor is continually suffering from fever, yet this sick man has achieved more with the Germans than any of the healthy rulers before him! He has defeated Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, holds him captive in Augsburg, and has transferred his electoral dignity to Maurice of Saxony. The latter has reinstated Melanchthon and the other professors in Wittenberg to their positions and provided them with better salaries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] On September 1, the Emperor presented individual points in a "Propositio". The princes and imperial estates were to comment on it. Enclosed is a copy of this "Propositio". Travers should handle it carefully and forward it to Johannes Comander and Johannes Blasius, who should return it as soon as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger would have enclosed another document with his letter if he had not sent it to Count Georg of Württemberg-Mömpelgard, namely the response of the princes to the "Propositio", whose goal is to resolve the religious division. In their response, the princes emphasize that they do not want to pass judgment before the Emperor has made his decision, especially since he has long been seeking a solution to the religious conflict. They also promise to implement his will, insofar as it is within their power.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In contrast to the princes, the German population proves to be steadfast. The truth will prevail! That's all for now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Bullinger was able to arrange with the Zurich mayors Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater that Travers' friend [Hans von Capol?] was presented with an honorary wine. Afterwards, he was invited to a meal with the second most important man of the triumvirate [Georg Müller] and another guild master [...], to which Bullinger also joined. Hopefully, this was honorable enough!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings, also to Travers' sons [Johannes the Younger and Jakob].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The sugar-sweet "Propositio" of the Emperor shows that he intends to rule over Germany and destroy the truth. But God's punishment will befall him.</p>

      <p>S. D. I have received your most loving letter, most esteemed Travers, and understood what you wrote about the Italian unrest. These things happen by the just judgment of God. For a long time, these princes have waged war on Germany and harassed it, something Germany deserved. However, now they turn their hostile arms against each other. Thus, the Lord avenges the blood shed by them. But these are only the beginnings of sorrows. Let us pray to the Lord that we may always please Him in patience and faith.</p>

      <p>You ask, my friend, what the Emperor is doing at the Diet of Augsburg, and what the princes are deliberating? The Emperor is suffering from a perpetual fever, but this sick Emperor has achieved more among the Germans than many strong princes have so far: he has overthrown Johann Friedrich of Saxony; he has elevated Duke Maurice to the electoral dignity. To him, Wittenberg has been given, to which he has recalled Melanchthon and other professors with a generous salary offered, so that they may teach there. Meanwhile, the deposed Elector of Saxony is held captive in Augsburg.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>On the first of September, the Emperor proposed certain points to which he wants a response from the princes, orders, and estates of the empire. I am sending the proposal here, but with the condition that you keep it clean, read it, and after reading, send it to Comander and Blasius, who should return it with the next, and trustworthy, messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have also received another document, which I would have added here if I had not sent it to the illustrious Prince Count of Württemberg, etc.: The princes respond to how the religious division might be resolved. In summary: They do not want to prejudge the Emperor or express their opinion before the Emperor's decision; they therefore pray that the Emperor first states his opinion, as he has been seeking a way to resolve the division for many years; they promise, however, to do what they can, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Meanwhile, the people are quite steadfast, but there are almost no princes. But the truth will prevail. I can say no more now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have arranged with the lords consuls that your friend be gifted with honorary wine. They dined with him in honor, the second of the triumvirs in the place of the consuls and one of the tribunes of the people, to whom I also joined. Would that we had gratified him as he deserved!</p>

      <p>Farewell forever. Zurich, October 22, 1547. Greetings to your sons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>From the most honeyed proposal of the Emperor, you will understand by your prudence that the Emperor seeks pure dominion in Germany and the destruction of the truth. Therefore, he will be punished by the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Travers of Susch in the Grisons, his always esteemed and beloved friend</p>
