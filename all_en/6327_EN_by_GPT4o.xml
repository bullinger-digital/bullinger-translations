      <p>Reverend, dearest, and most distinguished men, esteemed lords, greetings and commendations of my duties. While I await a response to the letters recently sent by my senior prince from your excellencies, other letters have arrived, which I am sending to your excellencies through the present messenger. I earnestly ask, since I hear that the plague is acting more mildly there, that for the sake of the Church of Christ, you undertake such labor and hasten your response to the previous and these letters, and at the same time urge the people of Geneva not to disdain to do the same.</p>
      <p>Your excellencies will earn the favor of a good prince in this way, one who is laboring with truly pious zeal for the concord of religion, which I do not doubt your excellencies will soon do for the glory of God and the immortality of their own reputation, which they will acquire in this way as they have with other pious vigils and cares.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that your excellencies will undertake this burden with more confidence, as they have given me great hope of this matter in their recent letters.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to your reverend excellencies.</p>
      <p>Given in Tübingen, December 8, most hastily, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your excellencies' most devoted, Balthasar von Lehwald, of the younger Prince Radziwiłł, etc.</p>
      <p>To the reverend, most illustrious, and most distinguished men, the lords superintendents, elders, and ministers of the Church of Zürich, etc., most esteemed lords and friends. Quickly.</p>
