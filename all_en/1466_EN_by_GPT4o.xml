      <p>S. Gastius told me about two booklets, one in Latin and the other in German, both on the same subject, sent by you and intended as a gift for me. I have received nothing, nor does he have any more to distribute. Borrhaus has his, Celius has his, and the rest are accounted for; I alone lack what you have given. Well then, let me lack it; I gratefully accept your intention to give.</p>
      <p>The rest is as follows: The people of Braunschweig have sent a messenger to the people of Stra√üburg, asking them to send a learned schoolmaster and a pious preacher. Such is the effect of the tyranny they have been subjected to until now. However, they have not sent anyone, because they have no one who can be sent. I wanted you to be aware of this as well.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, those from Wittenberg who were with you returned to me. They speak wonderfully of your generosity and highly commend your teachings, saying there is nothing there that does not please them. Farewell with your family. Basel, November 10, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
