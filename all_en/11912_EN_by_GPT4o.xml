    <p xml:id="regest1">Although Bullinger's letter of February 12 [No. 1846] was written in the name of unnamed brothers, Myconius addresses his reply solely to Bullinger, as he hopes for goodwill from him more than from others. The sermons in question about the Eucharist have so far only been criticized by Anabaptists, and Myconius has been delivering them for more than twelve years; their content corresponds to the Word of God, the Apostles and Evangelists, Paul, the common confession, Bucer's book to the people of Münster, which Bullinger himself had recommended, what Myconius noted on the Gospel of Mark, and what Bullinger wrote to the Scot [George Wishart]; finally, what was recorded in Aarau [regarding the Zurich Confession]. Christ feeds with his body through the bread and quenches with his blood through the wine, in a heavenly, spiritual, and indescribable manner. Myconius strictly adheres to the words of the Lord and the Apostles, which provide peace of conscience; what people express about the Lord's Supper only causes annoyance. In Zurich, he was a schoolteacher and only gave some exegetical lectures on behalf of the council; he followed Zwingli in interpreting the words of institution through "means," but always kept his focus on the special manner of Christ's presence; it is untrue that he preached that Christ is physically present and physically consumed at the Lord's Supper. The listeners of the Christmas sermon, who claim that he spoke contrary to the passage from Paul [1 Cor 11:24-26], are wrong; because a gossip accused him of deviating from Oecolampadius's teaching, he, to maintain his reputation, cited a passage from Oecolampadius's letters and evaluated it as consistent with Luther's letter to the evangelical cities [from December 1, 1537]; Bullinger himself had allowed [Martin] Bucer to speak in such a manner; the Wittenberg Confession is not new in itself, but summarized in the writings of Oecolampadius and Zwingli as well as in the Augsburg Confession of the Four Cities and especially contained in the [First Helvetic] Confession written in 1536; Bullinger should compare the passages and clear Myconius of the accusation of lying. Oecolampadius seems to have been contentious against the Papists and Luther on the question of the Lord's Supper, but conciliatory in his speech at the first synod; Myconius does not lie, especially not from the pulpit. Please accept this defense; indeed, it would have been more friendly if Bullinger had first asked him directly; effort for a simple teaching method. Skips some things that Bullinger probably did not write himself; disputes greatly endanger the Gospel, and the task of the servants of Christ and the Church is to build, not to destroy. Bullinger should also show the letter to [Konrad] Pellikan and Theodor [Bibliander].</p>

      <p>Greetings. You wrote a letter to me, my dear Bullinger, dated February 12, not as before, but in a new form which you have not used until now, and you wrote in the name of all the ministers and brothers. However, I do not care about the subscription, as I do not know which ministers or brothers, so I respond to you alone, with whom I have been accustomed to speak both seriously and playfully up to this day, hoping that you will interpret all my matters in the best light; something I cannot expect from all those who teach from the pulpit among you. I thought I had sons there; I do not know if they have become brothers through some metamorphosis. There is no doubt that I also have some who are not truly friends. Have they also become brothers? I would rejoice. So, leaving these aside, to the matter at hand.</p>
      <p>I acknowledge the sermons held not only on the days you name but for more than 12 years on the Eucharist, which no one has ever criticized except the Anabaptists or those similar to them. But these were not as you depict, but as the Lord taught me through His word, as the apostles and evangelists, Paul, our common confession, Bucer in the book to the people of Münster, which you also once recommended, especially in the matter of the supper, as I noted on the Gospel of Mark and, if I remember correctly, as you wrote a confession to a certain Scot, who asked you for it, and in Aarau, as we wrote together in these words: "In the mystical supper of the Lord, the body of Christ, which was delivered to death for us, and His blood, which was shed for the remission of our sins, is truly eaten and drunk by the faithful in memory of Him for the strengthening of the soul and the increase of spiritual life."</p>
      <p>From all these, I learned to speak of the Lord's Supper, that Christ feeds us with His body with the bread and gives us to drink with His blood with the wine, not in a gross manner as the Capernaumites thought, but in a heavenly and spiritual manner, yet truly, and this truth is to be believed, not inquired into, indeed believable, not investigable, which I say about the ineffable manner in which Christ, sitting at the right hand of the Father, refreshes His own in the sacred supper with His body and blood for life.</p>
      <p>You have in brief how I am accustomed to instruct the people entrusted to me about the matter of the supper, blaming no one, commending no one except the Anabaptists and those of mine who somewhat collude with them. For as they move, being restless, I am not allowed to be silent. For I will drive away the wolf that tries to approach my sheep; it is a duty. Therefore, I teach simply and according to the Lord and the apostles, from whose words and sense I do not depart. I believe, however, that they spoke in the best form, not to mention the simplest, and those who follow them cannot go astray. Experience also teaches me that peace of conscience cannot be obtained otherwise than in this way. I have read human writings about the supper to the point of satiety, indeed to nausea, but nothing from them brings peace of conscience. I have read the divine and have obtained peace against the insults of men and Satan; I pray to my Lord Jesus that He may keep me thus, strengthen and increase me until it is enough.</p>
      <p>The listeners you mention say that I used to teach the church in Zurich differently than I now teach the one in Basel. They certainly have a good memory if they know what I taught then, especially about the supper. Indeed, I do not remember often dealing with that subject. I was a schoolmaster, therefore I cared more for scholastic than theological matters. But what I lectured publicly was done by decree of the senate; for this, they even increased my stipend somewhat. I had Matthew and Acts in my hands, where this matter came up once and again. I wrote what I taught then, and I kept it, and thus I find that I followed our Zwingli of blessed memory, contending not against anyone except the pope and papists. And as he then explained "is" for "signifies," so did I, yet always keeping my eyes on the present Christ. I say present in His own way, not absent except in a carnal sense. Meanwhile, I never held with the Anabaptists that the signs in the supper are bare and that Christ is absent from His sacraments. Now if I teach otherwise, you will not find it difficult to judge from the confession mentioned a little earlier. Perhaps more clearly at present, what I said more obscurely at that time.</p>
      <p>If there is a difference, it is this; besides, none. However, I willingly forgive those listeners, while they say beyond the truth that I declared Christ to be corporally present and consumed in the supper; provided you believe me that it is not my custom to speak thus. But, as you have heard, I rely on the words of Christ and His disciples, teaching in such a way that no one listening to me with faith can be offended even a little, unless, as I remember, he first heard an Anabaptist or some formula that, even if not in sense, differs from my words. Such indeed seem to be those who attended my earlier sermon. Therefore, I spare them from my heart, I do not fight with them.</p>
      <p>Those who were present on the Lord's nativity, "not light or trivial brothers," as you call them, if they say anything other than that I explained Paul's passage about the communion of the body and blood of Christ in the supper more diligently, then inferred these two things: that those who have a double supper are not of the body of Christ, and those present, if they do not communicate without just cause, provided they know the mysteries of the supper, prove themselves not to be members of the Lord's church, are lighter than a feather and more trivial than a leaky barrel. As for what I added about Oecolampadius, it had this reason: A certain little man, known for his loquacity throughout the city, had spread that Myconius had taught something more gross about the presence of Christ in the supper than he had learned from the beginning, namely from Oecolampadius as a teacher. This lie forced me to defend my reputation. Therefore, I brought up a passage from his letter in the third book of the miscellany written to an anonymous person, from which it is easily evident to the non-contentious what he especially sought in the supper, namely the body and blood of Christ, not the figure of the body or blood. I added: "Oecolampadius agrees in this place with Luther's letter (whom I then named from the pulpit contrary to custom), which he sent in previous years to our cities endowed with the gospel for concord." Did I, my dear Bullinger, speak wrongly?</p>
      <p>Why then did you allow Bucer to speak in this manner: "The Wittenberg Confession has nothing new, but is contained in the writings of Oecolampadius and Zwingli, as well as in the Augsburg Confession of the Four Cities and especially incorporated into the Basel Confession composed by the envoys and preachers of the evangelical cities in the year 36"? Compare, I beg you, the passages yourself, and I will be easily freed from the lie or your patronage.</p>
      <p>Here, as about Oecolampadius, my holy and venerable predecessor, I need to say a little more. I am not so dull as not to understand what he once wrote, nor so negligent as to overlook his books.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I assert that I find him to be a double man in the matter of the supper, contentious and placid. He is said to be very vehement against the papists and Luther, where he thinks something papistic is present, as he feels almost in all his contentious letters and books, even in the Dialogue, although it is very polished and confirms my opinion in all respects. Placid (as he wrote everywhere to friends) he teaches, as I demonstrated from the said letter, as he also confessed here in the first synod publicly with these words: "In these," he said, "which pertain to the sacrament of the supper, I confess that our souls - through faith in the death of Jesus - are fed and given to drink with the flesh and blood of Christ, and this is sacredly commended by the Lord's bread and wine, but not that the body of Christ is now present either locally or dimensionally, but sacramentally, and thus Christ is truly present to believers." Therefore, when I asserted that those two agreed, I spoke of the placid Oecolampadius, not the contentious one, and of the other not certainly when he is driven by his vehemence and uses hyperbolic words against his enemies, but as he confessed to all of us in the Helvetians. And I said these things so clearly (for I wanted to satisfy the quibblers) that I see well enough what kind of listeners I had, after they persuaded you to judge me as a liar.</p>
      <p>I have not lied nor will I lie in the most sacred place. For nothing should be said from the pulpit that you would be ashamed of before the Lord. You must think long about what you teach from there; for one day you will have to give an account to God. The Lord has given me up to the present day to speak publicly with great fear of Him, and so far I have not been confounded, although often heavily attacked by the learned and unlearned. I pray the same that He may protect and defend me henceforth as He has until now.</p>
      <p>With these few words, I want my cause defended before you. I ask you by the Lord Jesus to accept all my matters as befits a friend. Indeed, in this matter, I gladly adhere to the simplicity of Scripture because of the dissensions and our common confession. If I had departed from these, you would have done rightly and kindly to rebuke my transgression. But since I rely on them with all my strength, it would perhaps have been more prudent and friendly to see my matter if you had first inquired about the truth of the matter from me. Although what has been done is not ungrateful, it would have been most pleasing, because it would have been most friendly. There are also other reasons why I persistently adhere to that simplicity; for I see a certain energy, by which all the acumen of this time and all the diction of the world is empty, indeed these are nothing compared to that. I also feel strength, so that even in the gravest contentions I am free from fear. And Satan is compelled to yield whenever I engage in battle with simple faith in the word simply accepted. I believe that in the article of death nothing else can help. Therefore, that saying of Solomon is constant both in my heart and on my lips: "He who walks simply, walks confidently" [Proverbs 10:9].</p>
      <p>For since I rightly conceived that sentence, I have fled from anything affected, sought, personal, contrived by human ingenuity without certain scriptures concerning divine matters, nor have I regretted it so far.</p>
      <p>There are some other things in your letters, which, because they are irrelevant, I knowingly pass over, as things you wrote not from yourself, but from the mouth and stomach of others, and indeed, lest I write something more foolish, and that would harm an undeserving friend.</p>
      <p>However, I cannot keep silent about this one thing: that I do not make gods for myself from men, as you perhaps think. And would that all were so cautious in this matter! For then these noises of contentions would not exist; which if they do not cease, the gospel is not far from destruction or at least from perpetual contempt.</p>
      <p>For it cannot be said what evil is fostered among the papists by these scandalous fights of great men in religion. And I know that good and honest minds are so moved by it that there is fear lest they be entirely removed from all goodness and even from salvation because of these contentions. Such are we ministers of Christ and the church, to whom, while it was entrusted to build, we demolish nothing but.</p>
      <p>May the Lord restore and preserve the light of His grace, which He had kindled so splendidly in the hearts of many and now begins to fail not a little because of the spirit of pride, by His kindness for the sanctification of His name and for our salvation. Amen.</p>
      <p>I beg you by the Lord to interpret these of mine as I do yours, and to have me henceforth as commended as before. With Pellican and Theodor, whom I call the doctors of your church, not brothers or ministers, these things are common. Farewell in Christ and may He always be with you.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 12, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his brother in the Lord to be respected.</p>
