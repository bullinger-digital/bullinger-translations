      <p>S. in solida salute nostra Christo. I received your letter dated August 27th on September 10th, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, and I am very grateful to you, especially for the most learned and Christian catechism of England, where a few days ago nothing seemed more fortunate, but now hardly anything seems more calamitous. A certain person arrived here not long ago directly from England, affirming that some of the most Christian leaders of that kingdom have been thrown into prison and chains by that Spanish Mary, while in the meantime all those whom the most Christian king had previously ordered to be more diligently guarded, lest they become authors of new seditions and treasons, have been released, and then all exiles of other nations have been ordered to leave within a month. Ah ah, my soul, what do you think will happen to our Germany, after these things are done on this green wood, on that most flourishing island, which has been wonderfully illuminated by the divine light of the gospel of Christ for several years now? O truly dreadful judgments of God, which at the same time threaten us with much more atrocious ones, unless we soon repent. Ah Christ the Savior, finally endow us with a serious sense of these evils, and also abundantly imbue us with your spirit, so that, terrified by the most just judgments of your Father, and again exhilarated by the sweetness of your grace, we may repent in time and run with an enlarged heart in the way of your commandments, which are of faith and charity and of bearing the cross.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write about, which I either think you are unaware of or believe could cheer you up. For truly, as you write, it is so: almost everywhere the Christian world is in peril; one disturbance emerges from another, and the ship of Christ is truly attacked and shaken by many and horrendous waves, while He in the meantime seems to be asleep. Let us therefore awaken our best and strongest avenger with the great cries of the prayers of the pious, so that, when no other hope of remedy remains, He may mercifully protect this his ship, tossed about among so many storms, with a favorable glance alone, with the mere rebuke of his word, and command this raging and ruin-threatening sea to be still. In this very matter, I wish you to be well and to endure bravely with a calm and exalted spirit among all these evils with all my heart. May all your brothers, ministers in the work of the Lord, especially Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, Wolf, and the others, be greeted lovingly and reverently. My household greets yours along with Funck. I would commend Johann Ulm to you with many of ours, if I did not know that he has long been commended to you by his own regard and officiousness towards you, besides many others. Greet the excellent young man for me as diligently as you can. Farewell again. October 17, 1553. See that you never forget me in your sacred conversations with the Savior Christ.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable brother and friend.</p>
