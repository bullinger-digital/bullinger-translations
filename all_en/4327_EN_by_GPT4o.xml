      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write at the moment, except that I cannot send these letters from Lord Steiger to you without adding my own. He thanks you for the honorarium sent to him at the Baths.</p>
      <p>He also writes about the Valesians, as he informed me, so there is no need to add more. Yesterday, Lord Simon Wurstenberger returned (for Lord Nicolaus von Diesbach stayed in Baden). He praises and commends exceedingly the hospitality, honor, and magnificence with which they were received in Zürich, and how you personally received them, as well as Lord Gwalther.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I rejoice greatly on your behalf, and I hope that from this, greater concord and goodwill will be fostered between both republics. I congratulate you on the new consul.</p>
      <p>In the place of our Watenwil, after two years (as the order requires), another will be elected. May the Lord grant us one as excellent as we have lost, certainly most outstanding in piety, prudence, and courage. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to Lord Gwalther, Lord Martyr, your wife, and your entire household. Bern, June 26, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his ever-honored lord and compatriot.</p>
