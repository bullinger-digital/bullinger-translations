      <p>Greetings. I would write more and indeed have things to write; but what should I do? It has been three days since I have been suffering from one eye and feel immense pain, so that I must refrain from reading, writing, and preaching. A response was due to Mr. Coignet, but I ask you to take on that task.</p>
      <p>I wish to know from Mr. Coignet as soon as possible who, in the name of the king, will summon our soldiers.</p>
      <p>I hear they have requested Junker Stoffel von Capal in the Upper League to be a captain; if this is true, I am very surprised, and it is the Tschudi's practice, with whom Junker Stoffel is related by marriage, to be half in, half out in matters of religion; they must go there so that they can more easily bring them up in the Upper League. But, as I said, this is hearsay; I do not venture out myself.</p>
      <p>Whatever it is, I wish to hear something certain from Mr. Coignet.</p>
      <p>If only Mr. Coignet would come and ask.</p>
      <p>But if Mr. Coignet insists, it is indeed up to him that, when the common Three Leagues publicly reject soldiers, he should let it remain so and not first spend money or give any payment before it comes to the common Three Leagues; once it is rejected, he has a good answer against the king. I think you understand what I mean; I would wish to elaborate on everything if I could.</p>
      <p>But if only Mr. Coignet would come himself; you will ask the man.</p>
      <p>We publicly oppose; but there are many of the dissolute people, and they are papists who will not let it rest by the sea when they know about money. I send the decree of the council; but you will return it sometime; I have not yet read it, I could not.</p>
      <p>This is written in haste; I have not reread it.</p>
      <p>Forgive me.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father, in Chur.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>As I wrote this, a member of the council comes to me, informs me that Junker Stoffel von Capal (this man is an atheist) has already ridden to Solothurn, summoned there by Captain Fröhlich, as our lords have also scheduled a meeting. Now it depends on the fact that, even if our lords of the Three Leagues prohibit the journey under penalty of life and limb or otherwise under severe penalty, and yet Junker Stoffel (who is otherwise an unseemly, needy fellow, indebted) receives the money, he will cause a mutiny in the Upper League, from which much unrest will follow. Therefore, I am very surprised at Mr. Coignet, if he has the authority, to hurry so much. If it is not too late, he should be advised once more not to give any money until he knows the will of the common Three Leagues, since it has been customary from ancient times that no people have been led out of the country without the consent of the authorities. These are the things I thought should be added here.</p>
      <p>Act according to your prudence.</p>
      <p>I read letters written in Paris, that ours have in three strongholds, Orléans, Tours, Auteuil, also that the king entered Paris very sadly, also that there are 15 with Prince de Condé, all bearing the king's orders. The custodian of this college, who came directly from France, says that all cruelty is used against the believers in Paris; they are burning at all the streets, and the constable is particularly involved in this. Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>This also had to be added here that Mr. Coignet wrote to me hoping that the most honorable council of Chur will do everything that contributes to reconciliation, and rather strive to send peacemakers than soldiers. Now, therefore, Mr. Coignet should in turn hear our reasons and, if he has not given money, not give it before he understands the opinion of our lords. To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
