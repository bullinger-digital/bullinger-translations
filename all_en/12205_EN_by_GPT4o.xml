    <p xml:id="regest1">Even for the blind, it is obvious how much the [Catholics] want to harm the [Protestants], so it would be pointless to give in to them. Bullinger has had the [Louvain] articles copied, as such evidence can be useful in the preparation of reports. Greetings and thanks to [Hans] Welser. Bullinger is soon finished with the work on the Mark [commentary] and will then begin with the Luke [commentary], which he still intends to dedicate to Welser. - He has not seen [Johannes von Ulm], the [nephew] of [Heinrich von Ulm], but would have gladly taken care of him. - The Christian potentates are seeking a truce with the Turks to better persecute the true Christians, but they will soon be destroyed by the Turks themselves. The [Protestants], for their part, are seeking peace with Emperor [Charles V.] at the expense of the peace of Christ, but they will also be disappointed, as Welser rightly assesses. - Allegedly, some [cities] are about to concede the duchy to [Heinrich] of Brunswick; thus they fall away from the princes who do not want to give in to [Charles V.] at all. If this is true, the cities have made a shameful decision [at the city council]. - [Heinrich von Ulm] will report orally on the negotiations [concerning Konrad Zwick's art of war]. Bullinger still believes that this pernicious art should not fall into anyone's hands. Even [Zwick] would only bring misfortune. - Bullinger thanks the Lord for the victory [of the Protestant princes over the roving troops of Duke Heinrich of Brunswick], even if this is probably only the beginning of greater evil. - [Duke Wilhelm IV.] of Bavaria is said to have hired the Spanish [troops at Donauwörth] to suppress Regensburg. For what else would these soldiers have been needed in Hungary, since a truce with the [Turks] is said to have been achieved long ago? - Bullinger mocks and pities the morals of the cardinals [Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte and Marcello Cervini in Trent]; such scum stands before the church! - In Bern, the Beat [Gering] sent there by Bucer from Strasbourg [slanders] the [Zurichers] because they expelled him from the church for adultery. - Melanchthon wrote to a [Zurich] friend on April 17 [...] that the [“True Confession”] of the Zurichers was neither wise nor moderate. Furthermore, the enraged [Luther] is supposed to write an opinion, "in which he describes the view of the opponents as an invention of the devil; he wants to" (according to Melanchthon) "further command us to sign and acknowledge [his opinion]." Should it come to that, Melanchthon would have to decide what resolution he will have to make. A returnee from Wittenberg [...] also reports that [Luther] plans a counter-writing similar in style to the [“Short Confession”]. - Not only did Pope [Paul III.] have murders committed near Avignon, but [Francis I.] also, at the instigation of Cardinal [François de] Tournon, first used the troops intended against [Henry VIII.] against the sincere and faithful Waldensians. Many places were destroyed and plundered; there were many dead and refugees. Therefore, Calvin was sent by the Geneva council. Calvin left the enclosed [not received] letter to Blarer. On May 12, Bullinger translated Calvin's speech before the council. Zurich immediately arranged a meeting for Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and St. Gallen on [May 22] in Aarau to discuss a delegation to King [Francis I.]. Calvin then rode to Basel, from where he wants to go to Strasbourg to effect a similar delegation of the princes and imperial cities to France. If [Constance] wants to get involved, it should write to Strasbourg immediately. During the murders in Provence, massacres were also carried out in the papal territories of Avignon at the instigation of the legate from Avignon [...].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Even the blind can see how these people are prejudiced against us or intend to act against us. Therefore, it is clear that to comply with them and to give them anything is not religious and pious, but plainly foolish. I have recently had almost all the impious articles copied for myself; for such written testimonies, or rather prejudices, are useful in consultations. You will give great thanks to Welser and offer my respectful greetings. I have just finished Mark, and then I will begin Luke, which I still intend to dedicate to him.</p>
      <p>I have not seen the young man, the son of my brother-in-law; otherwise, I would have gladly devoted myself to him if I had hoped that my conversation would be beneficial to him.</p>
      <p>The Christian princes are seeking a truce with the Turks so that in the meantime they can destroy true Christians with fire and sword; soon they themselves will perish by Turkish fury and arms. So it is fated; the prophets have foretold this. Some of our people are seeking peace from the emperor; however, they do not care for the peace that is from Christ. It will happen, therefore, that the emperor will deceive them, and God will punish them. The emperor is facing a grave fate. The excellent Welser judges well; there is little, indeed no faith in those who become so suppliant to a tyrant for a matter that he cannot grant.</p>
      <p>I hear that some are about to concede the duchy to the Duke of Brunswick and defect from the princes who do not want to yield to the tyrant but want to try the utmost first.</p>
      <p>If this is the case, the cities are making a shameful decision. Regarding the matter discussed between my brother-in-law and me, he will report more, for not everything can be captured by the pen, and he will indeed explain everything better. You always continue to be like yourself. I persist in my opinion: I have considered it better not to reveal that deadly art to anyone; it will not be fortunate and auspicious for him if he reveals it, except in notable calamity.</p>
      <p>I thank our Lord, who granted victory to our people. May that fortune be perpetual for them! For I think these are the beginnings of sorrows and great wars will arise from here.</p>
      <p>Regarding those shaven and half-circumcised Spaniards, we have this: they were hired by the Bavarian, who also prepared 500 horsemen elsewhere, to bring the ancient Regensburg into order by slaughtering all the pious to extinction. May the Lord preserve them and lay low the robbers and the public calamity of Germany.</p>
      <p>For what is the need for soldiers in Pannonia when truces have been obtained? And great men say they have been obtained long ago.</p>
      <p>Indeed, those holy cardinals conduct themselves excellently while they love virgins, girls, and matrons! For you will find those who prefer something else; shame forbids speaking more. It is the scum of arch-rogues (scoundrels) that should not be tolerated on earth. They must govern the church. O the times!</p>
      <p>There is a certain Battus in Bern sent there by Bucer from Strasbourg. He makes honorable mention of us because he was expelled from our church for a very foul adultery. Thus, the excellent man avenges himself! Pride, injury, and insult pour themselves out.</p>
      <p>Among other things, Philip writes to a friend that the Zurichers neither wisely instituted their response nor wrote moderately. "Therefore," he says, "our man is burning, and I hear that he will write a proposal in which he will declare that the opinion of the adversaries is an invention of the devil, and he will command us to sign and vote together. Although I have always spoken moderately and did not want to disturb the churches of these regions, nevertheless, if that harsh sentence is proposed, I will have to deliberate on what I will do." And soon: "I wish that my labors may benefit the church of God, and I expect exile and will bear it moderately," etc. They were given on April 17, 1545. There is one who has just returned from Wittenberg. He says that he is preparing a response, but brief, similar to the previous writing, swelling and teeming with evil spirits. May the Lord have mercy on the man!</p>
      <p>But, dear sir and brother, unfortunately, it did not remain that the pope accomplished such murder near Avignon. But the Frenchman, moved by the cardinal of Tournon, had the servants, who were intended against the Englishman, previously instructed to exterminate the poor Waldensian brothers in Provence, adjacent to the lordship of Avignon. And they think rightly and live most holily. They have received our religion and our doctrines in all things. Thus, about 10 small towns, villages, and hamlets were burned, in which everything, young and old, was stabbed. Some places were plundered. The poor people have previously fled into the woods as best they could. There (where) they are poorly provided for, most have perished. Oh, the lamentable murder, etc. Therefore, Calvin was sent by an honorable council to Geneva with messengers and letters, and he was here. He left me this letter to send to you. He had to hurry to other places. He could not come to you, as he would have liked. Please do not take it amiss. On May 12, I interpreted before our lords. There he had the great murder that had happened presented. He brought forward the names of the towns and villages, etc. My lords received them with great need. They have written to those of Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, etc., for a quick day in Aarau on May 21, to deliberate on a delegation to send to the king in France at our expense, to advocate for peace for the poor oppressed. Thus, Calvin hurriedly rode to Basel; from there he wants to go to Strasbourg to try if they might bring about a delegation to France from the princes and imperial cities. Therefore, if your lords want to do something, you can write to Strasbourg to further it, etc. But when they committed the murder in Provence, they also came from the legate of Avignon into the papal territories towards Avignon. They also slaughtered there.</p>
      <p>God have mercy on His afflicted believers. Amen.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, always to be honored as a brother. [...].</p>
