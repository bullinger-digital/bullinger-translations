      <p>I would have gladly sent a letter long ago; but it was delayed due to the lack of messengers. The Magdeburg affair is now more known to you than to us; for the messengers of that republic have informed me that they are about to depart from here to you.</p>
      <p>The garrison soldier is still in the city; but, as I hear, he causes no trouble to the citizens and is with Maurice... who also fortifies his other main cities with garrisons. From Maurice and the Landgrave, more certain and frequent news is received daily, that they are enlisting soldiers and have them in service; but for what exact purpose, we do not know; however, the release of the captured Landgrave is preferred. The Hessians (I suppose) recently took Count Solms captive, who has always followed the Emperor's camp. The King of the Romans is enlisting soldiers from all sides to defend Hungary. The Emperor still lingers in Innsbruck, and nothing certain is heard about his departure. Our bishops remain in the council; the session scheduled for January 15th was not held, but postponed to March 19th, until our people arrive. Safe conduct, as requested by the Mauritians, has been granted and given to all states of the Augsburg Confession under the seal of the council's presidents; I think our theologians will soon be sent from here towards Trento, and although nothing right or just is to be expected from this council, I do not see us omitting the mission; for in two diets we have promised to come there. You are beyond the reach of the missile.</p>
      <p>I think our people will achieve nothing there, except to testify that they were ready, if the opportunity for a right, just, and fair action had been granted and obtained, and so I think they will return home after making a protest. I wish more others had been joined to our and the Saxon people; for what are five p... s among so many? Melanchthon, Sarcerius, Alesius, and Paceus are said to be lingering in Nuremberg, until they are made more certain by the duke's forerunners. In summary, the council promises the most just things; but they will not even depart from... the house with what has been brought. These things very hastily.</p>
      <p>Commend me to your family and Bibliander. Farewell excellently. Strasbourg, February 27, 1552. Bibliander's deliberation on the first decree of the council pleases all the learned greatly.</p>
      <p>C[hristopher] M[ont].</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man Mr. Bullinger, most esteemed friend. Zurich.</p>
      <p>Letter of Mr. Christopher Mont, 1553.</p>
