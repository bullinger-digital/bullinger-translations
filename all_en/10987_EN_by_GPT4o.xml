    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to illness, I was unable to respond to Bullinger's letter; the son [Hans Rudolf], recalled by [Hans] Vogler, whom Bullinger will take care of, has made good progress in his studies, considering his limited prior education. He hopes for good results from the Bundestag in Schmalkalden; will convey news as soon as possible. He asks for Bullinger's goodwill and for a response.</p>

      <p>Peace of the Lord Jesus be with you.</p>
      <p>Do not take it badly, most learned Bullinger, that I have not yet responded to your most friendly letters. I have been ill almost all this autumn and did not seem to have a worthy occasion to write to you. However, when Vogler, our mutual friend, a most pious man, recalled his son, whom he entrusted to me for education this year, I could not send him to you without my letters, especially since I understand that you have agreed to take him under your care and discipline at the request of his father. I truly congratulate from the bottom of my heart the boy for having found such a teacher. In my judgment, the young man would not have been unfit for study if he had been dedicated to studies earlier. He could not fully learn grammar, of which he was entirely ignorant when he came to me; I believe he has not done too badly in such a short time; you yourself will judge.</p>
      <p>I write nothing new to you, as I do not doubt that you know everything better than I do. I hope that the assembly in Schmalkalden, which is now gathered, will bring many good things. As soon as I have thoroughly investigated what has been done, I will write to you in detail.</p>
      <p>Now I beseech you to admit me into your friendship, however unequal, and to humbly pray to God for me and our church, that all things may be done through us for the glory of His name. Farewell most happily, and if you ever have time amidst your duties, honor me with another letter, so that I may know that I am enrolled in the list of your friends.</p>
      <p>Given at Lindau, February 10, in the year 37.</p>
      <p>Thomas Gassner, minister of the church in Lindau, your most devoted.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his lord and brother to be respected.</p>
