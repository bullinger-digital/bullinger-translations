      <p>Greetings. We have read your book, Calvin, brother in the Lord, venerable and beloved, which you published on avoiding superstitions. It pleased not only me, but all the pious among us, not so much for its excellent learning as for the purity of religion and the sincerity of the true faith's confession, which is strongly asserted. We praise your piety and integrity, and we pray that the Lord may bless you for your good work. Meanwhile, we are not unaware that many oppose you, objecting that you are alone in this opinion. Therefore, so that they may not be ignorant that we also approve of your work and share your opinion, if your booklet is ever reprinted by the printer, you can attach this of ours to it, in which we discuss the same argument with you. We wrote it for the sake of a certain great, pious, and learned man who sought our judgment.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, 30th September 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
