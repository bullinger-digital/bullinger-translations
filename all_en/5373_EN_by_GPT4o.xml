      <p>Greetings. I wrote yesterday what I wanted you to know, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Now I likewise want you to know that those letters of Calvin to Hercules have arrived very auspiciously; for there was already someone present who was about to depart, and indeed on horseback, so that I believe he has the letters. Meanwhile, Mr. Condensis will write to our people; certain leading men (I hope this will be the case), for they can be quite sure of the goodwill of the Rhaetians, will go to Geneva. (However, I am waiting for Hercules, with whom everything), but today also, if I can, everything with Carlino.</p>
      <p>If you write, ensure with your letters that, when our people arrive, they are kindly received in Geneva. Even if, by the grace of God, the matter were to look towards some tolerable pacification (which I would not believe) or if victory were to fall to our people, so that the illustrious prince would no longer need the work of our people, at least they should be treated in such a way that they do not seem to have undertaken a long journey in vain. The prefect of our city, whom I mentioned before, is coming to you.</p>
      <p>I ask that you commend the cause of the good man from Walenstadt. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 22.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
