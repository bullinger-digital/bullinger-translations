      <p>Beware in those parts not only of Stancaro, but of all those who, with Arius and Servetus, deny the divinity of Christ the Savior. I hear that a certain Blandrata, practicing medicine in those parts among you, is infecting not a few with the poison of Servetus. Certainly, if he is the one who was in Geneva, he left there because Calvin, the most vigilant pastor of that church, pressed him and wanted to lead him to confess a sincere and true faith, and here in ZÃ¼rich with us, he began to dispute about those things, which we disapproved of in every way.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we seriously admonish you to beware; for we believe that the mystery of the adorable Trinity must be kept unpolluted by us, and we judge that the Servetans, as pests of the church, must be expelled and not listened to, as they propose mere blasphemies. May the Lord preserve His church from evil!</p>
