      <p>Since we are accustomed to consider all benefits conferred upon our people as also pertaining to us, most honorable man, I must rightly persuade myself that I owe much to your humanity for many reasons. First, because you strive with all your zeal, effort, and diligence to illuminate the family of our most illustrious marquis with your very learned writings and to retain them in true religion with your excellent advice.</p>
      <p>For indeed (believe me) both the memory of Bucer, a most holy man whom we revered as a father while he lived and whose memory we steadfastly retain as that of an apostle of the highest deity, and also your letters, which you sent to our most illustrious lord, have greatly benefited both in confirming the constancy of the religion we embraced and in further inciting and inflaming the spirits of those who, either through the passage of time have become more lax, or through the satiety of the matter we profess have become more disdainful, or through the levity and inconstancy of their minds have become more negligent. For they have always thought that your authority should be yielded to and your gravity followed. And as for myself, since my lord has always handed over to me both his and your letters, which he has never received from you without a joyful countenance, I used to consider myself most fortunate to be able to be the guardian of such treasures. For whenever I read them, I seemed to be conversing with two of the dearest lights of Christ's church. Then, that singular affection of your mind, with which you embrace my disciple, compels me, if in no other way, at least through my letters, to profess my respect towards you.</p>
      <p>For what could be more useful to her, more pleasing to the marquis, or more desirable to me, not only from you but from anyone else endowed with such great learning and piety, than that she, whom I pursue with love as a daughter and as a disciple, should feel those precepts of life flow to her from the most abundant source of your sacred heart, by which she might be led to live well and blessedly? And how useful the advice of the elderly is for moderating and governing this age, at which she is now 14 years old, you can well judge by your prudence. For at that age, as the comic poet says, all are inclined from labor to lust, and are more easily carried away by the pleasure of things and the corruption of nature to that delight which Plato calls the evil lure, than to pursue those studies which are aimed at the praise of virtue. Therefore, the more numerous the diseases this age suffers from, the more diligent and prudent physicians must be sought, so that what is ingrained in them by the corruption of nature and the weakness of age may be removed or corrected by the industry, effort, and study of the best men: for just as we prepare grazing for luxuriant crops and reins for fierce horses, so these tender minds should not lack the counsel of the elderly nor the authority of serious men. Therefore, it was excellently done by your humanity that you wished to adorn this our Sparta with your prudence. In this endeavor, you have done something most useful for her and most pleasing for her father. Writing these things to your humanity was prompted by both your singular zeal for my disciple and the importunity of Johannes von Ulm, a most upright and learned young man. For I was afraid to interrupt you, such a great man, so diligently occupied in the vineyard of Christ: but since he persistently insisted and praised your incredible humanity, I cast out all shame and fear from my mind. Therefore, receive these things with an even mind and a joyful countenance, I pray, and attribute whatever fault there is here from me to my love for you and the importunity of my friend. Farewell, most esteemed man, and forgive me for my impromptu writing. May God lead you to the years of Nestor for the sake of His church.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your greatness, I. Aylmer. Let these letters be delivered to the Reverend Father in Christ, the Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>To Bullinger.</p>
      <p>John Aylmer, Englishman.</p>
