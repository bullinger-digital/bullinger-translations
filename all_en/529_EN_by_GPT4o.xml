      <p>S. D. I have labored in your cause, most distinguished and eternally esteemed man, as much as my limited abilities allowed, and I hope that the matter has turned out very well. Just yesterday, a decision was made in the council, the content of which you will understand from the letters of the magistrate; for I also believe this to be very auspicious, that the magistrate himself diligently informs you of his goodwill and benevolence.</p>
      <p>You therefore have the sealed letters, and there is no reason for some conditions to trouble you; I am very hopeful about all matters. For I have understood that the senators' disposition towards you is most favorable.</p>
      <p>Above all, however, pray to our omnipotent and truly wise God, that He may direct your paths. I would have preferred to send the messenger today if the scribe had prepared the letters; but due to business, he could not; he only sent them this evening. I have now sent them to you through this messenger, sent for this purpose only, most esteemed man; he is diligent and poor. Furthermore, if I can do anything for the favor of you and yours, I offer myself most ready for your services.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me commended to you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 23, in the evening, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Thomas Blaurer, his most esteemed lord and friend. Griesenberg.</p>
      <p>May 24, 1549, by the Zurich messenger Andreas Sorseus/Sorsen? from Geneva.</p>
      <p>R[esponded].</p>
