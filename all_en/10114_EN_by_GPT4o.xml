      <p>Greetings and peace through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>You sent me as a gift through a certain friend your exposition on the Epistle of John, along with the speech "De prophetae officio," for which I am very grateful to you, not only because they testify to your friendly disposition towards me, but because with these new fruits you refresh your people with the best hope of all good things. For you know whose place you have succeeded. Therefore, these are the first fruits among the people of Zurich, a testimony to the restoration of the Christian republic recently collapsed with great destruction. Therefore, may Christ our Lord be with you, so that what you have begun, you may be able to accomplish successfully with the glory of God the Father and the edification of the whole church.</p>
      <p>Paul Ricius, the physician of Ferdinand, published this booklet with Ferdinand's favor and Faber's opposition. You will understand the cause and argument from it. I wanted to send it to you as a gift, a testimony of a friend's affection towards you, who loves the learned even though I am most unlearned. You will also share it with brothers Leo and Pellicanus. The one who delivers this to you is the preacher of the Esslingen church. From him, you will hear how much our Ambrosius has advanced the kingdom of Christ.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>6th of April, in Konstanz.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>I am sending two booklets written by Luther to Leo, not for you to publish, but to suppress, as otherwise our cause is full of hatred.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, apostle of the Church of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
