      <p>Greetings. I wrote to our Friedrich von Salis that I would write to you more extensively; but business demands brevity. Therefore, share with him what you have from France and Lower Germany; for I have enclosed them here with the condition that you safely return both. The one who writes about the affairs of France is an excellent man and has come from France to Geneva; be careful, be careful, that his name does not become known to anyone besides you; if it became known to others, I know it would be fatal for him.</p>
      <p>For the envoy and his interpreter have spies everywhere among you and they fish out everything. Therefore, use these wisely and transcribe with your own hand from the letters what you wish to share with trusted ones; let no one else inspect the letters themselves. For that good man is returning to France; if he were betrayed, it would be the end of his life.</p>
      <p>I did not want you to be unaware of these things; but there was no leisure for transcribing, hence I send these to you with utmost confidence, again beseeching you to tell no one from where and from whom you have these; especially keep silent the name of Geneva, etc. Say that such writings come from France; both Beza and Haller from Bern write the same to me, etc.</p>
      <p>Use these wisely and not with just anyone. You see that we must pray diligently and admonish the churches to intercede for the afflicted faithful; for in Lower Germany, too, horrendous tyranny is being exercised by the Spanish. I send what has been brought here about the battle fought between Count von Arenberg and Count von Nassau; I share it with you as I received it, I affirm nothing; yet it is confirmed by subsequent reports, etc. Return those safely and greet Mr. Karl most amicably.</p>
      <p>I received what you obtained from him about the Turkish and imperial pacification; thank him greatly in my name; and I also thank you, the scribe. I also received the story about the captured pastor of Morbegno, to whom may the Lord grant the spirit of patience and constancy. In this, the Rhaetians will show what kind they are; yet I think it should be handled wisely, so as not to give the enemies an occasion to plot worse things. I pray the Lord to do so. Fourteen days ago, I wrote my last about what he must patiently endure, which you already remember; meanwhile, I could not send any to you; I hope none have been lost, etc. I cannot say more. Continue to append the remaining parts of the unfortunate story about monastic audacity, etc.</p>
      <p>Greet all our people. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, June 18, 1568. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
