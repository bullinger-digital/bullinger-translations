      <p>S. P. Although I am now greatly and variously hindered, I did not want to fail to write something to you, by which I might at least in some way declare my inclination towards you. Furthermore, I cannot conceal from you how happily the progress of our church here is proceeding, for which reason we give immortal thanks to the best and greatest God. It is indeed succeeding according to our heart's desire, so that we can scarcely wish for better. Our Martinus (Martin) is performing his duty manfully, pursuing all his tasks faithfully, prudently, and diligently. I accompanied D. Hoper (Hooper), the Bishop of Worcester, to Worcester about four months ago, where I stayed for almost seven weeks; I cannot sufficiently commend his faith and zeal. May the Lord God make his ministry fruitful, so that the outcome of the matter corresponds to the man's wishes and efforts.</p>
      <p>Here now, for only a few days, certain disturbances have arisen among the bishops from the sermon of a certain pious man, the preacher of the Duke of Northumberland, which he delivered before the king and his counselors, in which he truly and freely inveighed against the kneeling at the Lord's Supper, which is still observed here among the English. However, that good man, a Scot by nation, has so affected the minds of many that we hope something good will eventually return to the church from it. I pray again and again that the Lord may make it so.</p>
      <p>D. a Lasco (Laski) has now received letters from several nobles of the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as well as from the King of Poland himself, full of all manner of kindness, inviting him to come to Poland for the public assembly of that kingdom, which is convened around the kings to reform religion. They especially desire (to avoid all suspicion from the adversaries of the faith) that he be sent there on some occasion as a legate from our king. This matter was first proposed today to the Duke of Northumberland by the Archbishop of Canterbury. May the Lord grant that it leads to the glory of His name. D. a Lasco and D. Martinus, who are now variously occupied, wish to be excused for not writing. In the meantime, they wanted to greet you very warmly.</p>
      <p>Please greet for me D. Bibliander and the other fathers and brothers known to me there, to mention D. Butler in the meantime. Farewell, my lord Bullinger, dearest and most esteemed in my heart in the Lord, to whom I commend your ministry from the heart. London, 12th October 1552. From the house of D. a Lasco, with whom I am staying.</p>
      <p>Yours truly and from the heart, Johannes Utenhovius. To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, much beloved friend and brother.</p>
      <p>"Utenhoffius."</p>
