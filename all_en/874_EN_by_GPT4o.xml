      <p>Most excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>While I was again going to Venice to bring back my small belongings from there, your most delightful letters, which you had sent to Florence a long time ago, were delivered to me. Where they were detained, I am completely ignorant. Letters from Pellicanus and Bibliander were also added, very consoling and truly learned, by the refreshing of which I alleviated my troubles not a little. But I would not want, by the long silence, since I have not replied, being unaware of their content, to incur the mark of an ungrateful mind with you or with them, although I have often informed my Laelius about this matter so that he might present my excuse to you. God is my witness, how much I love you all vehemently and observe you as unique. From you, indeed, I especially expect letters, more and more every day, which would inform me whether you have received several of mine on the same subject and some refutations of the slanders of certain brothers, which the most false brothers had so unjustly fabricated against me. Others will also write about this matter, and our brother here from Lucca will be able to give you and others the most certain assurance about all things.</p>
      <p>But to you, a most pious and perceptive man, whose mind I had long ago perceived to be inclined towards me, nothing but the very lies themselves seemed, so that there is no need for my integrity or innocence to be proven to you by witnesses. This man, because he has suffered much for the name of Christ, having endured as it were a certain shipwreck of all goods and the long bitterness of prison, I commend to you as much as myself, if you can be of any help to him. He is also very well known to your people and wonderfully dear to all because of his utmost integrity. You, indeed, as soon as you can, write back and use my excuse, if it has been omitted by our Laelius, with Pellicanus and Bibliander, whom you will greet in my name again and again, along with Gwalther, Gesner, and the rest of the church, and especially Laelius himself, nor have I yet learned if you have done anything for me in England. My affairs are almost in the same state and are troubled by the same dangers; I am still hiding in the Brescian countryside with my wife and child, but I do not seem so besieged that I cannot sometimes go out and enjoy the company of people. Nothing has been done or proclaimed against me yet; I live in the hope of the Son of God, who comforts and strengthens me with His Spirit, so that I may stand in the confession of faith, and I tread this Babylon with dry feet.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord that I may persevere in this way. The day before yesterday, Mr. Florian came to me, and it was very distressing to me that I could not gratify him in any way; I was so constrained by all things. If you love me, make sure that I soon see your most elegant and pious letters, and if you have anything new, share it with us, as you used to. Farewell in the Lord always and love me in Him. Given in Venice on the fourth day before the Nones of April 1550.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you, B[althasar] A[lterius]. To the most upright and learned Lord Bullinger, minister of Christ in the church of ZÃ¼rich, always to be honored as a lord and brother.</p>
