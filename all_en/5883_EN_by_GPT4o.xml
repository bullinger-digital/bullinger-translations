      <p>General Critique Against the Errors with which Recent Heretics have Stained the Holy Scripture.</p>
      <p>I hear that the Emser are aiming for the provostship of this local foundation. Also, the knight Ruinel, residing in Bellitz, has a son by the pope's own hand; he is a canon here; he intends to promote him there. The pope has long since granted the provostship here; so the Salices would gladly keep it in their hands. Thus, we are lukewarm and poor in spirit, etc. - Dr. Traversus passed away last month, and I forgot to write to you about it. Certainly, our bishop has lost a great patron; therefore, I often doubted whether this man benefited or harmed our churches more. Certainly, because he acted on our behalf and nevertheless defended the bishop's cause so strongly, he deceived many who profess our religion and drew them to his opinion. He had my booklet on providence read to him while he was bedridden, a few days before his death. I am not certain about the nature of his death, nor did I inquire; the illness was prolonged.</p>

      <p>Dietegen von Salis denies the death of the Duke of Savoy.</p>
