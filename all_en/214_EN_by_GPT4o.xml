      <p>What could have happened to me that is more pleasing or desirable than to receive a letter from such a distant region from a man most dear to me in many respects, whom I can never admire enough for his singular piety and learning? You have even anticipated me in the praise of humanity, dearest Bullinger. However, it is perhaps neither necessary nor indeed possible for me to recount the reasons for my long silence without great sorrow. Therefore, I set that aside and am very grateful to you for deeming me worthy of your most delightful letters, which have indeed cheered me more than I can express in words. For I believe that the true face of religion exists only among you at this time, and that you have worked so well in this matter that your memory will always be most pleasant to me. As for our affairs, how far we have progressed in the matter of religion, I think it cannot be unknown to you.</p>
      <p>Know this, that all our countrymen who indeed sincerely favor the reborn truth agree with you in all things, both those who are placed in positions of honor and those who are counted among the learned. I except the Archbishop of Canterbury and Latimer and a few others among the learned; for among the nobility, I have no one who does not think excellently. As for the Archbishop of Canterbury, I do not know how he conducts himself in such a way that our common people do not attribute much to him, and the nobles consider him cold. Otherwise, he is a humane man with a gentle nature. Although Latimer does not clearly perceive what truth lies in the matter of the Eucharist, he is more favorable to either Luther or even Bucer. We are convinced that he will never be an obstacle to this cause. For he looks deeper into the matter than others, as he is of a truly divine intellect, and he wishes to come over to our opinion; but he is hesitant and reluctantly and even fearfully renounces an opinion once imbibed.</p>
      <p>But there is good hope that he will someday be entirely ours. For he does not shun any of us, but rather embraces and listens most eagerly to those discussing this matter, as one who exceedingly wishes this cause to be fully revealed and even persuaded to him.</p>
      <p>But more on these matters when there is more leisure. I ask you to greet most accurately on my behalf the best and most learned men, Mr. Theo. Bibliander, an outstanding ornament not only of the Helvetians but also of all Germany, Mr. Gwalther, and the others, along with the most courteous provost, my host, and your excellent wife. Farewell.</p>
      <p>London, 1 August.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bartholomew Traheron.</p>
      <p>The young man whom you recommended to me, since I was absent from London when he came there, I have not yet had the chance to see: if I can do him any favor, I will most willingly perform my duty for your sake. I hear he is now staying in Oxford. Farewell again.</p>
