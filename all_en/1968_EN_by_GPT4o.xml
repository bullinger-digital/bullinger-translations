      <p>S. D. That Italian Paulus, whom you wrote about, most esteemed lord Calvin and dearest brother, indeed sent letters to be delivered to you. However, I thought that they could not be entrusted to a better or more reliable messenger than the one I trusted, a baptized Jew adorned and recommended to me by the testimonies of many excellent men.</p>
      <p>I hosted him for a few days in my house, then gave him travel provisions and sent him off. He claimed that he would go directly to Mr. Robert, to whom our Pellicanus entrusted letters. So if he deceived, I think you will hold me excused.</p>
      <p>For if I could have suspected even a little bit of deceit in the man, I would not have entrusted your letters to him. For I wish to gratify and serve you above others.</p>
      <p>That nobleman you wrote about, whom the king uses as an envoy, etc., is still bedridden with illness in Baden. However, there is hope that he will recover shortly. For Mr. Gesner has gone to him for the purpose of treatment and was hopeful about the man's recovery.</p>
      <p>I received letters from England with the most unfortunate news. That most holy king passed away to the Lord on July 6th, and indeed he passed away most happily with a holy confession. In May, by his own authority, he published this booklet, which I send here. From this, it is clear how great a treasure the church of Christ has lost. He died not without suspicion of poison. Sharp inquiries are being made about the author of the crime. Indeed, Jane, the daughter of Henry Grey, formerly the Marquess of Dorset, now declared Duchess of Suffolk, had been declared queen, and not long ago was betrothed to Guildford, the son of the Duke of Northumberland, formerly the Earl of Warwick. But Mary, the sister of Edward VI, from Catherine of Spain, the aunt of the Emperor, having overthrown the Northumbrian party, seized the kingdom herself. Therefore, the five sons of the Duke of Northumberland are held captive in chains, and the father himself with his daughter, the Bishop of London, the Marquess of Northampton, Mr. Cheke, and many others. And would that no more be joined to them and that Reginald Pole, the reformer from Rome, not be called, which the Emperor is said to be contemplating. We must pray to the Lord to have mercy on His elect. The London church of foreigners has more or less 15,000. Where will the wretched flee if the Pope prevails? Therefore, we must pray to the Lord. Germany is miserable for many reasons, about which grief does not allow me to say more. Farewell. Zurich, August 26, 1553. Greet all the brothers, especially Farel and Gallas, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed and dearest lord and brother.</p>
