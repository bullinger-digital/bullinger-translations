    <p xml:id="regest1">Is hopeful that [Konrad Zwick's art of war] will remain secret for the time being, as it could also be beneficial for Zwick and the city [of Konstanz]; if it becomes known, he would rather see it in the hands of the French [Francis I] than the Emperor [Charles V] - the latter might be more dangerous for the inventor, but he cannot elaborate further on this; since Bullinger cannot help further, he leaves the worrisome matter at that and apologizes for having troubled him with it; Bullinger should pray for him and his office. Has not yet received the [Cologne] "Reformation" [the writing "Einfaltigs bedencken" by Martin Bucer] contrary to its promise. Greetings. Also, greetings to [Diethelm] Röist, assurance of loyalty, and blessing wishes.</p>

      <p>Especially friendly, trusted dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>In response to your letter this time, as well as previously, I am undoubtedly and with great confidence hopeful that this matter will remain secret until the time when the Lord wills it to be brought to light, especially since there are ways available through which my dear cousin here could gain considerable benefit, as well as possibly the city of Konstanz, without revealing the art, although I would much prefer to see this happen with the French than with the Emperor. For it seems to me somewhat more dangerous for the inventor, about which I cannot write further; since you do not think you can act in this matter, I will let it rest and remain with a request to forgive me for having troubled you with this matter, although I am still often greatly anxious, troubled, and distressed about it; fearing perhaps human temptation and nature, the cunning devil might make a fool of someone, which could also be too dangerous and cause deception to an upright mind. Yet we trust in dear God, that He will not lead us into temptation. Therefore, you should also call upon Him with heart and faith and always let me be entrusted to you brotherly and Christianly in these swift and terrifying times, so that I may be faithful in my office and one of the least servants of the Lord, whom He, when He comes, finds watching, etc.</p>
      <p>The Reformation has not yet reached me, waiting for it; for he has now promised to write and send it to me twice.</p>
      <p>Convey to your honorable, Christian wife, children, and all dear relatives many services, love, and greetings with the wish for all good things; earnestly request your faithful intercession for all of you.</p>
      <p>Given in Konstanz, the 19th of January, the year 1544. To my gracious, dear lord Röist, convey all my possible willing service; that you desire our loyalty towards and to be with you, you are undoubtedly assured. May the faithful, strong God graciously keep us in His protection and care.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, brother and incomparable friend. Zurich.</p>
