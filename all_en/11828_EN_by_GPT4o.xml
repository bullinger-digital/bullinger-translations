Greetings. Bullinger should return the letter from [Petrus] Dasypodius.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I could do nothing more than what you see. I have not yet received any news about the war in Lower Germany. The Emperor was recently still in Bonn, which is why Bucer is delayed. Glarean is said to have foolishly conversed with Röist; I would like to know what he would judge here. I would also like to know about Nice, which they call Nisa, if you have any information.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your family.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the first day of September in the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Return the letter from Dasypodius. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
