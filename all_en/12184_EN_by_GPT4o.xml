    <p xml:id="regest1">Hilles never doubted Bullinger's goodwill and generosity. Yet, he always surpasses himself with his gifts, which Hilles is very pleased about, but for which he can never sufficiently reciprocate. - John Burcher recently wrote to him that he is seeking [Zürich] citizenship, but for this, he needs confirmation from credible persons that he comes from a legitimate marriage and did not flee from [England] due to a crime, but for reasons of faith. However, since such testimonies from England are expensive and Burcher is convinced that the Zürich council would also recognize testimonies from men [on the continent], he asked Hilles to obtain testimonies from two pious Englishmen for him. These are the pious and learned William Swerder and the universally esteemed Miles Coverdale, whom he once recommended to Bullinger and who has already written letters to him [HBBW XII, No. 1645]. Coverdale is the head of the gymnasium in [Bad] Bergzabern near Weißenburg [Wissembourg], where he translates many learned works, including those of Bullinger, into [English] and thus makes religious writings accessible to the public. He is one of those who prefer to imitate Moses and go into exile rather than enjoy a godless life in Egypt. Another Englishman [...] has also confirmed that [Swerder] and [Coverdale] can testify that [Burcher] came to Switzerland from England for reasons of faith. Hilles has questioned Swerder, who is now working in Straßburg, and he gladly, as can be seen here for Bullinger, confirms with his signature that Burcher has a good reputation and was persecuted because of [his faith]. - Burcher also asked Hilles to obtain a testimony from Coverdale (who, according to the bearer of this letter, [...] knows Burcher best) in Bergzabern on his journey to Frankfurt. However, he refrained from doing so, because even though the locality is not far from the road from Straßburg to Frankfurt, the way there is made unsafe [by robbers] in contrast to that through the Margraviate of Baden. Therefore, he hopes that Bullinger will recommend the enclosed testimony [from Swerder] to the mayor [Johannes Haab] and council [of Zürich] in such a way that they will recognize it as sufficient. - Hilles himself did not know [Burcher] before his departure from England, as his birthplace [...] is seven to eight German miles [about 50 to 70 kilometers] away from Hilles’ [Milton in Kent or London]. However, among the [Protestants], it was known that Burcher left England only for reasons of faith and always behaved piously and modestly. Since Hilles has known Burcher, he has heard nothing negative about him, whether in England or [on the continent]. Hilles has also seen a long letter [from Burcher] to [Thomas] Cromwell, then the most influential man and [Lord Great Chamberlain] of King [Henry VIII], in which he explains the reason for his exile and the unjust treatment by the bloodthirsty bishops and church orders. From this writing, it is clear to everyone that he was persecuted only because of the Gospel and not because of a disgraceful act or false doctrine. After Burcher was treated so unjustly (the bishops almost imposed the death penalty on him), he hoped that Cromwell, through his position with the king, could achieve that he could return to England without denying the truth and without danger. Burcher would probably never have written such a letter detailing the background of his exile to such a respected and influential person as Cromwell if his persecution had not been the reason for his flight [to Zürich]. - Hilles therefore asks Bullinger for support for Burcher in his application for [Zürich citizenship] and in general. God will reward Bullinger for it, and Hilles himself offers his help to him and his acquaintances if needed. - He knows nothing new from [England], except what the letter bearer [...] will report. - His wife, [Anna] Hilles, sends her regards to him and his wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and thanks for the prayer included in the last [not received] letter for their son Barnabas and the Swiss shoes for [their son] Gerson. Greetings to Theodor Bibliander, [Konrad] Pellikan, Kaspar Megander, Erasmus Schmid, and [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Praise be to God! Greetings in the Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ! Although I have never doubted your love for all members of Christ, and I have often experienced your singular benevolence towards me, you nevertheless continue to make it more evident daily with your gifts. These are indeed always most welcome to me, as they are signs of that love towards me, from which I have greatly desired to be loved; yet they are somewhat unwelcome, as I would have preferred you to spare the expenses in this regard, especially since I do not know how to reciprocate, and even if I knew, your humanity would not allow me to do so. But let us speak of these things another time: now it seems we should proceed to the main point of this letter.</p>
      <p>It has been recently communicated to me through the letters of my compatriot John Burcher that he is earnestly seeking the right of citizenship in your city, but according to the praised custom and plebiscite of your city, he is temporarily prohibited from this until he can present some testimony from credible men that he was neither born of a wandering concubinage nor fled his country due to some crime against the state; rather, he fled because he had agreed with the sincere and Christian doctrine and had freely professed it with some of the brethren. Now, since obtaining such testimonial letters from England would be too costly, and otherwise, John Burcher trusts that the Zurich magistrate (endowed as they are with humanity) would kindly accept the testimonies of any men of proven faith and integrity who are in these regions, he asked me to procure testimonies for him from at least two Englishmen of sufficient faith and piety. One of them is called William Swerder, a nobleman in whom the zeal for learning is combined with piety and modesty of life. The other, I believe, is somewhat known to you from my recommendation and from the letters he has previously sent to you. He is called Miles Coverdale, a man who is indeed dear and held in high regard among all the ministers of the word and other learned men of this region, and he is the head of the school in Bad Bergzabern, a town not far from Wissembourg, where in his spare hours, for the broader propagation of the kingdom of Christ, he translates various religious writings, partly yours, partly those of other learned men, into our language, greatly benefiting those among the common people who are eager for the truth and are inflamed with some zeal and eagerness to obey the will of God, and promoting their salvation: he is one of those who, imitating Moses, prefer to endure exile and other adversities with the people of God rather than enjoy the wages of impiety with a wounded conscience in their native Egypt. But to finally conclude this matter briefly and concisely, since (I say) this John Burcher has not long ago written to me, and not only that, but another Englishman of good faith has confirmed that the aforementioned William and Miles can indeed be witnesses, if they wish, that John was compelled to abandon his prosperous fortune, which he previously had in England before coming to Switzerland, solely for the sake of true religion and no other crime, so that he might seek his livelihood there by the labor of his hands (as you are not entirely unaware); I approached William Swerder, who is now residing in Strasbourg, asking him, since he was well aware that John Burcher was of unblemished reputation and afflicted for the name of the gospel, as has been shown before, not to disdain to confirm his testimony about John with his autograph, as you can see has been done by him. Since the same Burcher also asked me to obtain a similar testimony from Miles Coverdale in Bad Bergzabern on my journey to or from Frankfurt (indeed, something more, because, as I have been informed by the bearer of these letters, he knows this Englishman, who resides in Germany, best of all), I could not accomplish this without some inconvenience to myself. For although I do not deny that Bad Bergzabern is not far from the main road from Strasbourg to Frankfurt, yet because the journey along that bank of the Rhine is less safe, especially for those who are thought to have money with them, than through the territory of the Margrave of Baden, I neglected my brother Miles's testimony; and this all the more quickly, because there is hope that you, for your piety and benevolence towards the afflicted of Christ, will recommend this very testimony, which we send with this letter, to the most prudent senate of your city, so that they will consider it sufficient and admit our Burcher into the number of their citizens.</p>
      <p>Now, as for my own testimony, I confess that the man remained entirely unknown to me before his departure from England: for the place where he was born was far distant from the city where I was born and lived, namely, by a distance of 7 or 8 German miles. However, this reputation about him spread there among those who were considered evangelical among us, which also reached my ears while I was still living in England, that he had changed for no other reason than that he was discovered to uphold the orthodox opinion in the matter of the Eucharist; otherwise, he always conducted himself piously and modestly wherever he lived: and indeed, just as he never, since he became known to me by face, gave any indication in his behavior why I should think otherwise of him, so truly I have never heard anything from anyone that contradicted this reputation; although both in England and after I moved here to live, his name often came up, even when there was a convenient opportunity to criticize, if there had been anything in him very deserving of criticism. Moreover, I can also testify about him that I have seen his rather lengthy letters to Lord Cromwell, the chief counselor of the king, a man who at that time was endowed with the greatest authority in the English kingdom next to the king himself, in which he explained the entire cause of his exile and how unjustly he was treated by the bloodthirsty bishops and the ecclesiastical order: from this writing, neither I nor anyone else could have any suspicion other than that he suffered persecution solely for the gospel, not for any other crime or the defense of unsound doctrine; for (as I still well remember) the main and indeed the only aim of his speech was to obtain, through Cromwell's authority with the king, that he might be allowed to safely return to England from the rage of his adversaries without denying the truth (for he always denied that he would ever do that). Hence, it is easy to conclude, and when I read it, it removed all doubt from my mind, that he would never have put so much and such diligent effort into composing this writing, as he evidently did, when he was trying to demonstrate the entire cause of his exile in one letter to a man of such dignity and authority as Lord Cromwell was at that time, if the persecution he was enduring for the profession of the truth had not been the main, indeed the only, reason for fleeing to your province.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beseech you, dearest Lord Bullinger, by Christ, for whom he is undoubtedly now in exile, not only to assist him in this matter, that he may become your citizen; but also in any other affairs in which he may happen to need your help or faithful counsel, that you may show yourself easy and kind to him. God, who, as you know and truly teach, does not leave any act of piety without its reward, will abundantly repay you in the future age. And if I, in turn, can gratify you with any such service towards any of your people, I hope you will find me no less ready and willing, as our Lord Jesus Christ, our life and hope, knows, in whom I pray for your safety and all good things to the glory of His name and for the salvation of your neighbors. Amen.</p>
      <p>I know of no news from our region, except what the bearer of these letters can report to your piety. My wife sends her most faithful regards to you and your most faithful wife: she also thanks you for the pious prayer you recently offered to God in your letters to me for our little son Barnabas; likewise for the Swiss shoes given to my Gerson. Please convey my greetings in my name to Lord Theodor Bibliander, Lord Pellikan, Lord Kaspar Megander, Lord Erasmus Schmid, and especially your Gwalther, and the other learned men who have served the church of God so well. May God Almighty keep you all safe with us for a long time to the glory of His name! Amen. Strasbourg, the 15th day of April, in the year 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, RICHARD HILLES.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious theologian Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the church of Zurich, and especially to be observed by me, let these letters be given. In Zurich.</p>
