      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>Your commendatory letters, most illustrious and highly revered sir, were brought to me by the fortunate and very beloved son of Dr. Engelhard, who has a commendable character. The venerable Lord Johannes Haller, the faithful minister and most vigilant pastor of the main church in Bern, had already written to me about him, in whose name this Felix was already highly recommended to me here.</p>
      <p>He also mentioned the exceptional praise, which the very venerable old Dr. Engelhard rightfully deserves, to whom all those who are well-disposed towards the gospel of our Lord Christ owe a great deal. To all this is now added your commendation, which is held in such high regard by me and all of ours (and rightly so), that he is even more commendable to us all, and we shall endeavor to ensure that neither faith nor diligence can be lacking. We commit the rest to God (as is fitting), who alone can grant a successful outcome to the affairs and studies of this Felix, as well as to all others. However, one thing troubles us in this regard, which is that we cannot treat those who are sent to us according to their dignity and merits, and those of those who commend them to us, as we would wish. For we have houses not sufficiently comfortable to accommodate many guests, and in our economy, being not very skilled, we usually buy everything at a higher price than the locals, which often results in boarders being maintained at a lower cost and greater profit among these citizens than with us. For what others accomplish by themselves, we achieve through agents. Nevertheless, with the Lord's help, we will treat him in such a way that he cannot rightfully complain about us and will recognize that your and Lord Haller's commendation was not ordinary. As for the great effort and dedication you promise us beyond any merit of ours, it is due to your kindness and generosity, for which we give you thanks, not as much as we owe, but as much as we can.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus, who keeps you and those like you safe for His church. Lausanne, June 29, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Jacques Valier.</p>
      <p>To the most renowned man of distinguished piety and exceptional learning, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the main church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
