      <p>Revered, highly learned, especially gracious, trusted, dear sir, I offer you my tireless, willing service at all times. Recently, I have delivered your letter to my gracious lord, the Landgrave, and after he read it, he said nothing else to me except that he wanted to write to you again. He also spoke kindly with me. He asked me about the state of my health. Which I did not want to hide from you, as I am willing to serve you. Given in the field camp near Giengen, Monday, the 15th of November, in the year 1546. Your very willing Heinrich Thomann.</p>
