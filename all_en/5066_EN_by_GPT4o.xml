      <p>Greetings. Since Mr. Peter has not yet returned and has not written anything to you, dear brother, about the latest communications, I have nothing to write about the French affairs, about which there is now great silence. I hope well for the Lord's grace.</p>
      <p>If, due to the arrival of certain German scholars at the court, no discussion has been held between them and ours, we expect Mr. Peter to return to us soon.</p>
      <p>May the Lord guide his journey! The fury of the enemies of truth is so great that he can hardly return without danger; but he is safe enough who is under the protection of our Lord God.</p>
      <p>If you have received any certain news about the Venetians, about Italy, about the Council of Trent, all of which you will investigate, please communicate diligently and promptly. Regarding Vergerio, I say this: I can hardly believe that he will come to Zurich; if he comes, he will be forced to listen to others as well, not to speak alone. You could easily understand what kind of person he is from his meetings and conversations.</p>
      <p>I have never offended him, as far as I know; he began to neglect me for no reason. When I noticed this, I let him remain as he is, and I remain as I am.</p>
      <p>I will say nothing now about his prince and Brentius; he is their servant. I suppose you have seen Brentius's book written against me. - The cause of the people of Claron has not yet settled.</p>
      <p>I wish that under the ashes there is not hidden a fire, and indeed the fire of the Lord. Therefore, we must pray to the Lord to have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>I would like to see Vergerio's booklet, I would return it after inspection. Greet the consuls, Gallicius, Pontasella, and other good men, especially Mr. Hercules von Salis, whose friendship I would like to gain through you; for I hear that he is a man of integrity in religion and otherwise also prudent, strong, and humane. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 21, 1561. Also greet Mr. Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>Behold, while I write this, Mr. Martyr has happily arrived safe and sound and joyful.</p>
      <p>I only greeted him; I asked whether the affairs of the gospel in France are going well; he replied very well. He was brought here by two captains, etc.</p>
      <p>After eight days, more or sooner, if I can; for I have not yet conversed with him, etc. To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, esteemed lord and his dearest brother. Chur.</p>
