    <p xml:id="regest1">A boarder of Peter Kunz [Adam Heinricher] has spread the rumor that Ritter left Schaffhausen dishonorably, and when Ritter wanted to take legal action against him, he referred to the mayor of Schaffhausen [Hans von] Waldkirch - probably meant [Hans] Ziegler - as well as the mayor of Memmingen as witnesses. Ritter was only briefly in Memmingen in the year 1525, but he remembers that Bucer once reproached him, saying that in Memmingen it was said he had abducted a citizen's daughter and joined the rebels [in the Peasants' War]; apparently, Bucer's followers [in Bern] are using these false accusations because they cannot harm Ritter otherwise. He asks Bullinger to intercede for him with Gervasius [Schuler], [pastor in Memmingen] and, if it seems advisable, also to write to the Memmingen council; he has also written to Schuler himself and encloses money for a messenger; he requests a swift and discreet resolution. Only Kaspar [Megander] may be informed of this; greetings to him.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Beloved lord and brother, a serious matter has come to my attention; therefore, I ask you to assist and advise me in this. Peter Kunz has a boarder who has publicly slandered me with malicious intent, saying: "Erasmus is a deceitful boy and is as dishonorable and dishonest as a vagabond boy who left Schaffhausen," and when I sought legal action against him, he mentioned Mayor Waldkirch of Schaffhausen, but probably meant Mayor Ziegler, as well as the mayor of Memmingen, as witnesses. Now, I have only been in Memmingen for about 14 days in my life, but in the year 1525, when all of Germany was in turmoil, I came there as a stranger, knowing no one, and have not returned since, so I cannot understand why this person would have mentioned the mayor of Memmingen. However, I do recall that when Bucer was in Bern regarding the Concord, and I spoke to him earnestly about the matter, he said, "Why do you involve yourself so much, you are a stranger; you should remember how you left Memmingen." I replied that I knew nothing but what was right. Then he said he had sat at a table in Memmingen; they had talked about the Concord and about me, and someone had said: "How can Erasmus behave so wrongly; he took a citizen's daughter away here." I said that would never be found true. Then he said I had joined the rebels. But I have disregarded such things as falsehoods until now. Now I must think that Bucer's followers are spreading such things against me because they cannot otherwise harm me.</p>
      <p>It is true that when I came to Memmingen, there had been a rebellion before I arrived, and everything was in disarray. But as a stranger who knew no one, it is possible that someone may have associated with me; however, I know before God that I am innocent of any rebellious words, deeds, actions, or plans, big or small.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my earnest request is that you write to Gervasius on my behalf and exonerate me - for I know that some, though falsely, accuse me of being unruly, of being against the Concord, of wanting nothing but bread and wine in the sacrament, empty signs, and other things - and ask him to help and advise how I might inquire with an honorable council in Memmingen or with the mayor about the situation and whether I might have a safe place to make my case - for God knows my innocence - so that no one gives testimony against me until I have made my case. And if you deem it good, perhaps you could also write to an honorable council in Memmingen yourself and inquire about the situation and how I should conduct myself in this matter, and do so promptly and send a special messenger at my expense. I have also written to Gervasius and send you here 2 gold crowns; you may use them to hire a messenger. Whatever further costs arise, I will gladly pay; just send the letters quickly so that I receive an answer before I set out on the road. For although I am sick and quite unwell, I would rather lose life and goods than my honor. But I trust that God will preserve me. Please discreetly and promptly advance the matter and send out my, as well as your, letter, and let the messenger bring back an answer. With that, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, 25th of September, 1542.</p>
      <p>You may trust Kaspar, but no one else; greet him warmly for me.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and brother.</p>
