      <p>If you are well, it is good; I am indeed well. Regarding all matters that pertain to your dignity, what I have done and what is to be decided further, I have diligently written to you as soon as I returned from Scotland. Now I will briefly and summarily go over these things, lest if by chance the previous letters are intercepted, it may seem that I have neglected something which I think is of great interest to you. And first, know that your speeches are greatly approved by the prince: indeed, it is certainly persuaded to me and to many others that you have included whatever judgment you have on sacred matters in that book. May that prince, God and supreme ruler of all things, grant that our lives and actions may someday respond to the voice and doctrine of his Son, now magnificently resounding through lands and seas. The prince affirms that he will write to you as soon as he returns to London or Bradgate; now he wishes to be excused to you due to many and serious affairs, in which he is more entangled than can be said: meanwhile, he earnestly asks that you bear his silence with an even mind.</p>
      <p>I believe the letters of Johanna Grey, the daughter of the lord, have already been delivered there, in which she strives to prove herself grateful and mindful to you; but because letters are almost always in danger of either being intercepted or entirely neglected, I thought it necessary to rewrite their example for your sake. It is as follows word for word:</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and most excellent in piety Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
