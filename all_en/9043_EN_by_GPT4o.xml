      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, most esteemed father, and we express our utmost gratitude for sharing those new developments from the Netherlands with us, which have somewhat lifted our spirits amidst such terrors.</p>
      <p>But today, Mr. Müller will finally learn of them, because the letters sent to Mr. Pontisella were not forwarded with the other letters, but returned to Campell; and Mr. Müller himself was not in the city yesterday; the day before, while discussing various matters with me, he claimed to have sent you a copy of that vile lie, which the envoy spread in Rhaetia to excuse the king, as if he had been forced to repel force with force, a copy of which I had prepared for you with my own hand; for Mr. Consul had already shared this with me before. I fear that the Rhaetians may be so beguiled by their tricks that they will be on the verge of taking up arms. He entertained many at a banquet; gifts are flying; new salaries are promised; nothing is left undone that might entice and allure especially the idle. No one should doubt our people of Chur; but many of the pagans of the Upper League will follow the example. We resist as much as we can with our sermons and letters to the brethren; but we will see the effect slower than we would like. The pensioners fear that if they prohibit and impede in time, they might lose the envoy's favor and their salaries. But no one fears God if we conspire for a bloody military campaign.</p>
      <p>Two miles from here in Lenz, in the village, a vision was seen in the sky on Friday evening at twilight, first a burning candle, which immediately turned into an arrow in a green field and circle, which candle and arrow then became a white Swiss cross. We intend to inquire further in Basel. The envoy hastens in a remarkable manner to preempt our admonitions.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly. Chur, September 30, 1572. Your Reverence, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the foremost and most illustrious leader of the Church of Zurich, his eternally esteemed master.</p>
