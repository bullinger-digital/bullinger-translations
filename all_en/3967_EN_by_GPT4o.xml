      <p>Greetings. Your letter (most illustrious man) written on May 6th was finally delivered to me on the 17th of the same month; you therefore hear the reason why I am replying somewhat late. Certainly, your joyful and desired news from England has greatly cheered us all. May God, the best and greatest, in His mercy, deign to bring these good and auspicious beginnings to a desired end. I have no new matters to share with you, except for what you are interested in knowing, and you strive to learn from me, namely, the state of the church in the Valtellina and whether the decrees of the assemblies have taken effect.</p>
      <p>Regarding this, you should know: the commissioners, to whom among other things this care was entrusted, have conducted themselves diligently and excellently, and indeed especially those from whom you would have expected nothing of the sort, which not only surprised me and others but also provided considerable consolation; for when it is seen that God, even when it seems good to Him, sometimes uses the work of men not so well disposed towards religion for the glory of His name (so to speak), we may hope for better things in the future, even if the behavior of men commands us to predict otherwise. A single village, Morben or rather Morbidus, did not comply with the commissioners' decrees, about which, however, action will be taken at the next assemblies, etc. They have bad advisors, and there are some among the pious who blame the one who is in power there (remains in power), who is from Davos, and as I hear from others, he had always conducted himself excellently in matters of religion before he was sent there with power. He is the father of the quaestor Paul Pul; now he has become the Landammann of Davos; for the previous one, namely Guler, was passed over. Captain Hercules von Salis, whom the pious in Valtellina use as a patron, has filed a lawsuit against this Davosian by name, and the matter will be legally disputed at the next assemblies to be held here the day after tomorrow. The current captain in Valtellina (this is, as you know, the highest authority there) abhors our religion; he has a brother who is a canon here in the foundation, is one of the Schauenstein family. However, the captain's authority in those places is great.</p>
      <p>You know that the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of God. But God, who still sits at the helm, has not yet resigned all power to these men. Otherwise, you are not unaware of what bribes are worth in those places.</p>
      <p>For what the Roman pontiff is plotting, lest he lose this suburb of Italy, is well known. I will write here some things for you to keep, until we see the outcome of the matter.</p>
      <p>When the envoys from the Confederates along with ours were dispatched from the Roman emperor at Augsburg, Ferdinand detained our envoys longer and took one aside and spoke with him in the following manner: "Dear mayor of Chur, for my sake, please commend yourself to the gentlemen of the Quadri family in Valtellina; also commend him in my name to the best of your ability to the Three Leagues, so that he may not be hindered in his honorable undertaking; I will be responsible for it in the best interest of the common land," etc. This one, however (is of the Quadri family, they are knights), intends to establish a school in Valtellina (undoubtedly at the expense of the pontiff; for foreign and newcomer monks are no longer admitted), so that the sons of the Rhaetians may be educated there, who could not be expelled afterwards.</p>
