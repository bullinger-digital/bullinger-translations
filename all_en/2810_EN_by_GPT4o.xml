      <p>I have conferred, my dear Lysmannin, as I promised, with my colleagues about selecting some man learned in Greek and Latin, whose services you might use in reforming the Polish churches and therefore experienced in practice and equipped with the ability to discuss, write, and preach, who would be added to you as a companion and fellow traveler in the work now to be undertaken. However, to avoid many circumlocutions, we have found no such person among us whom our church can spare. And since they themselves recounted almost the same reasons that I recently presented to you in person, there is no need for me to repeat them now with annoyance. Therefore, it will be enough for you, with your humanity, to know our goodwill and otherwise most eager and ready zeal towards you. You undoubtedly remember that old saying: in great matters, it is enough to have willed. You have your calling from the Lord, who will undoubtedly add His spirit to you, by whose divine inspiration you will successfully accomplish what is to be done according to your duty. Nor do I doubt that you will tirelessly pray to the Lord for this, knowing that without this nothing can be attempted successfully. I am returning to you the writing from Lausanne, which was not displeasing, for which I also thank you. I also ask, if you can conveniently and willingly, for the writings of Musculus and Calvin. Later, God willing, I will prepare two writings for you, one indeed to Felix Cruciger and to the ministers and nobility of his assembly, and the other to Alexander Vitellius. I am writing with difficulty now, but since it is necessary, I will comply with you, but within these two days I promise nothing. For tomorrow I must again preach in my laborious work. Consider this my brief writing kindly. I do not leave the house, which I bear heavily due to the air. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 13 January 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Francesco Lismanini, Corfu(?)</p>
