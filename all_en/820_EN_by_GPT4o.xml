      <p>Greetings. If I have seemed to respond to your letters, most excellent and learned man, later than I should have, it will not be that I can justly be accused, since they were delivered to me on January 24th, although they were sent by you on October 30th.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I regret that the pleasure and benefit I received from reading them was withheld from me for so long. Hardly anything could have been more pleasing to me than to have received and read your letters, especially as they were so benevolent and humane towards me.</p>
      <p>You congratulate me on the successful outcome of the disputations, which should rather be attributed to you than to me, who for so many years have taught and defended the doctrine that I have undertaken to uphold there: but if you knew how many and how great enemies the devil has raised against me for this reason, you would be amazed. Nevertheless, there are many things that console me not lightly: firstly, nothing has happened to me that I had not long foreseen in my mind; secondly, I understand that it is so arranged that in matters of faith, the more true something is and the more it contributes to the solid restoration of the churches, the more bitterly the devil agitates it and the more fiercely it is opposed by him. Moreover, although many oppose, I have several on the other side who support me, and (if I am not mistaken) they are not to be regretted. But I look primarily to God himself, who is the author of all truth: as long as he is (as I hope he will always be) favorable to me, he will be enough as a shield and spear against all the power of Satan. Therefore, I am of good and confirmed spirit, although I have not yet reached the final victory of this struggle; for I hear, and it is considered certain, that the adversaries are now renewing the war. They have prepared something, I know not what, to publish against the book I have already published, as they perhaps think it will succeed more happily for them when the fight is mixed not with the energy of the living voice, but with paper arms. But I hope, by the benefit of God and the work of the Holy Spirit, that the truth, which could not be resisted by words, will not yield to ink and paper.</p>
      <p>I write these things more freely to you, not relying on my own strength, for I otherwise know well how weak and sluggish I am in speaking and writing: but the evangelical hope, which does not disappoint, and the goodness of the cause make me bold.</p>
      <p>I also trust that I will be so aided by your prayers that my rudeness and inexperience, both in matters and in speech, will rather harm any other private business of mine than weaken heavenly truth in any part.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if I consider with myself how much importance this matter has, how great is the vehemence, hatred, and deceit of the adversaries, and finally how great is the weakness of my strength, I implore the support of your prayers all the more.</p>
      <p>I also congratulate your churches on this agreement of ministers, and I pray and beseech God to make it perpetual, so that we may finally see one spirit, one faith, one baptism, as there is one Lord, and there must be one body of the church.</p>
      <p>About the kingdom of Christ, how it proceeds here, I will not write much: for I think there are others whose diligence and zeal in writing to you ensure that our matters are not hidden from you: yet the sum is that there are still many things remaining, which we have more in hope than in reality. The obstinacy of the bishops is incredible: they resist with all their might; yet some from that order favor the undertaking, but they are few. Nor could it be said how great is the labor of the most reverend Archbishop of Canterbury: for whatever has been extorted from them so far, we have obtained it all through the industry, contention, and importunity of this bishop. And this raises our spirits, that something is always added to what we have already obtained: and we hope that by the end of these assemblies, which are now being held, something will emerge that will somewhat promote the restoration of the church. May the Lord grant peaceful times; for whatever tumult, disturbance, or sedition arises here, it is all attributed to the reborn gospel by both enemies and the common people.</p>
      <p>Nor does the devil cease; indeed, he procures obstacles of this kind with the most cunning tricks and fraudulent arts.</p>
      <p>Now negotiations have begun for peace between our people and the French, and envoys have been sent from both sides. May it be able to come together well. The king's uncle, who was once his protector, will soon be released from prison; and not only will his life be spared, but also his income and fortunes will be restored to him, so that he can maintain his status and dignity. These things greatly refresh the pious, as they have found him to be a great help to religion. I have nothing to write about public affairs beyond this. But I thank you all, because (as you write) you pursue me with sincere charity: nor do I congratulate myself a little, when I hear that in your regions I have both candid friends and faithful brothers in Christ: I ask you to kindly greet them very much in my name. Those locals you commend to me, I will help with all my strength in whatever matters I can. I pray to the best and greatest God, that he may preserve you safe for his church for as long as possible, in both respects.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Oxford, January 27, 1550. If you think I can do anything here for your favor, it will be enough to have mentioned it.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, and dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
