    <p xml:id="regest1">Briefly reports what he has learned from letters by Richard Hilles and [William] Peterson, which he received on January 12. Since the marriage of King [Henry VIII] to [Anne of Cleves], an excellent and God-fearing woman, things have improved in England; no one is persecuted anymore except the followers of [William] Watts, who is imprisoned in Canterbury - how fate can change! A certain [Robert] Barnes and his comrades are powerfully proclaiming the Gospel; all books - this is important for [Christoph] Froschauer - may be offered for sale, and the dissolution of all monasteries is to be completed before Lent; the abbots [Richard Whiting] of Glastonbury and [Hugh Cooke, known as Farringdon] of Reading were quartered for high treason and hung at the entrance of their monastery. [Peterson] will soon come to Bullinger regarding the transport of the [wooden] bows, whose delivery he agreed upon last year with [Rudolf] Schinz and others in Glarus; Butler asks for assistance. Bullinger should also take up the cause of the destitute Scottish refugee, who brings a letter of recommendation. Butler will do what Bullinger has asked of him. Best wishes and greetings.</p>

      <p>Peace and every blessing through Jesus Christ be upon you! On the day before the Ides of January, I received letters from Richard Hilles and the brothers Peterson, Englishmen: the intention and effect of which I intend to explain to you in this letter, as it seems important for you to know. I will strive to do this briefly, so as not to weary you with lengthy letters. The state and condition of the kingdom is much healthier and more intact since the queen's marriage than it was before. She is a virtuous and God-fearing woman, whose works have instilled much hope in everyone for the propagation of the Gospel. There is no longer any persecution except of the followers of [William] Watts, a certain impostor of the sect, who is now speaking in wooden shackles (an unworthy deed) in the mills of Canterbury: he was accustomed elsewhere to proclaim the Gospel for the purpose of proscription. Oh, the vicissitude of all things, and (as Ecclesiastes says) nothing is stable under the sun. Meanwhile, a certain [Robert] Barnes and his comrades are vigorously preaching the word. All books are available for sale (which I judged to be of interest to [Christoph] Froschauer, my well-deserving friend, to inform him). Above all this (immense to say), the monasteries are being demolished one by one, or are to be demolished before Lent: of the most opulent, namely Glastonbury and Reading, two abbots, condemned for high treason, were quartered and hung near the gate where each presided, withering away. Oh, a worthy reward for imposture! You have what I promised. Furthermore, these good men send you their earnest greetings, one of whom, as he promised me in a letter, will soon be with you in person, for the purpose of taking away the bows, for which he made an agreement with [Rudolf] Schinz and others in Glarus last year. Therefore, I beseech you, most beloved Mr. Bullinger, to ensure with these men that Peterson does not come in vain. Finally, I beseech you by the Lord Christ, to have mercy on this Scottish exile and destitute person, who brings you letters of recommendation; and to promote and support his cause and purpose, if it seems to you not unjust what I demand. I will accomplish, with God's guidance, what you have requested of me in your letters. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, who may keep you and your entire family safe for as long as possible. Given on February 24. Please convey my greetings in the Lord to all your comrades.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, J. BUTLER.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most famous city of Zurich.</p>
