    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enclosed, Bullinger receives copies of letters, documents, and a report on the conquest and suppression of the city of Prague, as well as numerous evidences of the arrogant, tyrannical exercise of power [by King Ferdinand and his brother Emperor Charles V]. May God put an end to this tyranny!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In one of the documents, Bullinger will find a draft of the planned [Swabian] League. Should the king consent to this and the alliance be established, Germany will fall into servitude, be deprived of its military power, and be drained by countless expenses. The plans and advances of these [Habsburgs] must be countered. Since they have ruled as kings and emperors, they have always waged wars and behaved arrogantly, as if they were the future rulers of the entire earth. Under the pretext of state order, they have deceived the poor estates and cities, for it was not about justice, but about exercising their tyranny. They promise [the allies] protection, whereas Germany was never better defended and protected than at the time when they were not in power and caused confusion. With this alliance, they aim to declare anyone who opposes the [Roman] king or the emperor as an enemy of Germany. The alliance is mainly directed against the King of France and the Confederates. If they do not take wise measures against it, they will be ruined!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] All this is intended only for Bullinger. Vadian does not want his name to be associated with it. However, Bullinger may copy anything he wants from these documents. He should only omit any names that appear in them. He can then show his copies to whomever he wishes. However, it is important that Bullinger returns everything within six days with a reliable messenger. The person [...] who entrusted these documents to Vadian does not know that they were sent to Zurich, and Vadian would like to be able to return them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Here, Bullinger, you have some copies of letters and documents, as well as a report on the conquest and suppression of the city of Prague, and countless evidences of the most arrogant tyranny, which, may the Lord put an end to, so that it does not spread further, and may He destroy and overthrow it, so that it does not endure any longer!</p>

      <p>In one of the examples, you will read a very cunning proposal for forming a league, which, if accepted and established at the behest of that monarch, Germany will serve in servitude, not only drained of all military strength but also exhausted by infinite expenses. For it will be necessary to obey the plans and insults of those who, from the day they took up kingdoms and empires, have not been without wars up to this very hour, so elevated in spirit that they seem destined to rule the whole world. The miserable estates and most wretched cities are deceived under the pretext of public justice, which, as I fear, will not be justice, but tyranny. Defense is promised, as if Germany had ever been more defended, safe, and quiet than when it lacked those leaders, whose madness has now thrown everything into confusion and upheaval. Finally, the whole nature of the business seems to tend towards making all of Germany an enemy to those who will be enemies of either the emperor or the king, nor does this faction seem to be prepared against anyone more than against the French and the Swiss, who themselves will bear that fatal destruction unless they very cautiously take counsel for themselves.</p>

      <p>But I write these things to you alone. For I would not want my name to be rashly exposed. But it will be free for you to describe everything, with names suppressed, and to communicate it to your own or whomever you wish. I earnestly ask you, however, to send everything back to me within six days by some reliable messenger. For the person who entrusted these things to me does not know that I have sent anything there. Therefore, you will not allow me to lack those things by which my faith is shortly to be redeemed.</p>

      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, 12th day of August, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours, Joachim Vadianus.</p>
