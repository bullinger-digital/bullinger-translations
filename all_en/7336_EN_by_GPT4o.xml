      <p>S. D. I received your letter in good faith, dearest brother. What I have about the French affairs, I have enclosed in this letter; these are considered certain. I am expecting other letters from Mâcon; however, I fear it is over for them. It is also written from Basel that an incursion has been made, but they were repelled. I fear that, since there are few in the city, they may not be able to resist such great forces. But victory is in the hand of God. I have heard nothing so far about the siege of Orléans; if it is besieged, it has been so for 3 weeks. The envoy behaves badly; I wish him a better mind. The interpreter follows the lord and almost overtakes him, etc.</p>
      <p>It is certain that Italy has suffered irreparable and dreadful damage from flooding in people, buildings, and fields.</p>
      <p>It is certain that the Turk is planning an expedition, the likes of which no prince before him has made in living memory. It is likely that the Voivode has been appointed heir of Poland, as he is a nephew through his sister; for Isabella of Poland was married to John, King of Hungary. More on this later; for there is neither time nor leisure to write.</p>
      <p>Would that Borromeo had taken his relative from Emps, the Bishop of Constance, with him to his joys. But the Lord has set a limit for each, which no one will surpass. God has graciously blessed us these days and given us a mayor in place of the late Mr. Müller, Master Hans Bräm, who is a very God-fearing, honest man, and as governor and commander, Master Heinrich Thoman, the old bailiff of Kyburg. May the Lord bless you and keep you and your household and your newborn child; I congratulate you, etc.</p>
      <p>Greet the three lords, the consuls, Lord Karl, Lord Pontisella, and Gantner, and all good people. If I receive any certain news, I will write again.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 19, 1567, the day on which 5 years ago there was fighting in France. Would that today peace be restored or fought with better fortune. May what is pleasing to the Lord be done!</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Tobias Egli, minister of the Church of Chur, my faithful lord and esteemed and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
