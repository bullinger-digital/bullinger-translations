      <p>Greetings and peace through Jesus Christ, our Lord, and my diligent commendation.</p>
      <p>I give you thanks, most esteemed father, for sending Johann Miscovius to visit us, and at the same time, I ask that you do not take it badly that he was detained here by us for a longer time. I am sending you the writing of Mr. Viret against that Heshusian censure and I am returning your letter printed in England, which I copied because it is written most learnedly and accurately. However, the letters I received in Geneva contain certain things that cause me trouble and affect me with no small annoyance.</p>
      <p>For I am being slandered by a certain Italian man of no ordinary standing, in which matter necessity compels me to implore your counsel and assistance. Therefore, I must leave the baths and postpone my health, so that I can satisfy good and pious men and maintain my reputation among them. Thus, I have decided to come to you on Monday or at the latest Tuesday, to do what I say, and then, once that is done, I will request letters from you to Poland and, after staying with you for only a few days, I will bid you farewell, and as my spirit foresees, it will not be a long farewell, much less an eternal one.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, may you live most happily with your daughters, most excellent maidens, whom I greet very much and commend myself to you.</p>
      <p>Given at Baden on August 8, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and observant Christoph Thretius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious in piety and all [virtue or]namented Mr. Heinrich [Bullinger] the elder, most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
