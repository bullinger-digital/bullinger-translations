    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends Cochl채us' book ["A Short Reply to the Long Answer of Heinrich Bullinger"?]; Cochl채us is a vain braggart who wants to win over the people of Lucerne to further antagonize Bullinger; he also reviled Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and the [Swiss] churches in his book against Musculus ["Defense of the Priesthood and Sacrifice of the New Law"]. The Italians and Spaniards are returning in droves from the war, nothing is heard about the [Swiss soldiers]; the French King [Francis I] is leading his entire army against the English [King Henry VIII]; the latter has fled to England, the French army is pursuing him and has besieged the almost completely destroyed Boulogne; today a nobleman [...] has come from the camp of the Swiss; what Gast learns from him, he will write to Bullinger with the next messengers. The household goods of Paul Fagius are being transported by ship to Strasbourg today; Gast wonders why Fagius is leaving the well-established church in Constance, but perhaps he has reasons that Gast does not know. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am sending the book written by the furious Cochl채us against you; if you have it, please return it, as I cannot find any other book by Cochl채us written against you. The soldier is boastful; he wishes to win over the people of Lucerne to create greater animosity against you. He also attacks Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and our churches in his book against Musculus on the sacrifice of the mass. Oh, what a foolish head! It is evident in these writings how maliciously he distorts the old theologians. But you understand these matters better than I do, as you have greater knowledge of divine things and a more fertile mind to detect deceit.</p>
      <p>Italians and Spaniards are returning in droves from the military; they are very wealthy; we hear nothing certain about our Swiss. The French King is leading his entire army against the English. They say the Englishman has fled to England, the French army is following, and has besieged the city of Boulogne, which is almost completely destroyed by bombardment. We do not know what will happen during the winter. However, today a nobleman from the Swiss camp has arrived, whom I will speak to; if he says anything plausible, I will write to you with the next messenger.</p>
      <p>The household goods of Paul Fagius are being shipped to Strasbourg today. I wonder how he could leave the well-established church in Constance and with what conscience he did it. Perhaps he has certain reasons that escape me.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your wife and children. Give my regards to Mr. Theodor.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 15, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his ever-honored teacher. Zurich.</p>
