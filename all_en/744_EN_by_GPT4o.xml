      <p>The zeal to promote the glory of God has driven me to interrupt your holy work, my Bullinger, which you are now engaged in, namely the revision of your Decades, with my writings. When I see the papistic heresy, through the work of false prophets and the instigation of Emperor Charles, which had long been put to rest by the efforts and diligence of both learned and pious men, now happily awakening again and emerging from the mud. I believe this is happening due to the laziness, indolence, and yawning of some, whom one can see have become more silent than fish, while the enemies have become louder than the Dodonaean bronze. I cannot be persuaded otherwise than to believe that our people, deterred by the cross, have now become more silent. In the past, when things were in the shallows, everyone eagerly descended into the arena to vigorously attack the papacy. Every day, countless writings and vast books were forged, all striving to win the prize in this contest. I was convinced that they were directing their strength towards promoting the glory of God more successfully. But our cross in these times proves where the spirit of many was directed and what they did, namely with the hope of gaining the vain things and glory of this world. This clearly shows why they placed their efforts in the business of Christ. Now, when we see that hatred and persecution are the rewards for our labor, we hide like the frogs of Seriphos. Seeing this, the adversaries are encouraged and raise their crests, singing a victory song with great praise from the impious and profane people, declaring triumph for themselves in this matter. Few, by Hercules, have been found so far who dared to attack that impious Interim. Among our people, I remember no one who wrote against it except Calvin. Who also (as I feel) did not explode it with the dignity that the matter demanded, nor did he satisfy the business. Not long ago, a rumor reached us that a huge and thorny volume of the sophists' work, elaborated in the Mainz workshop of Sorbonne, had been published, in which they strive to strengthen and reform papistic idolatry and superstition again with secular arm (if Codrus' guts burst). But I hope the Lord has seen otherwise, who knows how to overturn the purpose of the impious, as it becomes clear day by day, with great praise of his own, and to deceive the gaping crows. Many have composed various books to cleanse the truth from sophistic stains; but no one has refuted the errors and tricks of these and the Anabaptists better and more skillfully than you. Through your labor and diligence, by the grace of God, many errors in the church have been removed. The deplorable kind of people, namely the papists and catabaptists, men reprobate concerning the faith, have been exposed and scattered by you so far. Rightly in this fight, indeed, everyone should extend the palm to you. Therefore, since your labor has brought so much importance to the church so far, I want to urge you to again advance eagerly into the field of truth, called to battle by the adversaries, by writing in the German style, bringing their tricks to light, overturning and convicting them with praise, and vindicating the evangelical truth of both Christ and all of Germany. Do, I beseech you, not be deterred by fear of things or death, and conceal nothing. You know what the parts of your office are, what befits a pastor, especially you as an archbishop, whom the Holy Spirit has enriched with so many and such excellent gifts, undoubtedly not for any other purpose than that you may be a good and faithful minister in the vineyard of the Lord. I do not think you are unaware that a most ample and unfading reward is prepared for you in the future world. I am accustomed daily to lament and bewail with the prophet Elijah the scarcity of the pious and the overthrow of truth, when it can be seen that our labors are in vain and our hope is frustrated day by day, and the more we desire and strive to advance the business of Christ, the more it is going to ruin, while everything succeeds and prospers happily for the impious according to their wishes, proceeding in such a way, if I thought it was so in the fates, I would indeed bear and endure this hard condition, which now remains for the ministers of the word, with a more equanimous mind, if I did not fear that through the negligence and delay of some, the inconveniences and innumerable evils for the church would gradually creep in and arise. Fight with these beasts, I pray, and act as a strong and invincible champion and defender of the truth. For if these gifts of the spirit were granted to me, you would see, according to the zeal of God that I have, a soldier in the business of Christ who would not be cowardly or fearful. May the Lord deign to strengthen us to the end for the use of his church and his glory.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, and accept what I have written with the spirit in which it was written, my Bullinger, most adorned and dearest of all.</p>
      <p>We pray incessantly that the Lord may allow you to live a Nestor's age for the use of his church, amen. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given on the 26th of November from Glarus in the year 1549. Fridolinus Fonteius, your friend from the heart and most observant of you.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in ZÃ¼rich, my gracious lord, to his hands.</p>
