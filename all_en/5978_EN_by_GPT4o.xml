      <p>S. D. Before you wrote to me, dear brother, I had not heard anything from anyone about that heavenly and super-heavenly book; however, I know that Africa always produces some kind of monster for us. That book reminds me of the one mentioned by Eusebius in the sixth book, chapter 28, of his Ecclesiastical History. These are the trifles of the Elcesaites; those who believe in it are truly worthy of being deceived because they do not believe in simple and sincere truth. I completely agree with you that there is no other book of absolute truth in the world besides the Bible, and that Christ cannot be proclaimed more clearly than he has been proclaimed by his grace for many years. To Schwenckfeld and the sectarians, these things seem too common. Everything must be elevated for them; therefore, they will eventually gather with all the sectarians and hair-splitters in the Brentian heaven, which is nowhere and yet everywhere, that is, they will vanish with their fantasies. The Lord has faithfully warned us to beware of such quibbling; the world always wants something new and to be deceived. I see our princes not only squandering all their resources in luxury but also bringing in beasts to help them with their gluttony and excess. Little or nothing is given to the poor; indeed, if they have anything, it is taken from them and given to the beasts. This is the nature of the world; therefore, John asserts that the world is set in evil. I am sending you what I have taken care to have copied for you from the letters of Mr. Calvin and Beza sent to me through our Liner, who said here: "Advise Bullinger to have the summary of everything copied for Mr. Blaurer." Perhaps he is unaware that everything is common to us, as it should be among friends. Mr. Zanchi, who came from Strasbourg last week, passed through here to Clavenna, where he has been called as a pastor. He told me that in Rynfeld he found a man of remarkable character in an inn (I suspect it was Cardinal Lorraine, or another from Sion), who, after various conversations, called himself Richard de Prato, a canon from the court of Cardinal Lorraine, who a few days later set out on the same journey to Lorraine from Italy. He said many things about the books of Calvin, Oecolampadius, Martyr, mine, etc., full of bitterness, etc. He is a disturber of the world; you will judge this from the enclosed paper, which you will return. The Abbot of Einsiedeln, having left his monastery, set out on December 13th, accompanied by horses; he says he is leaving unwillingly but cannot prevent himself from going to the council to which he is summoned in Trent. Guess what such men are concocting. We must pray to the Lord to confound the counsel of the Pope's Ahithophel. It pains me that all of Germany, intent on its wealth, worships its belly and thinks little of its salvation and is little concerned about the plans of its enemies, seeing nothing with open eyes. Perhaps these things are hidden from its eyes because the day of its visitation is near. Lord, have mercy on us and save us from evil! Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 19th, on which day a year ago opposing forces clashed in France, 1563.</p>
      <p>Greet your brother, your sister, Gregor from Ulm, and their families. Yours always.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer, now residing in Leutmerken in Thurgau, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Lüthmärchen.</p>
