      <p>Greetings. I am awaiting a response to what we recently sent to you and again ask that, if it can be done conveniently enough, the document we sent be published in your language. The one who recently came from you told me that you are not in very good health, which was very distressing to us. Our Calvin is indeed better than before and is performing his duties, but he struggles with countless troubles. We suspect that our neighbor is plotting something against us, against whom may the Lord protect this church. There is a rumor spreading about peace between the English and the French, but it is uncertain. Most churches in France are being badly harassed, because there is the utmost impunity; in short, anarchy prevails there, and unless God has mercy on that kingdom, other calamities will follow, even more bitter than the previous ones, if anything can be added to them. However, in Lyon, everything is still quite peaceful, and by the grace of God, we cannot be accused of rebellion, not even by our enemies, since we alone obey the royal edicts. Amiral is gathering the forces of friends, as they say, to protect himself against the power of the Guise family. What will happen, I do not know; but unless the license of the wicked is restrained, great evils must occur. Meanwhile, may the Lord Jesus comfort us and guide his little ship through the midst of storms and into the harbor! The one who delivers this letter to you, Frisius by nation, has lived piously and very honorably in this school, whom I also commend to you for this reason. I ask you, my father, to greet all the colleagues on my behalf, and I pray to God that He may keep you safe for His church and bless your holy labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, July 29.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a father to me most worthy of respect, the truly faithful pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
