    <p xml:id="regest1">Learned from Bullinger's letter to Rudolf [Gwalther] that he is angry with him because of his departure [from TÃ¼bingen] and [the pursuit of] the master's degree; apologizes and points out that even lower costs arise here than in Zurich. Is also saddened by the letter from [Johann Jakob] Ammann and asks for renewed trust. New Year's greeting.</p>

      <p>From your letters, Father Bullinger, which you sent to our Rudolf, I understood that you are angry with me both because of my departure and because of the matter of the degree or, as they call it, the master's degree, which has brought me not a little distress; for it should not seem trivial to me if I have you, to whom I always flee as to a sacred anchor, angry, since with you alone as my supporter, I possess all my fortunes, especially well-founded and well-established resources.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since I cannot bring any peace to my mind until I know that I have reconciled with you, I beg you again and again to forgive me; for the reason I requested money again in the recent letters sent to my mother was due to the matter of the degrees (for thus they call these dignities), which I would have otherwise omitted, for there was no need because of the convenience of this place. For we are now in such a city that we see our studies are well provided for and we can live much more cheaply than even in Zurich. I will strive to meet the expectations of good men regarding me to the best of my ability, if only what remains; for I am so afflicted by the letters of Ammann that I think nothing of my former reputation remains except what is retained by your clemency. But because I know you have more business than to be able to attend to these my trifles, I will now make an end of writing and will beg you to restore him, whom you once helped with many benefits, to his former reputation. I earnestly and repeatedly beg you to be willing to do this.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue to love me as you are accustomed. May the Lord make this year happy and prosperous for you and yours, I pray.</p>
      <p>Marburg, December 21, 1540. In Christ. Your Johannes Wolf.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Zurichers, his reverend father.</p>
