      <p>Mr. Gastius very kindly brought to the house of Mr. Münster, with whom I am staying, your very kind and most dear letters, for which, however, I cannot express how much I am obliged to you. But since I believe that this is already well known to you, I ask you to inform me further about the same, so that I may at least confess that I owe you not a little, because you do not conceal that I owe you much. As for Myconius, you seem to have a better opinion of him than he has of you; however, although Secundus always speaks honorably of the people of Zürich and most honorably of Mr. Bullinger, I have not yet ascertained what he thinks about the agreement; but you will know shortly. I will certainly write to Calvin once I have found a reliable messenger, and perhaps it will not be regrettable to have written. As for Florian, what should I say, as if he were still unknown to you, who has conducted himself in such a way that he is now known to all, and more than he undoubtedly would like. Mr. Uttenhofe sends you many greetings; he writes to me about two brothers of the Lord of Fales, who are detained for Christ not without danger to their lives; however, I do not think this is new to you. I beg and implore you to send to our Baldassare a few written reasons why you refuse the alliance and what was finally decided in the present assembly, I speak as far as such external matters are concerned and as far as it is permissible for a foreigner to know, and please do not consider me rash, most prudent man, since I ask for this not for myself, but at the request of your most friendly. I will deliver the poem to Mr. Schertel and greet him in your name. If there is anything that I think is worth you knowing, I will write immediately. As for English affairs, since you will understand everything abundantly from Bernardino's letters attached here and from the courier himself, what should I add, except that we should incessantly pray to the prince of shepherds, that he may quickly gather his scattered sheep and feed them with that food, from which their eternal life consists with his glory, amen. July 19, 1549. Basel.</p>
      <p>Greet everyone and assure them that they are always fixed in my heart. Yours most observantly, Lelio Sozzini.</p>
      <p>Forgive me if too hastily.</p>
      <p>In Spiera I will follow your judgment, although something else may perhaps be published in the name of Ghiribaldi.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant and always to be observed bishop among the people of Zürich.</p>
