      <p>Greetings. I am finally sending, most esteemed lord, what should have been delivered to you earlier, namely, what you desired to have concerning that troublesome man.</p>
      <p>I have summarized it briefly; without a doubt, you will hear more clearly from him at some point.</p>
      <p>All good people wish either for him to be brought into order or for the obstacles to our church to be removed by his absence.</p>
      <p>For he is so troublesome and shameless that they rightfully expect him to be brought into order. Enough leniency has been shown to him so far, enough has been done with him, if only diligent and frequent admonition had achieved something with him.</p>
      <p>He boasts of many things, but which are hardly in agreement with the truth; he flaunts much knowledge, which only testifies to his own wickedness. He preaches much about fairness and charity, while no one is more troublesome and prone to quarrels among us than he is. These and many other things in him are what we now allow you to correct in him.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve you safe and sound for many ages for the safety of His church. Meilen, January 9, 1550.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Haller, your most esteemed. To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and father.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
