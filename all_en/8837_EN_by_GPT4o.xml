      <p>S. D. P. Once again, I am compelled to trouble you, venerable father, even though I know you are overwhelmed with business and it would be inappropriate or certainly not fitting. A great prodigy appeared here in Chur this winter, so much so that I could not refrain from writing about it, having consulted with my most beloved brother, Mr. Tobias, and as accurately as possible, according to the accounts of men who saw it, whose credibility no good person among us doubts, as can be better gathered from the very history of the prodigy. That it is significant and portends something of great importance can likewise be observed from the narrative of the event (if indeed prodigies should be included among historical events) and from those things which have already begun to happen or have been done so far: from the prologue and climax of that tragic (alas, sorrowful) drama, of which the Pope is the author, and the Rhaetian lord is rightly considered the main character along with his son, etc. May the catastrophe of this drama, if not joyful, at least be fortunate for our republic! Certainly, in recent days, the people or communities of Rhaetia, stirred and aroused by what the Rhaetian leaders have done so far regarding the business of the Rhaetian lord, have gathered at Chur with military banners raised from all communities, numbering about 20, starting with the people of Pr√§ttigau, already 14 days ago. Indeed, at least two thousand men of the Upper League led the Rhaetian lord captive to Chur last week in a truly pitiable manner, where he is now held in public custody, bound and shackled with two chains, while at least four thousand armed men remain in Chur or more in its suburbs or in the surrounding neighboring villages under their banners.</p>
      <p>Although they are admonished and ordered by the nobles, even threatened with penalties, and when this does not succeed, they are asked and persuaded to leave, leaving only as many as are necessarily required to conduct the trial, they have so far refused to obey and instead order them to leave; for if they had done their duty, they would not have had a reason to gather in this way; now they, as the supreme magistrate of the Rhaetian republic, wish to establish a court that will impartially pronounce judgment and justly punish the guilty, whether it be the Rhaetian lord, the papal knights adorned with gold and chains, the monks, the instigators of the murder of preachers and pious men, or the advisors of defection to the Valtellina subjects. And this court has almost been established by the people. Furthermore, they say they are bound by oath among themselves to do no harm to anyone, nor to bring violence to anyone or attempt anything violent against anyone, but only to attend the trial and ensure that it is not corrupted or deterred from the right path by anyone, and to remain here until the end of the whole matter. And they have so far fulfilled this, while they live peacefully and honorably with everyone, while we, in the meantime, are caught between fear and expectation of what the outcome will be, along with many good people. Hence, since I believe that whatever this prodigy is, it will not be in vain or fruitless, I could not refrain from describing it in detail and sending the written account to you and to Mr. Josias Simler, asking that you ensure, if it seems worthy, that it be printed and published. However, there are those who are not ashamed of their lies and spew them against us, as if we were the authors of all these disturbances and tumults, against whom we have always strongly declaimed and seriously opposed them with our sermons and writings, although we have revealed in how many ways and with what wicked schemes and plots the detestable Pope, the thief of the Rhaetian republic's liberty and our evangelical religion, is plotting, and we have warned our people to beware of such a monstrous enemy: hence, I say, we do not care about the slanders of impious and ungrateful men, relying on the conscience of justice and righteousness, since we have publicly protested our innocence here both in our sermons and in the public assembly of the Rhaetians, and have shown that we have cleared ourselves of slanders and have so refuted and convicted the slanderers of their lies, that those who now accuse us of sedition because we have cried out against the Pope as an enemy and warned the people to beware of him, do nothing more justly than those who would accuse a good and faithful servant of some unfortunate tumult because he, having caught a thief who was plotting to steal his master's goods, called out to the master and the other servants and with his cry roused them to run and prevent the thief from stealing, in which commotion something unfortunate might have happened, who, I say, would revile the servant as a seditious and pernicious man, but praise and defend the thief as a good man and free from blame. Behold the most absurd indignity and injustice of the matter.</p>
      <p>But I am foolish to discuss these things with you; therefore, forgive me.</p>
      <p>The brothers who have come here in these disturbances send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Likewise, on our behalf, greet Mr. Tobias, I say, and Mr. Rudolf Gwalther and Mr. Josias Simler. Farewell happily.</p>
      <p>Given at Chur on the 24th of March in the year of our Lord 1572. Always, as is fitting, your most observant Ulrich Campell.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the church of Zurich, lord and father to be honored with all reverence always.</p>
