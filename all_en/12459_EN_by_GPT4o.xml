    <p xml:id="regest1">Simler received Bullinger's letter [not preserved] as well as that of his father [Peter]. He is surprised by the rumor expressed in the two letters that the plague is raging in [Basel]. It probably stems from some deaths in the [Basel] suburb of St. Alban, which occurred before Simler and [Huldrych Zwingli the Younger] arrived in [Basel] three weeks ago. Since then, at most five people from the large community of St. Leonhard have died, due to old age or other illnesses, as [Konrad Wolfhart], the [house] master [of Simler and Zwingli the Younger], testified. No one had the plague. Simler also shares this in the enclosed reply to his father.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Regarding the lectures: In the morning, they only attend Johannes Hospinian's lecture on Cicero's rhetorical work "De inventione". From noon, Veit Ardüser lectures on arithmetic. Hospinian explains Cicero's speech "Pro Milone". Additionally, there are [Martin] Borrhaus' lessons on [the book of] Exodus and [Ulrich] Hugwald's lecture on Aristotelian ethics. They would also listen to dialectics, but Markus Hopper is almost at the end of it. However, they will attend Hopper's lecture on [Johannes] Caesarius' "Dialectics".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Simler does not send a booklet edited by Justus Jonas on Luther's death, because the [Zurichers] should have already received it long ago. He encloses a printed picture with the Pope [as Antichrist], which Bullinger possesses on a [shiny, metallic] object.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Simler and Zwingli [the Younger] send greetings to [Anna Bullinger, née Adlischwyler], the maid [Brida Schmid], and the whole family. [Konrad Wolfhart] and Zwingli [the Younger] send their regards back to Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I received your letter, most esteemed sir, in which you mention the rumor spreading among you that the plague is raging here, which I cannot quite understand. However, I acknowledge that here the reputation of evil, which nothing is faster than, has been well described by poets; indeed, the poet truly said: "As tenacious of falsehood and fiction as of the message of truth." I believe this rumor originated from the fact that in the suburb named after St. Alban, several people died of headaches before we arrived here. However, by God's will, the disease is now ceasing. Very few are bedridden, and even fewer have been. In these three weeks, four or at most five people have died in the church of St. Leonhard (which is very large), and they were taken by old age or other illnesses, as I learned from our master, who visited the sick themselves. None of them suffered from the plague. My father informed me of the same, to whom I briefly replied with these attached letters. Therefore, I would not want you to think that I would hide from you if the plague were reigning, if there were any. With the Lord's help, I will diligently carry out your exhortation.</p>

      <p>I will also briefly recount our lectures here, so that you may know what our studies are. In the morning hours, we only attend one lecture, namely Johannes Hospinian's on Cicero's Rhetoric "De inventione". In the afternoon, we listen to Veit Ardüser lecturing on arithmetic, and Hospinian reading Cicero's speech "Pro Milone", as well as Martin Borrhaus on Exodus and Ulrich Hugwald lecturing on Aristotle's Ethics. We would also listen to dialectics, but Markus Hopper is almost finished with it. When he starts on Johannes Caesarius, we will attend.</p>

      <p>A booklet is circulating here about how Martin Luther ended his life, published by Justus Jonas, who was present; I would have sent it unless I thought it had already reached you long ago. I am sending here a printed picture of the Pope, as you have engraved in silver. I do not want to burden you, otherwise very busy, with more of my trifles. May the Lord keep you all safe for as long as possible. Convey my warmest greetings, both in my name and in Zwingli's, to your wife, the maid, and the whole family. Our master and Zwingli send you their warmest regards. Farewell. Dated April 5.</p>
