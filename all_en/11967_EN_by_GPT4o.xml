    <p xml:id="regest1">Received the two letters with the recommendations of Johannes Fabricius [Hans Schmid] and the Franciscan; Fabricius could barely answer the usual examination questions and was therefore provided with good advice. The Franciscan was sent on to Constance; there are too many local poor people with whom both the council and the administrators of the church properties are excessively burdened, and the price demanded by the craftsmen [for an apprenticeship] was too high for Bullinger with his large family. Regarding Myconius' accusation that he is silent: Bullinger responded to Myconius' last public letter [No. 1866] [No. 1877], but Myconius has not reacted since; Bullinger maintains that Myconius has interpreted the words "This is my body" differently than before, as he is said to have stated: "Wett, the devil taught them to interpret the Lord's words 'this is my body' as 'this means my body'"; if this is true, the Holy Scripture and the Church Fathers must be opposed to him, otherwise Myconius' response [No. 1866] suggests that he has lost his former simplicity and clarity; however, assures him of his friendship. Recommends the bearer Bernhard Lindauer, who wants to study and is about to travel to Hesse.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received two letters from you, dear Myconius. In the first, you recommended Johannes Fabricius [Hans Schmid] to us; when we examined him as per our custom, he responded so coldly, or rather not at all, that we were all forced to marvel and feel sorry for him.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, we gave the poor man some advice. If he follows it, we hope it will turn out well for him.</p>
      <p>In the second, you recommended the Franciscan, whom we received kindly, but then sent him on his way to Constance with provisions. I did not want to plead his case with the magistrate or the deacons of the church, who I believe are the administrators of church properties. I know that there are more poor citizens and locals than can be helped according to their needs, and I do not willingly burden those who are already sufficiently burdened. The price that the craftsmen demanded from me was more than I could commit to, as I saw that it would have to be paid from my own resources. Indeed, my family is already quite large. Therefore, I gave him provisions and a recommendation. I also gave him advice and sent him to Constance.</p>
      <p>I could do nothing else at present.</p>
      <p>In your last letter, you write: "You write nothing, you respond to nothing, you do not greet, you act as if you never knew me," etc. What should I write, my dear Myconius, or what should I respond? I wrote in my own name and in the name of the brothers. But you were so disturbed and agitated by that letter as by nothing else. I responded to your last public letter, and what I thought pertained to me, I did not treat in passing, but I addressed. However, you have not responded to it until now. I did not present the public letters to the brothers for no other reason than what I indicated in my letter. Before God and with you, I freely and sincerely say that your opinion on the Eucharist, which you hint at, does not agree with the one you once followed, or I do not understand you. Once, the Catholic interpretation of Christ's words: "This is my body," that is, "This is the sign, figure, memory of my body," was pleasing. But now you say: "Wett, the devil taught them to interpret the Lord's words 'this is my body' as 'this means my body'." If you said so, I respond that Scripture and the holy fathers provide us with that interpretation, which I can demonstrate with clear and most effective testimonies. If you did not say so, what you wrote in your last and public letters is such that, unless I do not understand you, they do not have your former simplicity and clarity. This grieves my heart. Otherwise, my feelings towards you have not changed. I love you, respect you, and wish you all the best. You will find a friend and brother, you will praise faith and love, wherever you need my help.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter, Bernhard Lindauer, a young scholar, wishes to see and hear the learned. He is traveling to Hesse. I commend him to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 2, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To D. Oswald Myconius, most vigilant bishop of the Basel church, dearest brother.</p>
