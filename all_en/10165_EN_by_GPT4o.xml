      <p>Philipp, by the grace of God, Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc.</p>
      <p>Our gracious greetings to you, highly learned dear friend.</p>
      <p>We have received your letter. And it is true, we would have gladly done our best with you and your associates to prevent separation and division. And whatever we can still do to prevent division and separation among those who have accepted the Gospel, so that everyone may remain and be left in peace and tranquility with the Gospel, as much as the Almighty grants grace, we are entirely inclined to do. We did not want to hide this gracious intention from you.</p>
      <p>Given at Kehrenbach, on the Sunday after the Nativity of Mary, in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Philipp, L. of Hesse, etc. signed.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend, the highly learned Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastic in Zurich.</p>
