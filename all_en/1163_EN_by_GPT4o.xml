      <p>Greetings. Since nothing is dearer or more pleasant to me than to frequently engage and converse with pious brothers in Christ, I am not a little nor commonly grieved that due to occupations, I am so rarely allowed to write to you. I indeed received your letters in November, which you had sent to me much earlier; and since I understood from them that you are well, and that everything there is conducted quietly and peacefully, I greatly rejoice. Although we here do not yet have what is required for the well-being of the church, we do not despair that things will improve day by day: the progress is slow, alas! May the abundance of fruit someday compensate for the slowness! I believe you have been informed about Mr. Hooper, how he has fallen into a very serious contention with the Bishop of London, a truly learned man who otherwise vigorously defends the cause of the gospel; this matter is as troublesome to all of us as it is most desirable to the papists, since they now think we are at odds among ourselves: but I promise myself so much from the goodness of God, that it will be enough to finally settle this dissension; and although at the beginning there were several points on which they seemed to dispute among themselves, I believe that all other matters will be easily settled if they could agree on the matter of vestments. The bishops wish the ministers of the church, in performing sacred functions, to be distinguished by some attire from others: Hooper vehemently denies this is permissible, claiming it is impious and contrary to the holy scriptures. And since almost two years have passed since the time when the mass was abolished by the universal (as they say) parliament of this kingdom, and a certain rite of the Lord's Supper was instituted, by which some vestments are assigned to the ministers of the church; this now troubles the royal counselors and many other men, both noble and common, that a publicly accepted decree, and confirmed by the authority of the kingdom, is being overturned as impious, and condemned as if it were fighting against the divine scriptures: there are also many on the other side who are devoted to Hooper and wonderfully favor him. The bishops (I speak of ours) indeed admit that this use of vestments is indifferent, so that it can both be used and removed; but they utterly deny that it is impious and contrary to the holy scriptures, and they do not allow the people to be taught this belief. And this dissension has flared up, which greatly distresses me, to the point that Hooper holds the bishopric conferred upon him as a knot, and is excluded from the office of preaching, in which he was not unsuccessfully engaged. May the Lord grant that some not regrettable tranquility may finally follow this turbulent storm! I also ask you to request this from the Lord again and again with your faithful prayers.</p>
      <p>When I was asked in recent days what I thought about this question, I replied that I am most eager for simplicity in sacred ministry; therefore, I advise that distinctions of attire be removed, and that this be decided by public authority as soon as possible; however, in the meantime, I could not acknowledge that the use of those vestments is impious or condemned by the holy scriptures; yet because that diversity of attire has little or no edification, and many abuse it superstitiously, I therefore judged it should be removed. Bucer did not respond differently. Therefore, in reality, we all agree that this use of ecclesiastical vestments should be abolished, although not all of us have the same reasons. If we cannot achieve everything we desire, I am nevertheless led to easily believe that we will obtain greater simplicity than has been granted so far. Not everything can be accomplished in one moment; labor and time are needed for an unformed fetus to reach the proper symmetry and shape of its members. This is the only thing I bear with great difficulty in this cause, that contention has arisen with those bishops through whom it has been labored here that the gospel may have a place, both vehemently and with no small risk to them.</p>
      <p>Now you have the summary of the whole business; as soon as any desired outcome reveals itself, I will not hesitate to inform you. Meanwhile, here in Oxford, I continue to sustain the province entrusted to me, although very difficult, with the diligence I can; hence, the more I deal with obstinate minds, the more vehemently I implore the aid of your prayers. Then I ask you, most excellent and dearest in Christ Jesus, to help me with your authority, which you rightly and deservedly wield there, in a certain matter of mine, indeed a public matter of the church and school. I have given my commentaries on the first epistle to the Corinthians to Byrgmann the bookseller, to take care of printing them. And since he (as I wished) has decided to have them printed in your city, and now, as I hear, is among you, I would like someone from the brothers there, at your urging, to spend some labor so that the book may come out as corrected as possible: for I was pressed in a remarkable way by the constraint of time; therefore, there was no time, as the matter required, and I would have desired, to carefully correct everything. For this reason, I would like the diligence of someone else to make up for what I could not provide; and since the matter is theological, and some Greek and Hebrew are often cited, it would be necessary for a corrector to be employed in the printing who is both learned and pious: for as through learning he will not deviate from the sense, so piety will lead him out of charity to replace a better reading wherever he finds the scripture corrected. It is certainly not a small thing that I ask of you, but perhaps a not regrettable fruit will be given: for this work is demanded in this kingdom with importunate and constant prayers; and although I think I have written nothing exceptional, and not said by other pious men, yet I know that the desire for certain books and the intense expectation often make them so recommended that they are read most eagerly by many, not for their merit, but for the hope conceived about them. Hence, what is often despised when written diligently and aptly by the most learned, the same is most gladly accepted when published by those far less learned: therefore, I would like our people to write constantly, and to inculcate the same things in various and diverse forms of treatment; for what sometimes does not succeed well in one way, if another is tried, it succeeds prosperously.</p>
      <p>But I will cease to deal with you at length, who have both written many things correctly and read many things diligently, and therefore know well how important it is for books that are printed to come out corrected and emended. If I seem bold in asking, I beg you not to blame my confidence, but attribute it entirely to your and all of your kindness, who have so often and so kindly offered me your assistance through letters; and since it has been indicated to me that Wolphius is suitable for doing this, and perhaps would not reluctantly undertake this burden, if it seems good to you, you could encourage him. I will take care to send the dedicatory letter, which is desired in the book, there within a few days. I wish you well in the Lord. May you bid all your fellow ministers from the least to the greatest to be well in my name; although I do not write back to them now, as soon as I have leisure, I will not fail in my duty. January 28, [15]51.</p>
      <p>In Oxford, England.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>From Peter Martyr of Oxford.</p>
