      <p>S. D. With great longing I received your letters, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, but I read them with the greatest sorrow, as I see all of France embroiled in conflict. I am glad to hear that the most illustrious Prince of Condé is well-prepared.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore pray to the Lord, that He may be with his army and that he may act swiftly with God as his guide, for there is great danger in delay. It is true that soldiers are to be enlisted for the king from the Swiss; for this reason, a meeting has been called for April 26 in Solothurn. Yet I know well that some of the more moderate will send peacemakers rather than killers.</p>
      <p>I urge here, as much as I can, that our people do not fail in their duty with the cities. Again, I know that many of the Five Cantons are already prepared to commit any cruelty. Why does not Condé write to the four cities and briefly explain his cause to them? The document you sent, I am now having translated into German, so that Brenz may read or hear and understand it. I have long seen that everything the adversaries do is aimed at our complete destruction.</p>
      <p>But we are in the hand of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Let what seems good to Him be done.</p>
      <p>May He at least grant us constancy in the truth. I beg you, my brother, ensure that we quickly understand how far matters have progressed in France, so that if it is good, our concerns may be alleviated and we may rejoice in the Lord, or if it is bad, we may grieve and pray, and faithfully offer our assistance to them. I will not refuse to do what my strength can accomplish.</p>
      <p>Would that I could do much.</p>
      <p>A summons and public assurance from the council were sent here in recent days.</p>
      <p>For the Swiss cities are called to the council. For these men have once decided to proceed with their plan, and if God permits, to fill everything with innocent blood. May the Lord our Savior protect us from evil.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love us in Christ.</p>
      <p>May the Lord defend and preserve you.</p>
      <p>I wrote this very quickly.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 19, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful minister of the church of Geneva, his honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
