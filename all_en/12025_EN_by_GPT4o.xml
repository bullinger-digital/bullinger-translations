    <p xml:id="regest1">A year ago, Myconius asked Bullinger for help for Alexander Rischacher's son [Martin?]; he thanks Bullinger for complying with the request; since the present father now wants to take the son with him, the [Zurich] church will be somewhat relieved; may God worthily reward Bullinger. Emperor [Charles V] is said to have left Saint-Dizier and set out for Châlons; from there, however, he moved towards Mézières in fear of a forced confrontation, but Myconius does not know if this is true. The cruelty of the Englishman [King Henry VIII] is exaggerated; the Imperialists boast of having brought the Dane [King Christian III] to their side and of preparing an army against the Frenchman [King Francis I]; Myconius wonders how [Landgrave Philip of Hesse] will take this. Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander] and [Konrad] Pellikan, who is to answer Myconius' question about who the deceitful informant [of Basel affairs] among the Zurichers is.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It has been a year since I asked you for help regarding the son of Lord Alexander Rischacher. You complied with my request, for which I am immensely grateful. The father is now here to take his son with him, as I believe, because our people have offered hope for a better situation, and therefore your church will be somewhat relieved. May the Lord grant you and yours a reward worthy of your kindness.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is said to have left the town of Saint-Dizier and set out for Châlons, but out of fear of being forced into a confrontation, he moved towards Mézières, as he realized that both reinforcements and supplies were lacking. What the truth is, I do not know. Everyone exaggerates the cruelty of the Englishman. The Imperialists boast that the Dane has been brought to the Emperor's side and is preparing an army against the Frenchman. I am very curious how Hesse will take this, if it is indeed true. I write this so that I do not write nothing.</p>
      <p>Farewell to you and yours, Theodor and Pellikan, to whom I would like you to say that he should respond about the false, whoever he may be, and the most deceitful informant of ours among you, as I have requested.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, September 9, 1544. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned Heinrich Bullinger, revered lord and brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
