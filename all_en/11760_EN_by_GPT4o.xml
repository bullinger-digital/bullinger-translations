    <p xml:id="regest1">Supported Erasmus Ritter during his visit to Memmingen; he received a certificate of his complete integrity from the council. Schuler has been suffering from an eye disease for three weeks. Praises Bullinger's commentary on Matthew and encourages him to continue his work; the day is near when God will reward such faithful service. He himself is now writing German homilies on the Epistle to the Romans, after a Latin commentary, on which he preached two years ago; some German sermons on the Eucharist are with Paul Fagius for printing; now he is preaching on the First Epistle to the Corinthians and later wants to write German homilies on it as well. Schwenckfeld is once again attacking Martin Bucer and all preachers; may his hypocrisy be exposed! Nothing further is known about the Nuremberg Diet, where [King] Ferdinand and [Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle have appeared; the rest can be reported orally by Erasmus [Ritter]. Includes a report by [Kaspar] Hedio on Bucer's activities in Bonn. Wife and children are well; greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dearest brother, I have supported the cause of Erasmus Ritter to the best of my ability, who appeared before our council and received the most celebrated testimony of his integrity and honesty, and this was not done with difficulty, since his name has never been tarnished by any unjust rumor among us; thus innocence finally reveals its true colors, etc.</p>
      <p>I have been suffering from a severe eye disease for three weeks and am not yet fully recovered; may the Lord grant that I be restored, if it is His will.</p>
      <p>I have read and am reading again your annotations on Matthew, or rather your commentaries, with great diligence, as they are most pleasing to me because they are supported by simple truth, clear and solid. May the Lord grant us more writings of this kind through you. Continue, my Bullinger, as you have begun, so that the kingdom of Christ may be increasingly illuminated.</p>
      <p>The day is near when the hidden things of the heart will be revealed. Let us be faithful in such a holy ministry, for we shall receive a worthy crown (because the Lord has promised it), which is hidden with Christ in God.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, I finished a public sermon on the Epistle to the Romans, and now I am writing homilies on the same, into which I am putting much labor. Pray, my brother, to the Lord that I may happily finish what I have begun. I previously wrote Latin commentaries on this epistle; I am now discussing them in German homilies. O the deep sea of divine wisdom! I have written several German sermons on the matter of the Eucharist, which Paul Fagius has for printing. I am now explaining the First Epistle to the Corinthians for a public sermon; when it is finished, if the Lord grants it, I will similarly attempt to arrange it into German homilies.</p>
      <p>About Schwenckfeld, good God, how he is perpetually the same chrestologus (proclaimer of Christ); he continually sings the old song, burdens the ministers of the word with hatred, again fiercely lashes our good Bucer, spares none of us, marks all preachers with the note of sycophancy and levity, because today they say and write one thing, tomorrow another. He is full of calumnies, wonderfully covered with hypocrisy. May the Lord remove the veil, so that with an uncovered face he may be visible to the whole world.</p>
      <p>We have nothing yet about the Nuremberg Diet. Ferdinand and the Lord of Granvelle are present; the princes of the empire are gathering from all sides, hopefully in the Lord. You will hear the rest from our brother Erasmus, who will be your letter in his stead.</p>
      <p>I send what I have from Hedio, the preacher of the church in Strasbourg, about Bucer now laboring in Bonn.</p>
      <p>My wife and children are well, with three sons and two daughters. My wife sends her best wishes to you and your family in the Lord. All the brothers and fellow ministers greet you through me, as well as Funckius, our consul. May the Lord be with your spirit. Do not cease to love Gervasius, your old friend.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, in the year 1543, January 26. Yours, Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church in Zurich, lord, teacher, and dearest brother in Christ.</p>
