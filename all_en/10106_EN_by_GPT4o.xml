      <p>Honorable, pious, prudent, wise, gracious, dear lords, my willing service, obedience, and whatever I know to be for your honorable wisdom's good and pleasure, is prepared for you beforehand.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask that your wisdom kindly accept my simple writing to you. For I trust you, especially as a Christian pious authority, to take this matter to heart, as befits Christian hearts. It concerns your loyal people in Bremgarten, who have shown you great loyalty in the past and have suffered great harm to their property and freedoms for your sake, my gracious lords of Bern and Zurich, and above all for God's sake, and now must suffer even greater harm to their souls if what has been initiated continues. Namely, that all those who have adhered to the Gospel until now must confess, go to the sacrament, attend mass, and accept all other customs and ceremonies used in the papacy, or else leave the town of Bremgarten within a set time. This proposal has been sent by the Five Cantons and announced by the mayor Schodeler himself, with the aforementioned penalty at the behest of the cantons and the council there. Now, should the loyal people with their wives and so many small children leave house and home, livelihood and work, where should they go? If they stay and endure the oppression against their own conscience, against God and His holy word, it is much more lamentable. For Christ says: "Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, of him will I also be ashamed" [Mt 10:33 par.]. And Paul: "With the mouth one confesses, with the heart one believes" [Rom 10:10]. Now, the loyal people of Bremgarten are yours. So, the faith is freely reserved for everyone in common dominions, and your wisdom does not force those who are in the papacy to accept what you rightly and well believe from the Gospel in common dominions. Why then should the loyal people be forced away from what has its foundation in God's word, for which man has been directed by God's word? Therefore, as one born in Bremgarten and who for a time proclaimed the Gospel among them, I earnestly wish to ask your wisdom on their behalf, who otherwise do not dare to show themselves, that you now remember the promises you once made to them, and though it could not be fulfilled at that time, that your wisdom now helps the loyal out of distress and need, considering that if we abandon our own in need, God will also abandon us in our time of need. But may God give you wisdom, steadfastness, and strength, that you may keep your honor, praise brought upon you with God, and remain upright and unshaken.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, the 19th day of March in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your wisdom's humble and obedient</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the noble, steadfast, prudent, and wise lords, the mayor and council of the city of Bern, my gracious, dear lords.</p>
