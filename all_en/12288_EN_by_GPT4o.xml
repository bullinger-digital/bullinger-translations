      <p>Greetings. My son, who has spent a year in Zurich with honorable success, most esteemed sir, is eager to go to Basel, attracted by the commendation of the academic order. However, since I have no one there to whom I can recommend him, I thought it better to have him recommended through you than if I were to send a thousand letters there. I know indeed how highly you are regarded among all the learned; therefore, I did not hesitate to approach you with this request, that you might be willing to write something in recommendation of my son and his companions to some friend of yours, a candidate of good letters, so that he may obtain an honorable preceptor according to the statutes of that gymnasium, under whose guidance and rule he may fulfill and submit to what will be beneficial for his progress in letters. Certainly, nothing is more firmly rooted in my heart than to adorn my son's character with honorable and good letters. Your kindness has often reminded me and his preceptors as well, not to allow this son to be distracted from the arena of letters. Indeed, I would consider it a sin to oppose the persuasions of such great men and the desire of my son. Moreover, so that you may recognize the fruits of our countryside, dearest Bullinger, I am sending two cheeses made in the style of the people of Piacenza; use them with the love of your most devoted Travers. Even if the smallness of the gift does not correspond to your merits and dignity, I beg you to consider rather the spirit of the sender and to take it in good part. Farewell. From Zuoz, 4th day before the Ides of September 1545.</p>
      <p>How small it is, from the heel, your Johannes Travers.</p>
      <p>To the true mirror of sacred philosophy, Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastic of Zurich, his lord and friend to be especially honored.</p>
