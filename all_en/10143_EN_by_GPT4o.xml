      <p>Greetings. I would have discussed more matters with you, most honorable man, if I had not been constrained by the lack of time, as fortune unexpectedly overturned me at that moment, so that I neither had the time to lament my misfortune to you nor to express my grief. However, to avoid dwelling on this longer than necessary, I will briefly explain the state of my fortune: The Swiss in our Fischingen Monastery have restored the papal ceremonies and removed me from my position, which has caused me considerable loss both in terms of better fortune and good times.</p>
      <p>And now I must either endure hunger bravely or seek the help of friends to address the impending poverty. I truly believe that this cannot be more conveniently prevented than if you become my patron in my misery. You will undoubtedly have men of uncommon integrity who will diligently work with you to ensure that I am provided for as comfortably as possible, provided that a suitable time frame for completing the business is offered.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me, for I cannot hate you. You will learn the rest from the messenger.</p>
      <p>Given from the Fischingen Monastery. Hastily, as everything.</p>
      <p>Michael Schlatter, yours as his own.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most renowned city of Zurich, his incomparable lord.</p>
