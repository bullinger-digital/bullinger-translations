    <p xml:id="regest1">Praises Bullinger's advice in a matter likely concerning Luther and is pleased with their agreement; for he had shortly before, on Melanchthon's advice, written to Erasmus in this sense, so that not everyone would become entangled in the dispute with Luther. He, Gryn√§us, is curious about how Erasmus will behave towards Luther. Encouraged by Bullinger, he will now write to Melanchthon. Whoever advocates for peace in the homeland also ensures peace in the church. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I praise your advice. Indeed, I also congratulate myself, who so clearly agrees with you on this matter. For not many days ago, I wrote a letter to Erasmus in this sense. For Philipp had written to me and advised that he was unwilling to stir up Luther and urged me to convey this sentiment of his to Erasmus, with the same intention, I believe, that it might be understood that it is possible for all good people, who stand by the gospel, not to be entangled in the same cause with Luther. Erasmus has not yet responded. I eagerly await what the old man will decide and what he will do about Luther. I am preparing to write to Philipp, as you encourage, with this one and the same argument that has been for many years, that he might consider the common homeland and heal these disputes as much as he can, and ensure peace for the public church. He has always written very amicably and now most kindly. I have long been confident that it will come to pass that all the pious will agree among themselves.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell and diligently handle the business of our Lord Christ with the same zeal. Greet for me the dearest men Theodor, Leon, Pellicanus, Carolostadt, everyone.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, everyone.</p>
      <p>Basel, 19th of April.</p>
      <p>Your Simon Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother and patron.</p>
