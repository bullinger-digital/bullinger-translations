      <p>I received the letter from Vadianus; I will ensure that it is returned to you in good faith and that it reaches certain people not without benefit to the church.</p>
      <p>I commend this Michael to you. Farewell in the Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>I have not yet read your booklet; the Lord knows that until now there has been no convenient time for that task, as business, although trivial and childish, distracts me.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell and love me in the Lord. May the Lord Christ keep us. Amen. Your Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger, esteemed brother.</p>
