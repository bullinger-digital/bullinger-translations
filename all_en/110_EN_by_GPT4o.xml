      <p>S. Buttler, our friend, greatly praises your courteous humanity towards him and has been burning with love and zeal for you for many years now, a man, if anyone else, a lover of the divine word and most observant of piety. You are not wrong to fear so much for Württemberg from those Austrians; for there are not a few of the more prudent of this age who are more than convinced of this very thing. I am led by some conjectures to believe what I wrote to you, especially since I have received nothing else from anyone these days. I greatly congratulate our Wolphius on acquiring a larger house; for it is better for young men to be together and that permanently than to stay in different houses, some by night, others by day.</p>
      <p>We give you the greatest thanks, greater than the greatest, for watching over us here with as much diligence as you are accustomed to in all other matters. If only we could do the same for you on some occasion!</p>
      <p>You speak humorously about the game of the princes; indeed, it is easy to wash the feet of thirteen old men; but the blood of many thousands is not washed away so copiously. Oh, preposterous religion! May the Lord graciously grant them minds more worthy of Him!</p>
      <p>I assure you to be at ease about Bucer; for I know he seeks the glory of Christ alone. I am sending a letter that our Gervasius gave after Buttler's departure, although I do not have much faith in what is read there; however, whether true or fictitious, they are not unpleasant to read; if it was not true, it still sounds good.</p>
      <p>The consul of Memmingen was amazed at your and Simpert's sermons, which so strongly dissuade from the French alliance. But I earnestly pray to the Lord that He may bind you to Himself with the most intimate bond of faith and protect and preserve you from all bonds of impiety! But farewell now, my venerable and excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>My cousin urges me to stop writing, who sends you his most courteous greetings. May your household and all yours be well. Pray for us most earnestly. May 4, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>The book that our Buttler presented pleases me beyond belief, because it was written in time and it greatly pains me that our printer has been inactive for more than a full two years; however, I will ensure, if it can be done in any way, that it is printed here or elsewhere with the utmost diligence, as it certainly deserves.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable servant of Jesus Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother to be observed above all others and by far the dearest. In Zürich.</p>
