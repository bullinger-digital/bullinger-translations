    <p xml:id="regest1">Received the Bible shipment and Bullinger's letter from December 2 [1543] yesterday and was shocked that the letter was on the way for so long, which pains him all the more, as Bullinger has been without news from him for so long and will remain so until he holds the present letter in his hands; furthermore, Bullinger writes that he has not heard from Curione for a whole year, which shows that he did not receive Curione's letter from [November 30] [1543] [No. 1821]; after this time, Curione wrote no more letters, as God tested him with a cold for almost the entire year; he asks that Bullinger not feel neglected, rather Curione always remembers all the kindnesses shown. He exchanged greetings and notification about the book shipment with Béat Comte; he writes only briefly, as Comte currently has a messenger available; soon he will write more extensively again. Greetings. Bullinger has had a daughter [Veritas], Curione as well [Angela]; may the Lord assist these two paternally.</p>

      <p>Greetings through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, my ever-honored patron, I received that remarkable work of the Bible and read your letters, which, upon reading, affected me in various ways. First with joy, because I saw that a most eminent man, not only in learning but also in holiness, wrote to me with such humanity and ease that nothing more humane or easier could be imagined. Then I was vexed with no small amount of sorrow when I learned the date of the letters; for your letters, which you wrote on December 2nd, were finally delivered to us on May 5th. What do you think I thought then? Everything that people usually do. Five months ago, Mr. Bullinger was in doubt whether you were alive or not; what will he do now with the letters and gifts sent to you? If he understands that you are alive and have not responded to such humanity and generosity, what will he think but that you are rude, forgetful, and ungrateful? These thoughts have tormented and will torment me until I know that you have received my letters. Therefore, first of all, since you wrote that I have been silent for a whole year, it shows that my letters were not delivered to you; for in November, if I am not mistaken, I wrote to you diligently. After that time, I wrote to no one else, because almost the whole year I was unwell due to a harmful humor flowing from my head, from which I am not yet free. Thus, it seems to the Lord that just as in Italy through the Antichrist, so now through bodily ailments, our faith is tested, so that we may seriously think about that future and blessed life. Therefore, you should not think that you have even slightly receded from my memory; for the greatness of your merits towards me is such that, unless I wish to be and be considered the most ungrateful of all who live, I cannot forget you. Even now, what thanks can I give or return to you for the most excellent and holy gift, to omit countless other things? You will therefore forgive my infancy and rusticity; your exceptional charity will pardon these things.</p>
      <p>Béat Comte greeted me in your name - yesterday I informed him, as you had written, and about the book you sent to him - and he added that he has someone who can carry letters if I wish to give them. Therefore, I immediately wrote these few things, which you will consider kindly. More at another time; now I did not want to miss this brief opportunity.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my patron, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, and pray to the Father for me. Greet your entire family and those excellent brothers. A daughter has been born to you and another to me; may the Lord be a father to both.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, May 6, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Coelius Secundus Curio.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a foremost man in Christian theology, the most holy and vigilant Antistes of Zurich, ever most respected by me. In Zurich.</p>
