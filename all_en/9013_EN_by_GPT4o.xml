      <p>S. D. I give you my greatest thanks for the mountain or wild hens. The man you wrote about, the pharmacist, never appeared, but sent home through the innkeeper's servant to the Stork. After two days, the maid informed me that the servant of the Stork was present and was asking for letters to you for the one who had brought the hens from Chur. Since at the same time I was at dinner and was compelled to write some things to be presented to the most honorable senate the next day, and also to prepare myself for the morning sermon, I replied that I had nothing to give in writing at the moment, but would write at another more convenient time, which I am doing now.</p>
      <p>However, I inform you of a truly mournful and unfortunate matter: The Admiral, along with several other most distinguished men and heroes, was killed in Paris on August 24th in a fortress by robbery. This is the faith, this is the old art of Satan, who was a liar and a thief from the beginning. But He lives, who conquered; He lives, who said: 'Vengeance is mine; I will repay.' The adversaries will think they have already won; but they are mistaken. For He lives, who conquered. From Belgium, we have heard nothing but good news so far.</p>
      <p>May the Lord avert all evil. Our Josias is still bedridden with gout.</p>
      <p>We had expected your arrival; but now we have despaired; for so many times this whole year you have not come. May the Lord bless you and keep you and your family from all evil!</p>
      <p>What news do you have about the Venetian and Turkish war? Zurich, September 5, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Josias and all of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, his honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, preacher in Chur.</p>
