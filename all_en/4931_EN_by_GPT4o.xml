      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ, along with the expression of my willing service beforehand. Reverend, kind, dear Mr. Bullinger, since I now have a certain messenger to you for my dear lord and friend Magister Engelbert Milander, I could not refrain from writing to you once. For recently my dear lord Joerg von Stetten has conveyed many greetings and good things from you, and also honored me on your behalf with your German booklet against ubiquity, for which I am most grateful.</p>
      <p>It pleases me not a little that you remember me so well. Your booklet has been translated into German and has truly accomplished much good among the common people, who have been greatly confused by ubiquity from our preachers. May the Lord God in heaven be your eternal reward, amen, etc.</p>
      <p>I understand that Doctor Peter Martyr also writes powerfully and thoroughly against ubiquity. I would like to know if it has come to the Frankfurt fair.</p>
      <p>Magister Johannes Parsimonius in Stuttgart has published a booklet, truly mocking things, to confirm ubiquity. They make themselves and others completely restless in the matter.</p>
      <p>I would now like to see when this quarrel will come to an end. The preachers in Strasbourg have published their confession about the Lord's Supper, thoroughly good things; but the contentious church servants say it is a cothurnus (a high boot, implying something elevated or pretentious), and no one can do enough with it. Dear sir, I have recently heard that Mr. Bernardino Ochino is staying with you in Zurich; I ask you to greet him kindly for me. I have heard many beautiful sermons from him, and if he has forgotten me, tell him I am the one who arranged the horse for him at Alexander Krafter's house, where my lords sent him before the emperor; for my father was mayor at that time, etc. Kind, dear sir, there is talk among us that on Bartholomew's Day there will be a wedding in Leipzig, Duke Moritz's daughter with one of Nassau. It is believed that over 5000 horses will come together: now people are considering that something else might follow from it, as recently the princes have sent to several cities to see if they want to remain with the Augsburg Confession or not; they are to declare themselves. It is said that Strasbourg, Nuremberg, Ulm, and several other cities have signed to remain with it.</p>
      <p>But with Augsburg, it is still doubtful; for the most prominent in our upper region are of the Roman religion, especially the privy council, which consists of 7 lords; they hold most of the administration of our city. May Christ Jesus protect and shield our city and churches.</p>
      <p>If it should come to war, it would be dangerous for us four other cities. May our church be faithfully entrusted to your Christian intercession.</p>
      <p>We have had learned, understanding men in the past who have faithfully built up our church; but the ubiquists have caused much discord and disruption in our church this year. May the Lord God avert and prevent all mischief and false teaching, amen, etc.</p>
      <p>The Elector in Heidelberg is almost dismissing the contentious church servants in the land, allowing the gospel of Christ to be preached purely and clearly, and is almost seeking learned, peaceful men. It is said that he has become Calvinist; with this, they mean that they have greatly flattered him.</p>
      <p>The Landgrave also has brave, learned men, as does the city of Strasbourg and others, so I hope the truth will come to light more and more, etc. It happened with us on June 7th that a prominent lord from the privy council, Mr. Marx Pfister, was struck by our lord's power in the open market, so that he was only brought into a nearby house; there he died, having spoken no word; quantum ad religionem (as for religion) he was neutral. Then on July 24th, the lord mayor Schollenberger was struck by our lord's power in the open council, so that he spoke no more word; thus he died in the town hall; quantum ad religionem he was entirely of the papistic religion.</p>
      <p>The case of these two prominent rulers is believed by some to signify a great change in our city. May our dear Lord keep us in the right faith (which works through love) until the end. Amen, amen, etc. On July 29th, Duke Albrecht of Bavaria came to Augsburg with the emperor's 5 daughters; they were all joyfully received here with dancing, fireworks, and all sorts of entertainment, as is the custom of the world. They stayed here for 8 days, visiting the city; for they had never been here before, etc. With that, may God the Lord be entrusted.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg on the 29th of August.</p>
      <p>Since I am writing today to my dear lord and brother Ambrosio Blaurer, I wanted to send this letter along; for I do not know how long Magister Engelbertus will remain here, etc. It is said that the contentious church servants have been together in LÃ¼neburg, where they held a special synod to arrange something special. May God prevent all evil counsel, etc.</p>
      <p>Your reverent, willing servant Simprecht Hoser. To the reverend and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my kind, dear lord, in Zurich, etc. Zurich.</p>
