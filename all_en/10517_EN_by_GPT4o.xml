      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Friendly, dear sir and brother. Regarding the young Lombart, I have sent him to Strasbourg with another boy, my daughter's son.</p>
      <p>I ask you, you and Master Leo, not to hold it against me. The boys wanted to be together.</p>
      <p>I have no news to write to you at this time, except that there is talk that the Emperor and France want to unite their children. Otherwise, there are many dealings to the detriment of the gospel.</p>
      <p>I am pleased to hear about your lords' newly issued mandate. May God grant that it bears fruit. I would like people not to trust the godless too much for their good words. You understand me well. May the Lord let everything work for the sanctification of His name.</p>
      <p>Greet the bailiff of Kyburg, Master Leo, the Pellican, and all the brothers for me. I wish you an increase in faith and divine grace. May He keep you long as His faithful instrument for the benefit and welfare of His church. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, the 28th of November, in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Jacob Meyer.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, shepherd in Zurich, my gracious, dear lord and brotherly friend.</p>
