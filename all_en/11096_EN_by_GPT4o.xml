    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejects his criticism of Benedikt Euander, as he did not maliciously make Bucer's letter to Luther public, but only dutifully communicated it to the people of Zurich, after which Bullinger forwarded it with a critical commentary to Megander, Myconius, Grynaeus, and Vadian; no unrest resulted from this. In the letter itself, on which he did not actually want to comment before Luther's promised response to the Swiss, he is disturbed that Bucer characterizes the Swiss as stubborn worshippers of Zwingli and Oecolampadius, instead of recommending them as favorably as possible. The letter contradicts several of Bucer's earlier statements: What he presented at the Basel meeting as Luther's opinion, he now excuses to Luther as a mitigation desired by the Swiss; his previous assurance that the Wittenberg Concord agreed with the teachings of Zwingli and Oecolampadius, he portrays as propaganda instigated by the opposing side; he no longer wants to acknowledge that he initially declared mutual toleration to be sufficient, and falsely claims that the Swiss would admit to not always having taught correctly; finally, he fails to recognize that certain formulas remain open to interpretation, while Zwingli's simple doctrine completely aligns with that of Augustine. Nevertheless, Bullinger does not question the planned Concord; however, Melanchthon's "Loci" seem to him to be a better foundation for it than Bucer's declarations. He does not commit to Bucer's ["Report from the Holy Scripture"] despite privately expressed agreement, but wants to be judged based on his own public statements; he recalls his explicit approval of a passage from Luther's [or Melanchthon's] "Instruction of the Visitors" and refers again to his own works and to the [First Helvetic] Confession. He vigorously denies having criticized the publication of Zwingli's and Oecolampadius's letters due to alleged endangerment of the Concord, but mentions some letters whose publication would have been better avoided for other reasons. The Zurich communion rite, reported by Bibliander in the preface to the letter collection, can cause no offense to anyone. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I hear, Bucer, dear brother in the Lord, that you have severely accused Benedict Euander when you were recently in Bern, for having transmitted your letters written to Doctor Luther in January to the ministers of the Swiss churches. You thought it was unworthy for someone to make public private letters written to a private individual, and even sealed, and to make them public to those to whom they were not addressed. You believed that because of this author and informant, great disturbances were stirred up in our churches. I was indeed not lightly disturbed by this rumor, seeing a good man and friend endangered in our name. Therefore, I decided to say these few things to a friend on behalf of a friend, who seems to have committed nothing unworthy by performing his duty to us, has not sinned against you, and has not stirred up any tragedy among us. First of all, if you have conducted the matter candidly, as you handle it in that letter, there is certainly no reason to accuse Euander, unless he is to be accused who also approves a right action to others. But if you have conducted that matter either negligently or imprudently, you have someone to accuse, not Euander, but Bucer. Furthermore, if you do not know, Euander owes us much, so much so that he would not have fulfilled the duty of a good man if he had not done what he did. For, aided by the stipend of the Zurich college and the beneficence of our church, he indicates what would harm us and what would benefit us from his duty. Therefore, he either believed that your letter would benefit us or harm us. If he had not indicated what he believed would benefit us, he would have defrauded those who deserved well; but if he thought it would harm us and had concealed it, he would undoubtedly have violated faith. Therefore, what he did, he did from duty, not from malice or error. Moreover, he was neither the first to take it from you here nor the first to communicate it to others. Whoever first took it from you and published it perhaps has his reasons. But if he has none, the blame for the published letters cannot be imputed to Euander, who, as I hear, only replied to them when he received them from others and sent them to friends, not enemies, when they had already been tossed back and forth and read by many. Now, what disturbances they have stirred up among others, I can neither say nor should I, as I do not know. But I know this, that among us it was ensured with the utmost faith and diligence that your letters were not communicated to everyone indiscriminately, because they seemed to conflict with those reports and writings which others had brought to us and we ourselves had brought from Basel once and again, and therefore they would have aroused much hatred against your name among all (which that good Euander could by no means have known, undoubtedly, as he was entirely ignorant of the events). Indeed, even today they have not become known to many among us. And to conceal nothing at all, as soon as I saw your letter, I had copies made and sent them to Megander, Myconius, Grynaeus, and Vadian, adding my own letters in which I testified that your method of composing, which you followed in those letters, seemed to me quite unsatisfactory; meanwhile, it seemed best that the letter not be spread, which, although it might not stir up any disturbances among them, seemed to be of little use for the peace of the churches among others, as others might be differently affected by the same matter. Nor did I think it necessary to argue or expostulate with you about this matter, as both the time and the matter itself seemed so ulcerated that it would have been much better to bear such things patiently and avoid every occasion for quarrelling. Especially since with a new argument or expostulation we would have given both the weak and all good men a reason to suspect the ministers and the whole matter of religion, not to mention the offenses, if our argument had become known to the opposing party. Thus indeed, from your letters, no disturbances have arisen among us, so that Euander is now free from all blame and accusation from you. I have done this for duty's sake with a friend for a friend, Euander, whom we cannot abandon in this cause unless we wish to repay him with ill will, who has conferred the greatest benefit upon us. Therefore, it will be your part, dear Bucer, to remit your accusation and anger and to embrace Euander, who has done nothing wrong, as a friend and brother with us in full charity.</p>
      <p>I now come to the letter itself, which you wrote to Doctor Luther, to which I was otherwise not going to respond before Doctor Luther responded to ours, as Philipp promised, unless I had already heard the matter of that letter discussed back and forth so many times and recently in Bern. I will touch on some things, as it seems almost an infinite task to pursue each one. And indeed, those who strive to mend the broken concord among brothers cannot be displeasing. For the Savior has deemed them worthy to be called sons of God. However, that method of composing which you seem to have followed in those letters of yours could by no means be pleasing. First, because you handled the greatest cause and the well-deserving brothers so contemptuously and coldly before him with whom you believed you had had the gravest enmities and to whom you ought to have commended us beyond measure and insinuated us above measure. Now indeed, you must remove the obstacles to the reception of truth from the Swiss people. As if our famous churches, planted and confirmed even by the blood of saints, had hitherto been involved in the darkness of lies and those who have hitherto slumbered in the doctrine received among us had migrated into the mists of errors. Soon you call us excessive admirers of Zwingli and Oecolampadius, when indeed these men were admirable and more than admirable, whom unless we honored as we do, we could by no means be freed from the charge of impiety and ingratitude. This seems to pertain to the fact that you take away judgment from our people, but attribute obstinacy and a stubborn judgment and a preposterous affectation of constancy, likewise that with a remarkable diminution of the estimation of our name you call us imprudent, who often seek a knot in a bulrush and who compose long speeches. Is it so, Bucer, that you wanted to approve and commend us and ours to a man otherwise irritable? Were these the appropriate formulas of commendation that seemed to you? Would that many of us did not trust too much in our subtle judgment and thus, deficient in just simplicity and constancy, be gradually carried away into inextricable perplexities of things and words! For when we expressed in more copious words what we feel in that rather long exposition of ours and excluded those things which seemed to provide either an opportunity for error or a new argument to posterity, we certainly did not seek a knot in a bulrush, but the salvation of the churches in a plain and clear testimony of truth. But they seek a knot in a bulrush who weave subtleties in a plain matter. We would rather err on that side, if indeed it is an error, than weave riddles to the offense of the simple. We will not now speak of long speeches and who indeed are said to weave long speeches, lest we seem to indulge in emotion. But I think I have sufficiently shown with these things why I think you have commended both us and our cause to Luther more coldly. I would have written other letters to that man, in which I would have depicted the whole nature of the matter to the man so clearly that I could not have done it more clearly, with the highest commendation of the ministers and churches of the Swiss, and finally of the most sincere faith of all; I would have added some things about the great accession and zeal for the gospel among us, and that the ministers truly favor Doctor Luther both for the various gifts poured out by the Lord upon him and for the benefits conferred upon the church through him. But the slanderers and disturbers of peace, who continually report to Luther that both he and his doctrines are never not most indignantly reviled by the Swiss in public sermons, are indeed trifling, and many other things of this kind which I could truly have written.</p>
      <p>I now descend to other of your counsels that displeased me. But you seem to contradict yourself in some things, and to narrate some things less accurately than they were done. For what need was there to excuse to Doctor Luther what you conducted in the public assembly of all the orders in Basel in the praetorium with such faith, as you said? - even adding a protestation that Luther felt no differently about the Eucharist than what you had brought forward in the declared articles. And indeed I was giving thanks to the Lord in the name of the ministers that it was finally clear that we did not disagree. However, I had previously warned you not to expound your opinion to us, how you understand Luther's words, but what is Luther's very opinion and how he wants to be understood. For there are those who believe that you add much of your own to Luther, so that you may gain more favor for him among us, but that Luther himself will never acknowledge that exposition of yours. Where you again interposed your faith not without protestation, but now in the letters sent to Luther you excuse what you were ordered to do, and you excuse it in such a way that you accuse yourself of a certain simulation, when you testify that you have given us some things that might perhaps displease Luther. "For your paternity will see," you say, "that in explaining to them what was done between us at Wittenberg, and accommodating the articles to their weakness; we pray that you take it in the best part." But none of us had asked you to accommodate anything to our weakness, but to expound the very sense of Luther. You testified most sacredly that you had done this with that exposition of yours among us, but you excuse it to him. Again, to what purpose was it to write in explicit words that the ministers of the Swiss churches, who were in the former Basel assembly, had asked you to temper the exposition to the capacity of the Swiss churches, so that they might hear some kind of agreement of Zwingli and Oecolampadius? For of your own accord, before we were called to Basel, you promised not some kind of agreement, but that you could prove a solid agreement of Zwingli and Oecolampadius, and that from their own writings. The title you prefixed to the Wittenberg articles and sent to the Basel senate will testify to this, namely that these articles contain nothing other than what is handed down in the books of those excellent men. The acts that Grynaeus and Carolstadt brought to us from Strasbourg will also testify to this. But now we are accused before Luther and all who see that letter, as if we had extorted this testimony of yours not of full, but of some kind of agreement by prayers, as if we were well aware that there was no agreement here, which nevertheless we wanted to appear. To what end, I ask, unless to mock our churches? What, I pray, could be thought more unworthy and disgraceful about us? Of this kind is what you write that we wanted to soothe the souls of some of our people with our verbose exposition. Consider here, my Bucer, into what dangers of life you would have cast the undeserving and those thinking nothing of the sort with your certainly bold words, unless our faith and integrity, by the grace of God, were somewhat better known to our people than to those who would believe such things about Leo and me, that we are leading them astray and involving them in clouds of words. You also say: "We have always clearly testified to them about the main point, that there will be concord if they solidly believe and openly teach that in the Eucharist the very body and blood of the Lord are truly and substantially distributed and received" etc. We do not deny that you have finally said this, but we deny that you have always and from the beginning said it. For what you first proposed was that both sides were erring in ignorance of the elenchus. For we do not understand that Luther does not attack ours, and again he does not understand what we attack, but you could easily show that Luther asserts nothing different from our opinion. For although he speaks coarsely about the mysteries, he does not understand them so coarsely. But it would be enough to establish concord if we bear his forms of speaking, nevertheless with our opinion safe and unharmed, and also with our forms of speaking safe and unharmed. Hence it happened that whenever you came to us and dealt with us, you never (as you truly say) left us without a fine agreement. But after the articles were brought to us from Wittenberg, in letters dated August 8 of the previous year you wrote to me in these words: "There is perfect concord if you accommodate yourselves to your own confession in all things and do not reject those things that have the same power with it." Here you made no mention of subscription. But when we met in Basel on September 24, as if forgetting the previous things, you asked us for subscription. When we refused, you finally burst out and clearly pronounced (which we frankly admit) that there would be concord if we confessed that with the bread and wine the true body and blood of Christ are substantially distributed and eaten, and if we subscribed to the articles to which almost all the churches of Germany have subscribed. But here, if you also want to confess the truth, we denied both the subscription and the dangerous word "substantially". This will be testified by the very exposition sent to Luther. But it seems unworthy that among other things you write: "We know that your paternity is rightly offended that they want to seem to have taught so before as well. But they do not understand 'before' of all the time during which there was dissent, but of the time in which they began to teach that exhibition of the gifts of Christ in the sacraments more fully, and they especially refer to the Basel confession." You are indeed a remarkable interpreter. You see what you have written to Luther. For we are so far from acknowledging what you have said that we have professed in explicit words in the very exposition to Luther: "But we have denied this with all our predecessors in the teaching of Christ, and we still deny it to this day, that the body of Christ is bodily or fleshly" etc. You hear that neither those who taught before us have been neglected by us, nor has their teaching been denied and neglected. Certainly, if we were to accept that exposition of yours of the word "before", we would condemn the writings and sayings of the holy men of God, Zwingli and Oecolampadius. We have the testimony of our church against your exposition. For if you remember correctly, you know that the scribe of our city, and finally all the delegates of all the orders and cities, having heard our confession, openly and of their own accord testified that it has been taught and preached in the same manner in our churches until now. Therefore, your commentitious exposition would not have been necessary. It also seems incongruous that you write: "They simply hesitate to admit in every way sound formulas." For we openly testified that we do not abhor expressions. But what you add "simply", I do not understand what you mean. For if you do not explain the expressions, you provide an opportunity for error to the simpler ones. But if you explain them and believe they should be explained, I do not understand what it is to "simply admit expressions". In the same way, I do not see how Zwingli has not yet satisfied you in the explanation of the Eucharist, whom it is known has subscribed to Saint Aurelius Augustine in all things, unless perhaps Augustine has not yet satisfied you, which I by no means think. For I would rather be considered somewhat unpolished with Augustine than subtle and illustrious with some.</p>
      <p>These are indeed, Bucer, dear brother in the Lord, the things that displeased me among others in that letter of yours written to Doctor Luther and which I wanted to lay out to you with a simple mind. For it is the part of friends and brothers to conceal nothing and to indicate freely and without pretense what you desire in a brother and would like to see changed. Nor is there any reason for you to think that it is now over with just concord or to think that it is necessary to meet again, to purge, to expostulate, and to argue. For I will persevere in those things that are of confessed truth. There are those things that were written in Basel with the common suffrages of all the churches. In these I will always be. And the cause we are dealing with is public, not private; therefore, account must be taken of the churches, of which we are ministers, and of posterity. But if in the meantime private injuries, insults, and provocations are made by private individuals, nothing will be derogated from the public cause with me for that reason. And those things that do not conflict with these of ours and those who bear us thus thinking and receive us with sincere charity, I will cultivate with a religious mind as brothers in the Lord most faithfully. I recently read what Doctor Philipp Melanchthon wrote about the sacraments in general and specifically about baptism and the Lord's Supper in the "Loci Communes" recently published, and unless someone perverts and distorts them with a malicious interpretation, they are very pleasing. I showed the same to Leo, Pellican, and Bibliander, the revered teachers, colleagues, and brothers, and they did not displease them either. Here I thought we were very unfortunate, who are condemned for the profanation of the sacraments, who nevertheless teach and believe nothing different from them in our churches. Luther will desire nothing more in us, who rightly esteems Philipp highly. Indeed, to speak frankly what I feel, and what may perhaps seem new to you: Melanchthon's things please me more in this cause than yours. For all of Melanchthon's things are simple and plain, but yours are intricate and obscure. Therefore, unless you hinder it with your excessive diligence, I trust that we will soon be beautifully united in the Lord. You will consider this said for our tranquility, not as an insult to you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, as for your book once written to the Monasterians, I do not want you to propose my opinion on the Supper from yours, neglecting all my other writings that I have written and published. For I have abundantly testified in published books and the subscribed Basel confession what I think about the Supper. Finally, what I once approved in a private letter written to you or what we understood by the spirit to which I wrote that you had given testimony in your book, I explained in person when we first met in Basel, and even before that and in letters written to Myconius. Indeed, those things that you have published since that time in this cause seem to me to be more involved than those. But you allow yourself to explain and retract even your published things; would you not allow me to explain more briefly spoken and privately written examples, but written ex tempore? In the visitation of Doctor Luther, if you have forgotten, I will repeat what I approved. When we last met in Basel, I produced a booklet in which I had written down Doctor Luther's passage on the eating and use of the sacrament. But having produced this, I said: "Would that Luther had written so clearly about the sacrament everywhere!" At the same time, I read the man's words, of which this is the sum: "The external eating of the sacrament neither confirms nor consoles the heart, but is a sign of consolation and remission of sins." Likewise: "The external eating of the sacrament does not confer the remission of sins, but by faith, which is admonished and excited by the external signs." These, I say, I approved and still approve. Therefore, I do not want you to argue from the species to the genus and conclude that Bullinger thinks exactly the same about the Supper as it is known that Luther has testified in his writings. But I want to be judged from my published writings, especially from the Basel confession.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, about the published collection of letters, you say that I am very grieved. I wonder if those who reported this have told the truth, namely that Bucer constantly affirms that Bullinger is grieved over the published collection because the matter of the Eucharist is treated more coldly in it and because it uniquely hinders concord. But I am truly grieved that such things are spread about me. For who would believe that man to be a good man who thinks so unjustly about his teachers and a good and useful book? I would indeed not want the best book to be suppressed, nor would I want this mark to be branded on well-deserving men. Nor do I desire anything of truth in the doctrine of the Eucharist in that book, nor does anyone live who has heard me complaining that this cause is treated more negligently in this book. And indeed, in the presence of Doctor Vadian, you were asked by me in Basel what you desired in the very work of letters or the preface of the work. You replied that as far as the orthodox truth and Christian doctrines are concerned, and therefore the very sum of the Eucharist, you desired nothing in the preface of Doctor Bibliander, only that you wished some words to be either changed or omitted, of which kind you said were: "Hence they will return to us of their own accord or rather return to us in grace" etc. and some other things not dissimilar to this. You added that otherwise the writings of Zwingli and Oecolampadius did not displease you, but they seemed to have been published at a less opportune time, especially those that were poured out in the first heat of the sacramentarian controversy, because the wounds inflicted long ago seem to be reopened by these. But I thought that those things that were done with a mind not at all evil and hostile should be taken in good part. And there is an elegant dialogue of Oecolampadius in the collection, which you yourself have always thought to be a singular instrument for mending concord. Therefore, I do not see how the collection of letters hinders concord, or how it proceeds less, unless the opposing party is pleased to interpret everything in the worst part and to expect a different concord than we have understood so far. You are not unaware that these things have been transacted between us. Therefore, it is false that I ever grieved over the published collection, and especially for this reason, that I think the cause of the Eucharist is treated more coldly in it. But it is true that to the most excellent man Conrad Zviccius, who was inquiring not about the published collection, but about a certain letter of Zwingli published, by which he feared a certain excellent man would be gravely offended, I said that there is indeed in that work one or two letters that I would wish had not been printed. Especially that one in which Zwingli attributes sudden consternation to the Swabians in sudden dangers, and that one of Oecolampadius, in which the fable about the abbot of Capell being most indignantly treated after death is woven. For as this is manifestly false and could have put the excellent man Thomas Blatter in great danger if the Five Cantons understood such things to be written about themselves and published by him, so that about the Swabians would certainly not have been published, and that because of the old enmity, which otherwise flourishes in some more than is beneficial. There is also another letter of Zwingli to Somius, which seems to have been imprudently published about private counsels, because it is said to have sown some suspicion among some free and imperial cities. But what do these things have to do with the cause of the Eucharist? Or how do they hinder concord? Did I therefore grieve over the whole book being published because I would not want one or two letters to be printed for certain reasons? But perhaps these things do not concern you at all, as you have said nothing of the sort about me.</p>
      <p>As for the rite of the Zurich church, by which it celebrates the Lord's Supper, I do not think it is disapproved by you nor is it an offense to anyone, unless someone wishes to be offended even by a good thing. For it accords with the Lord's institution and the apostolic rite and has much of antiquity. This cannot be unknown to you, since even Theodor, the ornament of our church, has written piously and learnedly about this in his preface to the collection of letters.</p>
      <p>These are the things I wanted to discuss with you, dearest Bucer, as with a friend, whom I greatly wish to be well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Greet Capito and the other colleagues for me.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 6, 1537.</p>
