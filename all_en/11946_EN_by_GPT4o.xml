    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] At the beginning, Bullinger wishes to express his goodwill and willingness to help to the Aarau council. He has received their letter [HBBW XIV, No. 1898, dated April 23, 1544] with questions regarding Johannes Haller. Since he is keen to be of service to the people of Aarau and, in general, to God's church and to provide good advice, the following is to be said:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Even though Haller is still young, he is a well-read, eloquent person knowledgeable in the Holy Scriptures and gifted in teaching. He is decent and modest. He lives with a discreet and honorable woman, [Elsbeth], daughter of [Zürich] guild master Ulrich Kambli. He preached for some time at the Grossmünster in Zürich before being appointed by the Zürich council as a preacher in Illnau (in the County of Kyburg) a year ago. Since the Zürich council has taken care of Haller since his childhood and ensured his education, he is obliged to them and may not simply move elsewhere without permission. However, Bullinger does not know if the council would allow Haller to leave Illnau (where the congregation is very satisfied with him).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] When Bullinger called Haller to him and asked if he would be willing to serve the church in the Bernese area, he replied that he was ready to do anything that would promote God's honor and would be ordained by the Zürich council. However, he is quite happy in Illnau.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] This is the response to the questions posed by the Aarau council, so that they can now deliberate on whether such a calling would be beneficial to them and whether they wish to write to the Zürich council about it, or if they would prefer someone else.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger is also always ready in the future to be of assistance to the people of Aarau. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, and wise, gracious, dear gentlemen, my willing service, friendly greetings, and whatever I can do for your honor, love, and good, is prepared for your love beforehand. I have received and understood your friendly letter to me concerning Mr. Johannes Haller. And since I am very willing and inclined to serve and advise the church of God and you to the best of my ability, I say in response to your question: Mr. Hans Haller is still a young man, but well-educated, also eloquent, well-versed in the Holy Scriptures and the evangelical matters, and has the grace to teach. In terms of his conduct and nature, he is entirely decent and modest. He also has a quiet, decent, honorable wife, the daughter of Mr. Kambli, the guild master, etc. As you also wish to know whether he has preached before and whether he is in a position to promise anything to my gracious lords, you should know that he has preached here in the city at the Grossmünster for some time, and a year ago was appointed by my lords as a preacher in Illnau, in the County of Kyburg, since my lords have raised him from youth. Therefore, he is obliged to them, so he cannot move anywhere without their permission and command. However, whether my lords would release him entirely or let him stay in Illnau (where the church, which is large, is very dear and pleasant), I cannot know at all.</p>
      <p>And when I called him to me and spoke with him about what he intended to do if he were called to preach by a Christian church in the Bernese area, he gave no other answer than that he would do what would be to God's honor, the church's benefit, and as my lords commanded. He is quite satisfied with his appointment in Illnau, etc.</p>
      <p>I wanted to report this to your good opinion based on your writing and request, so that you can now deliberate and decide what seems most beneficial for your church; whether you think it fruitful to write to him and my lords, or to seek another.</p>
      <p>Whatever I can do for your honor, service, love, and good, I will always be willing to do. I hereby ask that you will always have me at your service. And may the grace of God be with you. Dated Zürich, April 25, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your always willing Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, and wise bailiffs and council of the city of Aarau, his gracious dear lords.</p>
