      <p>Greetings. I hear (reverend father) that you there are overwhelmed with new matters to the point of nausea; we poor souls have absolutely nothing. Our merchants, who were in great abundance and very frequent with you, have all returned except for one, Balingket, who is expected the day after tomorrow. Regarding French and German affairs, not a word has reached me.</p>
      <p>Right now, I would very much like to know the state of the church. Tomorrow there will be a wedding here: the bishop has arranged for his sister to marry the one who was the custodian of the college, the custodian, Schouwenstein. The canonry is said to have been assigned to a young boy, who is to be at the table with Mr. Rudolf Funck. Thus, they play with their religion.</p>
      <p>There are so many poor people, whose death is visible in their eyes, and anyone can see how they are dealing with the church's goods. But I complain about these things in vain, etc.</p>
      <p>Our Hercules of Clavenna was so close to death that his death was announced to the consuls once or twice, which news struck me not a little. Now I hear he is recovering.</p>
      <p>I ask you to share news, which I may impart to him and thereby somewhat soothe his troubled mind. I wanted my speech to appear under my name, as it seemed to my father-in-law and I did not much disagree with his opinion for certain reasons. I know that I have incited the fury of the antichristians against me.</p>
      <p>But let them rage as much as they want; I wrote this, whatever it is, to provoke them. Oporinus printed it; the copies have not yet been delivered; when they are delivered, you will receive them from my relative Collin. In the meantime, I hear the council is being perpetuated and that the abbot of Eremus was granted leave only for the sake of recovering his health and was not allowed to go further than this monastery in Algau, where he is bedridden, etc. I am diligently inquiring into those sessions; but I have not yet accomplished anything; however, I will not cease to inquire further. I will write again to Mr. Travers and Mr. Julius, I will instruct Mr. Balingket, I will urge Hercules; if I cannot extract anything from this, I do not know what more I can do. What is now to be written, you will understand from the attached note.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, for as long and as happily as possible. Chur, September 7, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours respectfully, F[abricius].</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant and worthy head of the church of Zurich, his always honorable lord.</p>
