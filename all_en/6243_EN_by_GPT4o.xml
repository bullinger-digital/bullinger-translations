      <p>Greetings. There is no need for me to write about French affairs, as you will learn everything in detail from our Linero, who has just returned from the court. Recently, I wrote briefly to you through the Glarus messenger, especially about the response given to the French envoys; for at that time, I could not yet know what it was. Meanwhile, I hear that the response has been postponed until their return.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, there are various opinions and murmurs among the people. I hope the Lord will grant grace, so that, mindful of past dangers, they will refrain from such alliances.</p>
      <p>You will hear from Linero how the edict of peace is being observed in France, and we think we can establish it with our authority. Beza, as I hear from him, has also changed his opinion.</p>
      <p>I would, however, wish that he had written less about this matter to our people, so that they would not misuse his authority against us. We are now waiting to see what the assembly in Baden will bring.</p>
      <p>You have there from our side MÃ¼linen and Manuel, with whom you can correspond through letters. I think our Savoyard matter will have to be proposed to the Swiss there; for the prince urges nothing more than to finally settle and make restitution. They almost curse us for the restitution and do not dare to fully reveal their grief due to fear of the new prince; may the Lord be with them and protect us from evil. After the departure of the envoys, the consuls and senators also left the city in groups to their respective estates, so that this whole week there have been no more than 6 in the senate, and the vice-consulate has descended to the pandaretam in the Hof.</p>
      <p>Your friends and all the brothers greet you, especially Haller, your father-in-law, and Zehender. May all your people be safe.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for us; in Him, farewell. Bern, August 25, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my lord and perpetual compatriot, to be embraced with the highest love.</p>
