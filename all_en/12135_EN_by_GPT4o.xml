      <p>Greetings in the Lord, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>You can inquire from the Wittenberg messenger whether Luther's pamphlets have been suppressed in Wittenberg. It is certain that the people of Augsburg have banned them. I received the story about the Strasbourg printer from someone who saw it and knew the man for several years. It is consistently rumored that the Turk is on an expedition and has chosen Buda as his royal seat, and you will also hear this from the messenger himself.</p>
      <p>We are eagerly awaiting your response. If it is completed, you should give it to the Wittenberg messenger to deliver to Luther. You cannot imagine the joy the papists have over Luther's pamphlet; they boast and claim victory before the battle. Beware that Bucer does not blind you and our Theodor with his talkativeness, preventing you from writing what pertains to the defense.</p>
      <p>I know his mind; he has a very sad and depressed spirit; he fears becoming part of this tragedy. It is already apparent what kind of concord has been established with our churches. Therefore, proceed with a strong and steadfast spirit. The Lord will be with you with His help, providing true wisdom from the armory of divine scripture, so that you may strike down this Goliath with the first blow, indeed thrust him down to the depths of hell if he refuses to admit defeat and yield. The Lord tests us in this way, exercising our faith and constancy. He will be present and lead us, so that we may overcome all evils more easily. For if God is for us, who can be against us?</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and greet Theodor in my name, whom I know to be very busy; otherwise, I would have written him a personal letter.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, three ships came to us from Strasbourg with sails unfurled, full of wheat, which our council bought to assist the citizens who are suffering from scarcity.</p>
      <p>Each ship had one hundred sacks.</p>
      <p>The peasants in the Margraviate of Baden must all buy armor (equipment); they are making banners, which were taken from them in the previous peasant war. They have a dispute with Ulrich of Württemberg. The same is happening with the peasants in Alsace and Sundgau because of the Spaniards, who are plundering and devastating everything in Lorraine.</p>
      <p>Duke Christoph of Württemberg has banished the preacher Pantaleon Blasius because he refused to agree with another preacher on the matter of the Eucharist and other external ceremonies, which the duke keeps changing to eventually introduce the entire papacy. The French preacher Pierre Toussain suffers from paralysis. The sadness he conceived due to the alienated mind of the princes towards the true religion was the cause of this illness.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again and pray for our church. Basel, February 25, 1545.</p>
      <p>The Emperor in Brussels is severely tormented by gout. Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned Heinrich Bullinger, etc., pastor in Zurich.</p>
