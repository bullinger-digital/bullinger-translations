      <p>God be with us. Faithful, dearly beloved father, I have received your two comforting letters during my severe illness with great joy; for although I have never doubted your fatherly faithfulness and love, I have nevertheless felt your constant love even more through this, for which I thank you greatly and earnestly pray to Almighty God that He may graciously keep you in health and well-being, so that, if Almighty God should call me away, my dear wife and child may enjoy your fatherly help, comfort, and love. Regarding my severe illness, I can well recognize that it has been laid upon me by the providence and ordinance of God, therefore I have entrusted all my affairs to Almighty God alone and have borne them patiently by His grace until now. I have also, according to your comforting admonition, completely surrendered myself to the will of God, whether it be unto death or life, namely with God's help to overcome, and in this I remain firm and steadfast, while the afflictions of the illness are severe. When God comes with His redemption, I will meet Him with joy and warm faith through His help. If He then wishes to preserve me further (for which I earnestly pray that He may give strength to the medicines and strengthen my sick body to endure such), well then, I am ready to live in His will. With earnest prayer, faithful, dearly beloved father, I ask that you may commend me to God in your earnest prayers; that is the strongest and greatest help you can give me. Herewith I commend you to God in grace along with all of ours; may He be our help and comfort always and forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>I ask you to let Vrenli come to help us for a few days.</p>
      <p>Hans Rudolf Bullinger, your beloved son, in the year 1572, June 20th.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most beloved and esteemed father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
