      <p> Greetings. My brother, your letters are not a burden to me; I read them gladly, even though I am entangled in many affairs and burdened with cares. Therefore, continue writing. I thank you for your continuous efforts; in return, I will write when I can. Now I have heard from two or three places that peace has been made in France and the king has accepted all of ours into his grace and promised them all obedience, and the articles of peace are good. May Almighty God grant this! For at this time I cannot hear anything that would be dearer to me than a good peace. The poor people have suffered anxiety and distress for so long; may God comfort them and pacify the unpeaceful hearts! The queen in Scotland is said to be in court. The Duke of Holstein is taking 4000 horsemen and 6000 foot soldiers in the name of the Queen of England, perhaps for another, etc., Orange, etc. - There is said to be unrest in Ravenna and in several places in Italy. If you have detailed information, let me know; also, how it has gone with Ascanio, the servant of those from Emps, etc. </p>
      <p> Greet for me my lord mayor, Pontisella, Ganthner, and other friends. God be with you. </p>
      <p> In haste, April 2, 1568. </p>
      <p> Yours, Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, honorable lord and my beloved brother. </p>
      <p> Chur. </p>
