      <p>In the year of our Lord, January 27, 1533.</p>
      <p>Revered, well-learned, kind, dear sir and friend, I send you my service, always willing and unreservedly diligent, etc. This letter, from me to you as my dear lord and unknown friend, reaches you, wishing you to accept and understand my good and friendly intentions. Just as Master Ulrich, who is pious and undoubtedly well-regarded by God at this time, showed and demonstrated much goodwill towards me during his lifetime, so I wish you, as the one appointed and come to his place by God's order, to recognize my writing and request in the same spirit of friendship. If there is anything new in print available, please send it to me through this messenger. I will gladly reimburse you for the costs along with my highest gratitude. And if you have any news to report, please make it known to me, as much as it is appropriate for you to do so. For I am inclined to show you goodwill in return.</p>
      <p>Given as above.</p>
      <p>Martin Seger, bailiff of Maienfeld.</p>
      <p>To the revered, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Minster in Zurich, my particularly dear lord and friend.</p>
