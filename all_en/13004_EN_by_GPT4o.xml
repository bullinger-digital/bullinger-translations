    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] After the imperial bailiff Sebastian Gaisberg had been in Zurich, he met Sébastien de L’Aubespine, abbé de Bassefontaine [the envoy of King Henry II of France], on his way home in Winterthur, together with another councilor from Konstanz who had also been sent there. If the French envoy had been received in Konstanz, it would have caused a stir. Bassefontaine made great promises and claimed that the king was ready to help with money, soldiers, and other means. Consequently, the people of Konstanz decided to write to him and delivered it to the envoy. Blarer confidentially sends it to Bullinger on the condition that he returns it and does not let anyone copy it. He does not want to be accused of having spread such a thing among the people, as this letter was exceptionally made available to him to be copied quickly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He does not want to withhold from Bullinger that he has gained the impression from the whole affair that everything that is forbidden to [the people of Zurich] or the other [three Protestant places by the Inner Swiss] is justified by the claim that the French want it that way. Whether this promotes good, however, remains to be seen...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Now it is becoming increasingly clear that it would have been good if the original plan [regarding contact with France], drafted by [Konrad Zwick, Ambrosius, and Thomas Blarer], had been adhered to.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] How unfortunate that the people of Konstanz are completely on their own and can only help themselves slowly and indirectly! How great must be the burden of sin that brings such wrath of God! And the storm is not over yet! We must still be crushed by the [devil]. May the faithful God have mercy on us and be gracious to us.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger should pray for the people of Konstanz and warmly greet everyone from Blarer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Blarer inquired with the servant [...] whether [the printer Christoph Froschauer] had been paid for the copies [of the Rudimenta cosmographica by Johannes Honter]. The servant replied that Bullinger had done so. Therefore, he now receives the five Batzen back with great thanks.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother, I have nothing special to write, except (as you might well know) that Fontanus, on his way home from our lord bailiff Gaisberg, who had been in Zurich, was seen in Winterthur. Another councilor from here was then sent there to ensure he did not come here himself and cause a great stir. He has let it be known that he is willing to help with money, people, and in other ways on behalf of the king, etc. Consequently, my lords have decided on a response and have sent it to him. I am sending it to you in confidence with the condition that you send it back to me and do not let anyone copy it, for I truly would not want it to be known that such a thing was spread by me; for the letter was made available to me in haste to be copied.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I did not want to withhold from you, for it seems to me from all matters, that what you or others have not dared to do out of fear, will be attributed to the French, that they do it. Whether good things are promoted by this, only dear God knows.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I find and understand more and more, that if some good advice, of which you are well aware, had been followed, it would have been very good. I also say, we will experience it better and better over time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Oh Lord God, that everything wants to go so crookedly and only in the slow way! How great are our sins that deserve such wrath! It truly seems to me that all things point to the fact that the storms have not yet passed. We must still be crushed with the hammer of the whole world. May the faithful God be gracious and merciful to us and keep us in grace for eternal life!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Truly, truly praying for me and our church! Greet all people from the heart.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I asked the servant if he had given the money for the books. He says you have paid it. Therefore, I send you the 5 Batzen with great thanks. Dated July 18, 1547. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
