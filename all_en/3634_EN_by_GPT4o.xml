      <p>A certain member of the ministers from the previous year was condemned to the fire six weeks ago in the month of September.</p>
      <p>The Parliament had to subscribe to its (?) decisions. Many refused.</p>
      <p>The King, however, wanting to know, heard from the Parliament not the least, who nevertheless adorned and defended the message in such a way that the King, having been rebuffed by complaints, finally said that he would think more diligently about this matter. A certain Barb√ºrinus from Geneva, if I hold the name correctly, is taking care of the notes at his own expense.</p>
      <p>Beza.</p>
      <p>In the new testament, hear through our Gessner, for what reason he was detained in chains through the blockade(?)... released under the condition that he orders Gessner to stop.</p>
      <p>Regarding this matter, he made letters from the magistrate to my most honorable senate.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
