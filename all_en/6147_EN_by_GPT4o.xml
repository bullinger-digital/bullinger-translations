      <p>Greetings. I give you thanks, my father, for your most loving letters, and as you advise, I pray to God that, since He calls me to this, He may provide me with the strength needed to bear such a burden, so that, if not very useful, I may at least be found faithful to the end. I visited our Calvin, who is hastening more and more towards that eternal peace, three days ago in your name and communicated to him your and your entire church's constant prayers for him.</p>
      <p>"I give thanks," he said, "to the best brothers, whose memory now also refreshes me." And soon, not without tears, he said: "Lord, preserve your faithful servants and hear their prayers, but only so far, if it pleases you, that I may soon be with you." Thus that good man gradually declines; but not without the most severe pains, which, however, he endures with incredible patience by the grace of God, constantly sighing to the Lord. Meanwhile, we groan and lament our bereavement.</p>
      <p>But we trust in the Lord, whom we hope will be all the more powerful for us, the weaker we are ourselves. Concerning the French churches: The provincial churches are finally beginning to be restored, and some of the most cruel robbers have been punished. Many of their associates have fled to the Avignon territory, where Fabricius, in the name of the pope, is still cruelly persecuting all the pious with arms. The Occitan brothers are no better off, although their governor has been ordered by at least twenty letters to deal with them according to the edict's formula. In a certain part of Aquitaine, a most impious Montluc, whom they have nevertheless appointed over that region, does not cease to ravage the churches.</p>
      <p>To this are added other not light conjectures, that something is being secretly agitated which will eventually burst forth, unless the Lord breaks the plans of the impious.</p>
      <p>The king will soon be in Lyon, hopefully for the good of the church. I expected nothing else from that conference than what happened, nor will I hope unless the meetings are instituted in another manner. However, I have always wished, and still wish with you, that a meeting be held, but under conditions that offer some hope.</p>
      <p>The opponents are manifestly both the Lutherans of Saxony and our sacramentarian churches, these Omnipresent ones. What can you obtain from them? Therefore, a third party is needed, of the kind you write about. I wish something could be done in this way.</p>
      <p>I will not fail in my duty.</p>
      <p>But what I hope for, I do not have, since only Admiral with the brothers is strong, but he is so hated by the person on whom everything depends that it is certain she will plot everything to their ruin, namely, so that afterwards we may be destroyed without any trouble, since she thinks we rely on human support. [I write this to you and ask that you erase it after reading.] Nevertheless, I will try everything.</p>
      <p>But again, I say I have very little hope from this side. More hope appears from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>For these Omnipresent ones will certainly reveal the grossest errors which have hitherto been hidden, and so it will be that Germany will either begin to be wise, chastised by the just judgment of God, or (which the Lord avert) will feel the hand of an angry God completely.</p>
      <p>Why I should hope for better things, I am not only led to this because the merciful Lord has always kept some for Himself there, but also because He has raised up that excellent prince in the highest rank of authority among all the electors, who bravely defends the truth, so that all wise men may have someone to follow under his leadership.</p>
      <p>But the Lord will provide for all these things, who at least grants us this, that we may sow good seed. He Himself will give the increase as He knows and has decreed from eternity for the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Within the next fairs, if life permits, I will respond to Brentius, Andreas, and Eber, but with as few words as possible, since they bring nothing but partly unworthy things to respond to, partly also things refuted a thousand times.</p>
      <p>The rest when there is more leisure.</p>
      <p>For now, I am overwhelmed not only with cares but also with sorrows as I have never endured.</p>
      <p>Pray for me to the Lord, my father, and for all of us, that we may look to Him to the end. I ask the same from your brothers and all your colleagues, whom I bid to be very well in the Lord and to be healthy.</p>
      <p>Nothing confirms me as much when I look at this world as the agreement of this church with all the good ones: and privately, the union with those whom I know to be faithful servants of God, and therefore to be heard in their prayers for me, also raises me up, otherwise prostrate on the ground, as I know I have been saved a thousand times in this way from deadly diseases and dangers of all kinds. May this life, therefore, so often as if restored to me, be completely consecrated to my Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you with the brothers and the assembly of colleagues, and bless your labors. I hope Master Gwalther will forgive me for not writing to him particularly now, as it should have been done since I have been provoked by his most loving letters so many times. I love him and all of you, and I will embrace you to the end, despite Satan.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>Geneva, May 24, 1564.</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen that blasphemous book of Gregory, nor could I respond within the fairs if I had seen it. Yours, Beza.</p>
      <p>I have received the Theses and Eber's book, which I will return immediately. I hope the Poles, about whom you wrote to me, have been suitably provided for.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Master Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered father, the truly faithful pastor of the Zurich church. In Zurich.</p>
