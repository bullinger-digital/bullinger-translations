    <p xml:id="regest1">Can now report the outcome of his proceedings, that he was acquitted by the Landvogt [Zumbrunnen] (hopes that the enemies of the truth will be put to shame); asks Bullinger to withdraw the defense document [Mötteli's] so that no cause for dispute is given. Thanks the pastors and Bullinger for their support.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Since I know, excellent man, that you bear the anxious care not only of all the churches but also of all the brothers, I did not want to conceal from you, due to your singular benevolence towards me, the outcome of my affairs, which I had recently discussed with you and left with you in a written note, in case circumstances required them to be remembered. For the sake of the august majesty of truth, I hope that all its enemies will be confounded at once. The Landvogt (prefect), when he had summoned me to court and had me present on the third day of the legal proceedings without an accuser and did not charge me with any crime, declared me free. For what reason, I cannot know. Therefore, I would like you to withdraw my defense, which I gave you in writing, from the public, so that it may not be a cause of new disputes in any way in the future. If perhaps the Lord has granted a more equitable mind regarding the truth, let us not give any offense to those who are impatient with complaints for our sake.</p>
      <p>Moreover, my church helped me with diligent work, advice, and expense, showing exceptional diligence and love towards me, as did all the brothers. Just as they were anxious with prayers and care for me and the affairs of the church, so now they greatly congratulate both the church and me. May the Lord grant them eternal joy for their love and zeal towards me. You, for your love towards us, always give thanks to the Lord with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All the brothers always diligently pray for your well-being.</p>
      <p>The fifth day of July in the year 37.</p>
      <p>Martin Mötteli, always yours.</p>
      <p>From Weinfelden in Thurgau.</p>
      <p>At the same time, to the most pious and learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, his most beloved lord and brother.</p>
