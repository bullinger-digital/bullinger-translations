      <p>Greetings. The letters that I received yesterday from Schenck, addressed to you, were indeed written some time ago but delivered late and neglected by Gynopedius for a long time. I am now sending them to you along with mine, which you would have received recently through the Constanz couriers, had they not departed sooner than expected. Hoserus also wrote to me, but nothing entirely new, except that he complains greatly about those ubiquitous ones, who increasingly burden and disrupt the church. He also sent a sermon from the Württemberg court preacher Johannes, who calls himself Parsimonius, born in Augsburg and once a deacon of Musculus, whom I would send... if I did not think you would now receive it through this letter from Schenck. Hoserus indicates that he wrote to me in May through Leonard Schnider, that courier you know, for he has brought us letters from Augsburg more than once and received others from us to be delivered there. But he ran away with a rogue, was supposed to bring 30 talers to someone; he took them, just as his predecessor Jörg Stürmer did, and kept some money for himself and ran away with it.</p>
      <p>Thus, trust is safe nowhere.</p>
      <p>I considered this Leonhard to be a very pious man, he had a wife and child in Augsburg. But it is said: Beware of men.</p>
      <p>God has protected me from him for a time; otherwise, he would have caused me much greater harm. But farewell well, my venerable and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Winterthur, July 22, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
