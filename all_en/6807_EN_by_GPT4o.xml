      <p>G[reetings] I [say].</p>
      <p>They say the Diet of Augsburg has been dissolved. I received the report presented to the Emperor on May 19th by all the orders of the empire regarding the decision on whether they recognize the Elector Palatine as an ally of the Augsburg Confession. In the matter of justification and the essence of salvation, they recognize him as an ally, but in the matter of the Lord's Supper, they say he is Zwinglian; however, they will test whether they can come to an agreement with him before departure. Otherwise, they do not want to, nor do they ask the Emperor to exclude either the Palatine or others who agree with him from the peace of religion. Nor do they wish to give occasion to foreigners to persecute those who think differently about the Supper. They have entirely decided to steadfastly persevere in the profession of the Augsburg Confession. They think that the Saxon or the Hessian was either the author or at least the assistant of this moderation. If the Palatine continues, about which we have no doubt, the practices of the Lutherans are broken. To this is added that certainly Mr. Victorinus Strigel has openly come to us and in the University of Leipzig has both proposed and defended our doctrine. His authority will greatly detract from them. Mr. Pfeffinger opposed him, but he is a mere soldier to Achilles. Victorinus prefers exile to changing doctrine. The University of TÃ¼bingen, on the other hand, fights vehemently. This is the change of the right hand of the Most High, etc.</p>
