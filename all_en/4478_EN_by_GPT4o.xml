      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, letters were received from the King of France, addressed to our most esteemed republic, in which he explains the great danger he is in; for there are seditious individuals in the kingdom who are plotting against his crown; therefore, he is preparing cavalry to bring the rebels into order, and for this purpose, he is also seeking both assistance and money from the Swiss. Our people have not yet responded.</p>
      <p>Many suspect that this matter is being orchestrated by the cardinal and the Guise brothers. Therefore, if you know anything certain, share it with us, so that we may act as is fitting for the faithful; for if the seditious oppose the king, he should not be deserted, but if the faithful oppose tyrants and oligarchs and wish to restore the former rights of the kingdom, etc., then our arms or money should not be used against such people. But, what the situation is or how things stand, we cannot know for certain.</p>
      <p>What, therefore, should we do with certainty?</p>
      <p>Our affairs in these parts are also quite disturbed; for the people of the Five Cantons, very turbulent men, have a dispute with the people of Claron, from whom they are trying to take away all preachers because of certain agreements violated (as they themselves say) by the people of Claron. Our envoys are now going to the Diet at Heremitage, where that case will be discussed. Many suspect that the people of the Five Cantons will suddenly attack the people of Claron.</p>
      <p>If this happens, I fear the whole of Switzerland will be ablaze with civil war. May the Lord deliver us from men of blood and grant us true peace! May the Lord Jesus keep you and the church entrusted to you! Pray diligently for us to the Lord; live and farewell in Christ, all of you. Our brothers and all your fellow ministers greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 2, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful and vigilant pastor of the church of Geneva, his esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Geneva.</p>
