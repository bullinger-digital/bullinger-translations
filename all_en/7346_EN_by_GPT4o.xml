      <p>I pray from the heart, most esteemed lord, that the beginning and progress of this year may be most fortunate for you and yours from God, the best and greatest, and I ask that you kindly accept the 8 Rhenish gold coins enclosed here, which I send in the name of New Year's gifts.</p>
      <p>I have absolutely nothing to write about the state of affairs with us now, because everything is silent and everyone seems to be focused on the outcome of the French war; for as it happens, it will dictate laws to many. Now, as for what remains, since I have nothing to add, fare well.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, December 28, in the year 67.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your Reverence, Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>When I had finished this and wanted to seal it, your letter written on November 24 was brought; therefore, I return to you the note enclosed with it, whose handwriting is not unknown to me, and I thank you for sharing it; for I understood more certain things from it than I have been able to obtain from our own sources so far. I sent back the previous notes long ago; I hope you have received them by now. The envoys of the seven electors will meet in Fulda on January 6. Again, fare well.</p>
      <p>I think the German cavalry, which was supposed to be brought to Condé, is now said to be scattered along the banks of the Rhine, nurturing some kind of monster, which might reveal itself with the coming spring. There will be discussions in Fulda about creating a King of the Romans, because the emperor is in poor health at a rather untimely time, and you know the disposition of most of the princes against the Austrian house.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
