    <p xml:id="regest1">Defends himself against the accusation that he praised the Mass too much. He is only being accused because the altars have still not been removed from the church, but this is not his fault. He has never concealed the relevant Bible passages against the use of altars and also cites them here. For information, he sends the text of a sermon on the misuse of the Mass. His poor health in the spring and autumn is the reason for his absence from the synod. He will strive to obediently carry out the will of the synod.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>My most esteemed magnificent fathers and teachers, how much patience will I, your most humble servant, need when I perceive that so many false accusations, indeed slanders, are made against me before your most kind deacons day after day.</p>
      <p>Since you have previously experienced many false accusers against me, you will also believe that he who lies about me, claiming that I excessively praise the Mass, is hateful to me. These rivals accuse me because the altars in our church have not been removed, but this is not my fault. You know that it is not within my power to command or restrain, but only to proclaim the word of God, which I certainly do not neglect nor have I kept silent about that passage in Isaiah 27:9: "The Lord will lay waste all the stones of the altar like chalkstones." He will devastate all the altars in the temple of the Jews, and this is known to have been done by Hezekiah as stated in Isaiah 36:7. Hence, the sanctuary was destroyed as Daniel predicted, Dan. 9:27. What Asa and Jehoshaphat did in 2 Chronicles 14:3,5 and 17, I have not omitted, etc. They destroyed the high places and altars because God no longer wanted sacrifices to be offered in vain, Isaiah 1:12. Our altars should be destroyed even more because we believe in the sacrifice of Christ and know that all sacrifices have been fulfilled. Therefore, I cry out daily: "Why do you not remove them? Do you fear men more than God?" If your paternities command me to do anything more extensively, it is my duty to comply with everything. Thus, for my own and others' information, I send to you a few things that I publicly pronounced about the abuses of the Mass, if you have the leisure to read them. If I have erred in any way in these most simple writings of mine, I commend myself to your correction, most obediently.</p>
      <p>Finally, I give an account of my absence. God knows that I do not lie to the Holy Spirit like Ananias and Sapphira. Just as in every spring and autumn, so now my poor health prevents me from traveling. I pray that no one will attribute this to me for the worse. Whatever my rivals may insinuate, I will strive to devote all my efforts to the work of the Gospel in accordance with your gracious will and our synodal statutes to the best of my ability. And if there is anything else that my diligence can accomplish for your grace and benefit, I am ready to leave everything and obey your command, which is done by the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>From Wädenswil, on the eighteenth day of October 1534.</p>
      <p>Konrad Müppein, most obedient servant of the Gospel and its poor.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned men and each of the reverend brothers of the honorable synodal assembly, his most esteemed lords and teachers.</p>
