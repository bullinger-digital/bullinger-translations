      <p>Honorable, highly learned, especially dear lord and brother-in-law, my friendly greetings to your honor always beforehand. Dear lord and brother-in-law, your and all your people's health would be a great joy for me to hear. As for me and my little Aneli, it is as it is in our frail condition; may God the Lord grant us health according to His will. And, dear lord and brother-in-law, the medicine you sent me for my Aneli, I have given to him, and 3 large worms have come out of him, so that now, praise be to God, he has a little rest, but he is still as weak as before, which makes me think there are more inside him. And it is my very friendly request to you to send me more of the sugar peas; for he prefers them over the other medicine, and I will give them to this man who brings you the letter from me; he will give you what they cost on my behalf; for I will honestly repay him; for he is a good friend to me.</p>
      <p>He is my cousin Hans Jacob's brother-in-law from Laufenburg; for I cannot obtain any here. I have also ordered that they should bring me some from Basel; but they cannot obtain any for me either. May Almighty God keep you and all your people in great health, and greet all of them for me.</p>
      <p>Dated Rheinfelden, the 27th day of March in the year 1570. My little Aneli sends you, his dear uncle, and all his dear uncles and cousins, the little ones and the big ones, his warmest greetings.</p>
      <p>Your honor's willing sister Margaretha, widow of the late Hans Adlischwyler.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my dear lord and brother-in-law, to be delivered etc.</p>
