      <p>Greetings. Since a full month and a half has passed since I received your last letter, to which I have not yet responded, I am somewhat ashamed of such a long delay. However, so that you do not think I have no excuse, you should know that at the time I received it, I was suffering from a tertian fever, which terrified many and brought some a fleeting hope of false joy. From that time, I was kept in suspense for a long time by Mr. Johannes a Lasco, who had come to the assembly at Speyer to discuss a colloquy. I was completely unaware of what he had done until I was informed by a letter from Mr. Peter Martyr that he had also debated with Brentius in the Duchy of WÃ¼rttemberg. Now, some acts are circulating from which it appears that, although Brentius foolishly or coldly asserted the immensity of Christ's body, our brother was almost silenced as if defeated. While the opposing side is now celebrating triumphs, Peter Martyr thinks he acted inconsiderately by engaging privately without suitable witnesses or arbitrators.</p>
      <p>Three days later, letters written from Frankfurt arrived, not without the consent of Lasco himself, which highly commend the outcome of such an unfortunate expedition. He, being bedridden from illness, did not write, but his associate, who is aware of all his actions, reports these things as if from his mouth: that the Elector Palatine is ours, the Wittenbergers are hesitating, the chancellor of the Palatine supports us, and therefore the prince will endeavor at the Diet of Regensburg to have learned men from both sides meet. He also sent some collected writings under the name of acts to clear our brother, which confirm Martyr's letters. For the debate is not mentioned there.</p>
      <p>He only writes what he conceived separately upon returning from Brentius. Therefore, it was better to remain quiet unless perhaps the Lord unexpectedly offers something better. He indicates that he was advised by his nephew that it pleases the King of Poland, before returning to his homeland, to write an apology demonstrating that his doctrine agrees with the Augsburg Confession, and therefore he is contemplating a brief writing which he will publish with your, Martyr's, and my consent.</p>
      <p>While I do not disapprove of the type of argument and plan, I see the matter as full of danger unless the utmost skill is applied. But a judgment will be made quite opportunely from the reading. Concerning the colloquy, forgive me if I somewhat disagree with you. For although the progress is not as I would wish, because it would be far more disgraceful to refuse than to steadfastly and openly assert the true doctrine and bear the mark of obstinacy, I think the outcome should be entrusted to God, provided that in the meantime we do not shun the light. Indeed, as I have done so far, I will restrain myself so as not to appear too eagerly striving. However, if the opposing side summons us of their own accord, I will be ready to defend my faith. Nor do I doubt that you are of the same mind. In the meantime, I have testified to Mr. a Lasco how much I am displeased with his excessive diligence. But you know how difficult it is to draw anyone away from their own nature. Farewell, most excellent man, and my sincerely esteemed brother. May the Lord always be with you, guide you, and bless you with your family. My colleagues and friends send you many greetings. I pray for much health to your fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Geneva, July 1, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
