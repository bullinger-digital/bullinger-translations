    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Already yesterday, Blarer wrote [with No. 2716] in haste, and even now he lacks time, as he also wants to write to the people of Augsburg to exhort them to further steadfastness. Moreover, there is nothing certain to report about either the [Schmalkaldic League] or the [Imperials].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The people of Ulm are sending back the letters [from the Zurichers] (unfortunately, probably for good reasons). The council of Konstanz will now forward the consignment addressed to [Johannes] Haller from the Zurich authorities to Augsburg. But first, Blarer wants to enclose his own letters with this consignment.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] There is nothing confirmed about Emperor [Charles V]. The council of Konstanz, which otherwise spares no expense, was surprisingly unwilling to spend money to learn something certain about the [Schmalkaldic League] and the enemies through a messenger. But as soon as Blarer hears something important, he will report it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is pleasing that the [Zurichers] do not demand protection of their faith from the Nine Places, especially since such a thing really should not be done, as Bullinger has already excellently explained [in a letter not preserved]. However, that Bern and Basel intend to do so, surprises Blarer greatly! There must be something behind it, which will probably soon be revealed, especially if the Nine Places reject the request.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Oh, how bad things are in this world! Everyone thinks only of themselves. One can no longer count on any alliance. Everything is falling apart. But Bullinger is right: God will not abandon His own, as long as they do not turn away from Him. But first, one must show true repentance and conversion, as Christ, who is the truth, abhors all falsehood.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings. [Thomas] Blarer and [Konrad] Zwick also send their regards.</p>

      <p>I wrote to you yesterday more than tumultuously; which now again, whether I want to or not, I am forced to do, my venerable and more than dearest Bullinger, because now I have to write many things to Augsburg, whom I would very much like to keep in their praised steadfastness as much as I can, although, even if I had the time, there is nothing I could write to you now about our affairs or those of the adversaries; everything is so uncertain!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The people of Ulm are returning your letters. I fear they have not done so with a sincere heart. Our council will now send your letters to Augsburg, addressed to Haller, along with mine, which I wish to be included.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We hear no certain news from the Emperor, which makes me extremely wonder at the negligence of our people, who, although they otherwise incur unbearable expenses, are unwilling to spend even on messengers, so that they might learn for certain what is being done by our people or by the adversaries. As soon as I receive anything worthy of your knowledge, I will diligently ensure that I inform you without delay.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We are very pleased that your lords are all united and have not wanted to involve themselves with the Nine Places regarding their religion. For such a thing, as you have reported, is by no means to be done. We are very surprised at Bern and Basel, what they mean by it. We suspect there is something else behind it, which will soon be revealed, especially in the case that such a request is denied by the Nine Places.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Oh Lord God, how disrupted and disordered everything is in the world! Nothing fits together anymore. All bonds and ties are loosening. Everything is cracking and breaking, as if it wants to fall into ruins! But it is as you write: The Lord will not forsake His own, as long as we do not forsake Him. Let us urge, as much as we can, a repentance worthy of Christians and a solid conversion to the Lord, without which we implore His help in vain, and thus more and more provoke His wrath against us. For He, who is the truth, hates whatever is false, whatever is feigned, and is very near with His present divine power to all who call upon Him in truth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell, my lord and my soul, remember us before the Lord. My brother and Zwick also send their greetings. December 17th. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my greatest friend and brother in the Lord, in Zurich.</p>
