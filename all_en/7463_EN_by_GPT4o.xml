      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Whenever I see the written name of Mr. Heinrich Bullinger or hear mention of him, most learned victor, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Christ, my spirit is filled with great joy, because by the grace of God, the venerable and highly esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger is still alive and well, although there are some who, alas, perhaps envy him this blessing against the nature and beyond the spirit of charity, which is not the least mark by which true Christians and disciples of Christ are known and should be recognized and judged. Since this is so, most humane and upright man, I dare to pass judgment on myself and, as I hope, not a feigned or false one, that I pursue you with no hatred whatsoever, but with the highest and most intimate love in Christ Jesus, τς θις τΗσ αγαπΗσ Ξεοθ κει τς ΗγαπΗμενς. And if only among all those (to say nothing of the rest) who are named Christians by Christ, there were today as much ardor of charity as there is coldness! Oh, how blessed we would be, how safe and secure, how rich and opulent! Oh, how well at home, how rich at home! For Ξεοσ αγαπΗ εσι, as the Apostle and Evangelist John, the beloved disciple of our Lord, testifies, και ο μενςν εν τΗ αγαπΗ, εν τς Ξες μενει και ο Ξεοσ εν αθτς. May the God of charity and peace grant us all and each one, and especially those who seek and desire it from the heart, the spirit of δθναμεςσ και αγαπΗσ, so that we may be able to love one another from a pure heart εκτενςσ and persevere in faith working through love until the end through Christ Jesus. Amen. Furthermore, to come to the point for which I am writing to your Excellency and humanity now and never before, first of all, I want to ask my lord and esteemed father again and again not to interpret this request, which I am about to make, in a bad way; afterwards, if it seems to him not to be contrary to brotherly charity, which is also accustomed to cover a multitude of sins and not to oppose the praise and glory of Christ the Lord, which also seems to consist in this to a large extent, that many are gained and saved for him, that he may deign to grant what I ask. I am asking on behalf of Wilhelm Hengger, for whom I feel pity; for he acknowledges his misery and confesses that he has sinned against God and against you, his lords and patrons, and promises to be more prudent and more frugal in the future than he has been so far. And because charity believes all things, hopes all things, for this reason I ask you, most esteemed lord, to deign to help him and assist him in his poverty with some stipend, so that he may not only support himself and his family but also make progress in his studies and especially in sacred literature, and finally become a most useful servant to you and the Church of Christ from an unprofitable servant. If this is done, which I pray and wish with all my heart from the best and greatest God, know that you have saved a soul from death. As for what else I might add, I have nothing, although I ask you to always commend our Basel church with its pastors to your holy prayers, and then to greet in my name all your and our συνεργοι in the vineyard of the Lord. Farewell, reverend lord, always happily in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel in the year 1568 on the Ides of May.</p>
      <p>Your Excellency's and humanity's most observant and loving Johann Brandmüller, the least of the pastors of the Basel church.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man in piety and virtue, wisdom and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed and very dear lord in Christ.</p>
