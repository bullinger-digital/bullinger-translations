Complains about the conditions in Basel and regrets that the guilty [ZÃ¼rich students] were spared - Christoph [Rotacher] almost left Basel because of the [related] statements by Theodor [Bibliander] -; today, more Bachelors were promoted.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Receive what was sent to us the day before yesterday about the diet, and divine matters. Indeed, I hope the Lord will preserve His word; but nothing will come of the reformation.</p>
      <p>It grieves me exceedingly that religion is failing everywhere. I know what is happening among us: We are slipping into worse every day more and more. Good men are troubled that you so anxiously favor those two, while they act very badly here. But you will see. Christoph almost prepared to leave because of Theodor's words, but he was mistaken; I do not know what the reason is. Today we have again made bachelors. You will rejoice with us. I scarcely live because of the misery, which I see growing heavier every day.</p>
      <p>We are losing our minds. I can do nothing else.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours, Theodor, Pellican, and the others.</p>
      <p>Basel, the last day of March in the year 41.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
