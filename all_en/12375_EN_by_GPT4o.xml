    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer forwards a letter from [Georg] Frölich [HBBW XV, No. 2313]. Instead of responding to Bullinger's letter [No. 2319], he can now only point out a mistake in his last letter [HBBW XV, No. 2316]: It was not [Joachim] Mötteli [von Rappenstein], but Wilhelm von Peyer, the bailiff of the [Constance] Bishop [Johann von Weeze] in Gottlieben, who reported on the changed dealings of the [Zurichers] with the mercenaries. Mötteli and the [Constance] doctor [Johann Jakob] Menlishofer were only present.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [On January 5th] Blarer received a letter from his brother [Thomas Blarer] about the lack of progress [at the Bundestag in Frankfurt]. [Thomas Blarer] does not yet know when he will return [to Constance]. He writes that [due to] the death of the Trier Bishop [Johann IV. Ludwig von Hagen], now [Johann] von Naves is [in Trier]. He also sent the council [of Constance] an opinion from Philipp [Melanchthon], [Johannes] Bugenhagen, and Luther, which the council has not yet read aloud; Blarer might get to see it and would then also inform Bullinger. [Thomas Blarer] has nothing to report about the [Second Regensburg Religious] discussion, except that [Johannes] Brenz was alone in Regensburg for a while and had to wait for the other participants, of whom so far [Erhard] Schnepf and Balthasar von Gültlingen have arrived.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- This in haste because of the messenger [...]. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [P.S.:] The people of Isny have elected Benedikt Burgauer, who was known in Bern as a strict Lutheran, as pastor. This daring decision displeases Blarer like hardly anything else in many years.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Enclosure:] The following is reported from Augsburg: In England, King [Henry VIII] and the Parliament have decided that all church properties belong to the crown, which the clergy have approved with the request that the king at least grant their maintenance. The law also orders the banishment of the pope and his followers from the kingdom. Additionally, a church reform and the abolition of the mass are planned.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The envoys [of the Schmalkaldic League] continue to negotiate a peace between [Henry VIII] and [Francis I] and are confident. England and France offer [the Schmalkaldic League] an agreement and financial support. This will surely please Pope [Paul III] at the council [in Trent]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [Suleiman I] has not yet approved a long-term peace. It is supposed to happen only if [Charles V] cedes Milan to [Francis I]. That may take a long time!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [Charles V] is embarrassed and does not know how to keep his promise to [attack the Protestants] to the pope, so we will probably soon hear of a peace and the [reappointment] of the Chamber Court.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [At the Bundestag] in Frankfurt, things are going well. Blarer hopes for the soon extension of the [Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- [Georg] Frölich writes similar things and sends greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am sending the letters I received from Lętus. Regarding your letters, I can only point out an error I made in my last letter to you. It was not Metellus who boasted about the changes in your dealings with the mercenaries, but rather the prefect of our bishop at Gottlieben, whose name is Wilhelm von Peyer. However, Metellus confirmed this in the presence of our doctor Menlishofer. Therefore, please correct this error with those to whom you might have mentioned it.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, I received a letter from my brother, who writes that the affairs of our religion are progressing so slowly there that the benefits hardly outweigh the tedium. He does not promise anything certain about his return. Furthermore, he writes about the death of the Bishop of Trier and that Johann von Naves is now there, as they call it, the plague of the emperor. My brother sent the council the opinion of Philipp, Pomeranus, and Luther; however, the council has not yet read it, much less shared it with me, which might happen later. If there is anything that you should know, I will make sure you find out. He affirms that he has no certain information about the colloquy, except that Brenz was alone in Regensburg for a while and was waiting for the others, some of whom have already arrived: Schnepf and Balthasar von Gültlingen. May the Lord guide it well, to whom I commend myself most diligently.</p>

      <p>This in haste. I did not want to neglect this messenger. Greet the friends and brothers, especially your household. I can say nothing further. It remains as it was. January 6, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4">
      <p>Yours, A. Bl.</p>

      <p>The people of Isny have chosen this Benedikt Burgauer, who vigorously defended Luther's cause in Bern, as their pastor, with truly unfortunate omens. This decision displeases me as much as hardly anything else in many years, because all their plans are so reckless.</p>

      <p>From Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8">
      <p>Yesterday, news came from England that the king there, with the advice of the entire parliament, unanimously recognized and decided that all church properties in the entire kingdom rightfully belong to their lord, the king, to protect the land, people, and the Christian church. The clergy have also agreed to this and have only requested a decent maintenance for their lifetime. To this, the king said he would treat them appropriately. It is also publicly and explicitly ordered in the aforementioned parliamentary decision that the pope and all his followers shall be banned from the kingdom of England forever. They are also proceeding with a church reformation and the abolition of the mass in England.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Furthermore, the Christian allied envoys are now in England to make peace between the king and the Frenchman; it is considered very honorable, and there is good hope that ours will find peace, which will not please everyone. England and France also offer to make an agreement with us and to provide a sum of money to us. This will surely please the pope at the council.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Turk has not yet given peace. It is supposed to be for a year if the emperor gives Milan to the Frenchman, so such peace is still far off.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The emperor is quite confused. He does not know how to fulfill his promise to the pope, and I believe we will soon have news that they will offer us peace and the reappointment of the Chamber Court.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest9">
      <p>In Frankfurt, things are in good negotiation. I hope the Christian union will soon be extended and expanded.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Our Lętus also wrote similar things, who commends himself to you accurately and wishes you much health in the Lord.</p>
