    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger wants to be informed about Northern Germany. But how should Gast learn reliable information about people who live so far away? However, he can tell the following ridiculous yet insightful story: A priest [Nicolaus Piper?] recently thanked God in a sermon held in Bergheim for the victory of Emperor Charles V and said that nothing worse could have happened to the Catholic clergy and the Jews than a victory of the Lutherans! He then called on Jews and Catholics to continue pleading for God's assistance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] A citizen from Frankfurt [Mathias Limberger] reported that the five [imperial] companies stationed in the city are covering the costs of their consumption themselves and have not robbed anyone so far. When a monk [...] asked the soldiers for permission to read them the mass, this was rejected by the Frankfurt council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Emperor is said to have sent about 200 wagons to Worms because the next Imperial Diet is supposedly to be held there. Myconius will provide news about Saxony.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Recently, Gast wrote about Junker Claus von Hattstatt, who is imprisoned in Ensisheim Castle. He is said to be sentenced to death. The charges are: 1. He did not want to serve the Emperor in the campaign. 2. He allowed his troops to join the people of Strasbourg and recruited soldiers for Landgrave Philip of Hesse. 3. He wanted to recruit soldiers for the French King Francis I. Six riders sent to Hattstatt's castle to confiscate his documents were driven away by the soldier left behind in the castle [...] with gunfire. This soldier then burned the documents. Hattstatt is therefore still in possession of his castle.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Something pleasant: The people of Colmar have dismantled part of the house of the abbot [Johannes von Lienzingen] exiled from Maulbronn (for whose maintenance they cared for a long time) to fortify the city walls. The abbot then sued the city before King Ferdinand I. However, Prior Johannes Hoffmeister took over their defense and rode with one of the councilors [...] to Ferdinand. Thus, the Papists destroy each other!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Landgrave Philip of Hesse is arming in Kassel. Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony has taken Leipzig, killed all the soldiers in the city, and allowed it to be plundered. He is now moving with a strong troop to Silesia. Part of his army has invaded the land of Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. The cunning margrave, although he has the Gospel proclaimed in his land, was with the Emperor last summer. The Elector has also conquered the territory of Count [Friedrich Magnus von Solms-Laubach or Reinhard] von Solms.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Anna, Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, the wife of Ferdinand, has died. Gast learned this from the messenger [...] who brings a letter [on behalf of the king] asking the [four Protestant] cities [of the Confederation] to hold mourning services for the deceased.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The people of Strasbourg are arming themselves with weapons and prayer to resist the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The Jews in Frankfurt have placed the imperial eagle on their doorsteps so that no harm comes to them. They are granted more freedoms than the Christians!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] This in brief, so that Gast cannot be accused of having forgotten his agreement with Bullinger. He has commissioned Myconius to write the letters, as he enjoys writing and is better informed than he, who learns the news from the people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Theodor Bibliander and the other colleagues should also be informed about the content of this letter. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. in domino. You want me to write about what is happening in Lower Germany. Partly, the events are unknown because they occur so far away, and partly they are full of nonsense. I know this, but it is ridiculous, yet an indication of a guilty conscience: There is a priest who recently preached in Bergheim with these words: "Let us praise the Lord, who gave victory to the Emperor, for if the Lutherans had prevailed, it would have gone badly for us poor priests and the poor Jews, as no people on earth have ever experienced! But God does not abandon His own. You Jews pray to your God, and we will pray to ours. Then we will continue to have good fortune."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Receive briefly what is happening in Frankfurt, for I have learned this from a citizen of Frankfurt: There are still 5 companies of soldiers there. They pay for what they eat and drink. They have all the power in the city. A monk came. He approached the soldiers to allow him to hold mass. This was brought to the council in Frankfurt. This was denied to him. And the friendly monk had to leave again with his mass. No one has taken anything from anyone, nor does anyone take anything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It is also said that the Emperor has sent about 200 wagons to Worms. He wants to hold an Imperial Diet there. How things are going in Saxony, Myconius will write.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Junker Claus von Hattstatt, an honorable warrior, about whom I wrote recently, is still imprisoned in Ensisheim Castle. He has irons on his feet and arms. It is believed he will lose his head. 1. Article: He did not want to serve the Emperor in the campaign. 2. He let his troops go to Strasbourg, also took on soldiers for the Landgrave. 3. They have in the campaign, he wanted to take on soldiers for the French. They sent out 6 horses with the intention of retrieving all his letters in his castle; but they could not achieve this. The Junker had a well-armed warrior with him (himself) for a long time; left him in the castle. This one held the castle against the 6 riders and several peasants, drove them away with artillery, burned the letters, and thus still holds the castle.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Furthermore, this pleases me: The people of Colmar have long kept the abbot of Maulbronn in his misery, who has a house in Colmar. They took something from him, from which they made a bulwark. The abbot sued them before Ferdinand. Against him stands the prior Hoffmeister, Ferdinand's preacher. He rides to the king with one of the councilors to achieve against the abbot. Thus, the Papists should destroy the Papists! One devil should resist the other, so that everything goes to ruin!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Item, the Landgrave lies in Kassel. He is in great preparation. Duke Hans, the elector, has won Leipzig with a storm, killed all the soldiers in it, and also plundered the city. He is supposed to move to Silesia with a troop, doing great damage there. With the other troop, he is in the land of Duke Albrecht of Brandenburg, taking everything from him. This one was with the Emperor in the summer: A treacherous man, even if he allows the preaching of the Gospel in his lands. He has also taken the land of the Count of Solms.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The wife of Ferdinand, Queen of Hungary, has died. I heard this from the messenger himself, who carries letters to the cities, to organize honorable funerals.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The people of Strasbourg are preparing to resist the Emperor with arms and constant prayers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Jews in Frankfurt have placed an eagle on their doors, so that no one brings them harm. They have more freedom than the remaining Christians!</p>

      <p>This I wanted to tell you briefly, so that you do not accuse me of negligence or forgetfulness of the agreement you made with me. I have imposed this burden of writing on Myconius, who gladly writes and has more certain information than I, who usually fish out common news from the people. February 12, 1547.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>May you wish to communicate this to Bibliander and the other brothers, whom I wish to be well in the Lord for many years. You know the hand.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned master, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my beloved master. Zurich.</p>
