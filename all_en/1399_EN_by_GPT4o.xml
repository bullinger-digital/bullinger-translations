      <p>Greetings. Today I finally received your letter written on August 28.</p>
      <p>The people of Lucerne are requesting a meeting to be convened, but they do not indicate the reasons; it is scheduled for the 27th of this month. Many suspect that they will act on the instigation of the Pope and the Emperor; but we shall hear. We will overcome all evil with true faith, prayers, and steadfastness. I do not hear a word about the council. The war in Italy is escalating; the Pope is furiously angry with the French; for the affairs of the French are going well. The Turkish fleet is said to have sailed to Africa; it is said that 60,000 Turkish horses have come to Pannonia. Certainly, some garrisons have been sent to Austria. Thus, everything is arranged in such a way that I gather many evils are threatening our necks. The Lord will not abandon those who fight with true faith. In this, farewell forever; I could not write more, overwhelmed by the crowd of people coming and going. The Emperor is entirely focused on eradicating the doctrine of the Gospel; he is already fighting with exile, soon he will fight with the sword, etc. Farewell again. Zurich, September 13, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, faithful leader of the Basel church, venerable lord and dearest brother. Basel.</p>
