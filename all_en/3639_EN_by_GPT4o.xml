      <p>Greetings. I could not refrain, dear and kind sir and godfather, from writing to you further about our mutual correspondence, concerning our request regarding the matters of Davos. Firstly, I intended to send you the letter they wrote to both of us, so that you might fully understand the desires and requests of the people of Davos. My request to you is to send it back to me in due time, especially to me; it has its reasons. You should know that this matter is very difficult for me.</p>
      <p>The good honorable people place all the responsibility on us; but you, kind sir, can well understand the difficulties in this matter with your wisdom. For it is a distant, difficult journey, and Davos is a large wilderness, with little summer. Moreover, although the leaders of the Rhaetians are sensible, it is to be assumed that the rest of the people are rough and wild. It might easily happen that someone appointed there would receive little thanks from you or me, although I assure the honorable people of all modesty.</p>
      <p>I would have liked it if an honorable community had written themselves, but I did not let it be known, so that if some others were present, like Dr. Glastius, etc., who are otherwise constantly seeking, you might then promote one of them; one would not have to consider an authority here. However, it is very important to me that if someone is sent, he should have the name of being sent from the city of Zurich, and if he does not behave appropriately, it would be a concern that it would be very detrimental to all our churches, especially to me, and if they were later advised to let unsuitable persons travel, and to improve the salaries so that one might obtain honorable men, it would not be more effective with them than with those who would not let themselves be advised by our council. For the people of Davos have so far given no more than at most 100 florins; they have made the improvement because they think they will sooner get one with whom they are provided. One must not consider his own, but the benefit of the church, with godliness and modesty one could accomplish much good. It seemed to me that it would be best if you sent us one, and before you take action with him now, you write to us beforehand or to me alone, as it seems good to you, but in German, what our request on behalf of the people of Davos could achieve with you, what also troubled you in this matter, and if someone were to come and let himself be heard preaching twice, whether he might receive something for his sustenance, and what else would need to be considered in this matter. I would then read this letter to the foremost of the community.</p>
      <p>I would then report back to you on all matters; you would know how to proceed accordingly. For, as you know, the custom in these lands is that they accept no one unless they have first heard him preach themselves.</p>
      <p>It occurred to me that young master Hüßly might still be available. Josue Vinslerus also does not have such a large salary, so I think he would gladly accept it. The Spaniard and his kind do not fit into this land.</p>
      <p>If there is anything further that concerns you, you can write it to me before you take any action. I have written all this to you, as my kind sir and father, in good trustful opinion, and I assure you that you will understand it in the best way; for you are not bound by my writing, you can act more or less as you find good. However, my friendly request to you is that you let us have an answer as soon as you can. With this, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur, July 4, 1558.</p>
      <p>Fabricius, your willing servant.</p>
      <p>We have no certain news at the moment.</p>
      <p>There is a strong rumor that the people of Lucerne have some uprising and factions in their city concerning matters of faith. Others, namely Aurelius Scytarcha, say that the Florentine has taken the city due to the uprising. But I can affirm nothing certain.</p>
      <p>With us, it is as follows: The legate has accepted three companies, but the land is not burdened by it, indeed, beyond that, it is advised against doing anything without the permission of the lands. However, the custom is that if one wants to have soldiers, one must first call the three leaders, a mayor from Chur, a landammann from Davos, a land judge from the Upper League; these should then call a league day. But the legate could not accomplish this with 600 crowns; therefore, he knew well that the league lords would not have allowed him three companies. They would rather have their own regiment as in previous years.</p>
      <p>This gives many offices; but this is not convenient for the king. They have not had or barely had half the soldiers this year.</p>
      <p>Young master Hercules von Salis has intervened with the legate, by whose judgment everything was done; for his son is one of the three leaders. The others of the French faction, from whom the morsel was snatched from their jaws, are almost furious; the legate has so appeased them by giving them hope of a regiment. Meanwhile, it has been forbidden in the land, under penalty of life, honor, and property, and as high as one has to lose, that no one should bring in any foreign lord, yet with the addition "until further notice." If I had not already been informed of all matters from the innermost chambers, I might have thought they were doing it with good intentions; but they do it only because he does not want to take as much as they would like to bind him. If they had let it go like this now, the new legate would not have known who the leaders were, whom he must have in honor; also, he would have thought it stood as with Hercules, etc. That is the opinion among each other.</p>
      <p>Hercules a Salice sits in Cläven, is a subject, not a countryman; therefore, he must endure it even better.</p>
      <p>It would be too long to narrate how everything happened; consul Tscharner knows best of all. You might ask where the leaders are.</p>
      <p>They are lying in Ragatz, where they take on soldiers on the Swiss ground, etc. I would take two florins and hold harmless all those who move further away over this prohibition.</p>
      <p>This is our policy.</p>
      <p>Keep this to yourself.</p>
