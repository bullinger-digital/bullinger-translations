      <p>Greetings. You will hear from him directly what this request is about. I pray that you will be willing to give your attention. We must, by duty, assist our members to the best of our ability, and we must, by duty, sometimes advise the neighboring king, with whom we have had much business. When we do this, we must do it not casually or perfunctorily, but in the presence of the Lord. Therefore, you will give your attention, if it can be done, to send a delegation with letters. For private matters and those concerning money, delegations are often sent; in such a great matter, at such an opportune time, shall we not send one? I know what you fear, that we might be obliged to the king at this time. There is no danger; for what we do is not so much to ask as to advise, and we ask not so much for ourselves as for his citizens, indeed not so much for ourselves as for him, what we demand. Nor is it a great favor to recommend some common matter with letters; what is required of us here is something else, that we should not be ashamed to take up the cause of the innocent before kings and princes, before tyrants. If we achieve nothing, at least we have fulfilled our duty, and his blood cannot be demanded from our hands. I wanted to ask you these few things, the rest you will learn from the one who bears this letter.</p>
      <p>I wish you, most sincere heart, my dearest friend, to be very well in the Lord Christ. Amen. Greet all the brothers diligently.</p>
      <p>Your Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his patron. Zurich.</p>
