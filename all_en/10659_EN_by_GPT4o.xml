    <p xml:id="regest1">Admire his work ethic and urge him to conserve his strength. That some preachers are despised not without reason is shown by the example of Konrad [Hermann], who causes offense with his sermons. Peter Im Haag has only a few friends left. Returns the copy of [No. 562]. Peter Kunz has been appointed as the successor of Franz [Kolb]. Haller has concealed his hernia for too long. Requests to have the commentary sent to him by Bullinger to be charged to [Froschauer]. Has little hope for the planned defense against the Lutherans. Christoph [Froschauer?] has just arrived. The successor of the deceased Venner Georg Schöni will be Peter Im Haag.</p>

      <p>S. I received your letter, which was all the more welcome for its length, through the messenger of your city. Since you have satisfied me in all respects, I have nothing more to complain about. Continue, as you do, to expand the word and glory of the Lord both by writing and by teaching publicly. I recognize the special gifts of God in you, which I see lacking even in the most learned men of this age. But in the meantime, so that you may serve the churches longer, do not neglect the care of your health and studies, which you have wisely prescribed to others, lest you seem to perish of your own accord. I often think to myself how it is possible for you, occupied with so many lectures, sermons, audiences, reading the letters of others, and completing responses, to also complete those things which are sometimes urgently demanded for the press. Neither the brain nor the eyes nor the whole body and the strength of the mind can endure for long. I can hardly keep up with reading what you provide us with your happiness in explaining the scriptures. How you manage to accomplish everything, I truly do not know. I wish for the whole of Paul to be completed by you, as you have begun, but that you would rest for some time thereafter. I do not doubt that there are those from all the churches who spur you on, even when you are running too fast, so that you are girded for another work as soon as one is barely finished, without any rest in between. But in the meantime, no one relieves you of any labor or helps you as you struggle for all of us.</p>
      <p>Moreover, ministers are not so despised among us, except those who make themselves contemptible even to the good and pious, either by a dissolute life and excessive drinking of wine, or by stubborn contention with the peasants and a certain command under the pretext of faith and religion, or with unheard-of paradoxes, which very often provide the more ignorant people with an occasion for both slander and ridicule. These are most frequent with this Konrad. For he is quick in speaking, excessive in preaching. To give you one example: Recently, speaking to his congregation about the incarnation of Christ, he burst out with these words among other things: "Gott ist katt worden, und kat ist gott" (God has become a cat, and a cat is God). Offended by this, the people of Solothurn have seized upon a great slander: that we have long since rejected the divine virgin and other saints, and now make dung out of God himself. He interpreted the part of the Lord's Prayer "give us this day our daily bread" [Lk 11, 3] as us praying here for the magistrate, that he is our daily bread, and therefore the magistrate should not have such fierce animals as lions and bears for their insignia, but should carry a pretzel in their banner. Thus, through excessive talkativeness, he makes the ministry odious and is too wise in his own learning, and has alienated the magistrate from himself. Furthermore, he is so negligent of domestic affairs that he always struggles with extreme poverty. Otherwise, he is a good man, but he cannot restrain himself from such foolish and vain speeches, even though he has often been admonished by us. In five years, he now has his third church.</p>
      <p>What I wrote about Peter Im Haag, I wrote very modestly. For his affairs are far worse. All the good people are deserting him because no one is wise enough for him, alas, wise and constant, and yet they have experienced all sorts of things in him. He has none or very few who obey him in all things. May the Lord have mercy on him, have mercy on us, and grant that we may walk diligently in his fear.</p>
      <p>I am returning the copy of your letters, which has been faithfully deposited with me until now.</p>
      <p>Peter Kunz has been appointed in place of Franz. I hope he will have a colleague who will vigorously pursue the Lord's business and be agreeable with us.</p>
      <p>As for my fleshy hernia, a very heavy burden, there is no hope. I have kept silent for too long and wanted to conceal it for my whole life, since I felt no pain, but the pain urged me to reveal it to the doctor and others. Zwingli saw it, as did Friczius and Jacob the surgeon, but no one here. But it has progressed to the point that I can no longer hide it. May the Lord grant patience for the remaining portion of my life, and that I may not become entirely useless. For I would rather die than gradually perish from idleness and disease.</p>
      <p>What you sent on Paul is most welcome, provided the printer charges me. For I owe him and others as well, and nothing delays it except that he does not write the calculation of debts.</p>
      <p>I hear from that Konrad I don't know what, but among other things, that you are preparing an apology against the Lutherans. If you are undertaking such a thing, I pray for moderation, lest it incite a new contention. The world has long been persuaded of the truth of the Eucharist, and nothing is to be expected from the adversaries but insults, sneers, and mockery, from the weak offense, from the pious disgust. But why should a pig teach Minerva? Act as you always have.</p>
      <p>When you have finished the letters, send the rest.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother, indeed half of my soul, and commend me to the Lord in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Behold, while I was writing this, waiting for the messenger returning from Geneva - but Christophorus, a most welcome guest, interrupted, who spoke of you, which was uniquely and most pleasing, so that my joy may always be increased and fulfilled.</p>
      <p>In the Royal Field, the patron of studies and students, the tribune of our people, Georg Schöni, has perished. Hagius will succeed him in office, for there is no other. If he does not come to his senses, he will be harmful to both the Christian and civil republic.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell. I will write more shortly.</p>
      <p>26th of July, in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
