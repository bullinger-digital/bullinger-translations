      <p>Greetings. Your letters were delivered to me by Consul Fuchs, who is now absent, because the insolent stubbornness of the peasants has not yet been completely overcome. They very reluctantly acknowledge him, who is ours, as their magistrate, even though they cannot assert themselves into freedom by any right or deed. They never valued the Gospel, and they still receive its doctrine with great contempt, and now they are hardly persuaded to submit to him, who was once a papal priest. Sagend, because they must swear to a priest, are completely rough and uncouth and have tried everything to avoid being forced to submit their stiff-necked necks to this yoke. But it must be. Samuel Witenbach, my neighbor and godfather, went there recently without greeting or informing me at all; upon returning, he never visited me, so I think he is angry with me for some unknown reason, a man who, returning from military service, appears much more arrogant and fierce than before. May the Lord give him a better mind, which would beautifully match his bodily elegance. We greatly regret the situation of his most honorable wife, whom he so disregards.</p>
      <p>Let me know if he has met with you and what matters you discussed with him, what you advised him on, and what you encouraged him to do.</p>
      <p>Fuchs bears the consulship with difficulty and is often found to be vain; but more than enough about these matters through letters.</p>
      <p>Now it is reported to us that the pious people of Lucerne have accepted the great grace shown to them, namely, and wish to clear the land so that no war or any unrest arises because of them. May the dear God, whose is the earth and its fullness, establish dwellings for them somewhere, where they may live most comfortably in the kingdom of his Son. Amen. I truly have no doubt that the measure of these cruel ones will soon be filled, so that they will pay the penalties worthy of the avenging God for the truth they have long despised and violated.</p>
      <p>I neither have nor have seen Sarcerius's book or the published excommunication. But that philologist, who came to us from Calvin, appointed by the people of Lausanne as the minister of the Gospel in the town of Sainte-Marie, explained to me what I wrote to you.</p>
      <p>Now Farellus writes that Georg Major has also been condemned by Sarcerius and that Amsdorf and his followers are raging beyond measure.</p>
      <p>You have read, I have no doubt, Calvin's writing against these restless (not to say something harsher) persecutors of the sacramentarians and enthusiasts, as they call them; it is indeed so approved by me that I am certainly persuaded you would do a great service if you ensure it is printed in many thousands of copies and distributed everywhere as soon as possible. This certainly, unless it makes them a little more reasonable and placated, I see nothing left that could satisfy these hot-headed individuals without compromising the truth, although, even if it achieves nothing with them, this writing seems to bring wonderful light to all those things which, in your consensus, due to brevity, which had to be pursued entirely according to the nature of the argument, could not be written clearly enough, and could be understood even less by many who are a little more sensible.</p>
      <p>Farewell now, my soul, and recognize me as truly and entirely yours perpetually as before, and commend me to the Lord Christ with the patronage of faithful prayers. May your household be well; greet in my words as honorably as you can the most learned and pious men and my always venerable brothers in Christ, Mr. Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, Wolf, Zwingli, Lavater, and the others. Funck, my dearest fellow student, greets you and commends himself to you greatly. December 11, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the man of utmost doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my brother and his venerable and by far most beloved of all.</p>
