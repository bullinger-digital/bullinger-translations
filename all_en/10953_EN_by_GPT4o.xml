    <p xml:id="regest1">Have been informed by their envoys about the Basel meeting [of September 24/25]. Cannot agree to the Wittenberg Concord. Would have preferred if the Upper German cities had approached Luther with a joint delegation, but since the majority of them have already sent statements, they now want to present their doctrine of the Lord's Supper in a separate letter to Luther.</p>

      <p>Our friendly service first, prudent, honorable, wise, especially dear and good friend.</p>
      <p>Our envoys, who were recently with you in Basel, have reported to us what was discussed on that day. Now, as you may know, we have been inclined to sign the articles set in Wittenberg, so that the intended concord may proceed. However, this is burdensome for us for many reasons, especially because the articles set are quite disputable and impure, and in our opinion, not solid enough for a lasting concord to be established upon them. And although we are considered very fruitful in promoting a lasting and correct agreement, that the honorable cities together sent a delegation to Doctor Luther, who discussed with him orally, also informed him of our faith, doctrine, and practice regarding this article of the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, and asked him to be satisfied with it and with the report he had previously received from the preachers of these cities in Wittenberg, etc., yet the majority of these Upper German cities have already advanced their responses, therefore this our opinion cannot proceed, and we are also caused and willing to send our response to Doctor Luther. Since it is distant for us to give a response to the set articles with clear words or with some explanation of them, we will write him a clear report of what and how this article has been taught and held by us until now, so that he may have a solid and thorough instruction, confident that he will take good pleasure in it. We did not want to withhold this from you at the next departure of good and friendly opinion, with the offer to show you, where we can, all love, friendship, and neighborly service.</p>
      <p>Given on November 9th, in the year etc. 36.</p>
      <p>Mayor and council of the city of Konstanz.</p>
      <p>To the prudent, honorable, and wise N., the envoys of the confederate cities, now assembled in Basel, our especially dear and good friends.</p>
