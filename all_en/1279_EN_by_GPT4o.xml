      <p>S. I am sending you my response, however it may be, to that question you know of; I ask you to send it back, for I did not have time to write it out completely. Five days ago, I thought I had someone who would go there from here; but he changed his mind and went elsewhere. I am sending you news about the Emperor, which I received today from a certain distinguished friend.</p>
      <p>A certain excellent painter from Augsburg was with me, who frequently approaches the Emperor freely, because Charles is accustomed to take much pleasure in his work and artistry. He most steadfastly and repeatedly asserts that it is in no way possible for him to live beyond one or two months; which makes what this friend writes to me seem more likely.</p>
      <p>Philip is delaying longer than planned in Augsburg, because it is thought that his father is now at death's door. May the Lord graciously transfer him from the Roman to the heavenly kingdom, which he will have done with the good grace of all good people! Truly in God a good, joyful Ascension Day! I would not want the devil to take him away.</p>
      <p>Pray diligently for us. Here is a young man beyond my expectation, who is in a great hurry. I gave the letters you sent through that painter to our Welser. Farewell again and again. May 11, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
