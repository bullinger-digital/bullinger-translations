      <p>S. D. I write nothing these days, Myconius, most esteemed lord and brother in Christ, because I have nothing worthy of you, although I think I wrote to you last; for I do not know if you have responded. But it does not matter; I do not doubt that you will respond in due time and place. Now, the reason I write this is: Mr. Laelius, very well known to you and an excellent man, asks me to write to you on behalf of Mr. Pietro Paolo Vergerio, formerly the bishop of Istria, who, traveling to you in Basel, complained that he knows no one there nor has anyone with whom he can converse familiarly, and therefore asks that one of us recommend him to you. I have indeed never seen nor known the man; however, I hear that he is pious, learned, and has propagated the kingdom of Christ in Italy; I know that such men do not need a recommendation, especially with you; for you willingly receive, help, and embrace good and holy men. They tell me he has left Egypt and is heading to the promised land, has left a rich bishopric and desires to serve Christ. It is said he has written some things against the Antichrist in the Italian language; but you will learn this better from him. You will easily understand what kind of man he is from a friendly conversation or discussion.</p>
      <p>He would have come down to you through Zürich, if the plague had not begun to rage somewhat among us. We stand ready and willingly follow those whom the Lord has called, although it has not yet attacked us severely.</p>
      <p>I wanted you to know this about Mr. Bishop; please ensure that he feels the spirit of humanity and brotherhood in you. Farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zürich, November 3, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, most vigilant bishop of the church of Basel, his dearest brother in Christ. Basel.</p>
