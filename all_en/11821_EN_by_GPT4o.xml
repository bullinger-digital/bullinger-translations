    <p xml:id="regest1">Paid for the books [Vesalius' "Fabrica" and "Epitome"] with the money sent by Bullinger and thanks him for gifting him the gulden owed for the Bible, but wishes to show his gratitude. Requests the return of the news, which Bullinger can also share with his colleagues and Vadian. Report from Mainz about the deployment of imperial troops against J端lich; the Protestant envoys follow the Emperor, who did not want to receive them, and who cannot move directly to Brabant due to the blockade of the Rhine by Duke [Wilhelm] of J端lich; Breda, which belongs to Count [Renatus] of Nassau, was captured [by the Emperor's opponents]; the Protestant princes, including Landgrave [Philipp], are preparing for war. Gast wants to arrange the illustrations [for Vesalius' "Epitome"] for Bullinger. Cellarius [Martin Borrhaus], who is seeking a theological professorship, has presented theses; Bullinger should have them sent by Myconius for evaluation; especially [Wolfgang Wissenburg] is dissatisfied. Bullinger was probably too busy to address the issue of the begging students. [Postscript:] Two Frenchmen [Jacques Reynaud and Philibert...], who came here for the sake of the Gospel, have fallen into the hands of the imperial forces and are being held in Breisach; Strasbourg and Basel are working for their release.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, most learned and kind Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I received the money you sent and paid for the books we purchased for you. I am grateful that you do not wish for me to give the gold coin I owe you for the biblical work to the booksellers, but under the condition that I may repay it at a later opportunity; for I do not wish to trouble you in this matter or burden you more than necessary.</p>
      <p>If you have already read the news I sent and shared it with the other brothers, please return it; you may also share it with Mr. Vadian.</p>
      <p>Someone from Mainz also wrote to me with these words about the Emperor's troops: "Two large cannons of the Emperor have burst, which he had fired. He has traveled on many ships up the Rhine towards Mainz, with grain, flour, oxen, pickaxes, and entrenchment baskets, indeed with all war equipment to besiege and storm, with the intention of opening up the J端lich territories. He did not want to hear the protesting envoys at the castle in Mainz and has traveled away; they are still following him. He wanted to go down the Rhine with his equipment and ships. What happened? The Duke of J端lich has blocked the Rhine near Bonn, the episcopal city, where he has castles in a monastery on the Rhine with three blockhouses in front, where the Rhine flows, and two behind; thus he awaited the Emperor. For the Emperor thought he could easily go down the Rhine into Brabant; that failed him. He is now moving back up the Moselle into Luxembourg territory; for the Duke has also cut down the Westerwald, so he cannot pass through; he must make a wide detour into Brabant at great expense, transporting all his munitions by horse and wagon. Breda, the city and castle, has been captured, which belongs to the Count of Nassau, who wanted to protect the Utrecht bishopric and lost it. I know nothing further except that all the Protestant princes are arming themselves.</p>
      <p>The Landgrave has called up his troops; no one knows what he intends. May God grant us peace."</p>
      <p>I will send you these two figures arranged and assembled by the next messenger; for no one can easily attach them to the human body unless they have first seen their form.</p>
      <p>Cellarius has proposed certain articles for our examination; for he is seeking a theological lecture. Write to Myconius to send them to you and seek your judgment. Our people dislike the man, especially Lupus; the doctor fears that this doctor will be appointed and that our people will act rashly. He is indeed a learned and pious man.</p>
      <p>It is strange that you have not replied about the begging students; but I attribute that to your business.</p>
      <p>On St. Bartholomew's Day, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>Two Frenchmen, most learned men, have been captured by the imperial forces, led by a certain nobleman who followed them from Strasbourg, and have been taken to Breisach where they are held in chains. What will be done with them, the Lord knows. They came to us from France for the sake of the Gospel and are now captured for the Gospel. The Lord is marvelous in His works. The Senate of Strasbourg and ours are working diligently for their release, with added threats. August 16.</p>
