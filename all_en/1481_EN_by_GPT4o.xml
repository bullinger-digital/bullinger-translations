      <p>Greetings. We hear nothing here about the Council of Trent, for it is not as much cared for by our people as we hear it is there. On the 25th of November, there will be a session, as we have learned from the ministers of our bishop, who himself also went there after returning from Rome to his homeland, but without consulting our people. Vergerius sent us two documents to be delivered to you about the acts of that council; we are therefore sending them to you here along with other letters from the same man. Remembering your prayers, we wrote to a certain church for that brother from Augsburg at this fair; when we receive the response, which we hope will be given to us as we expect, we will send it to you; we will not forget. Everything here is quite expensive; however, in the region of Etschland, there is a greater scarcity.</p>
      <p>For the Spanish soldiers, who passed through there, consumed everything partly and partly took it away with them in many wagons.</p>
      <p>Ponticella will write to you about the school. The commissioners have pacified him and ordered him to be diligent; however, he again requested a discharge and release. We hear no one who desires or says the school should be abolished, although there are those who would prefer everything to be better managed. Comander, your perpetual friend, sends you many greetings. From Chur, on the 23rd of November, 1551. If there is anything that would be worthwhile for us to know or that you wish to command, write. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most esteemed man of the world.</p>
      <p>Your Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and in every way learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
