    <p xml:id="regest1">Even Christ himself testified to how necessary the unity of believers is; without the great solidarity of the [Neuchâtel] pastors and the neighboring churches, their church could not have withstood the attack of Satan. Through their letter [No. 1585], the people of Zurich showed the people of Neuchâtel the way to successfully defend against the enemy. Thanks to their reminder of the duties of each [estate], Farel found the strength to persevere, after he had wished to avoid the calling to this office during his stay in Basel [in the summer of 1538]. Without their encouragement, he would have despaired; he feels deeply obliged to them for their support. At the request of Calvin, Viret, and the Geneva Council, he visited the Geneva church, which is being rebuilt with great effort by Viret and Calvin. A withdrawal of Viret would endanger the entire work, which is also of great importance for France; to prevent this, the Zurich pastors should influence the Bernese church. Together with the [Zurich] council, they should work towards overcoming the discord [between Bern and Geneva], for which both Viret and Calvin, as well as he himself, have already made efforts. A church as significant as that of Geneva is particularly challenged by Satan, as was the case in Corinth; may Christ grant that all members contribute to the edification of the body [Eph 4, 16]. Greetings, also to Mayor [Diethelm Röist] and the council.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God. How necessary is peace and holy union in the church of faithful believers in Christ Jesus, as He Himself is a copious witness, while He so earnestly commends it to His followers and so ardently requests it from the Father as He prepares to depart to Him. Who today does not experience the peril of this matter? If even the least of those who minister here had been separated from the others, it would have been entirely over for this church: if any of the neighboring churches that had given their name to Christ had been separated, we would have perished, as the matter itself cries out. For if, after all efforts, Satan could barely be prevented, so agitated and raging with long and deeply pressed anger, having gathered innumerable forces which he believed to be invincible, what if those things which the Lord gave us for the destruction of Satan had been turned against us? To pass over others who labored with you, O brothers, with utmost piety, integrity, and doctrine, you are rightly to be observed by us, you intervened at the very moment, lest this church be utterly overthrown, addressing everything that pertained to the matter most precisely. What could be more complete than your letters? What did you omit to support, fortify, and raise up in the camps of the Lord, so that no entrance would be open to the enemy? You surveyed all the places by which Satan might pave a way for himself into the flock of Christ: you assigned each one their station in proper order, and what each should do, so that the enemy could easily withstand the attack without harm and drive the enemy away. Again, you made the enemy's camps so penetrable to the pious, having scattered all of Satan's fortifications through the solid truth of God, you so exposed the enemies that they are compelled to either offer a herb or present their throat without any trouble. We all experienced the marvelous power of our God in your letters, and the efficacy of the word from which they were taken. Each one, admonished of their duty, understood what and with what spirit they should act, and in what they did not sufficiently respond to their calling.</p>
      <p>Among whom I openly testify that so much has been added to me, that having detested my own sloth (to pass over other things I heard, groaning and lamenting myself) because I was so far from the one you depict, that I no longer thought of seeking a distant retreat, as before, while I indignantly bore that I had been cast again into these straits by pious brothers, especially by fellow ministers, to which, while I was in Basel, I implored them not to throw me back, predicting to them then all these things would come, so that I might live a private life in letters (from which this calling almost entirely diverted me), and no longer be driven away, not by the papists and those who detest the gospel, which would be light, but, which is most grievous, by those who profess the gospel. But I was so affected by your admonition that I resolved to endure with greater strength of mind, having invoked the Lord, that He might grant me those things which you partly write are present in me, measuring myself from you, and which you admonish me to perform. If, for this grace which the Lord used in me and the fellow ministers, through your absolute integrity, I had been neglected by you, as many things I committed against the Lord deserve, not to mention far graver things, what would have happened to me, miserable? The ruin of this church burned me far more than if all my bones were crushed by a thousand wheels, and I were torn apart above all evildoers. If I had sensed you, as some are reported to have said: It is over with Farel's ministry, he is now entirely confused, utterly fallen never to rise again, now he pays the penalty for not rightly administering his office, and many such things, which those who always sought themselves under the shadow of the gospel, and never anything of Christ, rejoicingly said: if, I say, instead of the kind consolation of our God through you, I had heard those things, how utterly I would have perished. But the Lord was more powerful in you to raise and strengthen me, than Satan and all his were to cast down and weaken. If Christ commands us to do good to our enemies and to love them, what does He not want me to do for such dear friends, indeed fathers in the Lord, who so earnestly supported me lest I perish. Therefore, you are rightly to be honored by me and pursued with every service. But since strength is lacking, and I do not sufficiently know what I desire to perform in the Lord, accept my vow: which I wish I could someday prove to you for the glory of Christ. But while I can do nothing else, I earnestly implore Christ with all my heart to repay you a worthy reward for such great labors, and to preserve you and the church entrusted to you, and to heap upon you greater graces and gifts for the edification and salvation of all.</p>
      <p>After the disturbances here were finally settled, which Calvin and Viret previously urged, and also with much effort the Geneva council, that I should go to Geneva and prepare myself for this, they finally accomplished it with great insistence. I came and saw no ordinary building erected there by the work of Viret, to which not a little was added by the arrival and labor of Calvin. But it is not so easy for them to build and raise such a work, as it was easy for others to demolish. And although Satan tried everything to scatter and destroy, yet he could not entirely: for there were always those left who did not bow their knees to Baal, nor could they be drawn to approve that insane way of living in such license and debauchery and drunkenness, in which the word of the Lord was not sufficiently spoken by those who should have. Not to mention what I heard was praised. Thus now not everything can be rebuilt and restored again, without the ruins moving to tears those who once saw standing what now almost lies in ruins. O how much better it would have been if such impure destroyers of the church had never been born, who do not consider with how much fear one must conduct oneself in the work of the Lord, and how diligently one must see that nothing of the holy building is torn down. How many calamities did that wicked Dathan bring upon himself, his own, and the people of the Lord with his companions? Therefore, it is not surprising if Viret had to undergo great labor to bring the people back to the way: in which he labored alone before the arrival of Calvin, and that with great fruit. And now if Calvin and Viret have to labor beyond their strength, so that the form of the church may be restored by which it can be preserved through Christ, and access is not so easily open to the wicked, in which matter they alone are engaged, I wish there were none who, instead of the help they ought to bring, do not hinder such pious efforts. To this labor is added the fear that Viret may be taken away from there, with whom removed, it will immediately be over with Calvin, and thus that church will utterly collapse. For, to confess openly, today I know no others to whom such a burden can be imposed, nor who can even reflect the shadow of these. Geneva has not deserved so well of me that I should wish it more consulted than another. But Christ compels me who chose it, to illustrate His name in it, through the great multitude of believers that is there: to which is added the greatest edification of all France, while that church stands, as incredible ruin follows while it falls and is desolated. To pass over others. Therefore, O truly Christ-loving hearts, just as you once labored for that church, and recently so strenuously for this one, so strive in this that what has already begun there, and which now gives much hope, and rises up, may be completed, in this with such pious and distinguished servants of Christ enduring, Calvin and Viret, and when the Lord has joined these, pray, I beseech you, that they may not be separated for any reason, but that they may always proceed more and more, as they are truly one, to render all there one in Christ. And with the grace and authority you have with the Bernese church, ensure that this is done. We have great hope in the pastors with whom your authority is not slight, which may Christ grant you to use holily in this cause, and also in others that contribute to the edification of the churches: in which I fear some are carried away with misguided zeal, dragging themselves with others into ruin. The words of Christ are well known, that He did not come to destroy but to save, with whom whoever does not gather scatters. Indeed, those whom the Lord has entrusted to us and joined to us, we must labor to preserve and be one with us, candidly before God, angels, and men, not with a double heart, not with much anger pressed within, which immediately exerts itself where a crack opens, by which we can resist holy efforts, having no regard for God or the church. O how evil it is to seek the applause of the people. But what? We do not cultivate fields here without thorns, which the Lord may entirely uproot from the hearts of all.</p>
      <p>The other thing I would like to beseech you to take care of, and that this magistrate also takes care of through the Lord, namely that pernicious and pestilent discord, than which nothing less befits those contending, who from the union and covenant struck between them, and the things the Lord has done in that bond, ought to be so much one, and to live in such holy concord and true peace, that none living today are more bound, if indeed so much has been added to both, that by this one reason these should yield far more to those and vice versa, than is the matter of contention. For what do they not owe each other for Christ, who now by contending are at variance? Where now is what Christ so greatly desires, namely that we love our enemies and yield the cloak to the one taking the tunic? Certainly, He does not want anyone to retaliate with insult. Here we see enough what the condition of men is, and how truly the Lord complains through the prophet, that He has brought up and made great sons who are finally despised by them, while they do not obey the paternal commands. How Viret and Calvin labor here with the Genevans, Christ knows. I do not think I ever made a greater effort with the Genevans after the doctrine of faith, than that concord, which I so ardently desired, that it would be enough for me even today, if it could be established in some firm way. What response I received is not worth mentioning. It must be seen that through admonitions and exhortations each one does their duty, having invoked the Lord, who may scatter and destroy Satan, the author of discord, and may He grant that we all see the churches fully concordant, indeed the whole world under the Prince of Peace worshiping the Father in spirit and truth, and united in true peace and perfect love. While we seek this desiring, let us strive to adorn the churches with all our might, and especially those from which the glory of Christ can be made more illustrious, which Satan is most accustomed to attack, as is that of Geneva, which above all those I know today that enemy has attacked and almost conquered. In which I seem to see that after the pure doctrine of Christ was delivered, what happened in Corinth, besides other things that concern the republic. May the Lord Jesus, who acquired the churches with His own blood, grant that all may be led by His Spirit, by which each may assist and be present to the other, as Christian union and that bond of the Spirit of Christ demands, and in each church all members may diligently and orderly perform their duty for the edification and preservation of the whole body.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent and learned brothers. Greet most dutifully the truly God-fearing consul and that pious council. The brothers who are here greet you in the Lord. Neuchâtel, April 19, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted in the Lord, G. Farel.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished pastors and teachers of the notable church of Zurich, men to be revered for their utmost faith, piety, and doctrine, in Zurich.</p>
