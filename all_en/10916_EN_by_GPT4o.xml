    <p xml:id="regest1">Is ready for a meeting and asks him to put aside his mistrust towards Bucer. Does not understand why the Bernese make decisions related to the [Eucharistic] Concord without consultation and suspect [the people of Basel] of wanting to deviate from the common confession; urges unity. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Regarding the meeting you mentioned, I am agreeable. Just see to it that you bring a more favorable attitude towards Bucer and carry less suspicion with you, which greatly hinders these matters. However, I have no doubt about your most sincere disposition, my dear Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Therefore, wherever you wish to meet, I will be there with great enthusiasm. If only the people of Bern had a greater desire for harmony! Why is there such a need to decide and agitate about concord without us, as if we wanted to depart from the accepted confession? But these things are now in vain. Make an effort so that we may truly unite in the Lord with our spirits, which has always been the greatest difficulty and, unless I am mistaken, will always be. Our matters do not differ much, if there is not always something hostile in our spirits. Let us therefore truly pray to the Father in heaven, that He may wish to unite us wholeheartedly and to reconcile the scattered and conflicting members. O Lord</p>
      <p>Christ, grant us that one heart at last, at least to your children, so that the name of the gospel may not be ill-spoken among our enemies because of us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your brother in Christ, Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>Greet Theodor and all the brothers. Farewell in the Lord, all of you.</p>
      <p>To Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
