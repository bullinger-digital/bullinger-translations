    <p xml:id="regest1">Engaged in conversations with [Bonifacius] Amerbach, Wolf[gang Wissenburg], and Berus [Oswald Bär] without success in seeking support for [Italian religious refugees]. While he was writing this, Amerbach came, and shortly thereafter [Johann] Bebel with [Peter] Martyr [Vermigli] and [Paulus Lacisius] came to him; following the conversation, the Italians were temporarily housed in the Augustinian College. An unnamed person expressed surprise that [the Basel Council] does not hesitate to oppose Luther and Philipp [Melanchthon] with its stance on the Quran edition; Myconius agrees with [Juan Luis] Vives that the Quran reveals itself through its internal contradictions and therefore - just like the papal decrees before - should be brought to light, so that in Austria and elsewhere the legal order and religion of the Turks can no longer be trivialized. The story [of the disgraceful act] of the Bishop of Constance [Johann von Weeze] should be published; this is also the opinion of [Ludwig] von Reischach, who, in light of the news shared by Vadian, expressed hope for the support of the fight against the Tatars by the Grand Master [Albrecht of Prussia]. [Sultan Suleiman I.] is said to have promised King [Francis I.] conversion to Christianity and the submission of the Emperor [Charles V.] in the event of his son's healing by [French] doctors. A student from Valais coming from Paris reported the arrival of Turkish galleys in France. Rumors of betrayal in Venice were already heard before the Italian [refugees] reported more details about it. There is no further news about the imperial army confronting the French king in the Netherlands. Myconius has acknowledged Theodor [Bibliander] and stands by his previous statement; regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings. As much as I rejoice that the gospel of Christ spreads its strength far and wide, I am equally saddened that we cannot extend a helping hand to the pious and worthy men who suffer persecution for the name of Christ when they seek refuge with us.</p>
      <p>You have sent learned and good men, as I believe; but whether we can assist them as they deserve, I do not yet know. We are indeed working, but whether we will achieve anything is uncertain. I have spoken with Amorbach (Bonifacius Amerbach), to whom Pellicanus wrote; he, being kind, replied calmly that he would intercede to the best of his ability. I also spoke with Dr. Wolf (Wolfgang Wissenburg). "What do you think should be done?" he asked. "You know how alms are burdensome for the poor." I mentioned the Greek lectures; he remained silent. Berus (Oswald Bär), to whom Pellicanus similarly wrote, recommended them to me as theologians. And unless I had added a new stimulus, he had decided to remain silent after persuading himself that he had done his duty with me.</p>
      <p>While I was writing this, Mr. Amorbach came to my house solely because of the Italians, and just as he was preparing to leave, Bebel (Johann Bebel) entered along with Martyr (Peter Martyr Vermigli) and his companion (Paulus Lacisius). After the conversation, we led them to the Augustinian College to arrange accommodation and sustenance, so they would not be forced to bear such expenses in the inn, namely a Basel pound per day, until we could arrange everything more favorably or know that there was no source of support.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we do not neglect our due diligence. Someone writes to me about the Quran: "Since your Luther and Philipp (Melanchthon) defer somewhat, I am surprised they are not afraid that they will defend their decision to publish the Quran against them." We will see what will happen; for we too are surprised that persons have prevailed more than the most truthful causes. I often repeat what Vives (Juan Luis Vives) left in his book 4 on the truth of the Christian faith against the sect of Muhammad. "They are persuaded by things," he says, "that can be refuted by mere narration; for it crushes and breaks itself, nor do we fight against it as much as it does against itself," etc. And indeed, the matter stands thus; there are so many falsehoods, so many absurdities, so many contradictions, foolish and impious, that I cannot sufficiently marvel at how it could have happened that such a large part of the world could have been captivated by them. But I rest, since the contempt of the evangelical truth, which was once mercifully given to those regions as it is to us today, occurs to me. It also adds that they have kept that unfortunate law so secretly; hence it has happened, as we see in the papacy.</p>
      <p>For as long as the papal decrees were not brought to the light of the gospel, they lost everything they touched. But after they came to the eyes of men who received sight from the truth of the Lord, they appeared as foul, cruel, and impious as they are. Is not the same reasoning applicable to the Quran? There are those who try to induce the Austrians and some others to believe that there is a great cult of justice among the Turks and that their religion is not as devoid of truth as is usually said. Who then, I ask by the Lord, would say that such foolish and impious knowledge is not needed? But I speak more than is permitted. Therefore, I cease.</p>
      <p>Many good men are of the opinion that the delightful story about the Bishop of Constance (Johann von Weeze) should be completed and published. And indeed, it is delightful when you consider the person widely known, suspected, revered, and in whom even the canons of Constance placed such hope that they thought they were fully provided for through him. Mr. von Reischach (Ludwig von Reischach) is exceedingly pleased; only this displeases him, that it is not known by all, whether good or bad. He also likes what you wrote from Vadian; for he hopes that the great commendator from Prussia (Albrecht of Prussia) has also added something against the Tatars with his own forces as their perpetual enemy.</p>
      <p>There is no news except that ridiculous one from Paris. They excuse there that the king admitted the son of the Turk (Sultan Suleiman I.) with a large retinue. For, they say, he suffered from a fistula here, and when the king heard this, he promised the Turk health through his doctors. So the Turk sent his son with these words: "If my son is restored, I swear to you that I will immediately become a Christian with my entire empire and that I will give you the emperor (Charles V.) seized by the hair into your hand, so that you may deal with him as you please." Laugh, if you like.</p>
      <p>And that from Paris is from Vallesiano, who studied there, narrating: This conversation is on everyone's lips in Paris that thirty galleys (Galeeren), as they call them, of the Turks have landed on the French coast for the king's use, wherever he may need them.</p>
      <p>There was a rumor here about the betrayal that the Frenchman (Francis I.) instituted through his envoys in Venice, but it was very uncertain before the Italians came to us. But when we had them, they certainly explained the whole matter, as undoubtedly also with you.</p>
      <p>We do not know about the emperor's army, which set out against the Frenchman in Lower Germany, where it is, what it is doing, what plans it has. The emperor (Charles V.) realized too late (this is certain) what the Frenchman (Francis I.) attempted and did there. Now he knows; we await what he will do in response.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with yours. I am always the same to Theodor (Theodor Bibliander); for I cannot depart from the words I uttered here (indeed) in the council of the university.</p>
      <p>Greet him diligently in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 17, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, an excellent man, brother in his Lord.</p>
