      <p>Regarding the Reformation, it is said that His Imperial Majesty is concerned: 1. Some colleges and spiritual private individuals, equipped with privileges, indulgences, and dispensations from the Pope's Holiness, thereby withdrawing themselves from the ordinary authorities and hindering them from proper visitation; likewise, that such reformation, when one should use it against such exempt persons, etc., would be objected to, as it should be contrary to common law in some points; likewise, that in places where there were preachers related to the confession, they were prevented from establishing the same, and could not even obtain a priest who would be willing to use such a form. 2. That the declaration (Interim), he understands by the declaration the Interim, was not implemented in all points, should the hindrances to His Imperial Majesty be brought forward; namely, that His Majesty should consider that the religion has now been in fluctuation for 30 years and has been instilled in the people through diligent preaching, singing, reading, and teaching, so that the subjects know nothing else, except that it is in accordance with the Holy Scripture and thus could not be turned away from it even once.</p>
      <p>Moreover, some subjects of the estates also complained to the princes and territories that the Interim was not in accordance with the Holy Scripture and that they did not know how to deviate from it without a council; should the subjects now be forced into it, one would have to fear the same tumult, uprising, and commotion, so that one could not get through it without special danger.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the preachers did not want to teach the Interim, they would rather leave their churches and chairs; otherwise, one could not have priests, whereby Christianity would be driven away, the churches would have to stand desolate, and thus paganism would be introduced. Many such reasons are still put forward.</p>
