      <p>Greetings. Excuse, most learned Bullinger, that due to a flow from the head, I was not able to respond fully to your letters in the ones sent to me last November. There was no need for any excuse on your part for your kindness, which I love so much that I would not hesitate to pledge my life for yours, as I am of no use to the church of Christ, not to mention necessary as you are in these most calamitous times.</p>
      <p>I add that my letters were not written for you to respond to each point, but only so that by reading them superficially, you might recognize how uncertain everything is with us, and then consign them to Vulcan (the god of fire), and also to elicit from you, a man of God, pious groans for the church of Christ in peril both with us in the entire region of the Vangiones and with many other peoples of Germany, even those (which is to be lamented) who seemed to be pillars and as if they would oppose themselves as a bronze wall for the house of God; but today we see how they remain consistent with themselves. Oh, the fleeting faith of men and unworthy faint-heartedness. "They have not yet resisted unto blood," Hebrews 12.</p>
      <p>I received particular letters from the exiles of England, as you know, in which they give thanks for the small conference; they promise prayers for me to God, a great reward in abundance. I, in turn, if indeed pious affections and groans are to be considered in place of prayers, will not be an infrequent intercessor for them. I grieve from the heart, I say, I grieve from the heart for their miserable fate as far as human matters are concerned, yet I no less rejoice for their piety in divine matters, giving thanks to God, who in this most ungrateful age has deemed it worthy to leave for himself seven thousand men who have not yet bowed their knees to the image of Baal, who for the blessed and most holy name of Christ prefer to suffer insults, proscriptions, exiles from their sweet homeland, even some chains, and finally tortures and deaths of various kinds rather than deny the truth once recognized.</p>
      <p>I replied to them; for it seemed uncivil not to reply, I would have added something to the recent small conference; but due to the frequent exactions with which we are continually harassed, and also because an enemy has today approached the city of Worms where we dwell, threatening defiance and war (for no other reason than that our senate was too obedient to the orders of the Emperor last year), I could not at present; for either he must be appeased by us, as I fear, with a certain sum of money, and not a small one, or our merchants (which is intolerable for the republic) will not have safe journeys. The Emperor, who is the cause of this crisis, is not moved by our danger; this is the gratitude he shows to his followers, etc.</p>
      <p>You write that the Lutherans are renewing the war over the doctrine of the Eucharist. I wish that some of your confederate brothers were not joining them (which I would like whispered in your ear). Sultzer is very suspect to me, who, when I was there in previous years, seemed to be plotting something of the sort; for when I happened to mention him in conversation with him: "I," he said, "am entirely in this, that I may reconcile the opinion of all the ancient doctors on this doctrine; he seemed to me to say that Oecolampadius and Zwingli of blessed memory did not satisfy him. Then, with all whom I discussed the matter, I found them to be Lutherans, except one, whose name is Thomas Gyrfalkio. Moreover, at that time, Johannes Brenz (whom you know what he is like in this doctrine) had frequent journeys to Basel and his name was gracious among many. I could name a man who wanted to commend him to me; but when he heard that I was offended by the mention of him, he immediately fell silent.</p>
      <p>In the end, the truth, however much Satan may snarl and these skirmishes of his, will, by the disposition of the Most High, turn out so that it is more and more confused and the truth triumphs with greater glory throughout the world, so that according to Paul's opinion, those who are approved may become manifest. Our lawyers say that the more the truth is agitated, the more it becomes clear.</p>
      <p>As for the letters of Agnini to you, I do not know what to answer. For if he used the same arguments in them as to me, they will not be firm enough nor drawn from anywhere else than from the faint-heartedness of mind, which today afflicts most cities and princes throughout Germany and which will afflict... annem. Many of the princes believed in him, but because of the Pharisees, they did not confess, lest they be cast out of the synagogue. For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God, etc. Thus these fear the indignation of the Emperor. They fear dangers, they value the peace of the world more than the peace of Christ or at least want to appear to do so (to avoid the hatred of men). Since all of Germany or nearly all is sick with this kind of disease today, I more easily forgive a similar ailment in a man otherwise good and very dear to me in many respects.</p>
      <p>What you write about the never-ending dispute arises from this; for when he asked me through letters for a sketch of a future will, to deliberate on what he should do, I did not want to conceal anything from him. I replied that I did not know who would make trouble for this will, except for some maternal friends of the wife (I say maternal), who once boasted among their own about my affinity with this addition: "Today or tomorrow, with him deceased (thinking of me), we will be numbered among his heirs." But those boasters ought to have thought: "We are equally mortal as he" (as indeed not long after some of them died), they ought to have thought that even if I died before them, the wife would still survive, she having a better right of succession. They ought to have thought: she is still a young woman; what if she then marries another, what if she assigns the entire inheritance to him by will? where is our right of succession? for we are not her necessary heirs, we can not only be disinherited but also, which is lighter, passed over. These and many other similar things could have come to the minds of the boasters, especially Agnini, to whom I often hinted in letters that I had great hope of the will and consent of the wife, as she had previously consented in more important matters, and that she would not oppose me here. But that eye of the mind, as I noticed from his letters to me, was diverted by the doctrine of the Zurich church concerning the Lord's Supper, which is hateful to many, and the will, which he is preparing, is entirely based on this, and it will entirely happen that a copy of it will be taken by appeal to the judgment, as they call it, of the imperial chamber. But they will certainly finally pronounce that will to favor heretical doctrine and to be entirely based on it and therefore invalid, and me, who is the defender of such a will, to be a supporter of the same heresy and also to be punished with a legitimate penalty or at least worthy of an ignominious appellation, etc. When I objected to him this fear and anxiety of mind through letters, he replied that he knew that he had labored under this hatred from ill-willed people since his parents. I replied: "Indeed, it is well known to me, but it is not enough to begin well unless you finish well" according to that Aristotelian saying: "If the end is good, all is good." Hence also Christ: "He who perseveres," he says, "to the end will be saved."</p>
      <p>He complains that it would be hard for him and his if such a sentence were passed against the defender in law of such a will, that it would also be executed against him and his. I replied: In civil law, it is provided that a sentence can be passed against a procurator, to whom, with the principal litigant dead, it is contested; but it is not provided that execution can be made against the same. Since therefore the testamentary is like a procurator, that fear is vain. He conceded, collecting himself here finally into my opinion.</p>
      <p>What he advises lastly, that I should sell everything and move to where I and my belongings (however I have disposed of them) are out of danger, I had this in mind before I saw any man either in Basel or Zurich and from that time Agnini was not unaware of it, as I revealed to him. He wanted to remind me of this now.</p>
      <p>But so far the ability to accomplish it has been lacking, not the will, as it is today. Meanwhile, while that has been denied for so long, so many years have passed, and much strength of the body has diminished, whence it is to be feared, even if everything else is soon ready for the journey, that I may fail on the way before I reach you, unless the mercy of the deity restores strength from time to time. Therefore, I will order you to be secure about renting a dwelling, before being warned by previous letters from me. A small cottage for me, my wife, a servant, and a boy will be enough, especially for the first arrivals. Then with time, better provision can be made.</p>
      <p>I have learned with Paul to be content with whatever, I know how to excel and to be humbled, etc. I learned this in Speyer, where the dwelling had to be changed frequently; later I returned to Worms with my wife, where her native soil is, I built more splendidly, for which I have repented a thousand times, as it was the sole or at least the main reason for not yet transferring the dwelling there.</p>
      <p>So much for Agnini's arguments and plans, by which he seeks to avoid the burden of the testamentary, and I, understanding his serious intention, voluntarily released him from this. In turn, he promised me that he would take care that the obligations both of Basel and yours, authenticated by the Frankfurt senate (as our people are wont to say), that is, reduced to authentic copies, which I may keep reserved with me, and send and deposit the archetype with you, as you please. With this settled, yours will return to you at the next autumn fair; for I am still deliberating about the Basel one, with whom I will deposit it for safekeeping.</p>
      <p>I will not add another word about Pfeffinger; for his hypocrisy is beginning to become known and is more and more hated every day even by those who have hitherto vigorously defended the cause of the clergy.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in your letters, you commend my modesty, which I would prefer to be praised dead than alive, indeed I do not even desire it when dead. For what would you praise in a sinful man, whose all pursuits from youth are evil? For whether on that day, out of the pure goodness and grace of God, I am placed on the right hand and sufficiently and abundantly praised with the sheep of Christ, hearing: "Come, blessed of my Father," etc., or by the just judgment of God (for he can do nothing unjust) placed on the left, those human praises will weigh more heavily according to that which is almost on everyone's lips, that in the calendar of the pontiff more are placed as saints and venerated by that name, whose souls are tormented in the underworld. Therefore, you would wish prayers to be poured out to God for one still living, that he may deign to grant a pious and happy end of life to miserable me; if that happens, I will be considered eternally praised, as I will enjoy never-ending praise with Christ and all the blessed.</p>
      <p>I am not surprised that Melanchthon approves of Calvin's booklet, in which he is defended from the calumnies of Servetus; I am more surprised that he has not testified this opinion of his to all by some public writing as Lord Theodore Beza, especially because of the Anabaptists, who do not want the civil sword to be drawn against anyone for the sake of faith, but think it sufficient if he is avoided or treated as a heathen and a publican, or if he is prevented from spreading poison, he is restrained in perpetual prison, while Luther, whose footsteps he still follows in most things, does not hesitate to testify in public writing that swords are holy and to be consecrated in temples, by which the tumultuous and seditious peasants were killed, of whom I would believe none to have been so prodigiously impious and blasphemous against the Son of God as that scoundrel Servetus.</p>
      <p>Concerning wars, famine, earthquakes, pestilence frequently and particularly raging in recent years, and other signs preceding the coming of the Lord, there is a prophecy of Christ among the evangelists, especially Matthew and Luke, entirely applicable to our time; therefore let us lift up our heads.</p>
      <p>That you have taken care to store our bond for the received 50 florins, where it may be safely preserved as a testimony of the truth, for I would think it the only sufficient proof of the contract of purchase and sale entered into between us, confirmed and further irrevocable, in vain murmuring by anyone, etc. Add that the archetype, likewise its authentic copy, will teach the same; the archetype, as I mentioned above, will return to you at the next fair. Farewell with your wife, children, and grandchildren (if you have any), all your sons-in-law, colleagues, and your entire literary college in Christ most happily. All of whom, along with my wife, I have ordered to be greeted most diligently in the Lord. From Worms, indeed old, but a poor city of the Vangiones, March 30, in the year after Christ was born 1555.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your excellence, Wolfgang Waidner. To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Zurich church and most faithful defender of the purer evangelical doctrine throughout all of Europe, where Latin is known and understood, most revered lord and teacher.</p>
