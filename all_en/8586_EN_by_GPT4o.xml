      <p>Since I have learned from experience that the use of the bath somewhat weakens the stomach to the point of nausea and is sometimes unexpectedly restored by small things, I decided to send this as a sign of my love for you, unless my opinion deceives me, as not unsuitable for that purpose. You, in your old humanity, consider Julius's will inclined to gratitude, certainly, if the opportunity were available. Our relative of blessed memory, Martyr, der gedultig kalb, has returned to us from La Rochelle, but like Tantalus, much thirstier in the midst of waters, so this one of ours is more mute than a fish in the very waves of business; he brings nothing except what was already known to almost everyone before you set out. I see from his speech that we have been burdened with many lies for the sake of party interests. I wish for you this bath to be far healthier than ours for me and my master; for he is not doing so well from the bath, and I have not become any more beautiful.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May God return you to us well-bathed and unharmed soon; otherwise, with you absent, I seem to myself to be acting in solitude in the very crowd. Hastily from the printing house, from which the master and mistress, who wish you well and desire your well-being, send their many greetings. Pardon the trembling hand and the lack of paper; for I too am acting like Tantalus.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, June 15, 1571.</p>
      <p>Most devoted of all yours, Julius Santerentianus.</p>
      <p>To the holy and beloved society of Mr. Bullinger with his most delightful sons and daughters, greetings.</p>
      <p>Julius.</p>
