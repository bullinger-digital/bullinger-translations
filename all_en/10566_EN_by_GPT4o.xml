    <p xml:id="regest1">Will take care of Thomas [Hofmann] and Konrad Lüthard, but requests that in the future only those appointed by him be sent. The renewal of the University [of Tübingen] has been ordered; Peter [Brun], Gall [Müller], [Johann] Armbruster, and Rudolf [Unger] were dismissed, Konrad [Blicklin] has died, [Georg] Simler is ill; the study of canon law is being reorganized, in addition, significant professors are being appointed, the bursaries are being merged, and the salaries increased. In many places, the reading of the Mass has ceased; the Eucharistic liturgy introduced by Schnepf in Stuttgart is hardly to be criticized. Praises Duke [Ulrich of Württemberg]. Explains his Eucharistic doctrine. Requests intercession. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Regarding Thomas, whom you sent back here, most illustrious Bullinger, I hope he will not regret the journey he undertook, even though it was hardly possible to foresee the outcome. I am pleased with the man's character and intellect, especially his piety and moderate learning. As for Konrad Lüthard, I promise nothing now, but I will include him in the list of others whom I wish to consult, and I will not let him slip from my mind, intending to call him at the appropriate time. Indeed, I retained him mainly for your sake; for there are quite a few good and learned brothers whom I have long encouraged to have good hope. Therefore, you will not add anyone to this list who has not been called by me first. I would indeed wish, if I could, to be present for all those who have been recommended to me from there, and I do not doubt that I will be present, but in due time.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, here the word of God runs and is glorified. The reform of the university has been prescribed. Several professors have been dismissed: three theologians - Peter Brun, Gall Müller, the parish priest of this church and professor of the school, and the younger Armbruster, now the rector of the university -, and the physician Rudolf Unger. The regular professor of canon law, Blicklin, has died. Simler, a clearly learned interpreter of the laws, suffers from apoplexy, and I fear he may not recover. Two other lecturers of canon law will be sent, and only one lecturer of canon law will be retained in the school, who will not read papal trifles, but according to the book of Decretals on judgments and a few other things for practical purposes, as they call it. We are calling upon excellent physicians, outstanding jurists, distinguished theologians, and the most skilled professors of languages. The two factions of the realists and nominalists, as they are called, will be joined, so that there will be one community where Aristotle is read to all in common, and good literature is taught. The salaries of all will be as they have been so far, although I cannot now write to you about this whole institution, which you will receive at another time.</p>
      <p>In Stuttgart, Herrenberg, Cannstatt, etc., the papal mass has been completely abolished; not because the prince has abolished it by his decree, but there were other reasons for the priests to cease. Since these reasons are not present with us, it certainly seems that the last traces will be placed here. The Eucharist in Stuttgart, instituted by Schnepf, is such that you cannot desire much in it. The bread and the cup are not elevated, nor is the minister dressed in sacred vestments. Some psalms are sung, readings are read, the angelic hymn and "In terra" are sung; some things are said in Latin, some in German.</p>
      <p>The prince seems to trust the Lord more and more, whom the more I perceive, the more I venerate and adore. I believe he is reserved by the Lord for accomplishing great things.</p>
      <p>Regarding my opinion on the Eucharist, I do not want you to be worried and anxious. You easily see that I affirm the true presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist, but which is beyond quantity, quality, and place, in which matter I do not seem to differ from anyone truly learned, whether they are Lutheran or Zwinglian. May the Lord, with a favorable spirit, continually open to us other and other windows of concord!</p>
      <p>Commend me, who loves you dearly, to the Savior Christ with your most pious prayers, so that I may be able to be equal to the task to which He has destined me.</p>
      <p>Greet your most holy wife with the children, then the best men Leon, Theodor, and the rest. Farewell, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, dearer than the dearest.</p>
      <p>In Tübingen, February 15.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Zurichers, his venerable brother.</p>
