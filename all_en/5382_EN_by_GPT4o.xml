      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write; however, I will make an effort to ensure that I seem to have omitted nothing in terms of the acts of the council. I was a nuisance to you last week with so many letters being sent; now I will be brief, so as not to distract you so often with my trifles. I would call them trifles, as I see that I have labored in vain in everything.</p>
      <p>What Hercules, what I have attempted, you can now know; we would have had the bravest of all. Now no peace can be long-lasting and stable, with the Guises at the helm. The adversaries undoubtedly do all this to once distract the strength of our people and then unexpectedly attack them unprepared. Oh, our wretched ones, who allow themselves to be so shamefully deceived! This past week has occupied me more than anything else in my entire life. You yourself can imagine how great a burden it was to undertake such serious plans, the outcome of which is so uncertain and doubtful. Now, with everything provided that was needed for this business, the Condenses are faltering.</p>
      <p>I beg you, continue to inform me of the rest. Why nothing about the brother of Guise, Aumale?</p>
      <p>This pacification does not please our people; for we foresee that Guise will not agree to any conditions adverse to him. I am writing back to Mr. Coignet; I ask you to ensure it is safely delivered to him. I am surprised that my speech pleased you; for I was not satisfied with myself, but nevertheless indulged; for in such a troubled time I could not do otherwise. I easily agree with you that my name should be omitted, although I do not care much about the fury of the antichrist. Therefore, let another name be substituted, and if it pleases, this one: Janus Orius, or you or Mr. Gesner may invent another name derived from Greek. As for the rigor, I would not want anything to be removed; for nothing can be said so harsh that the wickedness and cruelty of these men do not surpass it. But I doubt whether Froschauer will print it; if he proves difficult, send it to Heidelberg on occasion, so that it may be printed there. Farewell, reverend father in Christ. June 29, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Johannes Fabricius. To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, his lord and father in Christ, always to be honored. Zurich.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bullinger.</p>
