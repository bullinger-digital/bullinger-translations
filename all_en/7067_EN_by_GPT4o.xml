      <p>S. I wrote two days ago. I have nothing to add to this, except that in the meantime, the Count of Anguissola, the Spanish envoy, has been heard.</p>
      <p>He requested passage, not indeed through the lands of our lords, but near them and gave good words. Since this could not be prevented outside our borders, it was granted to him, as I hear, as much as my lords are concerned. Be aware, it will now also come to the attention of the Swiss Confederates. In the meantime, nothing has been done with the people of Freiburg. I am waiting to hear what is brought to you from this Frankfurt fair. We are expecting our merchants daily. You can send through this, if you have anything. He still longs for that girl, and I wish for you or some of your people to negotiate with Lord von MÃ¼linen, so that she may be granted to him in marriage. He wanted to impose this on me; but I prefer that this be done with him by others, so that it may be done with greater weight.</p>
      <p>My Blasius departed again yesterday; he sends you many greetings. Two boys, who are not from his own, died of the plague today in our Musculus; thus this evil recurs from time to time.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep him and all of us from evil! All of ours greet you. I am not writing to my brother now. Therefore, greet him in my name with all of yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 5, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
