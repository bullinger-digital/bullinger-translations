    <p xml:id="regest1">On September 20, Bullinger received the letter from Philipp of Hesse, issued in the military camp in Wechingen on September 12 [No. 2581]. He is very grateful that Heinrich Thomann was accommodated in the landgrave's chancellery.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger was also very interested in the report on the military actions that took place between August 29 and September 6 between the [Schmalkaldic League] and Emperor [Charles V]. May God continue to support the Landgrave!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger also showed his letter to the Zurich councilors. They were very pleased about it. Although they have not officially joined the [Schmalkaldic League] with troops, they are helping them, together with the three other [Protestant] places (Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen), in a more efficient way. Philipp will indeed know how the Nine Places, which want to remain in the old faith, are being courted by the Emperor and the Pope [Paul III]. If the [Four Swiss Protestant Places] were to go to war on the side of the [Schmalkaldic League], the Catholic places, which are by no means weak, would join the Emperor's side, even against the Four Places. Consequently, the negotiations and the sitting still of the latter are more beneficial to Philipp of Hesse and the [Schmalkaldic League] [than an open entry into the war].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Today Bullinger learned from a reliable man [Itelhans Thumysen or Johannes Haab] that the [Catholic] envoys of the Five Places at the meeting in Baden made it clear to the envoy of France [Antoine Morelet du Museau] that if King Francis I or the Four Places were to go to war on the side of the [Schmalkaldic League] and therefore got into trouble because of their faith, they would terminate the [mercenary] alliance [of 1521] with the King and the alliances with their confederates and would hold fast to their faith. They were made to understand that they were not bound by them. However, the Landgrave can infer from this how it would harm the cause if the Four Places were to openly enter the war on the side of the [Schmalkaldic League]. In an emergency, they will certainly show themselves helpful because of their common faith.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings from Mayor Hans Rudolf Lavater, who is fully committed to the [Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger also offers his services to the Landgrave.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- May the Lord grant patience, wisdom, and strength in the fight against the enemies, so that the poor Christians may be freed from the [papal] tyranny of the end times and the oppressed Germany from the yoke of the [Italians and Spaniards]!</p>

      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince, gracious lord, I am your princely grace's humble, willing servant at all times. Gracious lord, I received your princely grace's gracious letter, dated at the field camp in Wechingen on September 12, with the greatest joy on September 20, as I understood from it that your princely grace has granted my humble request to take Heinrich Thomann into your princely grace's chancellery. Therefore, I thank your princely grace most sincerely, offering to serve your princely grace in all that is possible for me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I was no less delighted by the diligent report of the military actions between your princely grace on one side and the Emperor on the other, successfully carried out from August 29 to September 6, which your princely grace graciously shared and sent to me. May God continue to grant your princely grace wisdom, favor, strength, patience, and victory against our enemies. For this, we are earnestly praying and thanking for the good and grace that He has granted your princely grace so far.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Your princely grace, I also inform you that I have shown your princely grace's gracious letter to my gracious lords, who received great joy from it, as they are sincerely desirous of your princely grace's welfare and will promote it to the best of their ability. Although they have not yet joined your princely grace with their open banner, they, along with the other three places (Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen), are doing what is more beneficial and better for your princely grace and your allies. As your princely grace may well know, the Emperor and the Pope are daily making remarkable efforts to win over the other nine places of the Confederation, and what the disposition of these Confederates has been and still is, namely to persist in the papal faith, etc., if our people were to march out of the country with their open banners, undoubtedly the opposition, whose power is not small nor to be underestimated, would turn to the other side, indeed, soon against us ourselves. Therefore, through our negotiations and sitting still (with which the opposition is also kept still), not a small help and advantage is provided to your princely grace and your allies.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Your princely grace, I cannot conceal that today an honorable, excellent man of good opinion has confided to me that the envoys of the Five Places at the meeting in Baden this week made it clear to the French envoy that if the King of France or their Confederates from the Four Places were to involve themselves in this war and seek to help, thereby being forced from their faith (the Catholic), etc., they would terminate the alliance with the King of France and their Confederates and further consider how they would also provide support and assistance to their faith. And although they received an appropriate response to this, that they understood well that they did not want to be bound to them, etc., yet your princely grace can see and learn from this how it would not be advisable nor beneficial to the whole cause if my gracious lords, along with the other three places, were to adhere to the Gospel and march to the field with their open banners. In case of emergency, however, I am of good hope that our people will show themselves very helpful, as the duty of one faith and uniform religion requires. And therefore, your princely grace can rely on all good and all loyalty from my gracious lords.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Your princely grace is warmly greeted by Mayor Hans Rudolf Lavater, who desires your princely grace's welfare, salvation, and victory to the highest degree and is entirely willing to promote it with all his ability.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>What I can do with all my service, and especially in this need and danger, to please and promote your princely grace, I would do unreservedly with loyalty and goodwill.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>May God Sabaoth grant your princely grace, along with your allies, patience in the great labor, understanding in these swift developments, and also strength against the power of the enemies, so that your princely grace may free the poor Christian people from the tyranny of the end times, and the oppressed German land, our beloved fatherland, from the yoke of the Italian and Spanish. May the Lord Jesus Christ be your princely grace's heart and strength, granting victory to the praise of His holy name.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, on September 25, 1546. Your princely grace's entirely willing servant</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger. To the illustrious, high-born Christian prince and lord, Lord Philipp Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc., his gracious prince and lord.</p>
