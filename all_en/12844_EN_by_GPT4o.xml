    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frey was more pleased to receive Bullinger's letter [not received] than to read it. Bullinger knows why this is so. Since the Wyttenbachs are absent, Frey and Peter Fuchs sent the letter from Bullinger addressed to [Hans Wunderlich] [not received] with their own messenger [...] to Neuchâtel, while Bullinger's messenger, Jakob [...], who is now returning with Wunderlich's reply [No. 2794], waited in Biel. Frey and Fuchs do not know what is in Bullinger's letter to [Niklaus] Wyttenbach, as he has not yet returned.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The people of Biel are doing well (if only the people of Zurich were doing the same!). However, they are equally prepared to be justly punished by God, even though they fervently pray for mercy. The measure is long full! May the Lord grant redemption and the spread of the Gospel. But one should think of the sons of Zebedee: first the bitter cup, then the dominion. The number of people who must die for their faith in Christ is apparently not yet complete.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Greetings from all who greeted Bullinger. Greetings also to Anna [née Adlischwyler], to the family, to Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, Johannes Fries, and Heinrich Buchter.</p>

      <p>S. D. P. I received your letters, dearest father, with a more eager spirit than I read them. You know the reasons, and there is no need for me to repeat them. The letters you intended for Neuchâtel, Vulpius and I ensured, with as much diligence as we could, were delivered there; for the Wyttenbachs were not at home. We retained Jakob, your messenger, until the one we sent returned; who also brought letters from Johann Wunderlich, as you will see. We have not yet read the letters addressed to Wyttenbach, as he is not at home, as we mentioned.</p>

      <p>We are all well, thanks to God. And would that you are well too! Meanwhile, we expect nothing else but the deserved punishments for our sins, although we fervently pray for mercy. It cannot be said how exquisite wickedness reigns everywhere. The measure is already overflowing! May the most good and great God either deliver us from the evils threatening us from all sides or grant that we may be made glorious with a patient spirit and a steadfast confession of the truth, and that the knowledge of the Gospel may be spread more widely. The Lord shows us that what he once answered to the sons of Zebedee pertains to us, namely, that now we must drink the cup of bitterness, but one day we will reign, when it seems good to God the Father, for the number of those who are to be killed for the confession of the Lamb is not yet complete. May God help the weak!</p>

      <p>All those whom you ordered to be greeted send their greetings to you, and they also command you to be strengthened in virtue, praying diligently to the Lord for you. You will convey my greetings to your wife and your entire family, as well as to your neighbors, Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, Johannes Fries, Heinrich Buchter, etc., the most esteemed fathers. Farewell forever. Biel, February 5, 1547. Entirely yours from the heart, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his father, always to be greatly revered. Zurich.</p>
