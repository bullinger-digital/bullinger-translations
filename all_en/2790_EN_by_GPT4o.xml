      <p>Greetings, most illustrious man and best brother. It has been a long time since I received any letters from you; yet I am indeed eager to know how my Bullinger is doing, how his colleagues are, and how the whole church is. I am now sending a special messenger; at least through him, let me understand something.</p>
      <p>With us, everything remains in the same state; I am in good health and work day and night, thanks be to God. Laelius will show you a writing that is not very new, but which I do not think you have seen yet. I hear that Melanchthon has recently published a rather papistic book; I have a very reliable witness of this matter. I have begun to hunt for that book and will obtain it; if I do, you will see it too. Indeed, next spring the Turk will invade Pannonia, for which reason there will be a diet in Regensburg on the first of March, namely where the matter of contribution will be discussed, that is, the pinnacle of all matters. Dr. Brenz is now sending to the press the second part against the Asotic beast, indeed a very good writing; I have it at home now. I wish you could understand my version of the first part; for often (with the author's consent) I paraphrase.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that Appiarius has not sent the image from Bern, for which I have already ordered to be given and know that one crown has been given. I beg you, if he has not yet sent it, to remind Dr. Haller with your letters to urge the man. I send my greetings to Dr. Rudolf Gwalther and your three sons-in-law and other brothers as well. I beseech you, help me with your prayers.</p>
      <p>Stuttgart, the day before the Lord's birth 1555.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, honorable brother.</p>
