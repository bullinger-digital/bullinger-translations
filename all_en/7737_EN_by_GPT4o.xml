      <p>Greetings. I pray for a most prosperous year for you and all yours, and at the same time, I am sending the letters which I received yesterday from Geneva. You see Beza's letters sealed with my seal; for he sent them to me unsealed, so that I might read them, seal them, and send them to you. Also, the brother of the syndic of Geneva, Roset, arrived here yesterday. He is very doubtful about what Beza writes concerning the suppression of the Angevin, and here no credence is yet given to this matter. Therefore, believe as much as you wish. I have nothing else, and he is departing so hastily that I cannot write more now. Farewell. Bern, on the first day of January, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
