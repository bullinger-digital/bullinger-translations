    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends the bearer of the letter, the pastor Konrad Heinimann from Merishausen?, who was relieved of his position due to marital difficulties, but is otherwise a good man. Hears that the people of Zurich are urging Beat Gering to return to Zurich. Certainly, this would allow him to avoid many inconveniences, but it would be a great loss for the Schaffhausen church. The well-being of the Schaffhausen church should be kept in mind by the people of Zurich in this matter.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter to you is a native of St. Gallen, who has until now served in the ministry of the word in the region of Schaffhausen. After the death of his wife, with whom he has surviving children, he married a young woman, with whom he has had some disputes and disagreements, partly because of the children, as often happens, and partly because she was not imbued with the manners that would have been fitting for her and pleasing to her husband. While few have justly considered this cause, our council has been informed that he has given occasion for offense to the church. Therefore, he has been removed from office, although he is by no means a bad man and not unworthy of being admitted again. I commend him to you in such a way that he may understand that my recommendation was pleasing to you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I understand that you are somewhat urging our Beat to return to you. Indeed, I confess, if he were to obey you, he could avoid the not uncommon injuries and insults that he must endure here. However, no one should believe that this can be done without great inconvenience to our church. Therefore, I earnestly beg you and the other brothers to consider not only the growth of your church but also ours, which is nevertheless one, namely, of Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love Erasmus, as he uniquely loves you in return.</p>
      <p>June 24, 1534.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, who steadfastly proclaims the gospel of Christ, dearest brother.</p>
