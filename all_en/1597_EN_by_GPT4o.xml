      <p> Greetings. I was about to send this letter through Calvin and Farel; for they returned here on March 6th, intending to go to Zürich as well, to obtain a delegation from those cities to the king for the remission of the severity of the persecution. They hoped that this could be achieved now, after the king had become more lenient due to the alliance with the German princes; for he granted all Germans the freedom to live according to their religion in his kingdom, and this was publicly proclaimed throughout the entire kingdom. But since our senate considered this attempt too premature, they changed their course and went to Basel, I do not know what they will do there. You understand the reason for this letter, which I wanted to send nonetheless because it also contains some other matters. </p>
      <p> There is nothing new to write about; surely all these things are more fully known to you. It is certain that the king will enter Germany with the greatest forces. They say that Maurice is besieging Frankfurt, and the English and French fleets are besieging Antwerp. The die is cast for a very serious and dangerous war, about which I do not know what good to promise myself. Certainly, my spirit shudders. If only our people would stay at home and be content with their own borders! I fear an incursion into Burgundy; but these things are for you. Schertlius bought 1000 spears from our people, gathers his soldiers in our fields; he is planning something, I do not know what. He asked our senate to give him Musculus and Mecardus, whose service he would use among his soldiers. Musculus was denied; Mecardus, since he does not concern us, was given the power to depart with him; he is now preparing for the journey. This is what I have for now. I wonder what is preventing you from writing for such a long time. Farewell with all yours, whom you will greet in my name and in the name of mine and also of the Musculi. March 15, 1552. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord and compatriot. </p>
      <p> Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
