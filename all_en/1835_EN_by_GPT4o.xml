      <p>That your most humane kindness, most learned man, has written to me less frequently, indeed needs no excuse with me, and that I am somewhat unworthy, for whose sake a man of such piety, learning, eloquence, gravity, and candor would take even a little leisure to write, and that I am certainly aware that your readiness, however tireless, hardly has enough time to carry out more serious matters, with which you are engaged both of your own accord and by the duty of public and divine office. But such is the nature of your illustrious humanity, that the more it contributes to the edification and salvation of the neighbor and the church, the less it always considers itself to have accomplished, just like certain learned and modest men, who, the more skilled and perceptive they are, the more they accuse and acknowledge their own ignorance and darkness, according to their distinguished modesty of spirit and religious humility. Therefore, I praise both this exceptional virtue of yours and your excuse for neglecting, or rather abundantly fulfilling, your duty, not so much due to my merits towards you, which are none, but I attribute it entirely to your more benevolent humanity and plainly wish that many others, theologians by profession, may be found similar to you in this respect as well, who support the weakness of their brothers as you do with their shoulders and virtue, rather than completely overthrowing them with proud disdain and contemptuous peevishness, and (so to speak) trampling them underfoot. But I refrain from writing more about these things, lest I seem to flatter you or criticize others. Regarding Theobald, if any rumor has perhaps spread among you that he has returned to the favor of our most illustrious prince and publicly professes a doctrine that he does not share with the Lutherans or Zwinglians or even the Papists, allow me to briefly write how the matter stands. After he received a rejection of his office and an ignominious return from the Papists, to whom he had defected as an apostate, and learned that our prince was liberated, whom he knew he had once ensnared and captivated with hypocrisy and I don't know what fanatical tricks, so that he could obtain anything, and he was confident that he could reconcile himself to him with the same tricks.</p>
      <p>He sent letters to the excellent prince, in which he requested to be granted safe conduct to meet him, along with a booklet of his on faith alone not justifying. Upon receiving this message and reading the booklet, the most illustrious prince immediately refuted it on his own and in writing and sent this refutation, written by himself, back to Theobald, while at the same time granting him free access, which Theobald, relying on, and not deterred by the prince's contrary opinion in religion, rushed to him and, having prostrated himself before the prince's family, asked to be received into favor. There the prince, among other things, asked how he liked the refutation he had sent him, to which question Theobald, smiling, replied that his clemency was not the author, but Mr. Adam (who is the chief visitor or bishop of the churches in Hesse). At this response, the prince, moved, said: "I recognize," he said, "your old arrogance," and, having summoned witnesses, convicted the impudent donkey of lying and insult. Then he added: "I see that you attribute nothing to anyone and rely solely on your own spirit and become insolent and fierce." Did he not know that at Ingolstadt, through the same spirit, he had given himself and all the confederates the most certain hope, even in a public sermon, of capturing the Emperor and slaughtering the enemies, and saw the opposite happen. To which Theobald replied that he had not been truly enlightened and converted by the light of the spirit at that time, as he was now, thanks to the gods. Whereupon the prince said: "What do I hear," he said, "but you also prophesied through this new spirit of yours and publicly professed that I would never obtain liberation from custody unless all the Lutherans were converted to your faith and all the ministers of the gospel in Germany were expelled. But you see that by divine grace we have been liberated and that the true preaching of the gospel flourishes everywhere as before. Do you not yet recognize and perceive even from this the vanity of this new spirit of yours?" With this confusion of his ignored, Theobald turned to the refuge of flattery and replied that the prince's clemency must have been singularly and divinely converted, otherwise he would never have obtained liberation. After these and other words were exchanged back and forth, the prince finally said:</p>
      <p>"I see," he said, "abundantly enough, with what rod of blindness and vanity you have been struck by God; however, so that you cannot accuse me of any injury or prejudice and my theologians, I will send you to Mr. Philipp, Brentius, Schnepf, and the Zurich theologians, to whom if you approve your cause, I will acquiesce; if not, I will then see what counsel I will take concerning you," and having given him both a horse and 20 thalers and two horsemen and guards, he sent Theobald away, first impressing upon him to see what he was doing; for if he were to be silent at his, I mean the prince's, lay refutation, he would be ten times more mute at the many contrary arguments of such learned men. I wanted to inform you of this, most excellent man, so that if he comes to you, you may know how to receive such a vain, frivolous, and impudent guest. As for the son of Cholini, I will take care that he feels that your recommendation has been of no small benefit to him and that 40 florins are sufficient for his necessary expenses, with which one can live comfortably enough here, unless one wishes to indulge in more splendid clothing, frequent drinking, and the purchase of fine books (as most do). For a table, lodging, and comfortable bedding can be obtained for 30 of our florins, and if the remaining 10 are not sufficient for other necessary things, especially for someone who does not need many clothes and books?</p>
      <p>Indeed, those who seek and desire patronage for their extravagance or envy with us usually pretend the high cost of living and the negligence or incompetence of the professors among their own. I will show your letter to me to Mr. Hyperius at leisure, so that he may understand how much you value him, and do not doubt that he values you greatly; for he has often made the most honorable mention of you and the rest of the Zurichers similar to you, and I have seen with my own eyes that your commentaries on sacred literature are displayed in his museum, covered with his eyes. But to make it clearer to you what his disposition towards you is, I will ensure that he reveals this in his letters to you. Your letters to the most illustrious prince have been delivered in good faith, which you can gather from the fact that Hyperius said that a small booklet sent by Mr. Bullinger to the prince, enclosed in letters, was sent to him by the prince's minister and that he read it and immediately returned it. Mr. Pellicanus sent back my Hebrew institutions and vaguely indicated that if they were written more polished and clear, Froschauer could easily be persuaded to print them. If I were a little more certain of this, I would want to write them out as soon as possible, so that he could explain and expedite them while printing, much more easily, or at least I would present myself as a corrector in person, partly so that it would be printed more accurately, partly to have the opportunity to converse with you for one or two months, while it is possible during the widowhood. For this reason, I especially desire them to be printed, so that some of the envious among us may conjecture from there about my knowledge of that language, however small it may be, of which they are completely ignorant and unskilled, yet they would like to have it disparaged before the prince as of no great importance and me stripped of its profession. Indeed, because I have not learned to flatter or refuse to be joined by affinity, as is the case, and I know that unless I relied on the authority of Bucer of pious memory, from whom the prince asserted that no unskilled person had been recommended to him, I would be in the most certain danger of rejection. For they insinuated to the prince the small number of listeners as an argument of my incompetence, although they are aware of other causes, such as that students are overwhelmed with more lectures than is appropriate or useful, to be heard from the artists, also that there is no free power to listen to me rather than the professor of the arts, that testimonies of the listeners of the arts, not of the sacred language, are required, that they are examined only in the arts, not in Hebrew precepts, in short, that the students see that the study of the holy language is almost oppressed and hindered by the professors themselves; I am silent about the fact that it is not new for Hebrew professors to be deprived of a large number of listeners, as the examples of all schools testify. Therefore, in your next letters, I ask you to stabilize Bucer's recommendation with your authority to the prince, and to suggest that more suitable listeners be assigned to me from the stipendiaries, with the permission granted to them to neglect the art for the ministry of the word, which is not of such great assistance as mathematics, etc. Furthermore, advise him not to allow his stipendiaries to freely apply their minds to any faculty they please, as the jurists would like for the sake of filling their auditorium, but to bind them all to the study of theology, who are supported by spiritual goods; for thus it will happen that he will not be forced to bear so many inept blocks as ministers of the word, as there are, which is to be lamented, many, especially since from the rest of the crowd of studies a sufficiently large number emerges to devote themselves to the law, and even if all 50 or sixty stipendiaries who are supported here annually were to become suitable preachers, which happens to very few, they would hardly suffice for even a third of the Hessian territory, indeed not even two hundred, if they were nurtured and satisfied their title, as I think.</p>
      <p>For I estimate, unless I am mistaken, that the crowd of subjects under the prince landgrave is five times greater than that of those subject to the Zurich territory. Farewell well, most illustrious man, and consider me as most recommended to you and all good people, and greet Mr. Bibliander, Gesner, Ammianus, and all the others. Given on March 29, in the year 53.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly in all respects, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy antistes of the church of Zurich in the ministry of the word of God, his most reverend lord in all respects.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
