      <p>Most illustrious and esteemed lord. I responded to your two letters in recent days and wrote down everything certain I had about the Council of Trent, and I also sent a summary of those matters that were discussed in the new and last session. Now that the council is dismissed, I cannot know what the plans of the papists are or what they are plotting against those whom they have condemned as heretics, but I do believe that they will attempt nothing at this time; for I hear that they are in great fear because of the Turk, from whom they have ascertained that the greatest fleets are being prepared, and they fear that he may attack the Kingdom of Naples in early spring, wherefore not only Philipp, but also the other princes of Italy are fortifying their maritime places, and the Venetians, although they are allied with the Turk by treaty, do not trust him, but are preparing a great fleet, and there is no less fear of an internal threat in Calabria, since the army of exiles is quite strong and cannot be driven from the occupied mountains, and there is even suspicion that it is being supported by some of the kingdom's leading figures, who are waiting for a certain opportunity to stir up trouble. Therefore, if these suspicions and concerns persist, I judge that they will attempt nothing now. They have reported the death of the pope; however, this has not been confirmed, but it is certain that he is suffering from a serious illness. If anything is announced that I can hold as certain, I will diligently inform you. At this hour, I have received letters from Mr. Fabricius with news from France, for which indeed the greatest thanks are to be given to God, who in reality most openly watches over His church and protects and will protect it from the snares of enemies forever; to Him be praise and glory always. I am sending a piece of rhubarb, which they assure me has been selected from the best found in Venice; if it pleases you, I will be glad; if not, I will be sorry that my friend's diligence did not provide what I had hoped for. Regarding the price you instructed me to pay, I write nothing to you; for I wish you to accept this little gift in my favor. Farewell. May the Lord bless your labors.</p>
      <p>In Chiavenna, on the first of January, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Ulisse Martinengo.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most upright pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
