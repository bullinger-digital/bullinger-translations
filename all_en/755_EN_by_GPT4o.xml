      <p>Favorable and familiar, dear sir, the reason I have not written to you until now is truly because I have been considering traveling to Zurich daily and, for many excellent reasons, have thought it better to handle matters verbally than in writing. However, since my departure has been delayed for so long and because there are messengers from known places and daily reasons present that force me to remain against my will, I could not refrain from writing to you out of brotherly, faithful affection. I begin by informing you that the matter at the known place is more well-established than I had assumed, and if progress is made, it will undoubtedly help the entire matter, secure France and the common Confederation, avert the merciless persecution according to the Lord's will, and save our children from idolatrous seduction.</p>
      <p>And although many good-hearted people, unknown to you and other Confederates, have sincerely desired and requested whether the Confederation should not be moved by the harm and disadvantage of others, and that these have not acted worse out of arrogance, willfulness, and contempt, especially for the deserved punishment of their sins, they should let themselves be moved by the current events (under which I want to indicate all circumstances to be considered), I do not deem it appropriate to write much to you as the understanding one. And despite all this, you should secretly know that the time to act on these matters, consider all necessities, and send the certain war from the homeland to other places is approaching so closely that, unfortunately, one can no longer doubt it, as my lords of Zurich, before others, have good information, the common burdensome matter before their eyes, and all things in good view. For in truth, the Lord does not want us to sleep and give the enemy a chance to destroy the poor sheep.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, things are still well. May the Lord grant grace that the matter is considered by you as it is by them and that not everything is thrown to the wind and onto money, and that nothing will be done for money. From other places, it is appropriate to speak verbally. You have many troubled hearts; if they could not regain their freedom, they would still gladly want the reputation of the common Confederation to be maintained, which might also improve their situation.</p>
      <p>But where there is no consideration, it will truly, truly be human nature to advance, so that the pastor's house also burns. Your advancement, however, can easily be accomplished with letters or messengers. My servant is in the Rhine and is waiting for other letters and messengers, and I might then arrange to come to you.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, December 6, 1549.</p>
      <p>G[abriel] A[rnold].</p>
      <p>Greet everyone for me and let me be yours. Some artillery has been brought from Brussels to Luxembourg.</p>
