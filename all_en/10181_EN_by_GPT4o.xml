    <p xml:id="regest1">Communications of news from Basel: The Emperor's army is to winter in Upper Italy, which is likely to further strengthen the Five Places in their unyielding stance towards the Reformers; therefore, they should stand together. The Bernese envoy Hans Franz Nägeli can be trusted. Haller requests further news.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Today we are once again warned by Myconius, and our leaders are also warned by the leaders of the city of Basel that the Emperor will winter in the Milanese fortress, with his army scattered throughout Italy up to Lake Como and Bellinzona. The Five Places, relying on this, are pressing you to clarify the truth according to the edict. If they succeed, they will attempt greater things against us. Therefore, with the Gospel eliminated from Switzerland, it will be easy for the imperial cities to be restored to papism. Hence, it seems advisable for the people of Basel to agree with the cities and especially with us, who have been united with the city. The Frenchman will not fail us - although I trust him little - as he has his own discussions with the Christian cities. There is also a public rumor among us that the Five Places have defected from the French. But let these things be set aside. You think and communicate with those you must.</p>
      <p>Our envoy, Franz Nägeli, is such a person to whom you can entrust everything most safely. I would like you not to let him leave without a greeting. He is pious and has authority among us. Although he is young, he is nevertheless steadfast and acts like a man. If you have any news, share it. I have nothing else.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In the dead of night, November 15.</p>
      <p>Write whether you have received both your letters and mine.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his kind lord and brother.</p>
