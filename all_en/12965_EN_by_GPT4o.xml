    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Regarding the defeat of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, there is still the following to report: The son of Hartmann von Hallwyl reports from the court of Landgrave Philipp of Hesse how the Elector and a considerable number of cavalrymen were defeated due to the Elector's wrong decision to divide his forces into three armies. Meanwhile, these armies have reunited to openly confront Emperor Charles V. In the letter from the son, which was written on May 6 in Kassel, there is no mention of a possible release of the Elector or about the Bohemians. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Hallwyl also received news from the courier, although it is unverified. As he traveled along the Rhine, he repeatedly heard that the Elector had been freed. However, unlike previously claimed, this was not achieved with the help of the Bohemians. The Elector was held in Dresden for a few days because Duke Maurice of Saxony was able to prevent the Emperor from moving him to another location. Then the Elector's troops attacked Dresden and freed their lord. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] From the [Catholic] opponents, however, Hallwyl heard that the Emperor had the Elector brought to Innsbruck immediately with cavalrymen after some discussions with him, which seems credible. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] Landgrave Philipp had not yet left his land on May 6. At that time, he had stationed his forces at four different locations in his land, equipped his fortresses with everything necessary, and prepared for war. Hallwyl had requested the release of his son from him. The Landgrave was not pleased about this. He asked the son if he also wanted to be disloyal to him. This prompted the son to swear allegiance to the Landgrave again for the entire duration of the war, as long as he lived. Hallwyl was very pleased about this. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] If he could have responded to the news Bullinger shared some time ago with equally good news, he would have written long ago. But since he had nothing pleasant to report, he decided not to write, especially since the good people are already too saddened. The lethargy of the [Protestants] has allowed the Emperor, this tyrant, to become great and powerful; which is why Hallwyl is worried about the [Protestants]. Yet God will not abandon any of His own. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Although he hardly dares, Hallwyl asks the overburdened Bullinger to write to him again when he has the opportunity. He is very affected by the situation. Of course, he is always at Bullinger's service. </p>

      <p>My willing service beforehand, gracious, dear lord and good friend. Regarding the Elector's defeat, I have the following report: My son writes to me from the Landgrave's court, how the Elector with a considerable number of cavalry was defeated, primarily due to the mistake that the Elector divided his army into three groups. However, despite the loss, the other groups have reunited and are facing the Emperor again. This letter was sent from Kassel on the 6th of May. It mentions nothing about the release of the Elector nor about the Bohemians.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>However, I have heard much uncertainty from the courier, namely, as he traveled along the Rhine, he heard in many places that the Elector was supposedly released, but in a different manner than we have heard so far: Not with the help of the Bohemians, but that the Emperor intended to relocate the Elector, which Duke Maurice of Saxony did not want to allow; therefore, he was held in Dresden for several days. Meanwhile, the Elector's troops are said to have attacked the city and freed their lord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Otherwise, I have heard from the opponents: After the Emperor held several discussions with the Elector, he immediately sent him off to Innsbruck with a number of cavalrymen, which I do not find very credible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Landgrave had not yet left his land on the 6th of May. He had his army stationed in four places in his land at that time. He had equipped his fortresses with all necessities and was fully prepared for war. I had requested my son's release from him; which he was not very pleased about and said to my son, if he also wanted to become disloyal to him! To this, he pledged himself anew to him, as long as the war and his life lasted, to serve him. This has particularly pleased me. May the Lord God grant His grace.</p>

      <p>If I had known, your recent news, which you sent to me before, to reciprocate with equal joy, I would not have failed to report to you long ago. But since I had nothing better, I refrained from doing so. For I think, all good-hearted people otherwise encounter enough sorrow, ignorance of these things is a great relief! We have allowed the tyrant, when we could well have prevented it, nostra ignavia to become greater; for I fear, it will not go well for us in the future. But the Lord God will not lose any of His own.</p>

      <p>Although in an unseemly manner, as one burdened with many great affairs, I nevertheless humbly ask, to remember me often and at times, according to your convenience, to write to me. These matters weigh heavily on me. Herewith, whatever I can do to show you love and service, I shall always be found willing. Dated Baden, the 28th of May in the year 1547. Hartmann von Hallwyl.</p>
      <p>To the faithful and highly learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my especially beloved lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
