      <p>Vergerio sends greetings. I am not, nor do I wish to be considered, a defender of that book.</p>
      <p>I praised, I confess, the advice of your prince, who suggested that the people of Basel should not allow anything unexamined to be published. But what does this have to do with the book of Caelius, which was not printed in Basel? Indeed, when I later walked alone with you in the Stork's hypocaust, after you had informed Gwalther and me of your plan, I urged you, if you remember, to handle the matter prudently, so as not to give the ill-willed people of Basel an opportunity to suppress even good books. I added that Caelius is learned and skilled in language; therefore, I advised you not to provide him with an opportunity for disputing and demanding with you. I am quite sure you will say that the matter was conducted in this way and no other, if you still remember my words. Caelius, like you, frequently writes letters to me and vexes and distracts me, occupied with more necessary matters, and since I do not respond to him as he wishes and accuse him, he also has something to accuse me of. But I, standing in the middle between both, will act, with God's guidance, so that I neither offend God nor can be justly accused by you.</p>
      <p>Since you promise that you will write nothing more about this matter and will persevere in our old friendship despite these past events, you will also have me as a friend, as you have had until now. For I do not know what letters I have written to you that you would not have expected.</p>
      <p>However, I see that what I thought would happen has indeed occurred, and I predicted it would happen to you, that a commotion would arise without yielding splendid results, and many friends would be disturbed among themselves. But it is well; let us, leaving those things aside, love each other mutually in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell in this.</p>
      <p>Most hastily.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, 8th of August, 1557. I would write about new matters, if I did not know that Mr. Lelio neglects nothing here.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
