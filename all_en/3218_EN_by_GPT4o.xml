      <p>Grace and peace through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>When the most illustrious Lord Franciscus Lismaninus departed from us, although we had first written to you, we did not want him to come to you empty-handed without our letters. For when he brought letters of your piety and of the highest love towards us (which he had also reconciled), it seemed unworthy that he should not also bring letters with him as witnesses of our zeal and inclination towards you. However, we cannot hide our sorrow from you, brothers, at the departure of this most excellent and upright man, whom we judged to be most useful to us and to our church.</p>
      <p>Besides his great learning and modesty, with which he is endowed, he had also thoroughly learned the customs and nature of our people, which is not insignificant for shaping men. Added to this is the fact that, for the restoration of church discipline, which is now our concern, he had observed the customs of the Swiss churches, which seem to us to be purer, and other things which we found to be most suitable for softening so many monstrous minds. These, I say, are the things that lead us to grieve his departure. The Lord indeed softened our sorrow when he appointed two other most illustrious men in place of this one who was exiled, our Lord a Lasco and Lord Vergerius, but when we see ourselves still deprived of many necessities and the vineyard needing more laborers, it cannot be that our hearts are not moved with sorrow. However, whatever has been done, we embrace the Lord's good pleasure in it and console ourselves with his promises and your zeal and benevolence towards us, which gives us hope that if we ever need your help (which we think we will), you will not deny it to us.</p>
      <p>We are also comforted by the hope of recalling this most illustrious man, Lord Lismaninus, who was exiled from here by the work of the wicked. But to say something about our churches, we have nothing except that freedom (with all the gates of hell raging) has been granted to all the children of God, from which we would also expect the number of the pious to increase daily, if the introduced discipline would exclude those who offend others with scandals from the assembly of the good. We hope this will happen more easily in the presence of these most illustrious men when the matter is addressed. More, if there are any things worthy of report, can be related to you by this one, whom we never wished to be a mere messenger to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious men. May God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, preserve you for his church and guide you with his Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Given at Secomini on the 20th of June in the year of salvation 1557.</p>
      <p>Felix Cruciger, Superintendent of the Reborn Church of Christ in Lesser Poland, in the name of all ministers and nobles united in the faith of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men in doctrine and piety, ministers and professors of the holy church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed lords and brothers in Christ.</p>
