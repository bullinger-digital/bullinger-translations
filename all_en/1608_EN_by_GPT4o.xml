      <p>This second letter is old, [it] has come back to me, yet nothing new, since Schertlin has successfully come through.</p>
      <p>A large powerful monastery in Lorraine has given the servants a prize; because the abbot, after thirty humble requests, did not want to send out any provisions.</p>
      <p>The Count of Mansfeld has scattered and dispersed the soldiers who were mustered at Thannhausen, and over 20 have been stabbed; many more have been lied about.</p>
      <p>The cavalry is all along the Rhine, up to 8000 horses. The infantry of Duke Maurice is around Nördlingen and at Dinkelsbühl.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is in Innsbruck, where it is completely quiet and there are no troops with him; but the prince is supposed to arrive with 25,000 Spaniards, and the soldiers who were mustered at Rothenburg in Schwaz are being led out to the Ehrenberg Pass, which Marcell Dieterich had previously taken. It is said strongly that His Imperial Majesty wants to make the Duke of Württemberg an elector; but I do not believe it; for it has no rhyme or reason, and it is not fitting for him to transfer the electoral dignity to other principalities.</p>
      <p>The council is scattered and dispersed. Mainz and Cologne are lying in Ulm, as they have come from the council; they dare not go further with these people. Dated April 5.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
