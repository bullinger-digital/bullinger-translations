      <p>S. I cannot write much; because the weather is so bad that I did not think anyone would travel; now I come to one in the city. Therefore, forgive me.</p>
      <p>From Trento, two are supposed to come, one going to Thusis, the other here to the Crown; they are supposed to say that there was an uproar among the priests in Trento; about 30 are said to have remained in the town. About 400 citizens are said to have gathered together, intending to strangle the priests. But their plan was revealed in such a way that the opposing party armed themselves. From this, this uproar is said to have followed, and, as heard, 30 died.</p>
      <p>I do not know if these things are true; they have affirmed it firmly. However, one has gone to Zurich (he escaped me), the son of Paul from Thusis; his name is Reget. There you may inquire further; because it was spoken of in his father's house, if he knew anything about it. His brother Stoffel has said it here many times, and today the innkeeper at the Wild Man told me and the consul. The land scribe from Davos has been here these days; he reports that the young Enderli Sprecher from Davos has come from Trento; he said how a cardinal (I cannot name him) wanted the innkeeper's wife, and when she resisted, he wanted to force her, and she screamed, the innkeeper came with his servants, stabbed him, and threw him into the water that flows by (he named the water; I forgot the name). There he was only found on the third day far below Trento.</p>
      <p>This might have given cause for the uproar. The one from Reitnau comes from there, reports that some cardinals are riding back.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand has urged the Pope to stand still. But this.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
