      <p>Praise be to God always, June 17, 1560, in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>My heartfelt loyalty and love be with you, my beloved lord. Today, I received a letter from you; thus follows my prompt reply.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter with the Taler, concerning the stable master at Terviß, to whom your son is supposed to be indebted, I truly cannot know how the matter stands; however, I will send your enclosed letter, which you sent to me, to Zacharias Bürer. With the 2 guilders, I will instruct my servant that if he has not spent the money, he should not give it to anyone else; for it has already been arranged and paid in another way and, in God's name, with your handwriting to me, to whom I should give it, I will pay it immediately, so that you will not be inconvenienced in any way. Also, I have received the booklets and your present and thank you most highly, until I can also deserve it. I ask you, do not spare me.</p>
      <p>Given in great haste.</p>
      <p>May God with His grace and blessing be with you and all of us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Konrad Semly.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Heinrich Bullinger, my greatly beloved lord, in Zurich.</p>
