      <p>S. P. Most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, I had decided to visit you; I have fallen into a fever here, and I do not dare to commit myself to the journey and proceed further; I am deeply sorry.</p>
      <p>I received these letters from friends to be delivered to you, and I entrusted them to this messenger; I ask that you send him back to me as soon as possible along with your letters to friends; I myself, God willing, or my servant, will deliver them. Mr. Hooper had asked me to inform Mr. Sebastian, the schoolmaster in Zürich, to send Mr. Hooper the lectures of Mr. Bibliander; he will compensate for the work undertaken. The book by Mr. Bibliander on the doctrine and life of Peter is eagerly awaited, and your remaining Sermons are desired with even greater longing; for they are so in demand that nothing surpasses it. Mr. Hooper could not write to all friends; he wanted me to greet all friends, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, Mr. Gesner, and Zwingli, and Mr. Consul.</p>
      <p>I ask you, my dear Mr. Bullinger, to kindly offer these greetings in my name to all.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Hooper sends many greetings to both you and your wife. Mr. Hooper is so occupied with sermons and consultations that he barely has time left to speak with friends. I have not seen a more diligent Englishman, nor is he swayed by gifts, with which the English are usually inclined to anything; he points out abuses, criticizes vices, and shows the true way to the only mediator. There is such a gathering to him that there is hardly enough space left.</p>
      <p>He has the king's favor and many from the senate. I wish in every way that in your letters to Mr. Hooper and to Mr. Canterbury you would recommend the Bibles printed with you and our labors; it will add no small authority. I would wish for another copy of the Consensus on the Eucharist along with the letter attached to Mr. Calvin; for the copies sent by you I gave to John Cheke, the royal tutor; if you have time, I would like you to write to him; for he is a man of much reading and sincere. Mr. Utenhovius and Martin greet you and your wife. Our senior archbishop and his brother give your lordship great thanks for the sent books and consolation; they pray that they may always be included in your prayers; if Mr. Omphalius had been present, they would have responded.</p>
      <p>I have not seen Mr. Caesarius, yet he is still alive. That good Harmann, who recently sent you letters, eagerly awaits a response; I ask you to reveal your opinion in three or four words. He has not read your judgment attached to the Consensus; he plans to visit you in the winter, he does not dare to stay with us longer because of the Imperialists. The younger archbishop is to be inaugurated in Cologne with great pomp by Imperial mandate. We must pray to God that all things are completed in peace. We expect in Brabant, Holland, Flanders that dreadful Spanish visitation in every way to be detested; I fear for many good people. The Bible of two translations is expected; I wrote to Mr. Froschauer to print it. Greet all friends in my name, and you too farewell happily.</p>
      <p>Yours in all things, Johann Birckmann the elder wrote. To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zürich, my lord and esteemed friend.</p>
