      <p>S. D. What I received from our Beza last week, you receive here, dear brother; I have taken care to have it transcribed for your use. In the meantime, a noble man came to us, who said he was coming directly from the court; he reported that there were serious conflicts in France, as one party urges the king to persecute the gospel and restore the papacy, while the opposing party resists; also, the king's entry has been postponed to January, to prevent the outbreak of disturbances; the kingdom's assembly has been postponed to August, but in the meantime, envoys from the provinces are coming to the king to offer him a confession of faith; for they want to preempt the assembly, in which they fear prejudices against the truth. It is not known what the king has replied.</p>
      <p>We must pray to the Lord incessantly, that the Lord, by His grace, may settle those serious disturbances and thwart the plans of His adversaries. There are princes and nobles who have the gospel at heart and promote it; there are other princes and powerful ones who obstruct it together with the cardinal, bishops, and clergy. They recognize that if France receives the word, it is over for their reign; therefore, they fight as if for their altars and hearths.</p>
      <p>However, I see the zeal of these people burning, while ours languish and many are lazy. In this matter, I am consoled by the apostle's words: "You see what our calling was, that not many were noble or powerful, etc.; but God chose the foolish things of this world to confound human wisdom." We expect our Julius from England every day.</p>
      <p>Our people have not yet returned from Baden; however, it is said that the court day is finally set for St. Gall in Einsiedeln, etc. I wonder what is happening in the Duchy of Württemberg and what has been done in Ellwangen.</p>
      <p>Justus Velsius was here, who also sought public debates in Heidelberg, Strasbourg, and Basel; he presented us with some writings more obscure than the Sibylline leaves and left after receiving our response. He is not an unlearned man, but one who is confused about what he says and asserts, and we must constantly deal with such confused people.</p>
      <p>A certain confession has now appeared, I don't know where, which almost wishes to restore the monarchy of Praxeas; the author wants to appear to think orthodoxly, but he rejects and despises the Trinity, and finally, he does not so much explain the Athanasian Creed as he entangles and rejects it. Such are indeed the minds of many today, who neither know nor want to know any antiquity and therefore invent new things every day. May the Lord convert them! Farewell with Matthias and all your families and all good people.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 4, 1561.</p>
      <p>There is a preacher, Joshua Schleher, who came from Glarus at the beginning of this year, having been accused of breaking the peace; he stayed here. Three weeks ago, he went to Pfäfers (although he was warned against it); on his way home, he was arrested in Wesen. May God grant that it goes well for him!</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, his esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
