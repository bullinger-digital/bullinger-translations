    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the information on the Concord matter and is pleased with the good reception of the letter from the Swiss Reformed by princes and estates. Is glad to hear about the progress of the evangelical preaching in England. Could not write earlier; must assist the Reformed in many places of his [bailiwick] with their property rights. Has written to the town clerk [Werner Beyel] regarding his son [Hans Jakob] and his cousin; will come to Zurich in a month and continue to deal with the matter. Greetings. Is in concern.</p>

      <p>Revered, well-learned, noble, especially dear lord and brother. The grace of God through Christ Jesus, our only redeemer, along with my friendly greetings and willing service, be with you, etc.</p>
      <p>Gracious, dear lord, I thank you for your friendly report on the Concord matter, which you have written to me recently, and for your friendly offer (accommodation) towards me. God willing, I may be able to repay and deserve it. I am also pleased to hear from the princes and estates of our religion that they have received our response well. May God continue to increase Christian unity, etc.</p>
      <p>I have also been particularly pleased to hear that the word of God is being preached so freely in England, in the hope that if they accept it with love and are grateful, God will work much good through it.</p>
      <p>I also ask you not to be angry that I have not written to you recently; at that time, I was burdened with construction and other affairs, so I had no time. Knowing also that in many places, which are attached to the gospel in my administration, my predecessors have been quite negligent, I now help them as much as possible, namely with the distribution of parish goods and some chaplaincies, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, gracious, dear lord and brother, regarding your writing about the town clerk's son and my cousin, I have written to him what was previously dealt with against another, and if he should happen to make a mistake or otherwise wish to withdraw, I would not find the matter bad at that place. I assume, however, that I will come to Zurich in about a month, and then, with the help and advice of other relatives, I will take up and handle what is possible and appropriate.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God, the Lord, to continue to promote divine matters. Greet Master LÃ¶wen and all the examiners for me.</p>
      <p>Lastly, I have been put in turmoil; I have come into great unrest. God is the master, so that he does not let people act according to their will, etc.</p>
      <p>Given at Rheineck, Sunday, the 20th of October in the year 1538. Your always willing friend and brother Hans Haab, bailiff in the Rhine Valley.</p>
      <p>To the revered, well-learned lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord and good friend, to hand.</p>
