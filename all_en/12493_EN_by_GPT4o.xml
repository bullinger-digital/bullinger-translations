    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to the imminent public school examination, Bullinger can only briefly address Blarer's letters [No. 2437 and No. 2444]. He regrets that Blarer's encounter with [Hans Wilhelm von Laubenberg] was fruitless, although he knows well that almost all Schwenckfeldians are incurable. It is a grave offense to attack and distort the mystery of the incarnation of Christ.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Should [Konrad] Hofherr lay down his pride, it would benefit him, and he would behave more respectfully towards Blarer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger knows that Emperor [Charles V] wants to harm the [Schmalkaldic] League. He has heard from traitors that the Confederates are inclined towards the Germans. Therefore, he sent a Burgundian messenger [Jean Mouchet de Poligny?] to Zurich, who appeared before the council on [May 10] and presented an exceedingly friendly letter from the Emperor. In it, the Emperor emphasized, contrary to the rumor, that he plans nothing against the Confederates but is friendly towards them. Some believe this! If Blarer knows who is behind this matter, he should report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Blarer should also provide information, if possible, about the extension of the [Schmalkaldic] League and its meeting in Frankfurt, as well as the Imperial Diet in Regensburg and the alleged desire of the people of Strasbourg and Ulm to withdraw from the [Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger does not know if [the apparition at] Lucerne, which is also spoken of in Zurich, is credible. For if God wanted to warn a people, he would not inform only one or two drunken fellows. The rumor about the discovery of incorrupt corpses at Kappel is fabricated. The gentlemen from Kappel [Steward Hans Steinbr√ºchel and Dean Peter Simler] confirmed this at Bullinger's inquiry.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The butcher [...], whom Bullinger did not meet, delivered Blarer's last letter [No. 2444] with the enclosed copy of [Bullinger's] letter to Melanchthon [No. 2404]. May the last letter have good consequences, especially since Bullinger does not love disputes. The letters for [Jakob] Ruf, [Rudolf] Gwalther, and Benedikt [Euander] were delivered to each personally. Since then, Bullinger has not encountered Ruf.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- He must now go to the examination.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. The upcoming public examination of our schools compels me to be very brief, dearest Ambrosius. I am responding to your two letters. I regret that your meeting with the disciple of Schwenckfeld was fruitless, although I see that almost all of his disciples are nearly incurable. It is indeed a grave offense to attack the mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God and to twist it to our own understanding. May the Lord have mercy on them!</p>

      <p>If Curio is wise, he will lay down his pride and take better care of his affairs and show more respect for the benefit you offer him.</p>

      <p>I have no doubt about the Emperor's hostile intentions towards the Evangelical League. Listen to what he has planned these days! He has noticed that the Swiss are inclined towards the Germans. There are also traitors among us who report to the Emperor about what is happening here. He has sent a messenger to Zurich with orders and writings. They are now exceedingly friendly (well-disposed). It is not known that he has ever written more amicably to Zurich and the common Confederates. The opinion is that he will present to the Confederates as if he intends nothing unfriendly or deceitful against them, etc. That is not the case at all! He is well satisfied with them, etc., and they should not believe anyone who claims otherwise, etc. You understand what this pertains to. Some believe these flatteries, others see through the deception. If you know in which pot and where this brew is cooking, let us know. The messenger was a Burgundian and appeared before the council last Monday.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>If you have any information about the renewed league, the assemblies either in Frankfurt or Regensburg, let me know. Some think that the people of Strasbourg and Ulm will request a release. What do you think?</p>

      <p>I do not know if what is said about Lucerne is true. There is also such a rumor here. No one believes it. For when God wants to frighten and warn a people through signs, he does not let the signs be seen by just one or two drunken fellows, but, etc. The rumor about the discovery of incorrupt bodies at Kappel is clearly fabricated, for I have asked the gentlemen of Kappel about it myself, since the rumor was also here with us.</p>

      <p>Now I respond to the last letters, which the butcher (whom I did not see) brought to me yesterday. I received the letters addressed to Mr. Melanchthon, and I pray to the Lord with you that they may have good outcomes. For I do not delight in discord. I delivered the letters addressed to Ruf, Gwalther, and Benedikt to each of them personally. I have not yet met the surgeon, who is otherwise familiar to me. I cannot write more now, for I am called to the examination.</p>

      <p>Farewell, then, with all your people. Zurich, May 13, 1546. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful servant of Christ, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, my dearest brother and truly my own. Constance.</p>
