    <p xml:id="regest1">Expresses gratitude for the benefits received during his visit to Zurich. Has good hope for an improvement in Zurich's situation, although the council shows a certain weakness. Messengers sent from Bern into the countryside have reported that the willingness to take to the field in the event of an attack on the reformed faith is generally present. Bern now has a courageous council. Bucer will strive to improve the opinions of Bern and Basel about Zurich. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, esteemed brothers.</p>
      <p>Since I cannot repay you, I pray that Christ will repay the benefits you have bestowed upon me. I am very hopeful that your affairs will improve, now that you have been granted such a harmonious and strong spirit among your ministers of the gospel, and above all, a spirit urging faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom all things are founded. Your council indeed shows a certain weakness, as everything attests, but Christ will dispel this through your ministry and His spirit. With as much diligence as possible, I will commend your republic to good people here. However, if I am not mistaken, your people have been somewhat forgetful of their duty towards these. For this council here is unaware of the saying: "What we cannot lift, we must let lie." Indeed, nothing of this was in their minds, as it is declared that when the Five Cantons threatened you so greatly, they sent envoys to all their subjects to explore what spirit they had to bring you aid, and they reported that all would assist to the best of their ability, not only their own lords but also anyone they wish to support for the cause of religion. However, they requested that other leaders be appointed, if anything happens, who would lead them against the enemy as soon as possible, not as in the last war, where they were held back for so long. Moreover, everything in the city is so prepared that they would have come to you at the first sign of movement, and it seems not unjustified that they are pained that your people concealed all their plans from them in the recent action with the Five Cantons. They now have a truly pious and wise consul. It cannot be that those who sincerely love Christ, of whom there is a good part here, do not embrace you with sincere love. Therefore, dearest brothers, make an effort to remove this discord among you. It is to be feared that some remnants of the spirits, about which you know the rest of the Swiss, almost all, complain, may prevent them from being more familiar with the people of Bern. For not only when it was already being negotiated to settle the recent dispute did your people refuse to send envoys to Aarau. Trust is to be placed in God alone, but in the meantime, the goodwill of no one, especially those who agree on religion, should be rejected. Suppose some Bernese envoy responds with something like: "What we cannot lift, etc.," the council itself should have been asked. What if those who desire the kingdom of Christ to be diminished exaggerate the sins of the Bernese and others to prevent the strengthening of the spirits of the weaker ones by some alliance? I do not doubt that there are very pious people in your council, but I seem to see them not so much abhorring war as any kind of unrest more than enough, and then being very fearful. But Christ is accustomed to exercising His power most especially in our weakness. Your people swear they will not fail the Bernese if anyone attacks them. They have sworn no less solemnly to do the same if any force threatens you. I will strive here and in Basel, as far as possible, to ensure they think and hope well of you. Instill the same spirit in your people towards these. What dear Leo entrusted to me concerning Megander and Bechtold, I will take care of with the utmost faith and hope it will be accomplished.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, most holy pair of preachers of Christ. Commend me to Pelican, Theodor, Carlstadt, Erasmus, D. Engelhardt, and other fellow ministers. Greet Beatus, so that he may go where the Lord calls him, without delay. Commend me diligently to the consul, Master Johannes Hab, Escher, and also Wertm√ºller. I will write diligently from Strasbourg about what I have learned here and in Basel.</p>
      <p>In Bern, where I arrived yesterday around the fourth hour - for the day before we had come to Murgenthal safe and happy, except that my dear companion suffered somewhat from the saddle -, May 11th. My companion commends himself to you greatly.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished ministers of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger and Leo Jud, most faithful pastors, esteemed brothers.</p>
