      <p>But whether he is freed or not, the Rhaetians do not intend to start any war from here or to make any first moves. However, we are urging our communities (which seem to be inclined to this on their own in most parts) to finally abolish and remove the monasteries of the Valtellina, especially those of Morbegno and Chiavenna, those most inauspicious dens of dragons (which should have been done long ago), and to expel the most monstrous monks to their ruin and convert their revenues to better and more pious uses. For from that cesspool, as from a fountain, undoubtedly both this and many other evils of all kinds, most pernicious to both our church and republic, have long flowed to us, as we have recently explained and demonstrated to our lords in the assemblies. For this is fitting for us, for the sake of our dignity, not only to preserve piety towards God, as a people long celebrated everywhere for their bravery, lest we become contemptible in the eyes of our enemies as cowardly and thus incite them, who are already more than sufficiently hostile to us, against us.</p>
      <p>For, to confess frankly what I feel: I am entirely led to believe that both the Pope and King Philipp (Philip) and the Austrian princes, along with others, are conspiring with the same plan, which is primarily aimed at our Rhaetians' destruction. If our people are removed or subdued, as if an intervening wall is destroyed, which has long delayed and hindered their plans, especially those forged at the Council of Trent, once they have gained control of Rhaetia (God forbid!), they would open a free path for themselves into Germany, which they especially covet, to pierce through its side the true religion, which they uniquely target, and thus seek causes for war against us from all sides. For in addition to the crime committed against Franz Keller, there is also the fact that the Austrians, in recent days, sent a rather grand delegation to the Engadin (in which there were about 20 horsemen) and dared to assert, under the pretext of a certain forest, that everything from the so-called Ponte Alto to the Ponte Martino, that is, the entire Lower Engadin, which extends about 5 German miles, properly belongs to the Austrian house or the County of Tyrol by ground and soil (grund und boden) as their own property; which our people take very badly as a new and hitherto unheard-of matter. - The rest, which is reported in letters from Venice and Rome about the Turkish fleet, which is making attacks on Apulia and Calabria, and about the Venetian expedition or fleet likewise organized against the Turks, as well as about the dreadful diseases and storms raging in Rome, I cannot now write in detail, being excluded by the narrowness of time, as the courier is in a hurry to leave.</p>
      <p>In SÃ¼s, on the 13th of July, in the year of our Lord 1568.</p>
