      <p>Regarding the Interim, it is necessary to ask about the authorities and also the preachers: Firstly, in the case that the Emperor wants this Interim to be upheld in such a way that the preachers of the Gospel are to be abolished or silenced, what then might be appropriate for a Christian authority to do in this matter.</p>
      <p>Secondly, in the case that the Imperial Majesty wants to allow the preachers of God's word alongside the establishment of the Interim, what then is appropriate for the authorities to consent to regarding the Interim.</p>
      <p>And namely, whether in such a case an authority should oppose this Interim in such a way that they would rather put themselves and their own people in utmost danger and suffer and endure everything for it.</p>
      <p>Or whether they might give such a response to the Emperor's request and say: they cannot in good conscience agree to this, and also know that they cannot justify such a thing before God in any way. But if the Imperial Majesty still wants to have it so, then let it happen, that it be established by His Majesty's decree and that they not be burdened with the enforcement of this Interim.</p>
      <p>Whether the greater power of the Emperor, which he claims to have in this matter, extends so far that one is obliged to consent to him in this case and not to oppose him with force, as against the regular authorities.</p>
      <p>Regarding the preachers: In the case that they are to be allowed to remain only under this condition, that they should not preach anything against the Interim and what is contained therein, what is then responsible for them to consent to and to do in this matter.</p>
      <p>To my very esteemed brother in Christ, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
