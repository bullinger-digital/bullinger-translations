      <p>Greetings. Your letter (most illustrious and reverend father in Christ) was delivered to me very late on Monday, which was the day of St. Gallus. I barely had enough time to read yours and Iaskei's.</p>
      <p>I give you immense thanks. The envoy shared your letters with us; but seeing that they were written rather hastily, I assumed you had other news from Germany that you were unable to write to the envoy due to the lack of time. What I had written about the Scots was fabricated.</p>
      <p>The terms of the peace, which you mentioned, the envoy has and read to us.</p>
      <p>It is intolerable to the French that the Scots want to exclude them from their kingdom. I am sending back Iaskei.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new here, unless perhaps it is new, though it is already old, about the disturbances in Rome, about which some things have been sent to Mr. Lavater.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Ferrara is said to have passed away on the 7th day of this month. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, and as you still do, keep me recommended to you.</p>
      <p>In Chur on the day of St. Gallus in the year 1559.</p>
      <p>All of ours wish you safety and health.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his much esteemed lord and patron.</p>
