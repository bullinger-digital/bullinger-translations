      <p>From the letters of your piety, not written to me indeed, but concerning me to my singular patron and most revered lord in Christ, Mr. Haddon, I perceived that you labored in my cause no less than if I had been a son, and not a stranger, and known to you least of all from letters. Therefore, how I might thank your piety for the labors undertaken on my behalf, I do not plainly find; but when I consider that you were born to help brothers and truly show yourself a Christian, one who indeed directs all his efforts to be of assistance to all, not only to the people of the present age but also to posterity, I certainly observe in no way that you yield to the greatest men, but easily surpass all in piety towards brothers and incredible diligence. There are some men, indeed very learned and truly pious, but who do not allow themselves to be willingly drawn away from their studies, even if great benefit would come to brothers from that interruption of studies; but you, on the contrary, seem to have nothing more important or prior than to interrupt, in the midst of your greatest labors of ministry, the necessary and most useful studies for the church of Christ, and that not for a short time, to assist this poor little one already placed in some difficulties. Therefore, I would gladly embrace with some grateful testimony how much I value your goodwill towards me; but this your more than paternal piety towards me surpasses all speech, indeed even thought. Therefore, what remains is that I will strive greatly so that you may not seem to have recommended an unworthy person. But that you may have yourself excused with me, good God, who am I, that you, being such as all ought to revere, should bear it with difficulty in your greatest occupations that this little man, even your beneficiary, has not been answered, who would rather undertake anything than be an impediment to your studies in any matter. Therefore, I give the greatest thanks I can to your piety, and since nothing else is in my power, I will always be mindful of your goodness in my prayers, which I pray to the most good and great God through Christ the Savior that He may wish to preserve for His church for as long as possible. January 9th.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety, Johannes Banks. To the most reverend father in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed Antistes of the church in ZÃ¼rich among the Swiss, and his greatest patron, greetings.</p>
