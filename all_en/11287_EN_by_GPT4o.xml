    <p xml:id="regest1">Erb does not need to apologize, Bullinger is pleased with the letters from learned and pious people. [Erasmus] Schmid recommended Markus [...] as a pastor for Volgelsheim; Bullinger also considers him suitable. He urges Erb to manage his new office according to the will and for the glory of God. He is troubled by the rumors of war and laments the religious indifference and moral corruption of the Protestants; they should not rely too much on the means of war and on allies, keeping in mind the example of the failed war policy of the Swiss Reformers.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>So far from needing any excuse, dearest Erb, for writing to someone unknown, I should rather thank you for your kindness. For the letters of learned and pious men are most welcome to me.</p>
      <p>Regarding the appointment of a minister for the church in Volgelsheim, there is nothing more for me to write. Our Fabricius has recommended to you that excellent man Markus, whom I also commend to you diligently, if he is still in doubt. For he is pious and sufficiently learned.</p>
      <p>And since you have obtained a holy and serious office, I urge you to adorn the Sparta you have acquired. We are not ministers of men, but of the eternal God. Nor have earthly matters been entrusted to us, but the safety of many souls is at stake.</p>
      <p>Therefore, with our holy diligence, we can benefit many, and with negligence, we can lose many. It is also about the glory and dishonor of the divine name.</p>
      <p>Nor is the reward set before us perishable, but immortal and eternal. Let us therefore run in our pursuit wisely and bravely. Let us bring many to our Lord, so that when He, the chief of shepherds, comes, He may grant us an unfading crown.</p>
      <p>Those tumults and rumors of wars greatly disturb me. For the ingratitude of our people terrifies me. We are sated. We disdain the word of God, we cannot endure sound doctrine. We do not want avarice, luxury, bloodshed, sacrilege, adultery, oppression, and finally the worst arts to be accused. We profess Christ with our mouths, but we live Bacchanalia. Therefore, it will come to pass that the judgment of the Lord, beginning from the house of God, will eventually reach our enemies. Would that our people were not so fierce! Our fierceness among the Swiss did not have a happy outcome. Would that others, taught or warned by our misfortune and disaster, would act more humbly! Our people also seem to trust too much in treaties and military instruments. Therefore, the Lord must be prayed to and those who are placed at the helm of affairs must be diligently instructed to do everything prudently in the fear of God and humility of heart, seeking not what is theirs, but what is Christ's.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with your spirit. I wrote later because I could not do so sooner due to business. March 14, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Matthias Erb, preacher of the church in Richenweiler, dearest brother. To the preacher in Rychenwyler.</p>
