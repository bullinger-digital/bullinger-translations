    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer sends the "Articles" of the Leuven theologians dated December 6, 1544, which were sent by [Hans] Welser and had already been confirmed by [Charles V.] in an edict dated March 14, 1544 [correctly: 1545]! He requests their return through [Johannes von Ulm]. - Welser reports that Emperor [Charles V.], King [Francis I.], and Pope [Paul III.] sent ambassadors from Venice to [Suleiman I.] on April 17 to negotiate peace. - At the Imperial Diet [in Worms], nothing has been undertaken yet; the Protestants want to negotiate peace, but this is rejected as unnecessary since [Paul III.] has convened a council. - Blarer is surprised that [the Zurichers] do not adopt [the military art of Konrad Zwick] despite [Heinrich von Ulm's] efforts. - It is reported from Augsburg that [Johann Frederick I.] of Saxony, Maurice of Saxony, and [Philip of Hesse] have defeated the leaderless troops of [Duke Henry of Brunswick] near Münster in Westphalia. - The Spanish troops are moving towards Donauwörth. Therefore, a troop was sent from Augsburg to support them. - Since Easter, two cardinals [Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte and Marcello Cervini] have been in Trent and are behaving so disgracefully that the citizens are bringing their wives and daughters to safety. - On April 22 [1545], Duke Ludwig [X.] of Bavaria, a friend of Duke Henry of Brunswick, died in Landshut. - May the Lord save His Church from these dangers! - In Bern, there are still disputes and factions, especially among the preachers, some of whom prefer Luther's writings to their refutations. May the Lord put a stop to this! - Greetings. - [P.S.:] Blarer recommends [Johannes von Ulm and his companions]. - [Postscript:] He reopened the letter as the young people have not traveled. [Heinrich von Ulm] will arrive in Zurich with articles [by Konrad Zwick], which Blarer recently gave with a request for judgment. Bullinger should also assess them and, if endorsed, show them to [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater], while Blarer waits in Griesenberg for the return of [Heinrich von Ulm], so that [Zwick] cannot reclaim the articles in the meantime. Blarer finds everything acceptable and hopes the matter [of the military art] will now be settled before it is too late. - The Spanish troops have already set out for Austria. - Pope [Paul III.] [ - correctly: King Francis I.] has attacked [the Waldensians in] Cabrières d’Avignon and either murdered them all or taken them captive for galley service; he intends to do the same in surrounding areas. - Bullinger should go to the inn of Heinrich [von Ulm] as he is not good on foot.</p>

      <p>S. The day before yesterday, I received a letter from Welser, the best consul of the people of Augsburg, in which he sends you very cordial greetings. He sent the articles of the theologians of Leuven, confirmed by the emperor, so that the lips would have lettuce. You will observe in this writing carefully that the emperor confirmed them before they were published. For the edict itself is dated March 14, 1545, while the magisterial determination of the theological faculty is dated December 6 of the same year. Meanwhile, however, the emperor affirms that these articles were thoroughly examined in his council and found to be Catholic and holy, etc., so that no one can fail to see by what arts the enemies of truth conduct their business. Welser wanted me to send you these articles to read, which I was going to do anyway. I ask you to return this writing through this young man, the illegitimate nephew of my brother-in-law, but a very holy man. No one here besides me has read it; yesterday I was so completely tied to another stake that I did not have time to send it to my brother or other brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>Welser writes among other things: "The emperor, the king of France, and the pope sent an embassy to the Turk from Venice on April 17 to make a truce for three years. Whether it will proceed or not, time will tell; but why this should happen, you can easily consider.</p>
      <p>Nothing has yet been dealt with at the Imperial Diet. The Protestants insist on the extension of peace, but they are answered that they should be content with the previous peace granted; which, however, does not suit them. For they do not want it to last longer than until a future council is convened, and since the pope is now holding a council, which the emperor considers Christian, peace would now be out of the question. What will be achieved will soon be known. It is shameful and shows a weak trust in God that one seeks a promised peace from the world, especially from these people, since it is evident that even if they gave a hundred thousand letters and seals, and even took oaths, they would not keep it longer than until they see an opportunity to attack us, not considering themselves bound to keep it with us, whom they regard as damned heretics."</p>
      <p>I am truly amazed that your lords do not adopt the matter you know of, despite my dear brother-in-law's efforts and faithful reminders; for I have no doubt that if they understood my dear cousin's intentions and foundation properly, they would act very differently, and my dear brother-in-law, after I have now opened some articles to him in confidence, is completely moved and restless again, as he certainly means an alliance with trust [...].</p>
      <p>At this moment, I receive a letter from Augsburg that the Duke of Saxony, also Duke Maurice of Saxony, and the Landgrave have set out against 3000 men, who are in the area around Münster, without a lord in Westphalia, to the detriment of the Christian understanding. They wanted to have a decision from them, but found no good decision; for they did not want to name a lord on whose behalf they attacked them, fought with them, scattered them, killed the greater part, and kept the victory.</p>
      <p>Now, on the date (which is May 3), 3000 Spaniards with 2000 baggage train are coming to Donauwörth; there they are to remain until further notice. My lords from Augsburg have sent a company of soldiers to Donauwörth in the city for comfort.</p>
      <p>So you know that two cardinals have been in Trent since Easter; they lead such a shameful, impure life that the citizens of Trent are fleeing their wives and daughters from the city so that they are not defiled by these holy people.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, not much special news at this time, etc., except that Duke Ludwig of Bavaria died in Landshut on April 22, who was a secret enemy of the gospel and a special friend, helper, and advisor of Duke Henry of Brunswick. All this from Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Let us cry out to the Lord, my soul, that He may mercifully preserve His church from these grave dangers that threaten everywhere, shorten these truly evil days, so that we may be saved as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>We hear that among the Bernese there are very serious offenses and unbearable factions, especially among the preachers, some of whom call those booklets, which were written in response to Luther, "shield books" and "fantasy books," claiming that Luther's writings are far superior. Ah Christ, Savior and Peacemaker, command these winds and the sea, so that we may finally see a calm and serene face of your bride! Commend us diligently to the Lord with all yours.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you. Farewell, dearest and best brother. Constance, May 8, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Blaurer.</p>
      <p>I commend to you these most pious young men.</p>
      <p>I have reopened this letter because the young men have not departed due to a change of plan. But here is my brother-in-law, who will discuss the matter with you, using your advice. He has with him the articles of his cousin, which he recently showed me to read, asking for my judgment on them. I have shared it with him in the highest confidence and am now alone in Griesenberg, so that my cousin cannot demand the articles from me. I will wait until my brother-in-law returns from you. Read the articles diligently with him, and if it seems good to you, then he should also let the two lords read them with measure, as he knows. I truly think it would be fair and agreeable to all. If it does not happen now, I fear that this art will be neglected later, as others are also seeking it. The 3000 Spaniards mentioned above have set out and traveled down to Austria, having not had a long stay here.</p>
      <p>So the pope has now, three weeks ago, through a legate, who then made several thousand soldiers, attacked Caprian, a small town, located somewhere not far from Avignon, and acted very tyrannically there, killing everyone and capturing several men, whom he intends to send to the galleys. He intends to deal with some other surrounding towns in the same way, for the sake of God's word.</p>
      <p>Given on May 13, 1545.</p>
      <p>Be willing to make an effort and go to my dear brother-in-law Heinrich in his inn; he is not well on foot.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed and dearest brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
