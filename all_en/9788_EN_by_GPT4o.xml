      <p>S. I am returning these letters to you, most esteemed lord and godfather, which I wish I could have delivered myself. I have been summoned and invited by my brother to the wedding of his daughter; however, the weakness of my feet prevents me from daring to undertake such a long journey; yet perhaps someone from my household will come. I rejoice that we are finally united by some kinship and connection because of your son, Johann Rudolf, with whom we have always been most closely connected in spirit, and I pray to the Lord that this union may be happy and prosperous for you and for all of us.</p>
      <p>As far as the embassy to France is concerned, I have understood your response and opinion, which I have communicated to Mr. Schultheiss Steiger, who was with me for a good while today and informed me that he is well aware that Bellievre is doing everything to nullify the mission of the embassy and, with the delay, to make the spirits of the cantons, especially the four of ours, indifferent, so that nothing will come of it; for he was here this week before the council and also presented many reasons, perhaps as with you, so that some here are beginning to withdraw and think, what is the cost, etc. But his opinion and that of the majority is still entirely and firmly that we should send, so that we do our duty and always have more favor; in this way, we can also better ascertain his disposition and other things that we would otherwise not know. He also hopes that Basel will not separate itself; he has heard that the Count Palatine has already dispatched his orators to Lyon. Other princes will do the same, and it would be just as good to visit nearby as far away. Therefore, he asks you to urge the same among yours, that it may happen.</p>
      <p>Regarding Chur, I have addressed it recently and also now, and have given them the lamentable letter of Dr. Tobias to read, as well as what those from Zurich are doing.</p>
      <p>He has presented all this before the council; but no definitive decision has yet been made about what to do here. I do not know how it will go or what is behind it.</p>
      <p>They want to see what others do or if they will be approached. I do not like this; it seems to me to be something else; yet I do not know. He who gives quickly, according to the old proverb. From Milan, regarding our admiral's course, I still have no certain information. This week, the Lord of Torn, one of the sons of the constable, who escaped with the Prince of Cond√©, has arrived here; he is still a young man. It seems to me that he would also like to winter here.</p>
      <p>Regarding our Hasler, Thretius has highly affirmed to me that he is upright in conduct and has behaved well in Krakow, having also some disciples, sons of great lords, with him, who would not have trusted him at all if they had been able to detect any falsehood in him, especially regarding this matter. Meanwhile, he has also written to me through the aforementioned Thretius and is displeased with the suspicion that has been cast upon him. I have written back to him very freely, explaining the matter and how he made himself suspicious and forced us to suspect him, and how he should now act so that we demand nothing more than that, as he brought himself into suspicion, he should also clear himself of it. We seek and desire nothing else, wishing to praise God and gladly help him if he does what he should. I will therefore hear what he will answer. If we could win him over, it would be good; for I hear that he is otherwise upright in the matter of the sacraments. I hope he has now seen and heard enough that he will adapt; otherwise, he would come home and bring such things that it might go with him as with Valentino Gentile. He has otherwise the best testimony of learning from everyone, especially that he is an excellent Aristotelian. But where am I going? Forgive me.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe!</p>
      <p>All of ours, and especially Mr. Steiger, send you their most respectful greetings. Greet all yours and ours who are there.</p>
      <p>Bern, the last day of August 1574.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
