    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for sending the judgment on the Religious Peace, which he will return shortly; at the moment it is still being read by the mayor [Diethelm Röist]. A friend from Swabia [Martin Frecht] learned from Wittenberg that [Nikolaus von] Amsdorf wrote something against the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] and sent it to Luther; this, spurred on by it, decided to write about the Lord's Supper [„Kurtz bekentnis“] and to demand a clearer confession [from everyone] in this regard; Bullinger feels sorry for the Archbishop, as Luther offers the Cologne theologian and all unbelievers a spectacle that is all too welcome; they are stupid, arrogant, and ungrateful towards Bucer. Rumor of a victory of the Persian [Shah Tahmasp I.] from the House of Sophi over the Turk [Sultan Suleiman I.]; confirmed report from Vadian, according to which the Turks in Hungary are making the worst raids with a complete lack of vigilance on our part; the rest will be told by Alexander [Rischacher].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I give you great thanks, dearest Myconius, for the judgment on the Religious Peace. I will return it shortly. The mayor is currently using it, so I could not return it to you now.</p>
      <p>I have no news, except that a certain friend from Swabia writes that he received letters from Wittenberg, which teach that Amsdorf wrote against the Cologne ordinance and sent it to the most holy anti-pope Luther, who, being stirred up, decided to write about the sacrament and demand a more exact confession regarding the substance of the sacrament. This is indeed to build churches and support the weak in faith! I pity the excellent and most pious prince of Cologne, now worn out by old age. Otherwise, Luther makes himself worthy of the matter and shows his disciples whom they adore; they would not have given such a pleasing spectacle to the theologians of Cologne and all the impious. But in those men, there is no prudence. Pride and arrogance allow them to know nothing. What, that they are also ungrateful to our Bucer? But I expected this kind of thing from them, who know nothing except what is Saxon and lard. The same rumor is here about the Turk being defeated by the Persian Sophi; but I have nothing certain, except that Vadian writes that the Turkish garrisons in Hungary are making very harmful raids, while our leaders are snoring. The rest will be told by the excellent man, Alexander. Farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 14th of September, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
