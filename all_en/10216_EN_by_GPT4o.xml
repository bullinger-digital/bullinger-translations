      <p>Greetings. I received two letters from you, to which I respond in one word that I have not been able to ascertain anything certain about what the godless are attempting. However, since you are not ignorant of what they have in mind, you can also suspect what their gatherings mean. The intention is certain, but the way to satisfy that intention is not certain. When I hear something that you ought to know, I will make sure you know it shortly, and I do not doubt that there are many among us who are concerned on your behalf, so that through them you can learn the adversaries' schemes. The Lord, on whose will we depend, will reveal everything that could harm us, provided we take care not to offend Him with our ingratitude.</p>
      <p>That persecutions press upon you is certainly, in my judgment, to your advantage. Make an effort to bring forth much fruit in patience. God will either put an end to these trials or grant that you endure them to your great benefit. May the Lord strengthen you, so that, despising the efforts of this world, you may persevere fearlessly to the end. And rejoice that the mind of the people of ZÃ¼rich is somewhat humbled. For the Lord loves such a mind. Meanwhile, pray to God to raise the horn of salvation in our hearts, wherever the world may go, so that we may be saved and not perish with it.</p>
      <p>But behold, I am sending you a very delightful dialogue between Theodor and you, from which you will understand that even the Romans and foreign nations are wise and feel the same as we do, although no one can reveal themselves without danger. Everything is permitted to Pasquillus with impunity. He speaks with Mercury, as follows:</p>
      <p>Mercury: Why do you sigh, Pasquillus?</p>
      <p>Pasquillus: I see the republic going to ruin through the fault of both the leaders and the private citizens.</p>
      <p>Mercury: Is there something you perhaps desire in these matters?</p>
      <p>Pasquillus: Many, many things.</p>
      <p>Mercury: If you were a god, what would you grant them?</p>
      <p>Pasquillus: To Clemens, clemency and piety, to Karl, magnanimity and vigilance, to Ferdinand, the opinion of a comedian, so that he may wish what he can, to Franz, fortune, judgment, and faith, to Heinrich, religion and a sound mind, to the Portuguese as much power as he can provide arrogance, to the purple senate, letters and a non-preposterous Venus. To the bishops, I would give what they do not want, knowledge, but I would take away what they desire, dominions and pleasures. To the priests, I would give wives, so that they may cast away concubines, to the monks concubines, so that they may cease to be husbands and wives to each other.</p>
      <p>Affixed in Rome by Pasquillus.</p>
      <p>Pellicanus also has something new from me, which, after being read by you and any good people, you will understand what Satan is plotting, and you will pray to God that many other infidelities and discords do not arise once one is put to rest.</p>
      <p>Farewell most excellently with all good brothers, Leo, Theodor, Karlstadt, and the rest.</p>
