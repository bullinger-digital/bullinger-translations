      <p>Greetings. A young man unknown to me, but very familiar to Mr. Carlinus due to his parent, is coming to you.</p>
      <p>He trusts that in the name of Carlinus, myself, and his deceased parent, his studies will be taken care of by you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, for your humanity, do what you can and what we trust you will do.</p>
      <p>Willingus, the court preacher of the Palatinate, would have also written to you; but when the young man left, he was absent.</p>
      <p>Do as much as you can.</p>
      <p>The Lord, who is accustomed to visit us in many ways, will repay.</p>
      <p>Our school seemed not at all suitable for him and therefore not to be visited; if he is received by you, perhaps you will educate such a one who will someday be useful to the Church of Christ.</p>
      <p>I have no news, except that there is a rumor that the Margrave of Brandenburg is assembling an army; however, it is not known for what reason; but I affirm nothing certain.</p>
      <p>I wish I could have your response sent to the Palatinate; I would return it in good faith and immediately, as well as the action of Strasbourg, which will be sent to you from Basel.</p>
      <p>Furthermore (but I write this only to you) it is secretly indicated to me that all the Swiss Cantons, indeed all the Swiss, think very poorly of the people of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>I heard three reasons: the action of Stierli, also of Tarer, hence of Molitor; two more remain, which he could not recite to me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, several thousand florins have been forced upon the people of Schaffhausen, as no justice prevails among us; they wish to erase the ancient praise of the Swiss from our people; or they return the letters of the Swiss Confederation.</p>
      <p>If these things are true, surely you have understood from the consul; therefore, I ask you to inform me; there is no reason to fear no danger here.</p>
      <p>However, I wish to know for certain reasons.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, who may keep you safe for us for a long time. Have our church commended to you and greet all our supporters.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, August 12, 1563.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your humanity, Jakob RÃ¼eger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, first and most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
