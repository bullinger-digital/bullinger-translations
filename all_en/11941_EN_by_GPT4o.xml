    <p xml:id="regest1">He implores him not to publicly respond to the insult [against Zwingli and the people of Zurich] that occurred through a private letter from Luther [to Christoph Froschauer], as a revival of the conflict would cause immeasurable harm to the churches. He has heard that [Froschauer] wants to republish Zwingli's works and ensure that this also happens for Oecolampadius's writings, but he does not consider the writings that emerged from the [Eucharistic] dispute to be beneficial. Bullinger seems to approve that [Joachim] Forrer denies the Strasbourg people communion; instead, Bullinger should explain to the Strasbourg people what is wrong with their confession, or admonish Forrer. Bucer has not yet received Bullinger's response to Cochläus, but thanks him for his efforts in the fight for the authority of the Holy Scripture. He shares his concern about the future of Germany; the Antichrists want to help the Emperor [Charles V] against the French [King Francis I] in order to better suppress [the Protestants] afterwards; the party with such intentions has greater voting weight at the Imperial Diet and is supported by princes who depend on the Emperor's favor. With the letter from the Imperial Estates to the Confederates [dated April 2], there is hope that a Swiss delegation [to the Imperial Diet] could mediate for France and bring about peace negotiations; thus, France might be won over for the fight against the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I]; if Hungary is abandoned, it could become a dangerous enemy. Only turning back to God can save Germany; in view of the strengthening of sects in Belgium and the Schwenckfeldians in Swabia, as well as the increasing persecution in Belgium, everything must be done to overcome the divisions, otherwise the church service is at risk altogether. He heard in Speyer that Pellikan accused him of deception; he asks to be treated as a brother or corrected if necessary, but assumes it is an incorrect rumor. He recommends himself and the area [of Strasbourg] threatened by war to the people of Zurich. [Enclosure:] He apologizes for his thoughtless writing; his entire effort is dedicated to the preservation of the church. He still hopes for a Swiss delegation; the French people, who are weary of the [Turks] and not averse to the true faith, could be won over if it is possible, with the help of the Confederates, to end the war against France - otherwise, an even more cruel rule of the Roman Antichrist threatens; Bullinger should consider what his task [in this matter] is.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I did not think that you did not respond because you had not received my letters. But, my dear Bullinger, do not abandon the thought of maintaining concord with so many churches and so many thousands of souls in the Lord in any way. Luther's writing is private; I believe you do not doubt how far we wished for something different. Therefore, in this time of such affliction for the churches, to renew battles, many will undoubtedly interpret it as wanting to ease your private pain with a public wound. Even among themselves, and indeed among their leaders, they do not agree; they attack each other hostily. How greatly has this delayed the course of the gospel, how many thousands of consciences has it gravely disturbed? This public evil has subsided, to revive such a horrendous stumbling block, what punishment would not more greatly terrify a conscience bound to the religion of Christ. If you want Luther to write more in this sense and publicly, provoke him; but not only Luther will come forth in this way. Suppose that many more from your side present themselves in the arena; what else can be expected from this than that many on both sides will spit insults on the ministry of the gospel, enemies of Christ will rejoice, indeed arm themselves against us, stronger Christians will be tormented, weaker ones will be cast down from the step of true faith? How much more atrocious these things are than can be explained, you will easily weigh with your pious prudence. Therefore, I beg and beseech you through Christ, as you first promised, while Luther writes nothing against you publicly, that you also wish to forgive that private injury for the sake of public tranquility.</p>
      <p>I hear that your printer has spread in Frankfurt that he wants to reprint all of Zwingli's works and ensure that all of Oecolampadius's works are also reprinted. Indeed, there are many writings of both men worthy of being frequently referred to by those devoted to piety; but those written in that so unfortunate battle, I do not see what good fruit they will bring to the churches.</p>
      <p>You seem to approve of Forrer's action; but for the saints, the communion of the church of Christ has always been of the utmost importance. It is indeed written: "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread" [1 Corinthians 11:28]; but it is not written that anyone should withdraw from the communion of that church which he cannot show to be at fault in those things that pertain to the profession of the gospel and the dispensation of the sacraments. Certainly, there is no middle ground, either we do not have the church of Christ, or he separates himself from the church of Christ. And since I wrote to you our confession, you should have either taught us that there is something in it that disagrees with the word of God, or admonished him not to alienate himself from us in the participation of the Lord's table. Indeed, if we had someone among you, since I believe you recognize not only the bread but also the true communion of Christ in the sacred supper, I would not cease to encourage him to sacred communion.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received your response to Cochläus. However, I thank you on behalf of the common church for your efforts in this matter.</p>
      <p>For I do not doubt that you handle this argument seriously and for the certain benefit of the church, as you are accustomed to. And this argument is certainly to be urged vehemently, as the malicious sophisms of the learned Antichrist attempt to undermine the authority of the scriptures.</p>
      <p>What you write about the danger to the German state is very true and foreseen by many. But what can you do, while we are so divided, while we are so scattered? Our sins press upon us; the time of vengeance has come. The Antichrists, seeing the Emperor hindered by the French from oppressing us who confess Christ, think he should be helped so that, with the French defeated, he may restrain us. They win in the Diet by votes; for the matter is so unfairly arranged that, while all the counts have only two votes in the council of princes, yet the cities have no vote at all, yet many abbots and abbesses, who have the principal title, have a place to speak their opinion. Moreover, some of the chief princes, even among our own, have serious reasons in which they need the Emperor's favor; these do not dare to say what they think. Hence it happens that everything is conducted as those wish who desire our speedy destruction.</p>
      <p>An opportunity was expected from you to withdraw from such a pernicious agreement. Letters were written from the Diet to the Swiss, in which the French are named as enemies of the Christian and German state. These were thought to effect that your people would have requested to hear the French envoys through some serious delegation; for they were repulsed when they asked to be admitted with a herald sent, and the herald was ejected with the letters not without disturbance. For although the evangelical cities have nothing in common with the French except the society of peace, yet it also pertains to them what the other cantons do, who have a closer society with the French, whom they would not want to be joined with the ally of the Turks.</p>
      <p>Since the French deny this society and the French envoys give hope that they will propose things that will open the way for restoring peace and making a society against the Turks, the request to admit and hear the envoys seems worthy of Christians. For if they bring an opportunity to detach France from the Turks, by whom they feel oppressed, and to join us against the Turks, this should certainly be eagerly seized by us. For the Hungarians, seeing themselves abandoned by all our help, surrender themselves to the Turks, to become more grievous enemies to us than the Turks themselves, because they think they have been betrayed into that servitude by our people. But if the envoys bring empty words and it appears that the king is averse to leaving the Turks and to fair conditions of peace, then the cantons allied with the French would see it as their duty to leave the French.</p>
      <p>Would that I could be with you for an hour and lament the state of Germany! What Jeremiah and the other prophets complained about the kingdom of Judah at that time, I now see fully expressed in the kingdom of Germany. Since there is only one remedy for these evils, to turn to the Lord with all our heart, I am exceedingly terrified that offenses arise so rashly among the ministers of the gospel, battles are renewed, when all should with one heart and mouth focus on the preaching of repentance. You will forgive me for freely expressing to you what pains me. I honor you in the Lord and love you; therefore, I wish you to be honored and loved by all. I am concerned for the church, which I see so miserably torn and disturbed; I therefore wish to avert what may bring greater distraction and disturbance to it. The Belgians are agitated by the most monstrous sects; the Schwenckfeldians greatly afflict Swabia; the number of the profane, who despise the communion of the church, is growing everywhere; the severity of the Roman Antichrist in Belgium is also gravely recrudescing. Let us therefore embrace each other in the Lord, let us forgive each other something, indeed many things; for we all sin. It is not a light thing, but most atrocious, for your ministry to be condemned in this way; but would that I could remedy this evil as much as it pains me! It is a fatal evil; if it prevails again, I expect the end of our ministry. I will not easily involve myself in this fight henceforth.</p>
      <p>In Speyer, it was objected to me by the Saxons that Pellican wrote something, I do not know what, that I deceived you and the Lutherans. If anything of the sort was written, I ask that the excellent man spare the common ministry in the future. I have sufficiently explained to you what I think, and I have truly explained it from the heart. If you can bear me as a brother in these things, as I wish and ask, have me as a brother; if not, teach me what is not right in that my confession. But I think it is false about Pellican, what was objected to me; for I know how gentle in spirit and friendly in mind he is towards me.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to you and my ministry, I commend also this region, which will undoubtedly bear the wrath of God with the city, unless the impending war is averted, not lightly this year. Farewell in Christ the Lord. April 18, 1544.</p>
      <p>M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and most faithful servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, his brother and venerable fellow minister.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I am now quite disturbed for various reasons. Therefore, I ask you to forgive, if I have written anything inconsiderately. My purpose is indeed to sustain the church of Christ, if nothing else.</p>
      <p>What I wrote about your delegation, would that it could still be obtained! I hear the French greatly desire to be freed from their Punic allies. They detest their Sardanapalus. They are a humane people and friendly to the Germans and not averse to the true religion. Why should we betray them to the Turks and equally harsh tyrants by destroying them ourselves? If the Roman Antichrist prevails, a worse and more atrocious severity than the Koran will be imposed on us. For now, it is becoming a capital offense everywhere to read the gospels in the vernacular or even to speak of Christ. Now these Antichrists have certain hope of achieving this most monstrous wish of theirs with the French defeated. Indeed, the zeal for Christ is chilling in a horrendous manner even among those who seemed to have embraced evangelical piety with the truest hearts. Therefore, whoever can do anything should labor to avert the present war, but on the condition that this impious Sardanapalus the Frenchman abstains from the Turkish alliance and the madness of waging war, by which he always destroys himself and others.</p>
      <p>To this end, none can do more than the Swiss. For they would certainly achieve something if, by a common delegation of all the cantons, they requested to hear the French envoys from the states of the empire, with the protestation that your people will not support the French if they reject fair conditions of peace, but will not desert them if - with him offering fair peace and unheard and not condemned even by the states of the empire - innocent France should ask. Many and more powerful princes wish for any intercession to be made. They would support your people, so that so much evil may still be averted, especially since the affairs of Hungary are daily being handled worse by the Turks. Therefore, consider and do what you yourself will think is your duty. Farewell and love me who truly loves you.</p>
      <p>The same as before.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the best and most learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed in the Lord fellow minister and dearest brother.</p>
