      <p>Strasbourg, 10th August 1553.</p>
      <p>Greetings. What I wished for in my previous letters, dearest Bullinger, I now send to you: the disputation of Dr. Peter Martyr and the booklet on the Eucharist. I did not want to deprive you of such joy any longer, although I do not know if you might have received it earlier; but if you have received it, I have nonetheless fulfilled my duty. You will praise the diligence and labors of the most learned man in every respect. A fierce battle was fought with men who are excessively sharp and perverse; yet he won the victory, which is certainly a great joy to all good people. If Cambridge could be adorned with such a man, how fortunate our England would be! Some men of the highest order in England wish for Musculus to be substituted in his place; however, as I hear, he refuses the position. Yet I dare to promise that if he wishes to undertake this duty, he will gain no less favor with the king and all good people than Bucer himself, nor will Dr. Peter find the scholars of Cambridge and Oxford so perversely learned. For the alumni of this academy were always suspected of heresy, as they call it, by the old learned and unlearned, from which you could easily judge that their studies were always more sincere than those of the Oxonians; for from there emerged Cox, Hooper, and, whom I should have named first, Cranmer and other such learned men, nor is there any reason to dread this calling; for it is more honorable to aid a kingdom than a city. Therefore, casting aside all human doubt, in my judgment, he would perform the duty of a Christian if he finally acquiesced after being called so many times; but if he does not, he will scarcely escape the suspicion of being faint-hearted and less vigorous. As for the rest, I do not doubt that you will act with the man; if he could be persuaded, let me know; I will ensure that he is provided with travel expenses and whatever else is necessary. I wish his wife and children well.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends. Farewell. In the news sent to Valentinus Nu√üboum three days ago, I mentioned everything I knew, and nothing has happened in the meantime. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your entirely, John Burcher.</p>
      <p>I would eagerly wish for your booklet, in which you responded to Luther's latest slanders, along with the booklet of the same slanders.</p>
      <p>There are those who have your response, but lack Luther's booklet; therefore, I would like both combined, so that Luther's slanders and errors and your response can be seen.</p>
      <p>To Dr. H. Bullinger, dear friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
