    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for the late response to his letter [No. 1537]. [1.] The question of the creatureliness of Christ is raised by people who, instigated by the devil, renew old heresies and deny the corporeality of Christ. Whoever questions the continuation of the latter beyond the resurrection questions the entire work of redemption. Without the bodily resurrection of Christ, sin and death would not be overcome. In Christ, our own bodily ascension into heaven is assured, as Tertullian, supported by Paul, teaches. The claim of a "deification" of the body of Christ is as false as the denial of his bodily ascension into heaven; this devilish heresy leads to the denial of the resurrection and thus to the greatest ungodliness. Christ will transform our body, just as his own body was glorified; the debates about its creatureliness are idle. There is nothing wrong with reading the Church Fathers despite certain dangers; Bullinger recommends writings by Tertullian, Jerome, and Augustine on the question at hand. Refers to the biblical testimonies and the Athanasian Creed for understanding the incarnation. [2.] As for the sacraments, the simple apostolic doctrine was corrupted four to five hundred years ago by the introduction of philosophical categories. According to the teaching of the apostles, we partake in the redemption, which is founded in Christ's death and resurrection, through faith. In addition to this doctrine, Christ has given the church the sacraments as visible signs. The Lord's Supper is a holy act ordained by Christ. Through this, the content of the doctrine - Christ's salvific death - is visibly affirmed. The Lord's Supper is like circumcision, a seal for the assurance of the church; only the Messalians considered the sacraments superfluous. The sacraments are named after what they signify, but remain in their nature what they are; this applies to circumcision and Passover as well as to the [Old Testament] sacrifices and baptism. Accordingly, the words of institution of the Lord's Supper are to be understood; Augustine also interpreted them this way. The later introduced paraphrases of the real presence of Christ do not correspond to the biblical testimony and are contradictory. The sacrament represents what is received in faith; sign and thing correspond to each other but must be distinguished. The accusation of Nestorianism is unjustly raised; however, the union of both natures in Christ does not mean that his body is everywhere. Christ gives himself to the believers as spiritual nourishment, while his body is in heaven; his sacrificial offering is appropriated through faith. Through what we see in the meal, faith is strengthened. We are also reminded that we are members of the body of Christ. Bullinger has already commented on the rite in the previous letter and in "De origine erroris." [3.] Whoever, despite better knowledge, communicates with those who teach the bodily presence of Christ, causes offense to both the strong and the weak and thus sins. Abstaining from the Lord's Supper would be less offensive in this case than participating. However, it would be better to seek out a congregation where proper teaching is given. Müller should not give up his position, as God can use him as an instrument to free the Württemberg churches from the compulsion of a superstitious doctrine; it would also be in the interest of the prince [Ulrich of Württemberg] to advocate for this; Müller should pray for the church.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The envoys of your most illustrious prince, through the treasurer of our city, delivered your letters, most distinguished and esteemed sir, to me faithfully and promptly enough from Baden; to which I would have undoubtedly responded if it had been possible amidst my duties. Since I could not, I beseech your kindness not to take this amiss and to consider my response favorably. I write not what I should, but what I can.</p>
      <p>[1.] The question of whether Christ is a creature and how he became a creature is an old one, proposed, debated, and agitated at various times by the marvelous arts of the ancient serpent. Those who revive it today follow, in appearance a different opinion, but in reality the same as the authors and teachers of the old error and wicked doctrine. The old dragon, ever like himself, continually bruises and bites the heel of the blessed seed and exercises enmity by contending with the virgin's seed and its members. For in this, the new and recently born heresies agree with the old ones, that they do not fully confess the true humanity of Christ, but rather, through their vain thoughts, they cast it into doubt and even deny it. Marcion, Cerdon, and Manichaeus claimed that Christ assumed a phantom, not a true body. Valentinus, although he did not entirely deny the flesh of Christ, nevertheless denied that it was assumed from the substance of the virgin; for he feigned that it was brought from heaven, not formed in the virgin's womb from the substance of the virgin.</p>
      <p>Apelles followed them and indeed attributed a body to Christ, but an airy and starry flesh, which flowed through the virgin as water through a reed. When those monsters were silenced, the spirit of the old serpent raised other instruments to attack the most hated flesh of the triumphant Christ.</p>
      <p>Today, therefore, there emerge those who, with their hypocrisy, holy life, and sweet golden words, write and dispute about whether Christ is a creature in glory, as if they were the most faithful and zealous defenders of the glory of Christ. They do not want to appear to share even a little with the old heretics and errors denying the true flesh of Christ; yet, while they most openly assert that the Lord Jesus ceased to be a creature in glory, what, I ask, do they deny other than the very flesh of Christ?</p>
      <p>But the new heresies are condemned with the old ones by the son of thunder, John, thus thundering: "Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God. And every spirit that does not confess Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not from God" [1 John 4:2-3]. Do they think it sufficient to confess that Christ came in the flesh up to the sacrifice, and after the sacrifice, he put off the flesh? Or is it rather believed that the word of coming encompasses the whole mystery of redemption? But who ever thought or taught that the mystery of redemption is completed by birth or death alone? Are not the resurrection of Christ from the dead, his true ascension into heaven, and his session at the right hand of the Father rightly counted among the merits of Christ? Certainly, the Lord himself said in the Gospel: "I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father" [John 16:28].</p>
      <p>With these few words, he wished to explain and enumerate the mystery of redemption, and yet he also recounts those things that followed death. The Apostle Paul in Romans 8 [34]: "It is Christ," he says, "who died, indeed who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us." And in 1 Timothy 3 [16] he says the same: "Without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness.</p>
      <p>God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory." Therefore, since the word of coming comprehends the whole mystery of Christ, surely he who denies that Christ came in the flesh, who denies his flesh from the resurrection, denies as much as he who denies it before the resurrection. Indeed, to deny the true flesh of Christ in the resurrection and after the resurrection, that is, to teach that Jesus Christ in glory and after glorification is no longer a creature, is also to render the death of Christ useless and to subvert the chief fruit of his passion, indeed the whole Gospel.</p>
      <p>I do not want you to believe anything from me here unless you find that the Apostle Paul himself taught what I have just said. Therefore, consult him in 1 Corinthians 15, where among other things: "If Christ has not been raised," he says, "our preaching is in vain, and your faith is also in vain; you are still in your sins; then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished" [1 Cor 15:14, 17-18]. For unless Christ had truly risen from the dead with his true body - according to which he is a creature - who could have proved that sin was abolished by his death and the underworld weakened? "For the sting of sin is death" [1 Cor 15:56]. Therefore, if he had remained among the dead, death would have conquered him, which would have retained him in itself, and therefore it would follow that sin was not expiated.</p>
      <p>But now, because he truly rose from the dead, he has clearly shown that death is overcome and therefore that sin is expiated. "For the wages of sin is death" [Rom 6:23]. And sin supplies strength to death, so that with this overcome, sin must also be removed. Hence, the apostles of Christ pressed no other article of our faith more fervently than the resurrection of Christ, as can be seen in Acts. Paul certainly placed the whole business of our salvation on this article as on the firmest foundation. Testimonies exist in Romans 4 [22-25] and 10 [9], 1 Corinthians 15, Philippians 3 [10-11, 20-21], and elsewhere, especially 1 Thessalonians 4 [13-18]. But the apostles unanimously and with one voice taught that Christ truly and with his true body rose again, from which it is necessary that he is and remains a creature even when glorified. For Peter, instructing Cornelius in faith, said: "God chose us as witnesses of the resurrection of Christ, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead" [Acts 10:41]. And Luke, explaining or describing this meal: "Jesus," he says, "came and stood in their midst and said: 'Peace be with you.' But they were terrified and thought they were seeing a spirit or a ghost. Therefore, the Lord said to them: 'Why are you troubled, and why do such thoughts arise in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.' And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. But while they still did not believe, he said to them: 'Do you have anything here to eat?' And they offered him a piece of fish and a honeycomb, and he took it and ate it in their presence" [Luke 24:36-43].</p>
      <p>From these, your prudence easily understands how many arguments can be drawn, which demonstrate that the Lord Christ is also a creature in his glorified body and in glory, that is, the apostles explicitly taught that the Lord Jesus truly rose with his true body. Nor is it without great mystery that we know our flesh, a creature, I say, acts in heaven in Christ. For the ancient Tertullian rightly and truly said in his book On the Resurrection of the Flesh: "The mediator of God and men, Christ, having taken the deposit of both parties," he says, "also keeps the deposit of the flesh in himself as a pledge of the whole sum.</p>
      <p>For just as he left us the pledge of the spirit, so he also took from us the pledge of the flesh and carried it into heaven as a pledge of the whole sum to be gathered there someday. Be secure, flesh and blood, you have usurped both heaven and the kingdom of God in Christ! Or if they deny you in Christ, let them also deny Christ in heaven, who denied you heaven." So much for Tertullian, whom I would not believe unless Paul had first said: "Our conversation is in heaven, from which we also expect the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be conformed to his glorious body" etc. [Phil 3:20-21]. Now, as they participate with the old heresies denying the true flesh of Christ, with whom they also serve the devil by spreading deadly poisons in the church, so it is certain that they also communicate with those who do not fully and plainly confess the true ascension of the Lord. Carpocrates claimed that only the soul and spirit of Christ, not the flesh, were received into heaven.</p>
      <p>Apelles taught that Christ, in his ascension, returned to each element what he had borrowed in descending and incarnating, and thus, with each part of his body dispersed, returned only his spirit to heaven.</p>
      <p>How little, I ask, do you believe they differ from those who dare to teach with great confidence that Christ is not a creature in glory? For if Christ is not a creature in glory, he lacks a true body, therefore he did not bring his body into heaven, and thus our flesh does not inhabit heaven in Christ. How little difference do you believe there is between asserting that Christ indeed ascended, but that divinity meanwhile absorbed humanity ("vergottet sein"), and asserting that Christ ascended into heaven, but that the flesh meanwhile vanished into air? Both are indeed to deny the flesh of Christ. Thus, thus Satan deceives us and offers the old errors and ancient poisons covered with new colors, and attacks the Lord Christ and his blessed flesh, lest it be true what is said: "I will put enmity between you (the serpent) and the seed of the woman (namely Christ and his members), he will crush your head, and you will bruise his heel" [Gen 3:15]. For indeed, Satan crushed the heel of Christ, his very humanity, through Caiaphas and Pontius Pilate long ago, now he attacks the same in these his members and tries to trample it in the hearts of the faithful. Moreover, this unfortunate doctrine about Christ no longer being a creature in glory paves the way for all impiety, so that finally even the resurrection of the flesh is denied, which is indeed the head and sum of all impiety. I think this needs no proof.</p>
      <p>However, that the resurrection of the flesh is denied and lost to the church by this doctrine, I show thus. Our bodies rise in the same way that the body of Christ rose. For Paul teaches this in 1 Corinthians 15 [13, 15-16, 20-22] and many other places. But if the flesh of Christ is deified and absorbed by divinity, so that Christ is not a creature in any part of himself, it certainly follows that our bodies will be such, that is, to be annihilated. Christ "will transform" (as the apostle says) our lowly body to be conformed to his glorious body. Therefore, the Lord himself has a body, and according to it, he is a creature, who according to divinity is the creator. But he says significantly "will transform," not "will annihilate" or "will transubstantiate" or "will deify," but with the substance remaining, he will give and clothe it with another form, namely incorruptibility. Therefore, he also did not cast off or dissipate his body in heaven, but retained it, so that he is still in glory the true God and man and according to human nature a creature, and a desirable creature to all, through whom we are certain as by a pledge interposed, that our bodies too are to be transferred to heaven after judgment. Thus, I say, the apostles, the teachers and masters of the whole world, taught. Let us therefore hold to these things and be in them, most esteemed brother in the Lord. Let the new disputes about creatureliness cease, which once secretly and with the marvelous cunning of the ancient serpent restore the whole college of heresies and heretics.</p>
      <p>However, I do not disapprove, most esteemed sir, that you inquire about the opinions of the ancients on this matter. For it is sometimes useful to have consulted them, so that we may at least learn from them what the opinions on the same matters were in former times, how they were either confirmed or dissolved by disputation. Although to carefully examine each of them and adapt the genius of each to their writings is a great labor and not in all cases of such fruit, not to mention the danger that threatens readers who are not diligent everywhere. I know that they are not always consistent with themselves. I know how obscurely and ambiguously they sometimes discuss. But this is to be attributed to the gravity of the cause and the wicked arts of the adversaries, which had to be guarded against everywhere. For I will say nothing now about how the best minds are so wearied by long disputes that through nausea and annoyance they often fall away from themselves. But if you have the leisure and desire to know the writings of the ancients on this matter, that is, to read those who wrote on related questions, read Tertullian On the Flesh of Christ and On the Resurrection of the Flesh, also at the end of the little book he wrote against Praxeas. However, this writer is the most obscure and difficult among the ecclesiastical writers I have read, yet not the most useless, although he too has his blemishes. Read the divine Jerome to Pammachius against the errors of John of Jerusalem and begin reading around the middle of the little book, where you read thus: "Let us pass from here to the famous question about the resurrection of the flesh and body" etc. Also read the little book of Saint Augustine On the Christian Combat. In the books On the Trinity, he discusses these matters most fully. I have been pleased to pursue these matters copiously because I easily understood from your letters how much you desire to hear my opinion fully, which I perhaps touched upon too briefly in my first letters. Indeed, the ardor of writing was more fervent at present than when I wrote the former.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, how Christ became a creature, I think you understand from what the apostles said clearly enough that God became man. For John: "The Word," he says, "became flesh" [John 1:14]. Paul and John said: "The Son of God came into the world" [John 11:27; 1 Tim 1:15], "God appeared" or "was manifested in the flesh" [1 Tim 3:16], also "God took on the seed of Abraham" [Heb 2:16], that is: God was incarnate and born of a virgin.</p>
      <p>The manner of conception was explained in more detail by the archangel Gabriel to the virgin mother in Luke chapter 1 [30-35]. But the manner of union and the point of conjunction of the most diverse natures, I think no human can express. It is enough for us to know that God united man to himself in such a way in one person, that the same Christ is both true God and true man, one, not divided, subsisting in two natures, each retaining its own nature. I brought forward some scriptural testimonies in my previous letters (if I remember correctly). And the great bishop of Alexandria, Athanasius, in his creed, beautifully, piously, and learnedly embracing and confessing all these things, says: "Although Christ is God and man, yet he is not two, but one Christ. One, not by conversion of the divinity into flesh, but by assumption of the humanity into God. One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person. For as the rational soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ." [2.] As for the question of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper and the Eucharist, it always seemed easy and clear to the faithful of old. Only four to five hundred years ago, through new questions, it became marvelous and inextricable. For they began to dispute against the sacramental nature of signs about transubstantiation, about the marvelous, I say, conversion of bread and wine into the natural and substantial body and blood of Christ, about accidents subsisting without a subject, about the unworthy eating the true body of the Lord, about adoring, enclosing, and sacrificing the Lord's body under the species of bread and wine. They learned this way of disputing about the Lord's Supper, about substance, I say, accidents, about the subject and species from the apostles of the Lord, of course! As if we did not know that those foreign questions and novelties of words were not sought from Solomon's portico, who taught that the Lord is to be sought in the simplicity of heart, but from the human, supercilious, inflated, affectatious, and interpolating academy of philosophers. But what has Athens or the Sorbonne to do with Jerusalem?</p>
      <p>What has the academy to do with the church? The church certainly received and believed from the tradition of the apostles that Christ, the Son of God and the undefiled virgin, died for the sins of the world and was raised for our justification. And all who truly and sincerely believe that the death of Christ is their life, the resurrection of Christ is their justification, finally that Christ himself lives in them by faith in such a way that after Christ they desire and wish for nothing more for perfection, have everything in one, who also exerts a life-giving power in them. This is indeed the very reason for our salvation, which is proposed by our Lord and the holy apostles in varied ways of speaking. For now the Lord says: "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life" [John 4:14]. Soon, with the figure of speech changed, but the same remaining, though with different words, he teaches the same thing and says: "I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst" [John 6:35]. Again: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him" [John 6:56 (Vulg. 57)].</p>
      <p>Likewise, the apostle John in his canonical letter: "By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit" [1 John 3:24].</p>
      <p>And: "Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God" [1 John 4:15]. Therefore, just as food sustains the body, nourishes and strengthens it for works, so faith in the incarnate and suffering Lord invigorates, vivifies, and preserves the soul. Again, in the Gospel, the Lord says: "I am the vine," he says, "you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, bears much fruit, for without me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me, he is cast out as a branch and withered" etc. [John 15:5-6]. With these, I say, and similar paradigms, sentences, and figures of speech of all kinds, he commended the mystery of his redemption to the church through apostolic doctrine, which doctrine he wanted to be perpetual among the faithful, first indeed, that God and his benefits exhibited to the world through Christ might be made known to the world. Then, that faith in God through Christ might be taught. Finally, that from faith, charity and the duties of a pious life might be planted, with the Holy Spirit of God breathing and supplying growth.</p>
      <p>According to this evangelical doctrine, the Lord also instituted sacramental signs and handed them over to the apostles, the apostles to the church. These are sacred actions, consisting of prescribed words or promises and rites, divinely instituted for the church, to seal divine promises, exercise faith, and represent and set before the eyes heavenly gifts (to be received by faith) through earthly and visible things, finally, to visibly gather the church and remind it of its duty. Among these, after holy baptism, the Lord's Supper is celebrated.</p>
      <p>This indeed is a sacred action divinely instituted. For the Lord says: "Do this," he says, "in remembrance of me" [Luke 22:19; 1 Cor 11:24].</p>
      <p>He commands to do something, namely what he himself did first: "And he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and giving it to the disciples, said: 'Take, eat; this is my body'" and what follows [Matt 26:26-29 par.]. With obedient and simple action, we express this, we celebrate the sacred action. And this indeed is the very rite prescribed by the Lord. The apostle had handed this same over to the Corinthians. And when they had somewhat corrupted it with certain abuses, he himself, repeating it, restores it and says: "What I received from the Lord, I also delivered to you" [1 Cor 11:23]. As if he says: "It is unjust and impious to hand over any other rite in this sacred matter than that which the Lord himself, the first and best author of this sacred thing, instituted." Hence, Saint Cyprian the martyr in the second book of his letters, letter 3: "When something is commanded by divine inspiration and command, it is necessary for the faithful servant to obey, excused before all, because he arrogantly assumes nothing for himself, who is compelled to fear the offense of the Lord, unless he does what is commanded. But know, Cæcilius, that we have been admonished that in offering the cup the Lord's tradition is to be observed, and nothing else is to be done by us than what the Lord did first for us" etc.</p>
      <p>However, the promise that is sealed to us by this symbol and which the Lord attests is not what some think, that by divine power the bread is turned into flesh, the wine into blood, but that the Lord Jesus himself gave himself for us unto death, namely the body to the cross, and that he shed his blood for the remission of the sins of the multitude. And this promise must be received by each with lively faith. In this respect, the sacrament here does not differ from the doctrine, which we spoke of a little earlier - for it refers to the same redeemer and shows the same Christ dead and raised, teaches and admonishes us to trust him as our liberator and redeemer -, except that the doctrine is content to effect this with words, this sacrament further and more proposes the same thing through a symbol to the eyes, whence it is rightly judged to be a visible testimony and seal that Christ truly and as certainly died for us as certainly as these things are now done by the faithful at the command of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Divine Paul called circumcision a "seal" or sealing or, if you prefer, a seal of "the righteousness of faith," by which God, as it were, sealed that faith justifies. But the same reasoning applies to the sacraments. Therefore, the Supper is also a certain seal, by which the Lord attests to us his redemption, so that as often as this is celebrated publicly, so often the seal of truth is brought forth to the church, by which it is secure and certain that it is asserted and sanctified by the body and blood of the Lord. "Indeed, the faithful are sealed with the Holy Spirit," as the apostle says, "and have the pledge of the Spirit in their hearts"; nevertheless, the Lord wanted to use words and signs for the church. For here the Lord, as often elsewhere, imitating the custom of men, is not satisfied to promise the excellent thing unless he attests and confirms the same with tablets and a seal provided. The enthusiasts, whom others called Messalians, after receiving the Spirit, taught that the sacraments were vain and superfluous.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, to make all these things clearer, by divine usage and especially because of similarity, the signs acquire the names of the things they signify.</p>
      <p>For neither substance nor nature pass over and are converted into the things they signify; for with the natures distinct, each part retains its own property. This can be demonstrated by enumerating all the sacraments and their nature: Circumcision is called a "covenant" in Gen. 17 [11]. But who does not know that circumcision and the covenant are so distinct in their natures that neither is by nature the other. For the covenant is that bond by which the Lord bound and joined himself to the seed of Abraham, promising to be their God, the Satisfier or Fulfiller, provided that they also have him as their God and walk before him with integrity. But circumcision is the cutting off of the foreskin. Because circumcision by its very rite refers to a certain purification, which God promises in that he promises to be their God, and which he requires when he says: "Walk before me and be perfect" [Gen 17:1], therefore it is rightly said that circumcision is the covenant of the Lord, which is the sign of the covenant, as is explicitly expressed in Gen. 17 [11]. Now also in Ex. 12 [11] the ceremony of the paschal lamb is called "Passover" or the "passing of the Lord." But it is most manifest that the passing of the angel in Egypt, by which he passed over the houses of the Israelites, broke into those of the Egyptians, and struck down the firstborn, is one thing, and this solemn ceremony is another. But because this by a certain similarity refers to the passing of the angel of the Lord, therefore the name of the thing signified is rightly attributed to the sign. For the Lord himself: "And this day shall be to you for a memorial" [Ex 12:14]. In the same way, sacrifices in the law of the Lord are called "sins" and "sanctifications," but by their nature, they were not this very thing that they were called, but sin and the remission of sin were signified by them, as the apostle says in Heb. 10 [3-4]: "In sacrifices there is a remembrance of sins every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins" etc. Thus, the baptism of the Lord is called "washing" and "remission of sins," as Ananias said to Paul in Acts 22 [16]: "Arise, wash away your sins," when he advised baptism. And divine Peter in Acts 2 [38]: "Let each of you be baptized," he says, "in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." Who here is so foolishly superstitious as to say that water is by its nature the washing away of sins and that water is converted by the presence of God into divine washing? For we know that the minister outwardly washes with water as a sign, but inwardly the Lord sanctifies, and water by a certain similarity refers outwardly to the mystery that the Spirit of God works inwardly. For thus the Baptist distinguished: "I indeed baptize with water, but he will baptize with the Holy Spirit" [Mark 1:8 par.]. And Peter 1 Pet. 3 [20-21]: "Baptism corresponds to the flood, which also now saves us, not by the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God."</p>
      <p>And what will now prevent us from explaining these expressions: "The bread is the body of Christ, the wine is the blood of Christ" in a sacramental manner, that is, that by these signs the body and blood of the Lord are signified to us, by which the Lord spiritually feeds his own to life, just as outwardly the minister of Christ represents and offers or presents those very things by the signs? Therefore, bread and wine remain in their substances distinct, the body and blood of the Lord. But bread and wine are called "body" and "blood" because of similarity and memory, not because of conversion or substance and nature. For the Lord adds: "Do this in remembrance of me" [Luke 22:19; 1 Cor 11:24-25]. And Saint Augustine in his letter to Boniface 23: "If," he says, "the sacraments did not have a certain similarity to the things of which they are sacraments, they would not be sacraments at all. But from this similarity, they often also receive the names of the very things" etc. The same teaches more copiously to Evodius in letter 102 and in the tractate on John 63. Finally, the same author (who did not express his own opinion, but what was then the opinion of the whole catholic church) explained these words of the Lord "This is my body" [Matt 26:26 par.] as: "This signifies my body or is a figure of my body." If you require the places, they are: Against Adimantus, the disciple of Mani, chapter 12, in the prologue of Psalm 3, etc. To what end now, I ask, is it to scatter clouds in this most clear light and to weave philosophical questions about omnipotence and miraculous presence or to infuse words most alien to all apostolic and ancient theology and to add to the words of the Lord: "bodily, naturally, and substantially" that the very natural and essential body of the Lord, as it was born of the undefiled virgin, is present, and therefore that the very bread is converted by divine power and presence into that very body and that the very bread presents the natural body of the Lord Christ to all who receive it really. For it is certainly not true. But who does not understand, thus they understand, as the master says, again Pope Nicholas, also N. "It is to be firmly believed." But how little firmness these have and how alien they are from the truth, they are refuted not only by the scriptures and the nature and genius of faith but by their own words. For they soon add: "but not qualitatively, quantitatively, locally, and circumscriptively." For if the true, essential, and natural body of the Lord is present here, it certainly has its quality and quantity and is in a place. For concerning the glorified body, the angels also testify: "He is risen, he is not here; behold the place where they laid him" [Mark 16:6]. Indeed, the Lord himself: "A spirit," he says, "does not have flesh and bones as you see I have" [Luke 24:39] and what follows.</p>
      <p>For you know what is read in Luke 24 [36-43], so not everything needs to be written here. But if it does not have place, quality, and quantity, it is not natural, substantial, and corporeal, that is, the true body of the Lord. For Saint Augustine rightly and piously said to Dardanus in letter 57: "Take away the spaces of places from bodies, they will be nowhere, and because they will be nowhere, they will not be. Take away the bodies themselves from the qualities of bodies, there will be no place where they are, and therefore it is necessary that they are not." Who, I ask, is so dull of nose that if he hears a natural and substantial lamb is given to him, where yet it is immediately added by him who offers the gift: "but not substantially, qualitatively, or quantitatively," he immediately understands that he is being led by the nose? Why then do we wonder or refuse to understand their deception, who swear to present the substantial body of the Lord to us, but then take away from that body what without which it cannot be a true body and such as they preach? They object that it is gross to speak of the lamb that is given, that they speak of a mystery. If therefore they acknowledge a mystery, why do they so severely urge the substantial, real, and corporeal presence? Why do they contend that the real and natural body of the Lord is to be eaten really?</p>
      <p>They say we have and deliver bare and empty symbols. Indeed, we confess that concerning the sacraments two things are to be considered, the sign itself and the thing signified; as in the Supper, the sign, namely bread and wine, and therefore the whole rite, not this alone, but rather for the sake of which these are so celebrated: for Christ, I say, who delivered that rite to us in such a way that he signifies what he bestows on the faithful, namely that he died for sins, that we might live. Those who will live, whoever eat his flesh and drink his blood. They eat and drink who believe those things were given into death for them. Those very ones who believe this also participate in this external Supper, by which the whole mystery of salvation is represented to them. Therefore, they eat the very body of the Lord by faith and feel the life-giving power of Christ within them (for we do not speak of faith as a bare speculation, but as a life-giving power of Christ), with the mouth of the body the sign of the body. And these two remain so distinct in their natures that neither passes into the other, but there is a double food here, a double minister and a double guest. There is a certain visible bread and wine, the invisible Lord Jesus at the right hand of the Father. Not that he is invisible by his nature, but that his operation is hidden, but yet effective in the saints, who see him with mental eyes, not bodily eyes.</p>
      <p>The minister of the church, who administers the sacrament, is a man. The priest, who satisfies the soul, is Christ. The outer man receives the sign, the inner participates in the thing signified. For the Lord Jesus lives in the faithful and abides in him through faith and operation, not through bodily presence, according to which he is in heaven, thence to come only at the judgment. Hence it is clear that we more fully and rightly recognize the mystery, it is also clear that we do not celebrate empty and vain symbols, but effective through him who instituted and lives in his own.</p>
      <p>As for the Nestorian dogma that some object, we do not recognize it at all, but we condemn Nestorius with his foreign dogma; we confess, however, that Christ is true God and man, and we confess one, not two, "whom we therefore also call the only-begotten, remaining in two substances, as the truth of nature has conferred on him, not with confused or mixed natures, as the Timotheans and Eutychians, ancient heretics, wanted, but united by association and in one person. Therefore, God assumed man, man passed into God, not by the convertibility of nature, as the Apollinarists say, but by the dignity of God, so that neither God was changed into human substance by assuming man, nor man into divine by being glorified in God. For change and convertibility of nature make diminution and abolition of substance." Let them see, therefore, from what spirit they weave their arguments, who, because of the union of natures in one person, diffuse the humanity of Christ everywhere like the divinity. For the truth clearly pronounces: "And after this I am no longer in the world" [John 17:11]. Again: "I leave the world and go to the Father" [John 16:28] etc. And Saint Augustine in the same letter to Dardanus: "He is to come," he says, "to judge the living and the dead in the same form and substance in which he ascended; to which he certainly gave immortality, he did not take away nature. According to this form, he is not to be thought of as diffused everywhere.</p>
      <p>For it must be guarded against, lest we assert the divinity of the man in such a way that we take away the truth of the body. But it is not consequent that what is in God is everywhere as God" etc.</p>
      <p>Relying on this eternal and infallible truth, plain and sacrosanct, we clearly and openly teach that the body of Christ is in heaven bodily, but in the Supper, he offers himself to his own not bodily, but spiritually, that is, as he remains at the right hand of the Father with his true body, he vivifies his faithful who rightly, that is, in faith and love, participate in his Supper and cleanses them from all sins, through the merit of the body given and the blood shed. Therefore, we do not confuse the sign and the signified, we do not mix the body and the bread, the wine and the blood, but we say that a sacrament is made from two things remaining in their substances, of which one is perceived by the body, the other by the mind. Concerning the body of the Lord, we do not teach contradictory things, as to say that the body of the Lord is truly present, but meanwhile to strip it of the properties of a body. Rather, we confess that Christ is bodily in heaven, and therefore in one place of heaven, as Augustine also said, because of the mode of a true body, and that this same Christ, the true God and man, satisfies and vivifies his faithful on earth celebrating the sacred things. Moreover, we teach that for this satisfaction and life, redemption and salvation to be perfected in the faithful, it is not necessary for the natural body of the Lord to be present on earth. "For Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many, and the second time (δευτέρου) without sin he will appear to those who wait for him for salvation," Heb. 9 [28]. And of this faith, we are neither ashamed nor regretful, knowing that the evangelical faith of the centurion is so commended by the Lord that he plainly confessed that he had not found such faith in Israel. But what was that faith like? He did not think it necessary for the Lord to be present bodily, but "only say the word" (he said to the Lord) "and my servant will be healed" [Matt 8:8 par.]. But Thomas also heard: "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed," John 20 [29]. Therefore, we will be blessed enough if we believe that Christ suffered and was raised for us, of which the Supper is indeed the seal, to which we come as to the testimony of the body truly given for us and the blood shed for the remission of sins.</p>
      <p>The same is also an exercise of faith. For seeing the bread broken in the Supper, we think of the body of the Lord given for us. Seeing the wine poured out, we think of the blood of the Lord shed for us and the rest, which the examination of analogy supplies. Moreover, exercised faith progresses more and more, so that Christ himself lives more and more in us.</p>
      <p>Let us add to these the other purposes and fruits of this divine banquet. Those who become participants of this table openly profess their faith, that they are of the body of Christ, indeed spiritual members of it, in which the head effectively works through the life-giving Spirit, and finally members of the whole church, brothers and companions of all who call on the name of Christ. Thus Paul said: "We, being many, are one bread, one body, for we all partake of that one bread" [1 Cor 10:17]. Therefore, we are also reminded of our duty in this Supper, namely to think of whose head we have been made members - of Christ, the Son of God -, and to give thanks worthy of him and praise the great benefit of his death. For Paul says: "Proclaim the Lord's death until he comes" [1 Cor 11:26]. Finally, we are reminded to think that we have been made members of Christ and all the saints, to live holy, pure, and innocent lives, and to pursue all members with brotherly love. Since we teach and confess these things from the heart, it is unjustly objected to us by some that we celebrate an empty and vain Supper and banquet without a host. Nor did the ancient church believe or teach anything else about this sacrament than what we have touched upon here.</p>
      <p>Concerning the rite by which this sacred thing is to be performed, I have discussed a little in the previous writings and copiously in my second book On the Origin of Error. For now, I cease to dispute this question, having discussed it more copiously than I had intended.</p>
      <p>[3.] Finally, I come to the question in which you ask whether it is permissible to receive the Lord's Supper from the hands of those who teach and believe that the natural body of the Lord is given and received in the Supper and that those who do not approach with such faith eat unworthily. By the communion of the sacraments, we are visibly gathered into one body, and by receiving the sacraments, we profess our faith. For we publicly testify by the very act whose faith and profession we are of.</p>
      <p>Divine Paul testifies to this very thing especially in 1 Cor. 10 [14-22] and after him divine Augustine in the book Against Faustus 19, chapter 11: "Men cannot be gathered into any name of religion, whether true or false, unless they are gathered together by some visible fellowship of signs or sacraments" etc. Therefore, when you receive the Supper from their hands and communicate with them, who teach and believe that the natural body of the Lord is eaten in the Supper, who would not give you the symbols if they knew you did not believe so, you indeed publicly confess and attest by public reception that you are a member of that body and believe as they teach it is to be believed. Moreover, if you believe so, you believe what is handed down by no word of God, therefore that faith of yours will be an opinion and not true faith. "For faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God" [Rom 10:17]. If you do not believe, but simulate and publicly testify by reception that you believe, you undoubtedly sin against the Lord and your own conscience by your lying and hypocrisy, and you sin against the church. For you offend both the strong and the weak. The strong, rightly instructed, think of the Lord's Supper as you do and as the scripture itself commands to think; therefore, they understand that the doctrine of those who teach otherwise is in error. Therefore, when they see you, whom they know to be of their profession, communicating with those who hold a different truth, they will think you have either become a hypocrite or have departed from your former and true opinion. The weak are otherwise offended by that gross opinion of the bodily presence of Christ; they do not know where to turn, what is true or what to rightly believe.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when they too see you approaching and participating in their banquet, they will think you are also of the opinion that the bishops teach concerning that Supper. Hence, each will think to himself: "Unless this outstanding man and expert in religion had the faith that the bishop of the sacred things teaches, he would undoubtedly not communicate with them; why then do you, being ignorant of all things, hesitate to approach?" Therefore, he approaches, but not with a whole conscience. But the blame for these things is rightly imputed to you by God. Meanwhile, by your example, those who condemn the truth and wish to persuade all churches of their abuse and error concerning the Eucharist as the most certain truth are confirmed in their error.</p>
      <p>Since I cannot safely advise you to sin against God and your own conscience, and also against the holy church, to simulate a faith you do not have, and in this way confirm those in error, shake the strong, and make yourself suspect to them, and also place a stumbling block for the weak, I do not see how you can safely and holily communicate with them or how it is right for me to advise you to approach against your conscience.</p>
      <p>You indeed offend many, I know well, if you entirely abstain from their Suppers. And it seems to be much less dangerous than if you approach. For the strong are confirmed by your example, the weak think more and more that there is a reason for your abstaining. They will not be able to accuse you of impiety and contempt of the sacraments if they do not desire piety in the rest of your life. But you will be a terror to the teachers of error and their followers.</p>
      <p>There will be another way by which you can avert the offense, if you visit a teacher and church among your own, which sincerely acts in this cause. Here, here you may approach with great faith and rejoicing. For I think there are many among your people who neither simulate nor dissimulate here, but propose the truth as it is. I advise in good faith, do not entirely abstain from the Lord's Supper, wherever you can find and obtain the Lord's pure Supper. For the most divine, most faithful, and Spirit-filled men did not neglect the external use of the sacraments, while they meanwhile felt the inner operation of the Lord, but with the greatest zeal and desire demanded them to be given to them. The Acts of the Apostles alone can testify to this. And I was very pleased that in your letter you wrote with such affection that you desire from your heart to give thanks to your Redeemer as he instituted. May the Lord increase his Spirit in you and complete his work begun in you to the glory of his name. Amen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I do not advise you to abandon your calling, but rather I encourage you and pray through the Lord not to abandon it. You can benefit many here. What if the Lord wishes to free the churches of Württemberg from this most grievous burden through your faith and ministry as through a chosen instrument? For who would not find it difficult to hear those mournful words at that joyful banquet: "If you do not believe you are eating the natural body of the Lord bodily, do not approach. If you approach, you will eat judgment to yourself. Unless you believe so, you will be condemned for heresy and justly exiled to foreign lands." These, these burn and press upon holy consciences and open a window to tyrannical persecution. Therefore, I pray to the Lord to give you in your heart and provide ample opportunity by which you may prudently and calmly avert that gross, superstitious, and intolerable opinion about the Lord's Supper and tyrannical cruelty from the churches of the saints and restore to them the true and genuine, simple and pure. Would that the most illustrious prince rightly understood and weighed this matter! He would undoubtedly be happier in other things. But if you think my advice and pious wishes in the present will have neither place nor fruit, come, let the will of the Lord be done; at least keep yourself pure and sincere and win those you can for the Lord. Above all, pray to the Lord to have mercy on his church.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 22, 1541.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours from the heart.</p>
