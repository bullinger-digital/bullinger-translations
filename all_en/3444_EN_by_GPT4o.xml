      <p>Greetings. That I have interrupted the habit of writing for many months now, I certainly do not want you to consider it an indication of a changed disposition towards you; but from that time on, I have been occupied with various and troublesome, rather than great or continuous, affairs, so that I seem to have forgotten not only my friends but also myself to some extent. Therefore, you are certainly not the only one who misses this duty from me.</p>
      <p>However, I will try to satisfy both you and others in this regard in the future, although I do not seem to be able to be freed from this trouble, which somehow takes away all the joy of life from me, until I have left this province.</p>
      <p>You do not desire that I explain this to you in more detail, nor would I have said so much unless I wanted you to consider another reason for my cessation than a diminution of our friendship, as far as I am concerned. Certainly, wherever I am, I will be yours, and when I have departed from here, which I have long requested and almost obtained to be permitted as soon as possible, I desire this very frequent correspondence between us through letters; but some method must be found that can certainly be safe.</p>
      <p>If I can find such a method, I will indicate it when necessary. I sent your letters to the royal procurator Coignet.</p>
      <p>I can write nothing new.</p>
      <p>Our armies in France are now ready for action.</p>
      <p>The inconvenient season may perhaps prevent anything significant from being undertaken; but there is both strength and spirit to attack the enemy very fiercely next spring. May God turn everything for the better, than it seems to be according to our judgment and, as I think, the opinion of any human intellect, for the tranquility of Christians. I will always gladly assist my guest from Zürich, both for your sake and his own merit, in whatever way I can. I have heard nothing about his son, but I will try to find out where he is.</p>
      <p>But as far as I know that nobleman with whom he set out (and I know him very well), he should fear nothing from his son, but rather hope for any honorable and grateful service. But such is the inherent negligence and carelessness of the French nobility regarding their affairs, that I am not surprised that the guest's son has not yet been sent back with the money that his father lent to the nobleman.</p>
      <p>I saw the letters of that nobleman, which he wrote to the guest himself, in Baden, in which he excused himself for not yet having sent back the son. There was not a single letter from the son, which surprised me; but nevertheless, I do not distrust his letters. If it were my affair, I would fear nothing from it; however, I would not want to guarantee even about a less doubtful matter. I reveal to you what I feel; you will judge for yourself if it pleases you so.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, December 24, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Sanlaurentianus.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, brother and best friend, etc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
