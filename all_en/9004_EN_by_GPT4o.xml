      <p>When you wrote to me about how my gracious lord at Rheineck and our lord brother-in-law, the bailiff, are supposedly being heavily accused here before our gracious lords and elsewhere, I have no knowledge of it.</p>
      <p>However, I do know that honorable men from Rheineck and Ellikon, whose names I do not know, came to me for advice and did not complain at all about the lord or the bailiff, but rather expressed their concerns about those from Martalen, as if they were trying to draw the parish and all the people solely to them. They desire that they be allowed to remain in Rheineck as they have for 41 years under the peace of the land, and if it would not harm, they would gladly ask our gracious lords to also request their gracious lord of Rheineck to let them stay, etc. I replied:</p>
      <p>"That does not harm my understanding, as long as you desire to proceed in a petitioning manner. I hope my gracious lord and lord brother-in-law, the bailiff, will not deny our gracious lords, as they have behaved amicably so far, and you are right to desire to remain with your old parish. Trust also my gracious lord, when he realizes that Rheineck is one of the oldest parishes in the diocese of Constance, he will not want to have the word among future generations that this old parish was lost under his gracious rule" etc. Upon this, the honorable people went from me to my gracious lords and presented their case there as they had shown me, and I have not understood that they acted otherwise. If something more severe was presented, it is not for me to know.</p>
      <p>Truly, they would not have kept it from me. But you know well how the advocates act; they speak much out of temptation, which is not entrusted to them, etc. Two of my lords have been sent out, by either of whom I have seen since, etc. My gracious lord could indeed do nothing better, more honorable, and praiseworthy at this time than if he would give them the new church, which is not needed, until the other is built, and their gracious lord would be as he has been and others before him have been. Since his grace has so far held the name of a good, honorable lord, he would also have more favor and fortune. May God grant him and all of us His grace. Greet the lord brother-in-law, the bailiff, etc., and if you find it good and appropriate, you may well discuss the opinion with him. I would be sorry if the honest people and they should grow in displeasure against others. The times are strange.</p>
      <p>Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>From St. Gallen, August 19:</p>
      <p>We have written that the loss of the French before Mont is not over 400 in total, and the Duke of Alba has suffered greater damage; for most of his old soldiers, Spaniards, who have been stationed in Naples for a long time, have been taken by the French. Afterwards, they made a sortie from the city and severely damaged the enemy. Some write that the Duke of Alba's son has been captured. The prince is advancing successfully; the estates of those he has now taken over, Zeeland, Holland, Gelderland, etc., have agreed to give him 2 tons of gold and maintain 12,000 men.</p>
      <p>As the king in Poland has died, it is generally believed that the young Duke in Prussia, Duke Albert's son, a young, God-fearing, wise prince who loves the gospel, will be elected and accepted as king, etc.</p>
      <p>From Montb√©liard, August 25: The loss of the French, which occurred on July 17, is not as terrible as it was made out to be, not over 400. The Spaniards have suffered worse: Since then, the Eberstein regiment has been defeated near Hasselt.</p>
      <p>As soon as the one from Montels with his 2,000 horses joins the prince, they will march against the Duke of Alba. The French and Geuzen are also said to have taken Bruges in Flanders.</p>
      <p>"Between Langres and Bassini in Lorraine, about 4,000 French, etc., along with 5 cornets of knights on the priests, etc.</p>
