      <p>To the noble lady N., Countess of East Frisia, etc., our gracious lady.</p>
      <p>The grace of God along with our willing services are before your grace. We humbly ask your grace, above all, to graciously and favorably receive this our letter; for, having heard of the faith your grace has in the Lord Jesus Christ, we hoped that our writing, as we are preachers of such holy faith in Christ, would not be unwelcome to your grace. We thank God, our heavenly Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that He has opened the true faith to your grace and given it into your heart, and has also so richly endowed you that your grace preserves and demonstrates such faith with truly good works. We pray to the Lord Jesus Christ that He may increase this faith in your grace and maintain it in His confession and all kinds of good works until the end. For the blessed apostles, the true teachers of the holy Christian church, have truly taught the true faith in Christ Jesus, through which alone we are justified before God, and thereafter the good works that arise from faith, especially the works of love and mercy. The holy apostle James rightly says: There will be a merciless judgment on those who have not shown mercy. What does it profit if someone says he has faith but has no works? If a brother or sister is naked or lacks daily food and someone says to them:</p>
      <p>"God help you, warm yourselves and be filled," but gives them nothing that is necessary, dear, what use is it? So it is also if someone boasts of faith but has no works of love.</p>
      <p>Therefore, your grace has done a right, good, great, and very Christian work by receiving and protecting the exiled and homeless church from England and France in your grace's land.</p>
      <p>The pious people, if they had wanted to practice open idolatry and depart from recognized truth and blaspheme the holy gospel, could have remained in honor and safety in their homeland. But since they did not want to commit such great vices and sins, but held only to the Lord Christ and His holy true gospel, they no longer had a place in their homeland, and however difficult it was, they left house and home and with wife and children went into exile, yet they ventured it out of true faith with our father Abraham on God, who also alone left his homeland on God's call and did not know where to, only that he trusted in God's grace and truth.</p>
      <p>Such troubled people and faithful, believing servants of God your grace has sheltered and thereby rendered all works of mercy not only to them but to the Lord Jesus Christ, who says in the holy gospel: "I was hungry, and you gave me food, I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was naked, and you clothed me; I was a stranger and in distress, and you took me in: truly I say to you, when you have done this to one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it to me." For elsewhere he says again in the gospel, he will not leave unrewarded even a cup of cold water that someone offers to one of his believers.</p>
      <p>So if all this is fundamentally so, then without any doubt the true faithful God will graciously bless, protect, and shield your grace, your land, and people, so that you need not fear any harm from such reception of these foreign people or dread those who are entirely opposed to the gospel, who would like to drive the evangelicals not only out of your grace's glory but also from all the earth, if they could. But the Lord God and true shepherd watches over His little flock of sheep, for the kingdom is His, and He is gracious to all who act with justice, righteousness, and mercy. David says in the 40th Psalm: "Blessed is the man who considers the poor, in the time of trouble the Lord will help him; the Lord will keep him, that it may go well with him on earth; he will not let him fall into the hands of his enemies, and when he is sick, the Lord will raise him up again." The widow of Zarephath, as one reads in the 3rd book of Kings in the 17th chapter, received the blessed or exiled Elijah as a guest and supported him very kindly with her poverty; the Lord blessed her in soul and body. So it also happened to the Shunammite woman, who hosted the prophet Elisha. When Abraham and Lot gladly received and hosted strangers, they received angels as guests, thinking they had hosted men. Therefore, great is the work of love that your grace has shown to the poor exiled church from England and France, and very great is the reward that is truly prepared by God for such work.</p>
      <p>Only your grace is admonished to persist in such good work and to continue to show grace and friendship to the poor exiles as before. All good works have many temptations from the devil, the world, and the flesh; but faith and the faithful prayer keep us until the end, so that we do not let go of the good, but with the grace of God bring it to a happy end.</p>
      <p>Thus your grace should also show our Lord God a perfect service in the reformation or improvement of religion and all worship and root out everything that has been established against the Lord's word in the papacy, such as monasteries or monasticism, altars, and images in the churches, with the holy king Josiah and the blessed emperor Theodosius; for as both aforementioned princes had such abuses, indeed idolatries, established against God's word completely broken down, they have attained great honor and praise here and there. Let your grace diligently plant the true right worship of God with preaching, so that it may grow and flourish in righteous prayer, in the godly use of the holy sacraments, in giving alms, in justice and righteousness, in abolishing vices and promoting all virtues. For the Lord not only wants us to outwardly hear His word and use His sacraments, but that we are pious and adorn our faith with all kinds of good works. Set here your grace the priests and elders in the church, who have, practice, and uphold the discipline, warn, admonish, and punish all who do not let themselves be moved to the good and right by the good word of God. The Lord says: "Have salt, that is, discipline and punishment, among you, so you will have peace among yourselves." May Almighty God grant your grace through His Son our Lord Jesus Christ peace and His heavenly blessing to the honor and praise of His name and to the comfort and salvation of His faithful church. Whatever we can serve your grace, we will always be willing. Commending your grace to God's grace and His mighty protection and faithful shield. Given in Zurich in the Confederation, which is called Switzerland, in the outgoing August of the year of our Lord 1554. Your grace's willing servant Heinrich Bullinger in the name of all pastors, preachers, and readers, etc., servants of the church in Zurich.</p>
