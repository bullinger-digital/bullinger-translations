    <p xml:id="regest1">Agrees with Bullinger; many are influenced by excessive fear or hope, but the main concern is the disunity within their own ranks, which threatens especially when the call for unity is heard; [the weakening of the opponents by] the increasing Turkish threat is only a weak consolation. The danger of a split has already been evident in previous years among the Swiss churches, when the Bernese and Baselers approached the Strasbourgers. Ambrosius [Blarer] has returned safely and sends his regards; otherwise, there is nothing new.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>You are indeed right in all things, dearest Bullinger; if only we could continue in this way! But I do not know what fear has seized the minds of some; others are enticed by some magnificent hope, which I, however, would not consider reliable. But the dissensions among the brethren terrify me more; for we would more easily endure all other crosses. Hence, the title of concord and unanimity will also kill us, which wonderfully deludes the unwary, indeed has more than once blinded the most cautious. This alone consoles me, that the Turk is again threatening most powerfully; but oh, what a disastrous consolation!</p>
      <p>Would that the Swiss churches not be torn apart while discussing concord. You did not hold together well in past years, when the Bernese and Baselers - in the judgment of some - yielded too much to the Strasbourgers. May the Lord defend you from internal strife, and us from the fear of tyrants and the flattery of certain very cunning men.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius has returned safely by the grace of the Lord and wishes you to be safe in every way. We have nothing new otherwise.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my brother, with your whole household and brethren. In Konstanz, February 8, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his esteemed brother.</p>
