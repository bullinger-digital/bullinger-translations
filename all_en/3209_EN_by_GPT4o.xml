      <p>C[oelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ Jesus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Here, Vergerius has claimed, venerable brother Bullinger, that our dialogues "On the Magnitude of the Kingdom of God" have been condemned by you as impious. However, I did not think it so easy to believe such a report from a courtly man about such a pious and moderate man and such a great and noble friend, until I was informed by you yourself about this whole matter. Therefore, I beg you by our old friendship, indeed by God himself, whom I worship with a sincere heart and faith through Jesus Christ, to remove this doubt from my mind, so that I may understand what I should do next; for none of your letters, of which you have sent me many, ever bore such a message. For even if you kindly warned me, due to a certain novelty, to be more cautious of the danger from Württemberg (from whom or by whose instigation I could easily understand), I could never even suspect from your words that you would mark it as pernicious and impious. Therefore, as I said, I beseech you by all that is dearest to you, to write to me whether you have condemned it or not, and in what manner. Farewell and greet your wife, children, and relatives, who are most dear to us, in my name, and in the name of my wife and children.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 11, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours as always, the same C[oelius] S[ecundus] signed.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and venerable man, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, most esteemed brother and lord. In Zürich.</p>
