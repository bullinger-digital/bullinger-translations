    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Due to unsettling news from Strasbourg, Myconius did not have a pleasant Christmas. However, God has somewhat uplifted him afterwards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] [Elector Johann Friedrich of] Saxony has inflicted great damage on the [Archbishop Sebastian of Heusenstamm] of Mainz. [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse is said to still be with [Duke] Maurice [of Saxony], the one responsible for this disaster. According to a report from [Johannes] Brenz from [Schwäbisch] Hall, the army of Emperor [Charles V] has split: [Maximilian of Egmont, Count] of Buren, has set out to defend the Archbishop of Mainz; the Emperor, however, is heading towards Württemberg. Nothing good is heard about the Count Palatine [Friedrich II]. Allegedly, [Duke Ulrich] of Württemberg has sent his brother Georg to the Emperor to negotiate peace. Ulm and Augsburg are said to have the same intention; indeed, they are supposedly already in negotiations! Myconius is appalled by this. What do all these people think of Christ and His Gospel? Rightly, they are mockingly asked by the sons of Belial [the devil], where their God is! Hopefully, Myconius does not lose his mind over this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Yesterday, he was truly cheered up by [Francisco de] Enzinas and [Johannes] Oporin, as they told him about the Emperor's death. As a result, he was able to sleep peacefully. But this morning, another completely discouraging letter arrived, prompting him to question the promises and omnipotence of God. Is not the Pope the Antichrist and the Emperor his servant? Certainly, we have sinned. But we have also pleaded with God for mercy. Why then does He withdraw His help from us?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Meanwhile, another letter arrived, according to which the Turk [Sultan Suleiman I] is preparing very strongly against Hungary, Austria, Bohemia, and Saxony, so that it will be hardly possible to resist him. However, this worries Myconius far less than everything concerning the Antichrist.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] From where, other than God, is hope now to be expected? Myconius wants to entrust himself to no one else. May the Lord grant him perseverance and patience.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] What the people of Constance reported to the people of Zurich and they in turn to the people of Basel about von Buren does not match [the news conveyed above]. Moreover, the rumor [from Constance] still persists. According to it, von Buren is said to have gone to "Belgium" with a corpse accompanied by many bishops. Whose corpse might it be?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Myconius is even more disturbed by the fact that the [Protestant] cities [of Southern Germany] have spontaneously surrendered [to the Emperor] and many are said to have even left the [Schmalkaldic] League. Christ must never have dwelt among them! For if the rumor is true, they have all pledged themselves to the Antichrist! Christ, save His Church! If Bullinger has anything comforting to report, he should please share it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings to the family and to [Rudolf] Gwalther and others.</p>

      <p>S. The writings from Strasbourg in recent days have been so unsettling that I spent this Christmas in great sadness, until the Lord somewhat restored me to myself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>[Elector Johann Friedrich of] Saxony has greatly afflicted [Archbishop Sebastian of Heusenstamm] of Mainz, from whom he will have a serious enemy. [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse is said to still be with [Duke] Maurice [of Saxony], the author of these troubles. From [Johannes] Brenz in [Schwäbisch] Hall, it is reported that the army of Emperor [Charles V] has been divided: [Maximilian of Egmont, Count] of Buren is setting out to defend the Archbishop of Mainz, while the Emperor is heading towards Württemberg. Nothing good is reported about the Count Palatine [Friedrich II]. [Duke Ulrich] of Württemberg is said to have sent his brother Georg to the Emperor for peace. Ulm and Augsburg are said to be considering the same, indeed, they are supposedly already doing so, which so disturbs me that I am not myself. For I see that they are all in despair, and if this is true, where is their Christ, where is the Gospel of Jesus Christ? What have they learned? Therefore, the sons of Belial rightly reproach them: "Where is your God?" This temptation also heavily afflicts me according to the flesh; I still hope my spirit is safe.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Yesterday, [Francisco de] Enzinas and [Johannes] Oporin so cheered me with news of the Emperor's death that I slept sweetly through the following night. This morning, however, I read letters that so cast me down again that I almost cried out: "Alas, Lord God, where are your promises, where is your power, where is the help promised to your followers in their needs? Is the Pope not the Antichrist, is the Emperor not the servant of the Antichrist? Do they not all fight against your kingdom? We have sinned, that is certain, but we ask for mercy, we pray for life according to your will and believe you will be gracious! Why then do you afflict us by delaying help? Be present, be present mercifully, or we perish!"</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>While I torment myself with these thoughts, other letters arrived about the Turk and his plans: He is preparing so strongly against the rest of Hungary, Austria, Bohemia, and Saxony that no one is thought able to resist him. A new disturbance, which nevertheless troubles me far less than the Antichristian one!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Thus, wherever I turn, there is not the slightest hope, except for the Lord. For He immediately says: "And you, do you want to leave me?" Then I say: "Lord, where shall I go? You have the words of eternal life!" Grant now the spirit of perseverance and patience, that we may become victors through you and be saved to life.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>About von Buren, the people of Constance said one thing to yours and they to ours. The rumor still persists, namely that he is setting out to Belgium and is carrying with him a human corpse, followed by quite a few bishops. However, it is unknown whose it is.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>What follows disturbs me even more: namely, that the cities are surrendering voluntarily (I do not believe Christ was ever there); then, that the league is said to be dissolved by many. For if this is the case, they have devoted themselves, who do this, to the Antichrist and all his blasphemies, all of them! May the Lord Jesus look upon His church. If there is any consolation, share it, I pray through Christ!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell with yours, Gwalther and others in the Lord. Basel, December 26, 1546. Yours, O. Myc.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of Christ, his brother and venerable lord in Christ. Zurich.</p>
