      <p>Greetings. I am saddened, my father, that due to the actions of certain wicked men who seek to gain from the misfortunes of others, our Robert Estienne is compelled to seek the aid of your most esteemed council. Although there is no fault of your citizen in this matter, and the entire affair pertains to one or two individuals who have long been practicing these arts, I know it is scarcely possible for Estienne to pursue his rights without incurring some resentment. Therefore, if he could have secured his affairs by any other means, or if the loss had not been significant, he would have much preferred to overlook the injury done to him rather than entangle himself in these troubles. However, since it could not be otherwise, he has considered it necessary to try this last remedy. But you will learn better from elsewhere what this business is concerning Estienne himself. As for what concerns me, my father, I cannot, nor should I, as I believe, conceal from you that I have never doubted your love for me and have thus been convinced that my reputation is of concern to you.</p>
      <p>Since it has happened that at the time of the first edition of my Annotations, I undertook the writing while the printer undertook the printing simultaneously, there are many things I daily find lacking in them, which perhaps would have been much more corrected and complete if, as should have been done first and as I most desired, I had been allowed to give birth before giving birth. But since what has been done cannot be undone, the only remedy that remains is to ensure in the second edition, as far as possible, what should have been done before.</p>
      <p>I therefore think it is greatly in my interest that, with the copies of the first edition being sold as quickly as possible, Estienne undertakes a second, more corrected and complete edition, to which I am now wholly devoted, and which I am confident will be presented by the next Easter fair. You can now guess, my father, what I am asking, namely that, since the edition begun in Basel cannot be completed there without our Estienne suffering significant loss, and it is also in my interest that as few copies of the first edition as possible be circulated, you use your authority to ensure that neither Estienne nor I suffer from the greed of some, for whom, as the saying goes, the smell of profit is sweet from any source. But I do not ask this on any other condition than if you judge it to be just and fair: for I know how we all tend to be blind, especially in our own affairs. Therefore, I also sincerely testify here that I will gladly prefer your judgment to my own, and will willingly accept whatever you decide in this matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord Jesus that He may bless you and your holy labors more and more. Lausanne, July 3.</p>
      <p>Th. Beza, your most devoted son in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
