      <p>S. D. From your venerable kindness, most illustrious man and father in Christ, highly esteemed, I have received three letters from you within almost eight days; the first two were delivered to me at the end of November, one written in Latin, the other in German. What you instructed in the German letter, to communicate to the honorable councilors, I did so immediately without delay, and they express their respectful thanks to you. Regarding the nefarious conspiracies of our adversaries against us, which our senate received from yours, I read and see that the Lord still diligently watches over us, no matter how much we may be sluggish. I have received your opinion on the confederation with the emperor and other states of the empire, which completely agrees with mine, and what that wise and renowned friend of yours in the empire advises, he writes from the depths of my own heart. Meanwhile, we are neither deserted by Christian princes nor do we desert them, if the situation and necessity so require, even if no public treaty is concluded between us.</p>
      <p>"For if Christian and sincere concord and charity flourished among us, we would by no means need these treacherous confederations, but in necessity, we would mutually assist each other." What that star, which affects me wonderfully, portends, time will tell. Dr. Burgover does not judge it to be a comet nor in the region of comets, but to be situated above the moon's orbit in the very ether, about which I still hesitate. We lack proper instruments; however, we have discovered and observed its position behind the chair of Cassiopeia and either in the very Arctic circle or not far from it and in Taurus itself, under which our Helvetia also lies. It forms, to my amazement, a perfect cross shape with three other stars in the configuration of Cassiopeia, one of which is in its left elbow, another in the knee, and the third in the chair itself; Perseus, with his hand, seems to grasp the handle of the cross and carry it aloft. In the revolution of the cross, that new star always looks towards the height of the pole, as the head of Christ exalted on the cross, the two lateral stars seem to designate each extended hand, and the lowest or farthest from the pole the conjunction of the feet. Some may judge by this figure that Christ is crucified in his members or will be crucified even more shortly, others, who consider the star's appearance to be lovely and the cross's figure victorious, may interpret it as Christ avenging the Roman beast's slaughter through a certain Perseus; there will be those who say this constellation is the sign of the Son of Man in heaven about which Christ prophesies in Matthew 24.</p>
      <p>Whatever it may be, no one looks at it with astonishment as at other comets and with fear, but rather with singular delight, so that all hope it will be not malevolent, but benevolent, as astrologers say. Certainly, it is not drawn like other comets by the malevolent Mars and Saturn, but in my judgment by the nearby Jupiter, gently rising in the morning, looking at Lucifer and even the sun itself, indeed almost coming to meet Lucifer and the sun. Therefore, may it be, as your kindness wishes, that it brings with it the very sun of righteousness in its glorious advent to us, or at least rouses some hero and endows him with the spirit of wisdom and fortitude, through whom he may restrain and crush the blasphemous and bloodthirsty satellites of the antichrist.</p>
      <p>But perhaps I have spoken more loquaciously and idly than was proper. I come, therefore, to the third letter, in which you consult, that I should ensure the letter written in the spirit of the antichrist is translated into the German language with brief annotations and printed. Indeed, I would have already done this to the best of my ability if your letter had reached me sooner; however, God willing, I will ensure that you have a copy of this writing shortly, so that it may be corrected by your judgment, printed, and published.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus kindly preserve your kindness to us unharmed for the consolation and confirmation of his church, we all pray with all our hearts.</p>
      <p>All the brothers reverently greet your kindness along with all other friends. We also greet all the brothers who are with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Given hastily on the very day of the solstice, which is December 10, in the year 1572.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Johann Konrad Ulmer. To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, the most faithful overseer of the church of Zurich, his lord and father in Christ, highly esteemed.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, the elder, etc.</p>
      <p>"The exposition of the star, which appeared in the months of November and December 1572."</p>
