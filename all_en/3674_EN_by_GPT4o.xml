      <p>S. P. D. You have responded quickly enough because you have done so well and most graciously to my letters (most illustrious man). For what could have been more pleasing to me than that acceptance of my friendship and goodwill? But about this, we shall speak at another time and in person, when the opportunity presents itself, which I eagerly await and hope to obtain. I have nothing new to write to you at this time; for as much as I have seen from your letters to the distinguished Mr. Fabritius, you have understood those things which have happened to us somewhat unfavorably in France, yet not all as unfavorably as I explained to Fabritius himself, and he promised to write back, and it can be said that the disaster was equal and balanced; for on both sides the same number of soldiers fell; indeed, some leaders of our army were captured with the leader Mr. de Termes, but on the other side, some men of the same rank were killed.</p>
      <p>Expect the rest from Fabritius himself, and also other news, as soon as they first present themselves, from me. Meanwhile, fare well, most esteemed sir, and love me as you have begun.</p>
      <p>From Chur (Curia Rhetorum) on the 15th of August, 1558. Yours most devotedly in work and zeal, J. Ja. Decambray.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the Church of Zürich (Tigurinae). In Zürich (Tiguri).</p>
      <p>First of Mr. de Cambray.</p>
