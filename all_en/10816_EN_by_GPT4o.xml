      <p>Greetings. We have exchanged sons, your city clerk and I. Therefore, he has received mine, and I have received his, both in good faith. As I have no doubt about his faith, I will sincerely uphold mine. My son has only lightly tasted three languages. However, I want him to nurture and increase his knowledge. He can be nourished in Hebrew through your sacred reading and deepen his Greek, if you allow it. Therefore, I ask that you not be annoyed by the boy's youth. For Christ also commended the little ones; he was far from being ashamed of children. You will therefore obtain from Mr. Theodor Bibliander and others that they allow him to be a listener. I also ask you to promise the boy that you will observe, with one eye or the other, how well and happily he spends his hours. Such a promise will undoubtedly ward off laziness and ignite diligence, and you will indeed do something greater than I can repay. But the best and greatest God will repay you.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily. Greet your wife. I wish all neighbors near and far to be safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 28, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, Andreas Bodenstein (Karlstadt).</p>
      <p>Be so kind as to greet Leo Jud and ask him to also keep an eye on the boy. I seek nothing but that he learns for the glory of God and the benefit of others.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and most prudent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor and bishop of Zurich, my most esteemed superior.</p>
