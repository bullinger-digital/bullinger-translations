      <p>S. The Landsgemeinde, as I recently informed you, dearest lord and brother, took place on August 24th in Glarus, in front of the village, called on the Sand, with many people well gathered, starting around 9 o'clock to discuss, and lasted approximately until after one, etc. Now, noting what was discussed, I want to inform you of the most important matters, although I was not there myself, I have understood it from my credible subjects, etc. The cause of this Landsgemeinde arose from the general assembly, namely that it was alleged that there were some who had practiced, spent money throughout the entire winter, and made many other promises, that help and support were given to them so that they might come to offices and other powerful positions, and some of my lords in the council knew about it, etc. Upon this, it was advised and decided that anyone from the country people, to whom this had happened, should report it under oath. It happened that some honorable people testified under their honor and oath, who and how had approached them, to help this one and that one, and this testimony was mostly against both the bailiff, the former Avienus of ours, and the landsweibel, etc. When on the aforementioned day the assembly came together, the testimonies were publicly read by the land scribe Stüssin against the aforementioned persons. Then the first uproar arose, that some publicly accused those who had spoken against them of lying, and said loudly: "You have lied." This caused great displeasure, so that people began to form parties and pair off in such a way that there was enough to do to offer peace by honor, oath, and great penance, etc. Now those who had not lied, who had spoken, wanted the others not to be as they had been said, etc. What will come of it, a poor man can well imagine, misery and distress, etc. The accused, like the bailiffs, answered quite reasonably: if it is found that they are guilty, then they should not be spared, they should be punished, etc. Upon this, it was advised by another that both the bailiffs, the landsweibel, and Avienus should be removed (parce; for thus it is said to have been spoken). Then the landsweibel showed himself very wild and with angry, furious words and gestures and said: "Hey, you rascal, may God suffer and make you begin, Saint Veltis and Saint Kyriacus' revenge, etc. Why should I be removed?" It became such a turmoil that it was close to coming to great deadly blows; it was barely calmed and pacified. In this, a common and great cry arose from many, namely: "Hey, that they shamefully wound; this one, that one, etc. have promised us so much, so much and barely won, that we help them with the union to make the sea, and have given us nothing, kept nothing," etc. And the cry was great, it also lasted long, until finally, it was advised by another that the common country people should appoint 30 men who are impartial; they should punish each one according to the testimony, whoever he may be, sparing no one, with the utmost and greatest seriousness possible. And it was decided, it should be so and happen; in addition, everyone should report to the land scribe by Saint Michael's Day under oath, what has happened to each one with the practitioners, who has not said it until now, and thereafter the 30 men should act according to the testimony, etc. The pensioners have suggested to the Landsgemeinde that this article should be removed from the land book, namely that no one should practice under oath to come to this or another office, etc. This was taken badly by them and the opposite happened, that the article was first newly strengthened than ever before. As for the aurum Tholosanum, it was decided that it should now serve and be led into the common land treasury, so that the land may be freed, etc. (It is pledged and written because of the lordship, which they bought, half of Werdenberg) etc. On this day, the faith also had to suffer; for it was not only once brought up with the opinion: since the faith has come into the land, it lies in no one's right with this money; before, no one was so grimly against it, etc., and since then, there has been neither peace nor rest, but all kinds of compulsion, etc. The barking did not help. Further, they began to discuss how to act so that in the future no one would take any secret money in the land. It was advised that henceforth, under the loss of life and limb, no one should receive any secret money from any lord and king or prince, etc. In this, the pensioners have defiantly withdrawn from the open Landsgemeinde, some home, others into the inns over the bailiff's admonition by honor and oath, they did not care, the landsweibel sent after them, to bring them back to the assembly by their oaths. It was all in vain, etc. Thereupon the assembly received a great thirst, etc. In this, Beldius, as much as he could, made a very commendable effort and prevented worse from coming out of it, and advised that now the best should be done; it should not happen anymore, it must be brought up at the future general assembly, that no one should deviate from the oath of any assembly, etc. And with great effort, the country people were calmed and uncertain whether it was the sea or not, that no one should take any secret money in the future. Bailiff Bussius is said to have said among other things: "Dear country people, I see and feel that secret money brings much and heavy unrest among us. It is my advice and opinion that we must let it go, etc. I want to help with that," etc. In this turmoil, some ran away, others stayed, and there was a great tumult, a very impious γελοίος (ridiculous) was brought forward and suggested that the young people should be allowed to dance, so that they too have joy, etc. It was allowed, although many older honorable people spoke and wrote very commendably against it, it did not help. It created much for the young people, overcame the more serious and smaller group, and could not soon become the sea. The musicians were prepared, and an unexpected great dance took place, so much so that everyone could not marvel enough, this serious matter ended with such a frivolous and laughable end. The honorability is very sad and gloomy, the Catilinarians and Clodii are happy. They have also let some threatening words fall, they want to tell them something else one of these days and teach them to increase over them; that is difficult. So you have the summary of what important things have happened with us. In summary: Wherever you turn, everything is full of evils. These things I write to you, my Bullinger. I wrote these disturbed things with a disturbed and grieving mind. What should I hope for? I fear that the Clodians may eventually plot a more atrocious evil, to destroy the better part of the fatherland, to rule alone. May the Lord be with his own. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, August 26th, Schwanden.</p>
      <p>Yours, L. from the heart.</p>
      <p>I have given this letter to the bailiff Pfändler, asking you to write a note so that I know it has been delivered. He is going to the sword.</p>
