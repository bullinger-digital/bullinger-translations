      <p>To Lord Bullinger, most esteemed friend and patron, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Four days ago, I wrote to you and I believe my letters have been delivered to you, to which I have nothing to add. Currently, there is a fair here, and some Italian merchants who have arrived reported that in the past few days, a plot was devised against the city of Crema (which previously belonged to the Duchy of Milan, but is now under Venetian rule) and it was nearly captured. The authors of this plot were said to be certain Franciscan monks. However, the plot was discovered, and they say that several monks, along with some notable soldiers found in the Franciscan monastery, were taken captive to Venice. A similar incident is reported to have occurred in another very fortified Venetian stronghold called Orsinuovi, where a plot was also discovered, and monks and Spanish soldiers were taken captive to Venice. If this is true (whether it is or not, we will certainly find out during this fair, and I will inform you of what I discover), it will strike great terror into the Venetians, who are always and otherwise suspicious of their empire. Indeed, there is a rumor or at least an uncertain suspicion among people that the aforementioned plots were instigated in the name of King Philip, aiming to reintegrate the Duchy of Milan and restore it to its former greatness. I certainly would not believe this; rather, I think that some idle soldiers, of whom there is a large number wandering throughout the duchy, voluntarily devised the aforementioned plots to plunder some fortified places to alleviate their poverty. However it may be, it is truer than true that the Venetians have very diligently inspected their fortified places and enlisted soldiers, of whom they maintain a large number even in peacetime, increased all garrisons, and prepared other war apparatus as if a certain war were imminent; for the prudent do not wish to be found unprepared. But if I learn anything further, I will write to you in more detail.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it has been reported here by some coming from Vienna in Austria that the Emperor sought permission from the Venetians to lead 15,000 soldiers through their territory towards Italy, yet I do not see why this should have been requested, if indeed it was requested as mentioned above.</p>
      <p>And this is what I had to write to you now, so that I would not allow the bearer of this letter to depart to you completely empty-handed. You receive all these things in the manner I received them, and therefore, if they are later found to be less true, you will not blame me. I commend to you the present bearer, who is exiled from Italy for the sake of the gospel, through whom, if it seems appropriate, you can write back to me, and I especially ask you to do so, so that I may understand the happy state of your affairs.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished Lord Bullinger, with all your family, and keep me always recommended to you. Given at Chiavenna on the first of December, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, the same as above, Friedrich von Salis, etc. To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and most esteemed patron. In Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my gracious lord in Zurich.</p>
