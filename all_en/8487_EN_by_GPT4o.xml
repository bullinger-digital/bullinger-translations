      <p>S. D. It has been several days since I last wrote to you, knowing that our Gwalther diligently sends letters about all matters, and I have nothing worth mentioning now; however, so that I do not seem too silent, here I send you these brief lines. In your last letter, you mentioned that it was reported among you in the Diet of the Zurichers that they promised soldiers to the Venetians against the Turks. However, whoever affirms this, affirms a vile lie. Nothing of this kind ever came to the minds of our people; our people are not so foolish as to allow themselves to be involved with the Turks to their great detriment. Perhaps those who think of nothing but war invent these things, so that their plans may seem more plausible. But many also report that the Venetians have made peace with the Turks and, having laid down arms, have returned to concord with the Turks, which perhaps you are not unaware of from Italy.</p>
      <p>Among us, everything is sold at a high price. Grain and all provisions have never been sold at a higher price. The scarcity is incredible, and the number of poor is abundant; nothing like this has been seen in the memory of our fathers. Already some, afflicted with pleurisy and headaches, are dying; the situation is miserable. But our sins and a life ignorant of repentance deserve these things. Similar and indeed greater complaints are brought from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>From Lyon, it is written to me that the faithful in France are terribly afflicted and some are being slaughtered; for no justice restrains the insolence of the papists; the king indeed wishes for peace to remain inviolate, but many oppose it. This is the fate of the faithful. I hope the Lord will not forsake His own. It is written about Navarre that he has expelled all impurities from his domain through solid reformation.</p>
      <p>I kindly ask you to inform me as soon as possible about the situation with Hägili in Küblis; he writes such lamentable things to us, unwilling to remain in the League, complaining of such great injustice beyond all measure, claiming to be of good teaching and conduct, and yet being treated in such a manner that, when my lord mayor Willi and you were in Fideris, it was said that you would rather go begging for alms than stay with those who treat him and his wife so disgracefully; he desires to be promoted here or in Thurgau. Therefore, inform me thoroughly, so that I may report it. I have always thought he is a scatterbrain and fond of drinking wine, etc. Therefore, I am not inclined to burden myself with him or trouble any church. Yet he wants to be here, has been causing trouble and complaints while he was with you up there. Note well, his wife is not happy up there, so he must be released from there; I am not inclined to do so unless I hear otherwise from you, though even then I do not know where he should go. Such fellows never cease their complaints and cause me much trouble, etc.</p>
      <p>Forgive me and let me know what you think would be beneficial for the churches. I will write more another time; for now, farewell to you and all your family and friends.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 9th February 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, dearest brother and fellow minister.</p>
