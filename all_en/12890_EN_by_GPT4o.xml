    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer and Konrad Zwick thank for Bullinger's letters [not received], which the messenger [Hans Zingg together] with a letter from the Zurich mayor [Johannes Haab] delivered to Zwick the day before, when Blarer was with the latter. They immediately read the letters together and, given their many other writing obligations, decided that Zwick would write to the mayor and Blarer to Bullinger. They should inform each other about the respective letter contents.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Zwick conveys that he is only bothered by Bullinger's letters because Bullinger always admonishes the people of Konstanz not to accept a false peace, while Zwick believes that no peace should be accepted at all, as such peace can only be false. Someone [...] from Ulm writes that not a single promise made to the city was kept, as Bullinger will also learn from Haab.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Mayor [Haab] has informed Zwick by letter that the XIII places have taken the order not to besiege or attack Konstanz from Swiss territory. Bullinger knows well how little that helps. Yet the people of Konstanz continue to hope for divine assistance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The response of the Zurichers to the Frenchman [Guillaume Du Plessis, sieur de Lyancourt] is quite pleasing to Blarer and Zwick. King Francis I is said to have conspired with Sultan Suleiman, but will hardly undertake anything against Emperor Charles V before the Sultan (who is already in armor) goes to war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer has received the money [from Kaspar Seidensticker]. He will reprimand Konrad Hofherr for his impetuous nature.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Strasbourg envoys were summoned to the Emperor in Nuremberg. It is feared that they will also reconcile, apparently under better conditions than the others [cities]; but perhaps not. Bullinger should inform Hans Schöner of this, greet him from Blarer, and apologize for his silence due to lack of time. He has received Schöner's letter and forwarded his letters to Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings. Bullinger should pray for the [German Protestants] and their church. Blarer must break off.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [News:] The captains [Sebastian Schertlin] and Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz are still in Konstanz. Bullinger should not forget Schankwitz’s concerns!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Rudolf Gwalther recently wrote to Hans Widenhuber in St. Gallen that Konstanz has not yet surrendered to the Emperor, but there is something fishy about it. Bullinger should find out what Gwalther meant by this, without mentioning Blarer's name (for good reasons).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Blarer sends back the three [letters addressed to Bullinger].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] In Konstanz, one also hears about the war departure of the Emperor's son Philip of Spain mentioned in Myconius’ letter [No. 2797]. However, if Emanuel Philibert of Savoy actually brings so many soldiers from Spain (a number that could hardly be raised there), things would indeed look bad! May the Lord grant peace!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] The following is reported from Ulm and Augsburg: Landgrave Philip of Hesse has allegedly given the hand of his daughter to the young Duke Charles Victor of Brunswick, which is hardly credible! Hopefully, this is not true.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] God's punishment has befallen King Ferdinand I, for the Bohemians are said to have refused him their support, while there was an uprising in Prague.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] The English King Henry VIII is dead, and the Emperor plans to undertake something against England. Also, King Francis I, the Polish King Sigismund, as well as Pope Paul III, are said to have died. The Duke of Alba, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, is suffering from a severe fever. Blarer has already reported the deaths of Johann von Naves and Eriprando Madruzzo [with letter No. 2824].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] The soldiers that the Emperor had in Regensburg, Nördlingen, Dinkelsbühl, and other places were sent to Duke Maurice of Saxony. The Bregenzer [Hans] Schnabel [von Schönstein] is recruiting many soldiers who previously served the [Schmalkaldic League]! He is reinforcing the imperial companies with them and sending them against the Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, whom they want to eliminate. May the Lord prevent this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] On Monday, February 28, 900 [imperial] soldiers arrived in Augsburg. Initially, they behaved rudely, but their colonel Bernhard von Schaumburg had them severely punished and forbade them, on pain of life and property, any mischief against the people of Augsburg. They are now to remain calm. The people of Augsburg and Schaumburg open and close the four main city gates. The other gates, whose keys are held only by the people of Augsburg, remain closed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] The soldiers stationed at Biberach are said to have set out for Nuremberg last Friday [March 4].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] The Abbot of Weingarten, Gerwig Blarer, who should best be drowned, imposes fines on the southern German cities as an imperial commissioner. He began with Biberach and demanded 40,000 guilders from this city! At the pleading of the people of Biberach, he promised them a remission of 10,000 guilders. The first half of the fine is to be paid in 14 days, the rest soon after. What will be demanded of the other cities if so much is already demanded from such a small place? All these cities are likely facing ruin! May the Lord take care of the situation!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] Recently, Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg sent a messenger [...] to Konstanz to find out how things stand among the Swiss, as he had heard that they were divided and fighting against each other. The Duke was in Ulm on [March 4], a few hours before the Emperor's departure. Due to his illness, he could not throw himself at the Emperor's feet and apologized for having to remain seated.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">[20] Count Friedrich von Fürstenberg recently visited his wife [Anna, née von Werdenberg] at home [at Heiligenberg Castle] and told her upon departure that the war was now really starting and terrible things were ahead, so she should get to safety.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">[21] On Saturday, March 5, a servant [...] of a citizen of Konstanz [...] was stopped by four horsemen near Engen, who took 100 guilders and promissory notes worth 400 guilders from him, saying he should no longer redeem the promissory notes because they would do so now. He is to tell his master that this is just the beginning; worse is yet to come!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">[22] In Konstanz, a soldier [...] told so extensively about the destruction of the entire army of Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach by the Saxon troops that, according to Schertlin, the reporter can only be an eyewitness. The Margrave led Duke Maurice 12 companies and 1,000 horsemen. Only 400 to 500 soldiers are said to have escaped.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest23">[23] When [on March 4] the Emperor wanted to leave Ulm, some people, including the Augsburg Bishop Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, asked him to order a daily mass for the Catholics of the city. The Emperor replied to the Bishop that he should rather remain silent if he had nothing more important to bring up. He also said that the Pope had used him so far, but from now on he wanted to pursue his own goals.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest24">[24] The Ulm pastors are said to no longer be allowed to express themselves freely. Blarer does not know more details about this, but he wants to find out more. In any case, the singing of psalms in houses and streets has been forbidden; but not "Hänsle on the pyre"!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest25">[25] [Appendix:] What would the Zurich marriage court decide in the following cases?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest26">[26] If an adulterer is divorced at the request of the betrayed spouse and the latter remarries, or remains single and does not want to reconcile with the adulterer, do the Zurichers allow the adulterer a new marriage? There is much discussion about this, especially since adulterers are not executed as they should be (which would also make the question unnecessary).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest27">[27] Some believe that it is not right to forbid the adulterer to remarry, as he is exposed to the same temptations as others, so marriage would be the better solution.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest28">[28] Others, however, believe that allowing the adulterer to remarry invites adultery, because then some would break their marriage so that their spouse files for divorce and they can then marry whomever they want. How are such cases handled in Zurich? Wasn't Agathe Studler allowed to remarry during her husband [Adam Frey's] lifetime?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest29">[29] In Konstanz, years ago, [Jakob Bagolter] was divorced from his adulterous wife [Wibrat Erdin] at his request. A new marriage was forbidden to her. Nevertheless, she teamed up with the carter Thomas Dietrich from Petershausen (who is not a citizen of Konstanz). Recently [on February 21], the two were married in Zurich and hoped to be able to live in Konstanz thanks to this certificate. However, both were expelled from the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest30">[30] In another case, a man [Albin Dienstmann] promised marriage to a single woman [Margreth Freudreich], and intercourse took place. However, after he refused to marry her, she sued him [in June 1544]. The court ruling declared both to be husband and wife. He then left the city and even gave up his citizenship after repeatedly ignoring the Konstanz authorities' requests to return to his wife.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest31">[31] Meanwhile, the woman became a maid for a single man [...]. He pursued her and impregnated her. As soon as Dienstmann found out, he returned to Konstanz after a two-year absence, repurchased citizenship and guild rights, and applied [on November 24, 1546] for a divorce from his wife due to her adultery.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest32">[32] Some reject this because they believe that he caused the woman to commit adultery by leaving her unlawfully. Otherwise, many would leave their wives and wait until they engage with another man.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest33">[33] Others, however, believe that Dienstmann should not be forced to live with an adulteress, even if he must be severely punished for his disobedience.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest34">[34] Bullinger should report briefly as soon as possible on how such cases are handled in Zurich.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace with all good things beforehand, especially beloved, most faithful brother. Your letters have reached me well. I express my most diligent thanks to you. This messenger has found me with my cousin Conrad Zwick yesterday. We read the letters together. And truly, both of us are now very burdened, especially with writing. Therefore, we have divided it so that my cousin will report some matters to the honorable mayor, and I will report some things to you. My dear cousin lacks nothing. He asks me to thank you most heartily and friendly. He is more than satisfied with your faithful service. What he writes to the honorable mayor, he says, you should also read. What I write to you, which he did not know before, you may reveal and show to him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Only my dear cousin says he has now several times found the lack in your letters that you always write that we should not accept a false peace, because he thinks now that no peace should be accepted at all; for they would all have to be false, etc. A good man from Ulm writes that none of the promises made to them have been kept, as you will then learn from the honorable mayor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>That the 13 places have unanimously decided and brought into effect not to besiege or harm Konstanz, the honorable mayor has also indicated in a previous letter with this clause, that they will not allow Konstanz to be besieged on their territory; which, as it brings with it, you know well to assess. But we trust in the dear God, he will help us with special faithful, gracious assistance through this danger beyond all expectation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Your lords' response to the Frenchman pleases us exceedingly well. May the Lord increase and strengthen all good in you! But it is said that the Frenchman is allied with the Turk and will undertake nothing against the emperor until the Turk is on the move, as there are very many and credible indications that he is on the rise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I have received the money. I will deal with Curio as is appropriate and forbid him his impetuosity. He is a rash head.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Strasbourg is now summoned to Nuremberg. They fear they will also be reconciled, but under much better conditions than the others have experienced, although it is possible that they might not be able to. This should be communicated to the good Hans Schöner and greet him from me in a friendly and brotherly manner with an apology for my not writing, as I truly have neither time nor leisure. Tell him his letters have reached me, and that I have forwarded his letters to Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Tell all yours with the wish of God's grace many greetings and good from me, and ask with all faithfulness for us and our churches, that we may come through all these severe temptations in his grace and that the Lord Christ may extend and strengthen his kingdom everywhere. With that, please consider it good. I cannot do better this time. There is so much to write! Keep me and our city always included in your faithful and Christian care. Dated March 11, 1547.</p>

      <p>The captains are still here. They are doing well. Do not forget Dietrich Marcellen's concerns!</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>My dear lord and brother, your Gwaltherus, recently wrote to Hans Widenhuber in St. Gallen, among other things, that he hears Konstanz is still upright and has not surrendered to the emperor; but he also hears that the matter with Konstanz is otherwise fishy. I ask you very friendly to find out from him how he meant such, as it greatly surprises us. But I ask you not to mention me in this, as it has a reason.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Herewith I also send you back your three letters. I express my diligent, high thanks to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>It is said that the emperor's son is setting out, as in Myconius' letters, etc. If the Sophoyer brings such a people (which I cannot believe, as all of Spain could not manage so much in my opinion), it would be trouble and work. May the dear, faithful God grant temporal and eternal peace.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>It is written from Ulm and Augsburg: The Landgrave is said to have given his daughter to the young Duke of Brunswick; which is still quite unbelievable to me. If it is true, much could be taken from it. Speramus meliora (hope it is not true).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The Roman king is said to have been struck by God's power. The Bohemians are said to have refused him all help and a serious uprising has occurred in Prague (is uncertain).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>England is said to be certainly dead, and the emperor intends to undertake something with England; likewise also France. The old king of Poland is also said to be gone, etc. Likewise, it is also said of the Pope. The Duke of Alba has a severe fever. Naves and Madrutz are gone, as I wrote earlier.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>What the emperor had for soldiers in Regensburg, Nördlingen, Dinkelsbühl, etc., he has now sent all to Duke Maurice. The Schnabel of Bregenz takes on many of the soldiers who were with ours. He strengthens his companies excellently, all against Saxony. They want to make the garus for him, but the dear God knows well what to do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>On Monday, the last of February, 900 soldiers entered Augsburg. They first behaved willfully (outrageously), but their commander, Bernhard von Schaumburg, punished them severely and forbade them on pain of life and property to willfully act against any citizen. Thus, they are now said to be completely quiet. The people of Augsburg, together with the commander, open and close the four main gates. The others have been closed, and the people of Augsburg alone have the keys to them, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>The soldiers stationed at Biberach are said to have moved out and all gone to Nuremberg last Friday.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>The venerable father, abbot of Weingarten (worthy to be thrown into the sea), is the emperor's commissioner to the upper German cities to impose fines on them. He started in Biberach. They are to pay a fine of forty thousand guilders. However, at their earnest request to mitigate it, as it is not in their power, he has given them hope that the signs might be prayed away, but nothing of the 30,000 fl. They must pay in 14 half installments, then the other half. How do you think the others will be imposed upon, while this small community is so burdened? It is nothing but the certain, fundamental ruin of all these cities before our eyes. May the faithful God have gracious insight!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>Item, the Duke of Württemberg recently had his own messenger here and asked to know how things stood among the Confederates, as it concerns him that they are completely disunited and have drawn against each other. He was in Ulm eight days ago, a few hours before the emperor moved. However, he could not fall at his feet due to illness. He had to sit in a chair and let himself be excused.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>Item, Count Friedrich von Fürstenberg was recently at home and then immediately rode away again. He very earnestly warned his dear wife, saying the war would now really begin, and a hot bath had been poured over them, so they should also be somewhat concerned.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21">
      <p>Item, on the last Saturday, near Engen, four horsemen stopped our citizen's servant and took a hundred guilders and some promissory notes (worth 400 fl.) from him and told him he should no longer collect the debts; they would collect them! And he should tell his master: This is the beginning; soon they will have to experience many more and worse things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>Item, a soldier was here with Mr. Sebastian Schertle and reported how the Saxons had destroyed the entire army of Margrave Albrecht, as he wanted to march with 12 companies of soldiers and 1000 horsemen to Duke Maurice, and not more than four or five hundred of them came away. He reported all things so credibly (as he said he was also there himself), that Mr. Schertlin believes him in all things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div23" corresp="regest23">
      <p>The emperor, in his farewell to Ulm, was asked by some, including the bishop of Augsburg, to arrange for a daily mass to be held for the old Christians in Ulm. To which he replied to the bishop: If he has nothing more necessary to bring up, he should now be quiet (it is true)! The emperor also said among other things: The Pope has so far acted according to his pleasure with him, but now he also wants to follow his own counsel, as is right for everyone to do!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div24" corresp="regest24">
      <p>The preachers in Ulm have been somewhat restricted. I cannot yet know what it is. I want to find out. The psalms are forbidden to be sung in houses and on the streets; but "Hensle on the pyre" may be sung!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div25" corresp="regest25">
      <p>Would you inform me what is customary in your marriage court.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div26" corresp="regest26">
      <p>In the case that an adulterer is divorced from his spouse, if he desires it and then engages with another spouse, or remains unmarried, but does not want to reconcile with the adulterer, whether in such a case the adulterer is also allowed to marry another person. For there is much debate about this, since adulterers and adulteresses are not put away, as they should be (for then this question would not be necessary).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div27" corresp="regest27">
      <p>Some think, since they are allowed to live and are just as tempted as other people, that it would be unfair to deny them marriage and put them in the danger of other unchastity; and it must always remain true for them: Melius est nubere quam uri (It is better to marry than to burn).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div28" corresp="regest28">
      <p>Others think, if such were allowed, it would open a great wide door to adultery, for some would break their marriage to give their spouse a reason to seek divorce, and then they could also take another who is agreeable to them. This is certainly true. Therefore, please let me know how it is handled with you. The Studler woman (I think) was allowed to remarry during her husband's lifetime.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div29" corresp="regest29">
      <p>For years ago, a woman was divorced from her husband for her adultery at his request. She would have liked to have another husband, but could not achieve it. So she nevertheless took one here. She is not a citizen, but still a carter here, named Thomas Dieterich from Bätershusen, and with him went to you in Zurich, where they went to church recently. They bring a written certificate of their church attendance. They intended to stay here, but my lords have ordered them both to leave the city.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div30" corresp="regest30">
      <p>Item, now a case arises that one has pursued a daughter, promised her marriage, and then also practiced the works with her, but then did not want her; therefore she had to take him before my lords. It was learned so much in the matter that they were declared husband and wife, but he then left the city and even gave up his citizenship after repeatedly ignoring the requests of my lords to return to his wife.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div31" corresp="regest31">
      <p>Meanwhile, his wife was in service. She had a relationship with a single journeyman, who impregnated her. As soon as her husband became aware of this, who had not been here for two years, he came, requested citizenship again (had to buy everything anew, guild and citizenship), and immediately after that, he requested to be divorced from his wife, who had been granted to him before, because she had become adulterous to him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div32" corresp="regest32">
      <p>Some think, since he was disobedient and did not stay with her, and thus gave her cause for such, he should not enjoy it, and blame himself, and keep the wife. Otherwise, many would do the same, leave their wives, and see if they might go astray.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div33" corresp="regest33">
      <p>Others think it would be unfair for him to have to keep a known adulteress and live with her. He may well be punished severely for it, but not release the wife to him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div34" corresp="regest34">
      <p>What might be spoken in such a case with you, please inform me. For there are arguments on both sides. But your judgment, please let me know briefly. As soon as you can, please inform me about it.</p>
