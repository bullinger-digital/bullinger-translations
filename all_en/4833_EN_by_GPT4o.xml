      <p>Greetings. I, reverend father, have begun to feel somewhat better by the grace of God, but today I took medicine to prepare myself for the baths, and therefore, I cannot write as extensively as you might wish to know from me. However, I am pleased to note the main points.</p>
      <p>After the papal legate had spoken at length before the Senate of the Three Leagues on the seventh of June and finally also presented a document in which the same points are noted that you have already read, except that the legate's document treats everything more extensively and has very sharp threats interspersed, he was then dismissed and escorted to his lodging.</p>
      <p>He spoke for two hours and also wept, very pathetically, and then first offered the written document to the lords. However, since the document was in Italian, some of the councilors (few were aware) translated the document into German in passing but did not read the threatening words, nor did they mention that he referred to the false preachers who falsify the scriptures, and especially named Chur explicitly.</p>
      <p>These things, I say, they omitted when they were ordered to translate it from Italian to German in the Senate. But when the council rose (for this happened on Saturday morning), our consul Tscharner secretly sent this enclosed document to us through his son-in-law, for us to inspect. And when Dr. Philippus, who understood Italian, found some abusive words, we decided to appear after dinner and complain, which was done. However, Philippus' message was also heard first.</p>
      <p>He immediately requested and indicated: they should add Philippus' message from the Pope. The sharpest thing that our Philippus Gallitius said in German and Italian was this: that he reminded the Senate that they should believe us, their servants, more than the Castellan of Müß's brother, etc. When we had finished, some adversaries, magnates from the Upper League, wanted to slip away from the matter, and a heated debate arose; for the papists claim: we preachers want to prescribe to them, as if they were not as wise when foreign lords' messages appear before them, that they know how to respond. They also said it was not written that way; therefore, the document was reread, and it was found. On the other hand, others said: "The preachers have acted as pious people should." And one said: "It amazes me that you could let the priest speak for two hours and swallow the venom (using this word) and complain that you cannot let our servants in the lands speak for a quarter of an hour." In short: it has become much more: we have acted as pious people should. Our consul Tscharner said even more: "Since the priest attacks the city of Chur with such blasphemous words, he has broken the law, and they would have good reason to deal with him differently." Thereupon, a response was decided.</p>
      <p>Those mentioned earlier, who did not like our proposal, intended to bring the serious matter before the communities, especially since he might send a letter of refusal the next day, yes, already now as much as he has refused if they do not comply. Others said they were just threats and nothing more.</p>
      <p>Thereupon, a response was decided: What has been dealt with in the religion of the Italian preachers and also concerning the monasteries has been done with the knowledge and will of the communities.</p>
      <p>Let it remain so; ask him to leave us in peace in our lands in this case and to have good neighborliness; we will also do that. (The same response was given to Philippus' legate.) The response will offend his heart, etc. Many papists have said: "Let us not bring shame upon our lands, that the Pope thinks we fear him; for if we comply with these things, we would no longer be free confederates, but the Pope would be our overlord," etc.</p>
      <p>These things hastily and suddenly; therefore, I ask you to forgive me. Philippus' legate is indeed present, but he is plotting something else.</p>
      <p>He is secretly seeking a union.</p>
      <p>I have learned this: his servant went to the old land judge Capol, who is ours in religion, and made a mistake; for it was not the right person. But when this Lord Capol came before Ricium, Ricium did not recognize the person either and began to tell the matter, whereupon he first offered Lord Capol a letter (but the clever lord should have done this first, since he did not know the person). But when the land judge Capol replied that the letter did not belong to him, but to the current land judge, Ricium turned pale and said: "My servant has deceived me." These things Capol himself told me in secret. Therefore, under the pretext of a papal legation, he is doing something else; for Philippus and the Pope do not agree very well, and a war is expected against the Florentine. The rest, which pertains to the acts of the synod, with our confession, which will henceforth not be called Maynardic, but Rhaetian, when I have returned from the baths and lived. You, however, reverend father, can still write if anything worthy of knowledge arises, so that I have something to communicate to those men when passing through Clavenna. I myself have written to Dr. Coignetium.</p>
      <p>Make an effort, I ask, to deliver them as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The good minister, whose son I recently recommended to you, about whom you also wrote back, while climbing rocks and searching for a distant chapel, fell headlong and perished miserably. A good man without any deceit.</p>
      <p>Now, therefore, I ask you again: if it is possible in any way, have mercy on this good man's fate, etc. The bishop's business is very reciprocal.</p>
      <p>It has happened that some of the communities sent their envoys here to Chur with proper intentions and claimed that the envoys bind the God's house differently than their instruction allows. This happens with many envoys; it is a pity.</p>
      <p>The bishop is not yet secretly involved in the matter; he calls upon the Two Leagues, but has not yet received an answer. I think it will remain stuck again.</p>
      <p>I hope to obtain a response today, indeed a written one; for a written and quite noble response was given to them. It was added that this people is free.</p>
      <p>But I will send the response.</p>
      <p>These things I write, I have from our most honorable lords.</p>
      <p>These things hastily, June 9, 1561, and I have not even reread them. Forgive me; for our fellow citizen Johannes Sutor was in a hurry here.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Johannes Fabricius.</p>
