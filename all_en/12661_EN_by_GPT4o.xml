    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius writes so rarely because he no longer hears from the people of Strasbourg. He criticized them for being too concerned about their money. As a result, the news circulating in Basel is already known to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Count [Georg von] W端rttemberg writes: The enemies have mixed bread with lime, which has caused many soldiers to die. Water and wells are also being poisoned. Some German wrongdoers have been caught. The Teutonic Master [Albrecht] of Prussia has sent the [Schmalkaldic League] 2000 cavalry and 4000 infantry. Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] has had a bridge built over the Danube to soon meet [with the Imperial forces]. Large battles take place daily. Count Wilhelm [von F端rstenberg] is in the field camp. The cost of living is cheap there. Due to a plague among the Imperial forces, Italians and Spaniards are deserting in droves. Emperor [Charles V] hangs all those he can catch. The [Schmalkaldic League], however, has largely been spared from diseases. So much for Count Georg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] A hundred [Schmalkaldic] cavalrymen were searching for provisions. They encountered 500 Imperial cavalrymen, whom they attacked head-on on the orders of a count [...]. About 30 Imperial soldiers were killed and several captured.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Allegedly, the Landgrave told the Emperor to fight him if he had even a drop of warrior's blood in his body. The Emperor replied: His whole body was full of it; he would prove it to him over five, even six years!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Konrad Lycosthenes, a relative of [Konrad] Pellikan, wanted to dine in Ensisheim these days together with two Zurichers [...]. However, they were not allowed into the city because they were from the Confederation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Myconius is very pained by what is heard about the arrest of the Baden messenger [Konrad Schweri] in Memmingen. What will become of the godless [Inner Swiss], and what do [the Protestant places] still have to do with them?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Dryander [Francisco de Enzinas] has received the entire shipment and opened it in Myconius' presence. A small book written in Italian by Ochino was enclosed with the letter. Enzinas thanks [Bullinger] for his greeting and sends his regards back. Today he showed Myconius a French book written by the theologians of Leuven, which he wants to translate into Latin. These foolish devils! The book contains a list of forbidden books, including even schoolbooks and catechisms! It also contains reading recommendations.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings. Myconius will write to Gwalther once he has read his "Endtchrist".</p>

      <p>S. The reason I am brief in writing is that I receive nothing from Strasbourg. They complain about their fear for their treasure. Because I took this badly, they remain silent. Furthermore, what I understand from our people, you already know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The following was written by Count [Georg von] W端rttemberg: "They have mixed lime into the flour, which has caused many soldiers to die who ate that bread. Some have become bloated and swollen. Also, they poison the water and wells, and some German wrongdoers have been found." He also writes, "The Teutonic Master [Albrecht] of Prussia recently sent 2000 cavalry and 4000 infantry to our side. The Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] has built a bridge over the Danube, and they hope to meet soon. Large skirmishes occur every day, which is astonishing. Count Wilhelm [von F端rstenberg] is already in the camp. In the camp, things are cheap. The plague is among the Imperial forces. Italians and Spaniards are deserting in droves, and the Emperor [Charles V] cannot control them. He hangs all those he catches. Our side has not suffered many illnesses yet." So much for him.</p>

      <p>A hundred of our cavalry went out for provisions. Five hundred Imperial cavalry came trotting by. A count from the hundred said, "Now may God help us! We must die or break through them." They let the horses go and charged through them, killing about 30 and capturing some, bringing them home with honor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is said that the Landgrave sent a message to the Emperor, saying: If he has a drop of warrior's blood in his body, he should fight him. The Emperor replied: Not just a drop, but his whole body is full of it; however, he would not show it in one battle, but over five, even six years. He must become aware of it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>M. Konradus, a relative of [Konrad] Pellikan, came these days to the town of Ensisheim together with two Zurichers to dine there. However, they were not allowed to enter because they were from the Confederation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>It pains me more than words can express what is reported about the arrest of the Baden messenger [Konrad Schweri] in Memmingen. What, I ask, do you think will happen? Such are those who are godless, and they cannot be otherwise. What then do we have to do with such people? May they be corrected by the Lord!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Dryander [Francisco de Enzinas] received everything and opened it in my presence. It was a commentary by Ochino, written in Italian, along with his letters. He gratefully received the greeting and returned it. Today he showed me a small book written in French, published again by the theologians of Leuven. I believe all the foolish devils have entered into them, for they note books of all disciplines not to be read (and also propose those to be read), where they indeed so empty the literary games that they even prohibit catechisms. He will make it (the book) Latin.</p>

      <p>Farewell with yours and Gwalther, to whom I will write once I have finished reading his "Antichrist". Basel, October 7, 1546. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned, most faithful doctor of the Church of Christ, the venerable lord in Christ, Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
