      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I thank you for everything and in all things, which you continuously bestow upon me. Our Haller sent me your letters along with your booklet; they contained the most delightful matters. Your writing against the Interim has not yet been completely translated; when it is translated, he will send it to me. The day before yesterday, I was with him in Bern; he said that the time has already come for him to be recalled by you. This matter displeased me greatly because of our common situation. For as far as I understand, he is exceedingly well-received by the people of Bern; the church affirms that if they had always had him, such great hatred among the citizens could never have arisen; indeed, the whole matter will be worse if he is taken away from them again. Therefore, as much as it is in your power, my father, I beg you not to allow him to be denied to the people of Bern who are requesting him. We are one church, and this will increase mutual love more, and old hatred will be extinguished if we have common pastors on both sides, etc. But you, with your singular wisdom, can best consider and assist in these matters; meanwhile, pardon the foolish advisor. Our people greet you. Greet yours in my name. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Biel, 12 days before the Kalends of June 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Antistes of the Zürich church, Heinrich Bullinger, his father, always to be greatly respected. In Zürich.</p>
