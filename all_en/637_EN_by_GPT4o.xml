      <p>Greetings. The most learned man, Mr. Johannes N.,</p>
      <p>from Lucerne, who there both presided over the school and purely preached the word of the Lord, has come to us. I believe he is unknown to you by face, but known by letters. He informed Mr. Joachim Beldius, our consul, who a few years ago administered the praetorship among them and was therefore deemed especially suitable to use his counsel, how he fell into the utmost indignation of the praetor of Lucerne due to his evangelical profession. This Silvanus is a most vehement persecutor of the evangelical profession, which is common to them above others. Since our consul could not assist him due to the divided interests of our district, he decided, by his counsel, to approach the council of Zürich and to inform them, as their most reverend lords, of the impotence of their praetor, who ought to have been the administrator of all the Swiss, not of private affections, so that his just cause may not be oppressed by such an unjust prejudice. Therefore, he requested letters from me to you and all the brothers, and that by the right of familiarity, which we were joined by during those days he was with us. I considered it unjust not to comply with his request, not because he needs commendation, since his diligent work is already known to you and all the pious are held in high esteem by you in their own name, but so that, accompanied by our letters, he may more confidently approach the city not seen before and your unknown house. I hope you will assist him, for he presents the example of a pious and learned man, and you will commend his cause to the council, so that by their counsel this obstinate violence may be countered.</p>
      <p>Farewell and always keep me recommended to you. I wish all the brothers well.</p>
      <p>From Glarus, August 17, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Valentin Tschudi.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zürich, most esteemed friend and brother.</p>
