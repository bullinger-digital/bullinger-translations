      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, your letters have been delivered to me. I am sending back what you requested. I have diligently informed you about everything. Regarding Italian affairs, I have nothing beyond what I have written. The Pope has created four cardinals; however, I lost the list with their names. Two of them are Venetians, and the third is a Venetian inquisitor; I do not remember the fourth, etc. I have also informed you about our affairs. I ask and beseech you not to abandon the common cause, which is being pursued with all strength by those from Palestine. Difficult things are beautiful. If the Lord blesses the undertaking, as I still hope, the victory will be very illustrious. No one is crowned unless they have competed lawfully. - I write this in haste, as I was about to escort Mr. Strupler, who came here to bid me farewell. Mr. Pontisella was with us, who sends you his respectful greetings. - Nikolaus von Pellizari was in Baden; he brought letters from the House of God. There is no reason to doubt; they were indeed written and delivered; if they were not taken care of, this is unfortunate. Consul Tscharner signed in the name of the House of God, he told me himself. Tomorrow the House of God meets here. I will inform you of everything. Farewell, reverend Father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, in the year 1566. Y[ours] F[abricius].</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his and in Christ reverend Father. Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
