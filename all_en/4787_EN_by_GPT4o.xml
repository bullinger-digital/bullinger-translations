      <p>Greetings. I received letters from Binas in Chiavenna, the previous ones from Mr. Augustin Maynard, in which he explains that a decision was made by the common consent of the brothers, which orders all foreigners coming there to be examined as to what religion they belong to, and to require them to subscribe to the Rhaetian confession. He adds that some consider this quite tyrannical and oppose it in every way; for it is enough, they say, if someone makes a confession of the Apostles' Creed, and there is no need for the Athanasian Creed, etc. The latter letters are written by Francis Portus on behalf of the newcomers, whom the people of Chiavenna are trying to expel from the place; he shows that many damages will follow if they are burdened so that they cannot stay there; he asks that I obtain from our most honorable magistrate letters of recommendation to the Chur Senate and other Rhaetian orders, to commend the cause of the newcomers. Here I am holding a wolf by the ears; for I doubt for what reason they should be moved from that place.</p>
      <p>For if they refuse to subscribe to your confession, I do not wish to take up their cause; but if they are to be expelled for other reasons and are sincere in religion, I will gladly lend them my assistance.</p>
      <p>In this matter, I await your judgment and what you advise, or what should be requested from our magistrate, and thus prescribe. I see that you must respond promptly.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing to write.</p>
      <p>What is happening, I pray, in Italy? What are the fathers attempting in the holy council of Trent? Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 9, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, his dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
