      <p>S. D. To ensure I write something, dear brother, I at least wanted to write that I received your letters and laughed heartily when I read the fool's sermon. Immediately, this came to mind: "Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies, you have perfected praise to destroy the enemy and the avenger." Often these people have sung praises before victory, when their battle cry finally ends in their own: rest for them, light for them, etc.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, that with Sisera and Holofernes laid low, the church may sing praises to the Lord, for He is good, for His mercy endures forever; for He is present with the afflicted and hears those who call upon His name, He exalts the humble and casts down the proud from their seats. As for Gideon, as much as I can, I will take care of him. But you know that the magistrate and the church are completely burdened in this matter, and you rightly judge it to be disgraceful that a city so wealthy does not at least provide for the son of its minister in some way. He served the church for many years; now this is the gratitude he receives. But the Lord predicted this would happen to us, who will never forsake us and ours. - The Bishop of Constance continues in his purpose, about which I recently wrote to you, and I hear a meeting has been called for the first of September. May they have good fortune in battle, as they seek peace, etc. - I hear the Bernese are seriously deliberating whether to accept the French alliance or reject it; the king's envoy is pressing them. However, I hear they are prescribing some new articles, especially this one: that the true religion should be free throughout the entire kingdom, etc., and I do not know what else. Now someone is here who is asking for these letters. I have spent the entire day writing several letters to Poland and Heidelberg, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I pray you take these things in good part.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with Mr. Ganthner, Pontasella, the honorable councilors, and also Charles and the royal envoy, as well as Balthasar the interpreter, whom you will greet in my name.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 15, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger, the elder, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
