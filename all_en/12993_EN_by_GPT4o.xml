    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Renato has not yet received any feedback from Bullinger on his letter [not received], which the young [... Paravicini] was supposed to deliver recently. Renato asked that Bullinger take care of the young man and share his opinion on a subtle, perhaps somewhat strange-seeming question: Renato and his colleagues are unsure whether, according to Christ's instruction, during the baptism of a boy (or another person), the words "I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" [Mt 28, 19] are necessary at all during the sprinkling. Most [theologians] have so far held the opinion that it is not a valid baptism if these words are omitted. If Bullinger has some time to spare, he should indicate whether this is true or not. In doing so, he should support his answer with arguments or with the Holy Scripture. Renato and his colleagues know that Bullinger will be all the more willing to do this, as he can probably answer this question easily without much effort. They do not want to bother him, only to let him partake in their eager inquiries. If this is too much, Bullinger should somehow let them know.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger should also share his opinion and prognosis on the current situation. In Chiavenna, there is nothing noteworthy to report, except that people fear the future, even though they have not given up all hope.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Greetings from Agostino Mainardi, Francesco Negri (who has been very ill for four days), and from all colleagues, also to Bullinger's colleagues and to the whole church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The enclosed letter should be forwarded to Celio Secondo Curione in Basel.</p>

      <p>Camillo Renato to Heinrich Bullinger, an excellent man, sends greetings in the Lord.</p>

      <p>I have no idea what you think of my previous letters, which I had sent to you through a young man from our region a few days ago. I wrote that you would do us a great favor if we understood that the young man, whom we recommended to you more from the heart than with words, was commended to you, and what you think about a subtle and perhaps even, as it might seem, curious question. There was a debate among us about whether it is absolutely necessary, when a boy or anyone else is being baptized, to add the words prescribed by Christ during the act of washing: “I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” Many have said and written so far that without these words, or if omitted in any way, there is no baptism. If you could write to us at your leisure whether this is correct or not, you would understand how grateful we would be. We do not merely seek a dry opinion, but one that is complete and not suspended, confirmed either by reason or by testimony from the Holy Scriptures. We know you will do this all the more willingly and conveniently, as the matter itself seems minor and the discussion easier, nor would I want you to think that we, occupied with more serious matters, are causing you any trouble, as we often have in the past, especially now in this matter. Our studies and your proven kindness and love towards us are already sufficient cause. Therefore, if you wish to avoid trouble, to put a brake on our studies, you must show yourself difficult in the future. How you can achieve this, you yourself will see.</p>

      <p>Moreover, regarding the state and fate of these times, what you think, what is to be feared or hoped for, and if there is anything else you think we should know, please inform us as soon as possible out of your kindness and our relationship. Here we have nothing that we think should be committed to writing, except fear; yet we have not entirely lost hope. As for the rest, Agostino Mainardi, Francesco Negri, who has been seriously ill for four days, and all the brothers, greet you, and in the name of whom you will greet your colleagues and the entire church in Zurich in the Lord. Farewell. Chiavenna, July 6, 1547.</p>

      <p>If it is convenient and certain, I ask again and again that you ensure this letter is delivered to Celio Secondo Curione, who is now staying in Basel.</p>
