      <p>S. D. I received two letters from your piety, dearest brother, the first written on June 7th, the latter on July 1st, and in these, the letter from Mr. Consul Welser, which I am returning here.</p>
      <p>Everything is ulcerated everywhere, everything is teeming with wars and treacheries, because this whole world is set in evil and, for the most part, knowingly and willingly opposes the truth.</p>
      <p>Italy is miserably torn apart by famine and war, yet it does not cease to act Italian; everything throughout Germany trembles with fear of war; but we do not cease to act German; therefore, the judgments of God are just.</p>
      <p>What is more, ministers, having set aside all gentleness, rage and act ferociously like wild beasts against their brothers? I speak of the Lutherans; it is astonishing how they rage against us. Various rumors are spread here about various matters; they say it is certain that Poland has received the Gospel of Christ; in England, the most cruel slaughter is being carried out. May God be with us!</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, Regensburg, and in other cities of the empire, the Lutherans now have nothing to attack in such great corruption of all than us. Let us pray to the Lord to be with the afflicted church; it is certain that the Lutherans are far more hostile to us than the Papists.</p>
      <p>You will keep one of these booklets for yourself, and you will give the other to Mr. Consul Fuchs. Would that Samuel Wittenbach, warned by the calamities of many, would now abstain from the military service that is being prepared! You will greet him and encourage him to remember himself and his own. You will especially greet Mr. Consul, Mr. Jakob Funk, Mr. Valerius, and the other friends. Live and farewell together with your whole family. Zurich, July 21, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Johannes Haller, my dear godfather, to deliver this letter in Biel to the honorable Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, preacher in Biel.</p>
