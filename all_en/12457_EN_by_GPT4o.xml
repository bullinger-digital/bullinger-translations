    <p xml:id="regest1">After his return from [Zurich], Hochholzer discussed Bullinger's request for [information] about the castles [in Aargau] with Gabriel [Meyer], who promised his support. They will send Bullinger some notes. If [Gabriel Meyer] knew exactly what [Johannes Stumpf needed for his "Swiss Chronicle"], he could make a more suitable selection.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- On his way back from his trip, Heinrich Lochmann was asked in Aarau whether it was true that one could gamble for money in Zurich. Lochmann, as he admitted remorsefully, had said in jest that drinking was forbidden in Zurich and instead gambling [for money] was allowed, to avoid frequent drinking. At Gabriel [Meyer's] request, Bullinger should explain the situation to the mayor [Hans Rudolf] Lavater so that this incident does not harm Lochmann. It was only a joke, albeit an inappropriate one, especially since it could have harmed [Zurich] and the true faith. The [Aarau] bailiff [Beat von Luternau] is being laughed at for being so gullible. The [Zurichers] should not worry. This story will not be spread as a verified report from [Aarau] to other cities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- In recent days, Hochholzer was in Zurich again for another matter, but did not dare to disturb the busy Bullinger with a visit. Hochholzer would like to ask for his brother [Heinrich]'s hand in marriage to [Anna Thumysen], the daughter of [Großhans Thumysen] who fell in the [Second Kappel] War, and who lives with his brother [Rudolf Thumysen]. Hochholzer would have liked to entrust Bullinger with this task, but since Bullinger and [Heinrich] do not know each other well, Hochholzer entrusted the matter to Johannes Fries. However, Bullinger's advice is useful to him in any case. Perhaps Rudolf Thumysen will make some inquiries; in this case, Bullinger should act in the interest of the Hochholzer brothers. [Heinrich] should marry an honorable woman. Neither [Anna] nor [Heinrich] have large financial means, but she has honorable parents [Großhans Thumysen and Anna, née Werdmüller] and is modest, as Hochholzer heard. [Heinrich], for his part, is diligent and skilled in his [girdler] craft. Bullinger should discuss the matter with Fries or with Rudolf Thumysen, who particularly loves [Anna].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. When I returned home from you, my esteemed lord and father, I discussed the matter you entrusted to me regarding the castles, their founders, and owners with Master Gabriel [Meyer]. He promises his assistance in this matter; we will compile some notes and send them to you. He has many things that he could more conveniently communicate in person, having seen the order of your discussion, what might be missing or what might contribute; but when you see it, if you desire anything further, you will indicate it.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, what I especially want you to know now: Heinrich Lochmann, having returned from his journey to Aarau, when some inquired more diligently whether it was permissible to gamble for money in Zurich, confessed that he had said it in jest and regretted the statement. For he wanted to avoid frequent drinking, since it is forbidden by law to drink in Zurich, and instead gambling was permitted, not with the intention that it should be believed, but more to mock. I mention this so that you may explain the matter to the most prudent and vigilant mayor, Hans Rudolf Lavater, as Master Gabriel requests, so that Heinrich does not suffer any harm because of this. It was a joke, but not a decent one; for it tends to bring disgrace to our city and the true religion. Our people already know, not without great joy, that these are mere tales. Our bailiff, Beat von Luternau, is being laughed at for being so easily deceived. There is no need for you to be concerned about that vain persuasion, although it has been spread as certain in other cities.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Moreover, I was in Zurich for a certain matter these days, which I would have liked to communicate to you; however, the multitude of tasks incumbent upon you made me not dare to confer with you. Since I am fully convinced that I will conduct everything more successfully with your advice, I cannot refrain from revealing what it is. I was contemplating marrying my brother to an honorable girl, the daughter of Großhans Thumysen, who fell in our ill-fated war, whom Rudolf Thumysen raises in his house. I would have liked to handle this through you, but I feared it would be burdensome to you, especially since my brother is less known to you, so I entrusted the matter to Johannes Fries to be settled in my name. In this matter, your advice or assistance would be quite beneficial. Perhaps Rudolf Thumysen will inquire about something. Then I ask you to do what you know to be in my and my brother's interest. I do not want to impose the whole matter on your shoulders. I wish for my brother to be given an honorable woman, even if she is not wealthy. She is such a person. She does not have ample means, nor does my brother. However, she is born of honorable parents, chaste and modest, as I hear. I will not fail my brother as far as my means allow. He knows how to work, and he is as skilled in his craft as anyone else. Therefore, if you can do anything (and certainly you can do much), I ask you to do so, either by discussing the matter with Fries or with Rudolf Thumysen, the girl's uncle; for he, above all other brothers, has taken the girl into his home and regards her almost as a daughter.</p>

      <p>Farewell and keep me, as entirely yours, commended. My wife, Agathe, née Näf, sends many greetings to all of yours. Aarau, April 4, 1546.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and sincere man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Christ in Zurich, his lord and most esteemed father.</p>
