      <p>Reverend and most illustrious men, esteemed lords, greetings and commendation of my duties. While I am here with the young son of the most illustrious prince and lord, Nicholas Radziwiłł, Duke of Ołyka and Nieśwież, etc., for the sake of studies, these letters were sent to me, which I offer to your excellencies through the present bearer. I earnestly request that, since the matter concerns the benefit of the church, your excellencies do not hesitate to respond briefly to the aforementioned prince regarding these writings, whether it be done through the present bearer or through another messenger (if it is not convenient now) specifically hired for this purpose, to whom I will gladly pay when he comes to me.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I will detain the nobleman who came here with these writings until a response has been received from your excellencies.</p>
      <p>With this, I diligently commend myself and my duties to your excellencies. Given in Tübingen on the 19th of October, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your excellencies' most ready servant, Balthasar von Lehwald, administrator of the studies of the young Prince Radziwiłł in Tübingen.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and most excellent men, the lords superintendent and pastors of the church in Zürich, esteemed lords and friends.</p>
