    <p xml:id="regest1">Comply with the request to take a position on the Zurich Confession of the Lord's Supper demanded by Bucer [No. 482]. See it testified therein that through the breaking of the bread and the offering of the cup, the communion of the body and blood of Christ is spiritually given to the believers, but to the unbelievers, it is only bread for judgment, as Christ and Paul teach. Testify themselves that through the sacrament, the merit of and participation in Christ's Passion is offered to the outer senses, the inner person is thereby made alive through faith and will rise on the Last Day because of the absolution from sins, and that bread and wine should be consumed with fear and yet with trust and self-examination. Before God, Luther, and others, it should be confessed that they are willing to improve because here all have only babbled and have not fulfilled their office. Vadian thinks likewise and desires concord. Request brotherly prayer and admonition. Retain the copy [of No. 482] without any other notice.</p>

      <p>Salvation and grace from God the Father and peace through our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Your letters, most pleasing to us, have come into our hands, bearing witness to your love towards us and your piety, along with a booklet in which you explain the confession concerning the holy Eucharist, as demanded by Bucer, and you ask that, having read it, we either add our approval or, if we have any better advice - as you are modest - we send it back to you.</p>
      <p>We have read and reread it with our limited ability, and we commend your education in such a holy matter, granted to you by God for the edification of the churches - let no one applaud themselves beyond this measure - and we have seen that you aim to testify through this confession: Through the holy breaking of the bread and the distribution of the holy cup, the communion of the body and blood of Christ is spiritually and truly ministered to believers, but to unbelievers, it is not the body of Christ, but holy bread unto judgment - since Christ, our Savior, himself asserts: "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you" [John 6:53] and: "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life" [John 6:54] and the rest, and again: "Whoever eats this bread will live forever" [John 6:58] and: "As I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me" [John 6:57], and further, the divine Paul says: "Whoever eats this bread unworthily" etc. [1 Cor 11:27], "eats and drinks judgment on themselves" etc. [1 Cor 11:29]. From these, it is necessary to conclude what you simply and sincerely profess with much exegesis.</p>
      <p>Therefore, have our testimony, which you request, on this holy matter, namely that we rely on our doctrine and the strength which the Lord grants us, unworthy fellow presbyters, through the merit of his passion, and will continue to rely until the end of this life, so that all the faithful of Christ may know that through the holy sacraments, the merit and participation in the precious passion of the Lord is offered to the external senses, by which the inner person is made alive through faith and, reviving, will rise with the outer person on the last day and become a partaker of the glory of Christ, who rose from the dead and lives with the eternal God, and that through repentance and the absolution of sins in the blood of the Lamb, and that with trembling and fear, yet trusting and examining ourselves, we may eat of that bread and drink of the cup. We confess this to you and persuade others by teaching the same, convinced by the authority of the holy scripture and examples. It would please us if you would also freely confess before God, Luther, and the other brothers, even if we have not spoken as worthily or as holy as the majesty of such a divine communion demands, that we would gladly amend. For all of us, to speak the truth, have erred and been lukewarm, nor have we conducted ourselves with dignity in this ministry as in others. But these are the studies of beginners among many, who begin to exercise and become wiser and better day by day.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we have handed it over to Vadian, our lord and brother, to read, who feels the same as we do and desires nothing more with prayers and wishes than that holy concord may grow among the pastors of the churches, so that with one spirit and one mind we may profess the one Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Finally, dearest brothers and venerable in the Lord, we give you great thanks for remembering us and loving us in Christ. Only do so that we may reap infinite fruits of your love, and always, if there is anything to be admonished or reproved, diligently accomplish it. Especially make us participants in the holy prayers of your churches, so that the word of the Lord may run and we may be able to live what the divine word repeats through our impure mouths. A copy will remain with us unless you order otherwise by reply. May the grace of the Lord be with you all, who are in Christ Jesus, to whom be glory in eternal eternities. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your brothers Wolfgang Wetter, Matheus Alther, Sebastian Cuontz, Dominicus Zili, and the rest.</p>
      <p>To the pastors of the Zurich churches, Leo Jud, Heinrich Bullinger, etc., our venerable brothers in Christ.</p>
