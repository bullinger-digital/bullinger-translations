      <p>God be with us, etc., beloved lord and brother, etc.</p>
      <p>If it were well with you and your people (household), it would be my joy, etc. I have understood from ZÃ¶ger, the old Appenzeller, the messenger, that you cannot write to me about many matters, etc. Also, consider that you or my dear Rordorffer might (probably) have not yet been able to negotiate anything definitive regarding the inn of Ronen, now on behalf of my lord of Kyburg, etc. Although I might endure it, if it were possible for it to happen, I would adapt myself to it. For it concerns me, especially also my wife; with a request, if it is possible for you, to inform me, etc., as you also think it appropriate for me to receive the house, I entrust all authority to you. For I trust well, wherever I am lodged, I might always be tolerated, etc.</p>
      <p>Item, regarding the copy of the letter of the mortgage bond(?), as you know, etc., it is, as is certainly said, now Monday, ridden to Aarau to the French envoy; what is to be negotiated there or not, advising you, etc., and writing us news altogether, etc.</p>
      <p>They say the abbot had a small donkey paraded on Palm Sunday. It is good, he does not eat oats, etc.</p>
      <p>Beyond the Rhine, they are recruiting soldiers for the third time for the Emperor to go to Milan. It is possible, we will soon have letters, where the Emperor is, to inform you accordingly.</p>
      <p>Greeting both of us, your entire household, Rordorffer and all dear ones, etc.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, Wednesday before Easter day in the year 36.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant Hans Vogler, etc. If Rordorffer would like to write to me about something that might happen, I ask to inform him; for I am certain, regarding the house, I would receive news these days.</p>
      <p>To my beloved M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
