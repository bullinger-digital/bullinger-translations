      <p>Philipp Gallicius to his dear Heinrich, greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>In our Confederation, we baptize and admit godparents, whomever the parents of the infants wish and call for this purpose, so much so that the Bishop of Chur, who preceded this one, more than once sponsored infants at the baptism of our Comander. The Italian brothers say this is impious and that no one should be admitted as godparents in baptism who are entangled in papist faith and do not hold and confess ours as the true and Christian one. We indeed often advise those who are Christians not to call upon non-Christians as godparents; nevertheless, we do not reject those whom they wish to have and send with the infants to baptism, provided they confess God and His Son Jesus Christ and the other things which that so-called Apostles' Creed encompasses, which we also recite when we baptize, meanwhile committing to the Lord whether they believe in their hearts what they confess with their mouths. And certainly, admitting these and rejecting those might be bold or dangerous, since the greater part in our Confederation (among whom are many not at all bad men) are still in their former faith, from which disturbances against the gospel and us might be feared, especially in these times. Therefore, although it can be gathered from your clear writings what should be followed here, we prefer to hear the summary and conclusion of your opinion from you rather than to speak it for you; for that will be more certain both for ourselves and for others. You, therefore, who have received such gifts from the Lord and who have long shown yourself to be a Hercules in enduring and overcoming labors, deign to respond to us. For all of us who preach the gospel in the Confederation ask you to make us more certain of this, as soon as you can through your occupations. For it is much debated which opinion is better and what should be done.</p>
      <p>Moreover, concerning the council that is being held in Trient (Trent), we hear nothing now, except that we see it is held in little regard by almost everyone, even if many cardinals are gathered there.</p>
      <p>We have no other notable news. We earnestly pray: confirm, O God, what you have worked in us. Farewell, most esteemed man by all good people, and do not cease to care for us. Brother Comander always wishes you well. From Chur in the Grisons, on the 12th day of October in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>The same, yours no less than his own.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord, etc.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
