    <p xml:id="regest1">Caesarius has indeed seen Cochläus’ [„Replica brevis“], with which he responded to Bullinger's [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“], which was directed against Cochläus’ „De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae autoritate“. However, Caesarius will only read the [„Replica brevis“] once he has received Bullinger's [„Brevis ἀντιβολή“]. - Many want to know when Bullinger's commentary on Luke will be published. Caesarius tells them that he is waiting for it himself; probably a work by Bullinger will be offered at the [Frankfurt Spring] fair. - The Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] remains steadfast. May God strengthen him! - Caesarius is surprised that [Charles V.] persecutes the so-called "Lutherans" so harshly in his territories, especially since a council has been announced, in which he supposedly will participate himself and from which unity in the disputed questions is hoped for. - In Cologne, [Bartholomäus] Latomus published the [„Altera plenaque defensio“] against Bucer, and soon the 50-sheet [„Iudicii universitatis et cleri Coloniensis... defensio“] by the Carmelite Prior [Eberhard Billick] will be published against Bucer, Philipp [Melanchthon], and the jurist Oldendorp. A learned count [...] was already able to see some quarto sheets of it and could not help but laugh. [Billick] claimed at a banquet of the dean [Heinrich von Stolberg] that he would show in this work that Luther, [Melanchthon], Bucer, and the others had not understood the [Holy] Scripture! - Greetings to Gwalther. Caesarius recently saw his translation of the [„Christiana et orthodoxa assertio“] by [Johannes VI. Kantakuzenos], directed against the Muslims.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior.</p>
      <p>I recently found in the shop of a certain bookseller here a booklet by Cochläus, which responds to your work against him, "On the Authority of Scripture"; however, I have not yet read it, but I have reserved it until I receive your response to it, most excellent and learned man.</p>
      <p>Many people almost daily inquire of me whether your commentaries on Luke have been published or, if they have not yet been brought to light, whether they will be published at some point; to whom I usually respond that I too am eagerly expecting them day by day; but I fear that excessive labor may burden and weigh you down more than is fair. Yet I do not doubt that we will expect something of your writings at this Lenten fair. It is a huge labor and task to write on those authors and to explain them with commentaries, who treat almost the same subject, such as the four evangelists especially.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the most reverend Lord of Cologne has not yet completely abandoned or deserted his cause, indeed he perseveres most steadfastly, and, as I have heard from great men, he adheres to his purpose so firmly that he would rather die than let the cause fall. May God, the best and greatest, strengthen and confirm his spirit!</p>
      <p>I am greatly surprised at the emperor, that he so severely persecutes the so-called Lutherans, the ministers of his dominions, to such an extent that many of them, who are already experiencing persecution, are leaving their homeland with their wives and children. We must pray that the same God and Lord may change his spirit for the better. However, I am surprised, I say, why the emperor does this, especially since a council is said to be imminent, to which he himself, as they say, is going to come, where it is hoped that this matter, which has hitherto been controversial among great and learned men, will be settled and brought to unity. May Christ, for his glory, grant the princes and those men who are delegated to handle this matter a sound and pious mind, so that the matter may be examined and decided by judgment, not from affection.</p>
      <p>In Cologne these days, a booklet by Latomus against Bucer has come to light. Not long after, a book by the Carmelite Prior here, containing fifty sheets of paper, as I heard from the printer himself, will also be published. It deals in that book against Bucer, Philipp, and Aldendorp, the jurist. A certain not unlearned count here told me that he had seen some gatherings of that work and could not refrain from laughing while reading. What this means, I can somewhat conjecture; indeed, the same monk at the table of our dean in the great church here said that he would show in that work that Luther, Philipp, Bucer, and the others had not yet understood the Scripture; whence I can say with Horace or rather exclaim: "What will this promiser bring worthy of such a great mouth?" Whence the same immediately adds: "The mountains will labor; a ridiculous mouse will be born." Greet my Gwalther in my words, whose translation of a certain author against the Mohammedan sect I recently saw. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Cologne, on the second day after Laetare.</p>
      <p>Johannes Caesarius, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most practiced in sacred letters and also most skilled in more refined letters, his best and almost incomparable friend.</p>
