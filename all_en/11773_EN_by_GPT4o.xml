    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends [Johannes] Rhellikan's commentary on Julius Caesar's [„De bello Gallico“] as a gift from [Johannes] Hospinian; the anatomical books [„De humani corporis fabrica“ by Andreas Vesalius] are expected to be in print until the end of June; has no [ancient] gold or silver coins, but offers some bronze coins from the time of Emperor Constantine. Inquires about the price of the „Biblia [sacrosancta]“ by Leo [Jud]. [Johannes] Oporin will publish Epiphanius in Greek and in Latin translation by [Janus] Cornarius; [Rudolf] Gwalther, whose [translation of a work by Johannes Kantakuzenos] is being printed by Robert [Winter], should therefore not trouble himself unnecessarily with it. Gast intends to send the Hyginus after the [spring] fair. [Hieronymus] Froben has received [Flavius] Josephus in Greek and is preparing a complete edition of Athanasius; Bullinger will receive a list of new publications after the fair. Paul Phrygio has published a commentary on Leviticus. Greetings. Myconius reports on the death of [Johannes] Eck [Nr. 1729]. In Florence, three lightning strikes have hit the cathedral and the ducal palace. In Sicily, an earthquake has devastated several places; Catania and Augusta were particularly hard hit. These news were communicated to Peter [Martyr] Vermigli from Italy.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am sending here the annotations on Julius Caesar by Johannes Rhellicanus, which Hospinianus gives to you as a gift. The anatomical books are not yet completed. The second book is already being prepared for the press, and there will be seven books in total; the entire work might be completed by the end of June. I have a few coins, not gold or silver, but bronze, which were mostly minted under Emperor Constantine and are commonly found in our fields. If you wish, I will gladly send them with Christoph Froschauer, if he returns from the fair.</p>
      <p>I would like you to inquire about the price at which Leo's Bible would be sold. If they are sold at a high price in Zurich, then I could purchase and buy them from the Basel booksellers, so as not to be a burden to you and to the one who would have to transport them.</p>
      <p>Oporinus will publish Epiphanius in Greek and Latin, translated by Cornarius the physician. Therefore, he instructed me to inform you, so that Gwalther does not labor in vain in translating, which Robert will also print this summer.</p>
      <p>You will have Hyginus after the fair. Froben has received the entire Greek Josephus, which I have seen; when he will put it to press, I do not know. He is already preparing all the Greek works of Athanasius, which are also being translated into Latin by a certain theologian. Besides this, there is nothing new with us that Oporinus has not sent to our Frisian. However, you will have a catalog of all the books printed here and elsewhere after the fair.</p>
      <p>Paul Phrygio has published a commentary on Leviticus. Farewell. March 6, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>On the death of Eckius, Myconius. In three notable places in Florence, on December 22, the sky was struck.</p>
      <p>The first lightning bolt opened the highest vault of the main temple; the second caused so much ruin and damage to the same temple on the right side that it can hardly be repaired for 15,000 crowns. The third burned the duke's palace, in the part where they were accustomed to perform divine service, and killed a certain noble courtier. All these occurred at noon on the same day.</p>
      <p>In Sicily, on December 17, the fortress of Nicodia was overthrown by the force of earthquakes, and 150 houses collapsed, where many people also perished, so that the marquis of the city and his wife fled to Messina. The same happened in Catania and Syracuse; therefore, the inhabitants migrated from the cities. Lentini, Calatabiano, Militello, and many other places were destroyed. In Scordia, the lady of the city and her husband, along with their children and a large crowd of servants, perished in this disaster. The same happened in many villages, towns, and cities; but no city was more damaged, indeed overthrown, than Catania, except for Augusta, which was mostly submerged in the sea, bringing death to many people.</p>
      <p>These things were recently written to Peter Martyr from Italy.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the esteemed theologian, his dearest teacher. Zurich.</p>
