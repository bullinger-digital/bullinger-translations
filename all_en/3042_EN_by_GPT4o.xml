      <p>Your letters, as much desired as they were, were also very delightful, my venerable and dearest Bullinger. The reason I do not respond in writing is that my more than dear brother and fellow minister Funck is now traveling to you. He will serve as a substitute for a long letter, and he is even more welcome because he can explain everything to you in person and with greater fidelity about all our common and my private matters, as they stand. I commend him to you as myself, since he is not another self, but exactly the same as I am. The young man you sent has been received by our people for the service of the school; we wish him all the best and success with all our prayers.</p>
      <p>Funck, who is well aware of all our affairs and even my thoughts, will tell you the rest. Farewell, my soul, and remember us perpetually before the Lord, who may keep you flourishing in His church for as long as possible and may you continue to prosper happily. Greetings to your entire household. Stay and remain forever in the old ways; let me always be one of yours. I have written almost a cartload of letters, both out and also to Augsburg. Welser sends you his most friendly greetings, indicating that the Emperor is not taking his way to Spain, Duke of Alba is handling matters, and a large force has been gathered at Innsbruck and elsewhere. The business of the five places is foolishness; they will accomplish nothing; for he has understood what they are attempting, etc. November 5th.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. H. Bullinger.</p>
