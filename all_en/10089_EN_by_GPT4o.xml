      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I cannot help but congratulate myself, most esteemed Heinrich, that you pursue me, a very poor and most abject little man, with such favor that you console me not only with words but also with deeds, and especially in these days according to my necessity. For I am convinced that you sent me your book, a most welcome gift, to declare your goodwill towards me, so that I do not doubt that I have friends who are not ashamed of me, even if through the former tragedy stirred up in me I am a reproach and abjection of the people, etc., and so that I may consult your book on what needs to be done whenever my afflictions, with which the Lord God continually exercises me, meet me, etc.</p>
      <p>I therefore give your kindness the greatest thanks I can. If only it were possible to repay, according to your dignity, what I owe, and you see that I have the utmost regard for this gift of yours and that your effort has not been in vain, etc. The rest, which I wanted to write, I would like to tell you in person, when it is possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed lord, keeping me in your care. January 26.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johann Valentin Furtm√ºller.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the city of Zurich.</p>
