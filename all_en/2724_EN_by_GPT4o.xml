      <p>S. D. I do not doubt, most esteemed man, that you were surprised that you received no letters from me during the previous fairs. However, I would like you to know that this was not due to any negligence, but because, although I greatly desired to inform you how the letters you sent to the most illustrious prince on behalf of our studies were received, I had not yet received any certain news to report. Even though I am still not entirely sure how the most illustrious prince interpreted your advice or what his disposition is towards us and our studies, I thought it would be unwise for your students to leave Frankfurt without a letter from us. I am especially grateful, as much as I can be, that as soon as you understood the state of our affairs and public studies, you immediately tried to provide assistance and did not hesitate to appeal to the prince himself to uphold the dignity of our studies. Therefore, I cannot help but greatly praise your spirit towards our school, and I would rightly be considered ungrateful if I did not proclaim it as long as I live. Certainly, my faith, diligence, and labors, which were devoted to the public benefit of students and especially to promoting the doctrine of religion, have unfortunately resulted in letters full of slanders and lies, which deceitful adversaries had fabricated. But it pleases the Lord, as I willingly interpret it, to exercise me for a time, so that when the opportunity arises and the adversaries are revealed, I may return to the arena better prepared and more eager.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I have felt myself repeatedly refreshed and strengthened by the letters and conversations of certain pious and learned men. Yielding to their advice, I am beginning to gradually neglect and despise the injuries that some most impudent Epicureans have inflicted on me and our studies, and I am no longer as anxious as before about abandoning the school. For, to tell the truth, there are those who are trying to draw me elsewhere, and I am indeed glad that I am not bound here by any means and that I can find hospitality and earn an honest stipend elsewhere whenever I wish. Therefore, our school, which last year was partly dispersed due to those who, with a hostile spirit, sought to completely suppress our studies, and partly due to the spreading plague, is now gradually regaining its former strength, and indeed the number and fervor of those who devote themselves to theology is increasing daily. Therefore, my spirit predicts that we will soon see better times.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Diet of Augsburg, I do not doubt that you have heard what it has produced; namely, the Austrian catechism (whose authors I understand to be certain monks called Jesuits) has provided a clear example of what could have been expected if the adversaries had had the opportunity as they had the will. For a new Interim of the same coin was bound to follow. But He who dwells in the high heavens sees and laughs at the vain thoughts of men, and He has thwarted their wicked attempts. However, I have understood that certain things have been accomplished by our men, which we had not even dared to hope for before.</p>
      <p>They say the bishop has relinquished the jurisdiction he had claimed in those regions where the churches have long been reformed, which I truly consider a great benefit divinely granted to our churches. Regarding a new colloquy to be held for the reconciliation of doctrines, something was written to me from Augsburg; but since the Diet is now ending, it may perhaps be resumed in March of the following year, and I cannot affirm anything for certain. As for myself, I frankly doubt whether anything will be achieved by such colloquies.</p>
      <p>For what, I ask, can be hoped for from them, when, although various errors of the churches are frequently and clearly brought to light and refuted, the bishops and all the papists sufficiently declare that they do not seriously seek the glory of God, as they do not abolish even one superstitious rite in their churches nor promote any salutary institution of the ancient church, among those that have now been restored. Therefore, where such hypocrisy perpetually reigns, how can we hope for any success? God is not mocked. I hear that the Duke of Württemberg has written to our prince about convening a synod or colloquy in which the leaders of our churches may decide on ceremonies and, if possible, compose a common form of ceremonies and rites to be used by all. For although the dignity of the Christian religion is not at all placed in these external and bodily matters, yet both for the sake of our weak brothers and for the sake of the adversaries of stiff neck, who both very hatefully complain that serious offenses arise from such a variety of ceremonies, it is rightly considered that deliberations should be undertaken about similarity and agreement in rites. I understand that this plan is approved not only by our prince but also by some others, and I could easily believe that the adversaries could somehow be silenced if they saw equality of ceremonies introduced into our churches, and they would think less about fabricating a new Interim when they observed that all our people were content and devoted to a few select ceremonies. But I fear that from the very things from which consensus is hoped for, the seeds of new dissensions may sprout; for if those whose minds are always more focused on external and less necessary matters than on the very doctrine on which the hinge of religion turns and without which churches do not stand, will insist that all churches be immediately compelled to the rites and ceremonies that happen to be approved, it will indeed be feared that fierce conflicts, not to mention cruel persecutions, will follow, and unless very prudent moderators are present, many even pious and modest people will judge that the freedom which Christ asserted for the churches with his blood is being not moderately undermined. Now, regarding the diligent inspection and visitation of churches and the restoration of a certain ecclesiastical discipline among the maritime cities and Saxon territories, moreover, in the dominion of the Elector Prince Augustus, the same has been done by certain distinguished men, partly noble, partly from the order of the learned (among them were Dr. Johannes Forster, Paulus Eber, professors of the Wittenberg school, and Georgius Fabricius of Chemnitz), and more than a hundred ministers have been removed from ecclesiastical function there, and I believe that the Elector Palatine has also begun to take the same path, as far as the state of the churches in his dominion allows, and finally, I believe that our prince is now preparing similar things, as you have long been informed by others.</p>
      <p>These things indeed make me hope that our churches will be better ordered in many places and that the name of God and the gospel will be better heard. I am indeed convinced that God the heavenly Father is now granting some peace from arms to Germany, so that the churches may breathe, be refreshed, and if any were scattered and dispersed by the storms of the Interim, they may be gathered again.</p>
      <p>Dr. Philipp Melanchthon has finally wished his opinion on punishing and removing heretics by the magistrate to be published in a brief scholastic question, and the same (unless our Heinrich Victor of Friedberg was mistaken in his opinion, who told me) he included in his letters to you. Dr. Philipp certainly sent it to me through his son-in-law, Mr. Caspar Peucer, who recently traveled this way.</p>
      <p>The young men you sent here are conducting themselves well, and I desire nothing in them. However, there is one, Johannes Conradus Fabricius, with a happy and fertile mind, but whom it would be more advisable to recall home soon rather than leave here longer. You see how I strive to compensate for the long silence with prolixity. Consider me, as you have hitherto, among your own. I wish to greet the lords and colleagues from me, whom I revere as teachers. Farewell in Christ. Marburg, September 11, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, Andreas Hyperius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his venerable lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
