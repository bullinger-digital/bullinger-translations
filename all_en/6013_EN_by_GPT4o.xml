      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt, most excellent man, that (especially in these troubled times) you have infinite and very serious occupations, which I wish would not sometimes overly burden your kindness, so that you may be able to remain with us longer! As for the Ochino matter, I copied it quickly and return it with the utmost thanks, which would have been done several days ago, had not by chance our Augustin arrived, to whom I preferred to entrust it rather than to anyone else. And I certainly desired all those things, as you said, anxiously and for many reasons. How well you acted in warning the Rhaetians not to be seduced, since that wretched Ochino is said to be seeking them. We too must always be warned about such matters and such things must be communicated to us; there are many reasons at hand. I suspect or fear nothing else than that everything is being set up and has been set up to divide our churches. However, there are many other scandals remaining, more than is fitting. May God preserve us, not impute sins, nor punish us according to their merits! As soon as the response concerning the Sulceran matter has been brought to you, please inform us of everything, what you and yours think about it and what the most honorable magistrate and you are going to do from both sides. We are amazed at how things stand, that they have taken care to publish the old confession anew, to which Sulzer is said to have subscribed again. And the people of Basel elevate Sulzer to the third heaven, who, if they meet ours, will also have some among us who praise and admire him, who, if there were an opportunity, might perhaps even try to impose the Augsburg Confession; if we did not want it, it would be an opportunity for them to expel us. But the Lord knows his own. I could not understand anything about the conversation between the cardinal and Bernardino. The cardinal quickly passed through the city around half past three on December 17th with fourteen horsemen, all of whom were covered with white cloaks. He proceeded on that journey to a city belonging to the jurisdiction of our magistrate, whose prefect is Mr. M. Peyer, and other men pertaining to it. That same night Mr. Martin was here with us, unaware that the cardinal was spending the night in the town; the next morning the cardinal departed hastily. I inquired through others from the host whether any gray-haired man had conversed with the cardinal or whether such and such had spent the night with him. He said he had not observed such things, that there were some gray-haired among them, and that two always walked in the hypocaust and conversed among themselves, not knowing what or what kind. Here almost all the more notable guests were asked about such a guest, but no one could recount anything. Therefore, I do not know whether Ochino made his journey through Schaffhausen to the Rhaetians and whether he conversed with the cardinal. There was a rumor for some time that Calvin was dead, but uncertain. And now I will conclude. When the French ambassador was here recently, he invited me alone to a lunch, which was attended by most of the senators, centurions, etc. I not only did not want to attend this banquet, but I could not due to illness. Nor could I find out for what reason this was done. Even if I had been well, I would have judged that I should not go: I am uncertain, however. I would perceive what you would have advised me. Thus I seek your counsel even in this. In the coming July, the treaty with the French will end. I fear many are working to establish a new one. I have already gathered many reasons which seemed to me to dissuade me from it: The king is a boy. The Mass. Cursed is he who trusts in man. The minds of the French against us. The covenants of the Israelites. Bad examples. The fatherland and parents, etc. But I will hear your counsel, for the hypocrites will pretend true religion.</p>
