    <p xml:id="regest1">Is surprised that he was not informed about Bullinger's illness and spa treatment. Would have appreciated it if Bullinger and Grynaeus had traveled to Strasbourg or Haguenau, as this would have fostered friendly relations and discouraged the opponents. These wanted to use the recently concluded convention to strengthen their alliance and only pretended to be willing to negotiate; as a condition, they demanded the restitution of church property and the renunciation of the expansion of the [Schmalkaldic] League. King [Ferdinand] forwarded the Protestants' rejecting response in a distorted manner and announced a new meeting in Worms; under Fabri's influence, he apparently wants to subject them to the Imperial Chamber Court and destroy them by force. The Archbishop of Trier has died. The Dean of Passau, Ruprecht von Mosham, is spreading a new doctrine directed against both the Pope and Luther, for which he was expelled from Passau. All this should also be communicated to Theodor [Bibliander], from whom Myconius expects a response to his last letter.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is surprising that, while you were ill, no one informed me of it with even a single word. In recent days, I understood that you were bathing and not entirely well; but I thought it was just a result of the bath. I would have at least prayed with mine for you to the Lord.</p>
      <p>But I rejoice that you have recovered; I wish that you may continue in good health for a long time. I understood well enough what you wrote in your recent letters; however, I wish you had been either in Strasbourg or Haguenau, not because I ever thought anything would be accomplished regarding the reformation, but so that your presence and that of Grynaeus would have fostered friendship among the learned and instilled terror in the papists due to the concord they would have suspected. For I know how fierce they are, because they think there is discord among us. Nothing terrifies them more than when they even dream of our concord. Something of this was said in front of Faber. He immediately said: "A feigned concord; we fear nothing."</p>
      <p>But listen briefly to the end of the assembly. As they gathered, so they dissolved. The adversaries' plan, by which they wish to ruin us, has failed. They aimed to expand their alliance to avoid being compelled to reform. The offered colloquium was a pretense, not truth; for otherwise, the pacifying princes did not want to hear about defense (thus the legate of the Roman pontiff called the war against us for his church) and even less about the alliance. But they had so contracted the colloquium that they could not do otherwise, adding these two conditions: The first, that before the day of the colloquium, ecclesiastical goods be returned to the dispossessed or that they be answered for before the judges of the chamber or allowed to be held by sequestrators; the second, that the Protestants should not be concerned with those who had come to them after the peace given at Nuremberg, whether anything was done with them justly or unjustly, nor with those who might still come. And here indeed there was much labor; for they cannot bear that our alliance be expanded further.</p>
      <p>Moreover, hear similarly what our people responded: "We have never ejected any rightful possessor, and the ecclesiastical goods are partly ours. Likewise, we have transferred them as the canons command. Finally, if anyone still retains anything otherwise than said, he will answer at the next colloquium, where it will be determined whose goods they are and who their user is." They further requested that the demands for restitution, the chamber, and sequestration be deferred. To the other condition, they responded that they would not reject anyone who wishes to devote themselves to Christ. The king, having heard these things along with his deputies, responded nothing, but wanted to refer the matter to the remaining orders. This he also did, but so concisely, indeed deceitfully, that the Archbishop of Cologne and some other princes requested from our people that the entire action be written down for them. Having done this, they were somewhat astonished. The king transferred the colloquium to Worms in the tenth week after the last day of the assembly. Our people requested a few weeks to be added; but when the matter is weighed by the lamp (as the saying goes), the adversaries seek something else. Thus our people divine that the king will return all actions against us to the chamber and that it will happen that, with the alliance expanded, he will crush us by force. In sum: Faber, who is a god or at least an angel of the king, thirsts for the blood of us all, a distinguished soldier.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Archbishop of Trier went to Haguenau and died. A new antagonist of the pope and Luther has arisen, a man of titles, Dr. Ruprecht von Mosham, Dean of Passau, counselor to the Roman royal majesty. He has discovered that both the pope is the antichrist and Luther is the antichrist.</p>
      <p>He writes a new doctrine, according to which it should henceforth be preached, namely: With the heart, one believes unto righteousness, with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation [Romans 10:10], with works, charity is performed unto perfection. With this doctrine, he has achieved only that he was ejected from the city by the chapter of Passau; but more on this another time.</p>
      <p>These things should be shared with Theodor, to whom tell that I will not write again until he responds to my last letter, to which a disputation was attached.</p>
      <p>Farewell always with yours in the Lord. Greet all the brothers. Basel, August 3, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
