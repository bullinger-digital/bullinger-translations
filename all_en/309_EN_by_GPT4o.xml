      <p>May the grace of the Lord be with you. When your young men visited me, greeting me in your name, I did not want to dismiss them with just a greeting, but with a letter, so that you might learn of our situation, most revered lord and brother in Christ, etc. We are still caught in this persecution by Charles, unaware of the time and manner of the persecution; however, we are certain, unless the gracious deity averts it with its usual mercy, that we too, no less than the other churches, will be tested. Especially because of the abominable impiety and ingratitude, which is so rampant among many who seemed to be pillars of religion, that it can only be removed by divine vengeance.</p>
      <p>Life is lived very poorly, sin is committed with all license, so that the morals of the pagans were hardly as corrupt as ours. What then is to be hoped for, except destruction, I ask?</p>
      <p>I could hardly inscribe in a large book the impenitence, contempt of the word, neglect of prayer, and profanation of the sacraments, etc. Hedio, Fagius, and the other brothers from Strasbourg write that the Emperor is preparing lodging in Speyer and will winter there. The court of the chamber has now begun, in which bishops, abbots, and canons are reclaiming their possessions from princes and cities, which they have not received for several years. Our Tossanus was recently in Basel and, on the advice of some unknown persons, adopted a linen garment over woolen, which he uses for preaching and administering the sacraments. I cannot approve of this; for it seems to me that it opens the door to the adversaries, so that they may impose more impiety.</p>
      <p>In the duchy, the one true religion of Christ is miserably crucified, about which perhaps more another time. Pray for us with your church, that we may not fail in tribulation.</p>
      <p>Greet Rudolf Gwalther and Gerold Meyer with all the brothers in Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>In haste. Riquewihr, 18th of October, 1548. Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, true theologian and pious ecclesiast of the church in ZÃ¼rich, lord and brother in Christ, always to be revered.</p>
