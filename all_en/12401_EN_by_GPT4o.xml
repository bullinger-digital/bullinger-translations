    <p xml:id="regest1">[Thomas Blarer] returned the day before [from the Schmalkaldic League meeting] from Frankfurt. Due to his brother's many commitments, Ambrosius Blarer has so far only heard general information. However, he will certainly learn more once the [Konstanz] council has reviewed the documents [of the league].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- A meeting of the [Schmalkaldic League] was scheduled for April 1 [in Worms]. On this occasion, the league will be extended, and [Hermann von Wied, Archbishop of] Cologne, [Elector Frederick II of the] Palatinate, as well as others, will be admitted. All Protestant estates, even those that are not members of the league, including Elector Palatine [Frederick II], are ready to support the Archbishop. Thus, Emperor [Charles V] was asked to stop the proceedings against the Archbishop, as they would not let him fall. The city and the chapter of Cologne were also informed about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The [Schmalkaldic envoys] could not mediate peace between [Henry VIII and Francis I], but they were well treated and given gifts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Regensburg religious discussion has become a laughingstock. The [Catholic] party did agree to negotiations, but demanded (even though they knew the [Protestants] would not agree) that all negotiations be recorded in writing by clerks and forwarded to the Council [of Trent], which would ultimately decide on it! Thus, the whole effort was in vain, and much money and time were wasted. - Bullinger should inform whether he received the letter from Blarer [No. 2335] delivered by a butcher [...]. - Greetings from [Konrad] Zwick and [Thomas Blarer].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [Theodor] Bibliander should manage the 27 guilders that [Konrad] Hofherr received from Hans Peter von Wellenberg himself. Hofherr has agreed to this; he should now adhere to it! Blarer had also instructed to pay Hofherr only 20 guilders; however, [Wellenberg] added another 7 guilders. If only the money is managed by Bibliander and not by Hofherr! Blarer did not get around to writing to Bibliander about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [P.S.:] Blarer requests to send back the enclosure through the messenger [...].</p>

      <p>My brother Thomas Blarer returned to us yesterday from Frankfurt, but due to his excessive commitments, I could only hear general information from him; however, I do not doubt that I will receive more details later, especially once the council has learned all these matters first.</p>

      <p>Another meeting is scheduled for April 1st; there, the league will be extended, and Cologne, the Palatinate, along with others, will also be included. All Protestant estates, even those outside the Schmalkaldic League, are supporting the Archbishop of Cologne, along with the Elector Palatine and others. They have appointed a delegation to the Emperor with the request that he abolish the proceedings against the Archbishop; otherwise, they will not be able to let the bishop fall. They have also informed the city of Cologne and the chapter.</p>

      <p>Our people could not fully achieve peace between England and France, but they were treated very honorably and gifted by both kings.</p>

      <p>The colloquium in Regensburg has become a laughingstock, as the opposing party appeared and said they would engage with us, but only if all matters were recorded by sworn notaries and then all proceedings sent to the council, which would decide on them. They knew well beforehand that our side would not do this. Nevertheless, they let it lie there for so long, wasting precious time and much money. Thus, one must make fools wise; it will not help. Let me know if you have received the letters recently from one of our butchers. Commend us diligently to the Lord. Farewell with all yours. Greet the brothers and friends. Our people, especially Zwick and my brother, greet you. More next time.</p>

      <p>Tell our Theodor to manage the 27 guilders that Curio received from Hans Peter von Wellenberg. Curio has agreed to deposit everything with Theodor; I absolutely want him to do this, although I only authorized him for 20 guilders, he added 7 more; although it does not matter much, as long as Theodor and not Curio has the money to spend on Curio's necessary uses. I was going to write to Theodor, but I was completely excluded by the lack of time. You will commend me to the holy and most learned man very diligently.</p>
