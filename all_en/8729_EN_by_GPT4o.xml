      <p>Greetings. There is nothing new to report, except that it has been decided here that Coladonius is to be called to the theological professorship in Lausanne. This will undoubtedly annoy the people of Geneva; but we do not care about that. He also prefers to be with us rather than return to France.</p>
      <p>What your people have done and achieved here, you will learn better from them than from me. Steiger himself writes to you and also sends wine, as he used to before. I was afraid that this would not happen this year; but his virtue and goodwill, which he bears towards you, have overcome all remaining difficulties.</p>
      <p>He greets you, as does my father-in-law, who is not very well. May the Lord restore and preserve him for us. I sent the letters written to Beza to my son-in-law in Lausanne; I also took care of those that Mr. Gwalther recently sent to me.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 20, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
