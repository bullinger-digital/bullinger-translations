      <p>Greetings. Our Celio was preceded by Postellus; but it does not matter, because I have no doubt that you, if given the opportunity to converse, have engaged with him familiarly and have been able to elicit a confession of his doctrines, so that what he cannot suppress and conceal for long, he may initially keep silent about. Therefore, you will learn everything more fully from this our brother, whom I do not need to commend to you at length, as he is already most commendable to you. From him, you will also hear the story of the conflict between the Margrave and Maurice; the battle was fierce on the 9th of this month, after Albert would not be swayed by any entreaties of the mediators, the Dukes of Mecklenburg and Pomerania, nor would he accept any conditions, however fair, and was already advancing towards Hesse with all his forces, namely to free his besieged men at Schweinfurt and then to confront the Emperor's son. Maurice, having pursued the rearguard with skirmishes, harassed them to such an extent that it came to a full-scale battle, with both sides engaging from the third hour in the afternoon until evening, resulting in a great slaughter of the Margrave's men, who were finally put to flight, and Maurice gained victory, but it was very bloody and with great loss to his own men.</p>
      <p>He received a wound from a cannonball, but, as they believe, it is not fatal. Also fallen on his side were Philipp and Karl Victor, sons of Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, and they report that their father Heinrich was mortally wounded.</p>
      <p>Albert, however, lost all his most distinguished men, and it was not yet certain, when he left the camp on the 10th of July, whether he was alive or dead among the corpses, because his horse was found in the camp without a rider. But we will soon learn the details more precisely, as this is the first news. There are those who narrate too credibly about the mournful and premature death of the King of England; but also about this, our Celio. Farewell and live well. Basel, 18th of July, in the year 53.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
