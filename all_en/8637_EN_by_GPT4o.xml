      <p>God with us. I assume you have previously understood from Mr. Ziegler that a meeting will be held next Sunday in Aarau. Attending will be Zurich, Bern, Glarus, Basel, Solothurn, and Schaffhausen. Bern and Solothurn have ridden to Freiburg to see if they can also bring them along; because the envoy to Baden from Freiburg is said not to have acted according to his instructions. It concerns the provostry in Lucerne; the 13 cantons have lent it to someone who is now the provost; Cardinal Borromeo wants to revoke the loan. The spiritual loans are always falling. The five cantons, to whom the envoy from Freiburg belonged, want to relinquish them, but the others do not; at the very least, there will be a legal dispute, etc. The people are deaf (coerced undoubtedly by bribes), that they want to give it to the priests out of their hands, etc. Wegger has come to Wetzikon.</p>
      <p>Young Lord Wilaprecht says nothing new from Milan; everything is peaceful and there are no troops. It is said that Famagusta is lost; others say no, and it is very quiet. They are waiting for Hansel from Austria (thus they name John of Austria). I am sending you two letters herewith, received from St. Gallen and Bern, please send them back to me when you have the time. May God grant you, your honorable wife, and the sick Lisili health and all good things.</p>
      <p>Dated August 14.</p>
      <p>The envoys to Aarau are my lord mayor Kammli and treasurer Cham. On Saturday, there will be a council and citizens' meeting. All my people greet you. Greet my fellow bathers. 1571.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my friendly, beloved brother-in-law Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, currently in Urdorf.</p>
