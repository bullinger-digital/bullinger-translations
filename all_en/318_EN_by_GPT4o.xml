      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have received your three letters, to which I now respond.</p>
      <p>I praise your diligence and effort in consoling and admonishing about matters concerning the church, which many are trying to oppress. Satan is causing trouble for the pious everywhere, and he is now also attacking our churches with remarkable cunning; but may all who hate the name of Jesus Christ be confounded and ashamed. Amen.</p>
      <p>The nobles of Kraichgau, numbering 68, were summoned to Sinsheim by the Palatine, and the Interim was proposed to them, which they all accepted; now they are working on how to be bitten as little as possible by the serpent they have admitted into their bosom, and how to retain Christ at the same time. May the Lord be with them.</p>
      <p>Veit Dietrich writes this, and the letters are dated the day before Michaelmas: "Know that blood has flowed in Silesia from the straw, near Brunswick from the ground, at Coburg from the pond, and here very copiously for three weeks. We hear nothing from the Belgians. The Emperor in Brussels drinks water from wood, pondering what to do during the summer."</p>
      <p>Strasbourg has not yet accepted the Interim.</p>
      <p>Philipp Melanchthon writes this: "Since there have been such great disagreements among the teachers about the most important matters, we should be less surprised that the people's wills have been so little firm, indeed, we should not be surprised that God's wrath has been kindled against us more fiercely than it can be mitigated; for I pray daily with lamentation. The churches now lie oppressed by multiple tyranny, alas; but they were already lying torn apart by dissensions before.</p>
      <p>Now, however, [...] αγοσ δει πολιτενσιγ, which God governs. The Saxon cities on the Baltic coast and others and the Pomeranian dukes have decided not to change the doctrine or rites of their churches.</p>
      <p>And although we have seen how easily others, who had greater reasons not to accept that new γομοδεσια, have been broken, yet now indeed the resolve of these is to be praised, and God is to be prayed to, that He may preserve the remnants of His church. It is said that a book is being published οτον Μαφφιτισ Κολα..., in which I am accused, perhaps I will have to seek another place where I can publish a response" etc.</p>
      <p>Our lords have ordered Lord Sebastian Schertlin to take his horse into his house from the inn, and he may well eat in his house, but still take the food from the inn. I hope that soon everything he desires will be allowed to him.</p>
      <p>Some rebellious people in France, coming from the Emperor's land, are gathered together, have many nobles joining them, are thus rebels, have made a banner, on which is written in golden letters on one side: Liberty, on the other: Whether better or worse. The king is supposed to call his people from Scotland, who have made a truce, to war. They are poor people who thrust themselves into danger without necessity, since seditious people have never had anything prosperous.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Brenz greets you. You will also greet Dr. Musculus, to whom I wish all good things; he could have stayed with us most comfortably; but I do not know by what counsel he left Basel. October 25, 1548.</p>
      <p>What has been done in the senate or what response we will give to the Pagans, I do not know; but you will learn more extensively from Dr. Myconius; for tomorrow a larger senate is held. But this I know, that our people cannot sufficiently admire the cunning and craftiness of the sons of men; but thus the foxes are caught. What should I say about a certain envoy who was in my congregation? When I mentioned hidden sins, which God rarely allows to go unpunished, he immediately rushed out of the temple, spitting on the ground, as a sign to me.</p>
      <p>Thus miserable men reveal themselves.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gast.</p>
      <p>Greet Dr. Theodor, Pellican, and the other brothers and bid them to be steadfast in the Lord. We hope for a successful outcome in the business of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most diligent pastor of the church in Zurich. Zurich.</p>
