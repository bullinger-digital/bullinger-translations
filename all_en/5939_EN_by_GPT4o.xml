      <p>Greetings. First of all, you will greet Mr. Calvin for me and excuse me for not having written to him.</p>
      <p>I spare him; I know with what and how many letters and affairs he is overwhelmed every hour.</p>
      <p>I was very pleased with his excuse; indeed, I will do as much as I can to ensure it is not unfruitful, while I can freely and confidently affirm to him that the matter stands differently than he has persuaded himself.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I will pray to the Lord that He, in His mercy and power, may so temper this business that the wrong counsels of men may not harm the best cause.</p>
      <p>I give the greatest thanks to both of you for your remarkable diligence, with which you are accustomed to inform me, indeed all of us who live in these parts of Switzerland (for I share your letters with all the best people, though not without selection) promptly about the affairs of France through letters...</p>
