      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The Turk has died, and his son became emperor on September 16th. The Janissaries have gladly accepted him, based on their old rights, that he would maintain good military law for them. He promised them to carry out the war against Maximilian. They are supposed to wait until spring, then he wants to come to them with 20,000 Janissaries and also make another 100,000 fresh troops. Maximilian is said to have retained 6,000 horses and several regiments, while the Turks did not all withdraw. His own men have not been paid, many have perished from hunger and misery. The princes and nobility have feasted and drunk so much that an order was made that no more than 12 courses should be served at a meal. See, has that ever been heard of! It is like Belshazzar and his feast in Babylon. Maximilian has made himself a peacock in his women's chamber, etc. He is despised by brave soldiers. He has let Szigetv√°r, Gyula, and others go to ruin. He now says he did not attack because his men were not all willing, he could not trust the situation and did not want to make things worse out of bad. Indeed, a distinguished emperor. He holds court in Vienna. Wants to go to Prague. Ferdinand in Tyrol, indeed to be skinned. There is also talk of a Reichstag, which is to be held in Regensburg or Worms, all for the sake of being skinned, and that everyone in the German lands will be brought to the pope's bathhouse and stripped. But whoever the hat bites, may let the Turks comb him well. Why, they say, does Maximilian not let Hungary go to whom it belongs and make peace with the one he cannot fight without his terrible downfall? Have the Austrians not long sucked out and plagued the whole world? Must we first suffer that they set the Turks upon the whole German land with their pomp and arrogance, bringing us all to ruin in body and goods? The Queen of Poland, Maximilian's sister, has arrived in Vienna, for the King of Poland no longer wants her, as he previously held her sister. Now comes the remorse and conscience, as he has long held her. May God protect you forever.</p>
