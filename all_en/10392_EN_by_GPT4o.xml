    <p xml:id="regest1">Requests Myconius to support the honest but poor fellows who come to Basel. These will ask the council for a contribution to the sum they have to pay to the former mayor of Bremgarten, Johannes Honegger. Zurich and Bern have already contributed 100 pounds each. Honegger, whom they unsuccessfully tried to hold accountable during the First Kappel War, is now taking advantage of these lads. The salt master Jakob Goetz and other people in Basel are aware of the situation.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>Beloved brother, I kindly ask you to keep these poor fellows in your prayers before my lords of Basel, as they will make a request for a contribution. They have to pay 200 guilders to Honegger, although they owe him little if things were handled justly.</p>
      <p>My lords of Zurich have given them 100 pounds, and my lords of Bern have given them 100 pounds. Most of those in debt are honest fellows, but poor. They would have liked to see Honegger punished and therefore appealed to my lords of Zurich during the First Kappel War. However, Honegger was spared. Now, as the matter has fallen into his and his kind's hands, they are taking advantage of these poor fellows. The salt master and other people in Basel are well aware of the matter. Witnesses of this letter can inform you well. I ask you to do your utmost. Be entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>April 22, 1534.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, your faithful one.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and honorable Mr. Oswald Myconius, preacher at the cathedral chapter in Basel, his kind dear lord and brother.</p>
