      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, dear brother.</p>
      <p>I presented the instructions from Mr. Chaam to the other consul, Mr. MÃ¼ller; he reported everything to the council.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord to settle these disturbances; for I see in all things that it is nothing else but a true, self-seeking peasant war. If they persist, they will meet no other end than that which the peasants met in 1523.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep us from evil and turn our hearts to true repentance towards Him. When I read to the consul what you wrote about the Rhaetian wine, he lamented, saying: "I bet I would not have desired it, since he must have so much unrest because of me." I replied: "He does not find this difficult, rather he is glad to be able to serve your kindness and will serve diligently and faithfully." Therefore, for your faith and diligence, take care of this matter, which I know is of concern to you.</p>
      <p>My Ludwig could no longer be without a wife; for my deceased daughter left him with 7 children; you are not unaware of the common faith and diligence of maidservants. Therefore, he chose for himself a modest, good, and faithful wife, though poor and of humble origin.</p>
      <p>Her father is a miller; he was originally from Thurgau; the family is called Strubler. Here, she served the miller Kramer, whose daughter he married, from whom he received this daughter Adelheid, born in Zurich. Therefore, I see that he did not seek a wife well-endowed with wealth and illustrious in lineage or family, but one born of honest parents and well-endowed with virtues. This action of his is approved by all good people; there are others, however, who say: "He should have married a well-endowed and more noble woman; how easily he could have achieved that, if he had wanted to." But we say: "Is this how the children left behind are to be cared for? It is better to marry one whom you hope will be a mother rather than a stepmother." These few, or rather many words, in response to your question. The day before I received yours, our Rudolf was appointed by the unanimous decree of the most honorable council to succeed Mr. Sebastian; he alone was nominated to the council by the schoolmasters and examiners, which I know has rarely happened; but his virtue deserved this.</p>
      <p>I congratulate you and us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord guide him and keep you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. March 23, 1565.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends in order, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I am sending back the letters written by that good brother to our Tobias and thank you. Separate everyone; for thus it should not be.</p>
      <p>If indeed the judgment of the Lord is at hand, I pray that He may correct us, but not in His wrath, which we deserve, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
