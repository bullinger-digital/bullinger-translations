      <p>Most Reverend Father in Christ, you have already long since understood from your own sources what has been done here and what the hope is; therefore, there is no need for me to trouble you with more details. If your friends write to ours amicably, there is good hope; if harshly and bitterly, I see none at all. If I were with you, you would hear what has exasperated our people. - I wish to know from you what is happening in Germany. There are those who assert that the city of Metz is to be invaded; but I scarcely believe it. - I am going to the baths at Fideris; the utmost necessity for my health compels me; if I did not carry my cares with me from home, perhaps I would bathe more effectively. If you write anything, send it to my people; there are daily those who carry it there. I am sending my son to Zürich; he has made moderate progress in his studies. Here the school is not at all well-attended and is frequently interrupted; I feared he might be neglected. If he comes to you, I ask you to encourage him towards piety. Things instilled by such great men as you are more firmly retained. - The plague does not indeed progress here; but almost wherever it strikes a house, it empties it. Another son of Philipp has also died. I commend myself to your prayers.</p>
      <p>Chur, 30th of June, in the year 1566.</p>
      <p>Your T. F.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most reverend father in Christ. In Zürich.</p>
