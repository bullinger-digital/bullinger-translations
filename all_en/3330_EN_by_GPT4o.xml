      <p>Greetings. I received your commentaries on the Apocalypse, as you wished, through our Peter Mechlin, and I am very grateful to you for this gift, intending to repay you if I can. Your diligent writing about Italian affairs was also appreciated, and it appears that these are indeed perilous times. We are entangled in an unnecessary and, in my judgment, most unfortunate war.</p>
      <p>We have joined forces with the French, who neither uphold the conditions of the treaty with us nor the agreements made with the enemy. This treachery has been hateful to all ages and nations and has often brought suffering and disaster as punishment, as you know.</p>
      <p>I add that at the same time, war against Christ does not cease to be declared, whose members are afflicted, nor does it feel the rod of the Lord's fury hanging over their necks, let alone turn to the one who strikes upon recognizing the offense. For I received yesterday through a most serious man, who also showed letters written on this matter in Paris by a pious and certainly trustworthy man on September 4th, that 200 people of both sexes were thrown into chains in Paris, among whom were also some of the highest nobility, because they had gathered in a certain room to hear the word of the Lord and prayers and perhaps also to partake in the Lord's Supper, numbering about 400. And with others having escaped, those 200 I mentioned are now held captive with an uncertain outcome, and for this reason, a certain man is ready to request the intercession of the Swiss princes and cities on their behalf. I hear nothing about the Piedmontese except that they also hear fierce threats, yet they continue in the Lord, by whom they are preserved not without a miracle. Let us earnestly commend them to the prayers of our churches along with the others.</p>
      <p>Bolwyler crosses the valley of St. Alban to invade Lorraine, having first accepted the town of St. Hippolyte, St. Pilt, not far from Selestat, in surrender in the name of Ferdinand, because it previously partly belonged to the Lorraine domain. Mathias Erbius writes that the wine yield in Alsace is as meager as it has been in the past 30 years, and they predict the scarcity of grain despite any abundant harvest due to the magnitude of this war, thus indeed punishing the Lord for prodigious ingratitude and stubborn impenitence.</p>
      <p>I hear that our Bernese are steadfast in refusing soldiers and that yours are also diligently vigilant to keep theirs at home, for which I rejoice and pray to the Lord to also give others eyes and minds to discern and follow better counsel. We thought that a suitable ecclesiastical position had been provided for your relative with the margrave, and I was glad for his and your sake; but as far as I see, he has declined to accept it, moved by certain and indeed evident reasons. Nevertheless, I will look out for another opportunity, if it arises, to remember him; for I wish to provide for a good man afflicted for Christ's sake, and your relative, from the heart. I hear nothing about the Worms colloquy except that Philip is present and some of the adversaries, but no legitimate negotiation has yet begun. If I learn anything certain, I will not hide it from you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours, whom I wish you to greet lovingly and respectfully with my words. Written in Basel, September 24, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Simon Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed and dear brother and fellow minister. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
