    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks Bullinger for the gifted work ["In evangelicam historiam... Annotationes"] by the much-appreciated Zwingli. In light of the imperial demand for a presentation of the confession, for which a day in Schmalkalden is set, the people of Memmingen are determined to adhere to the Augsburg Confession; hopes, although the Emperor is completely in the hands of the opponents of the Reformation, for a successful negotiation through the peace-loving and pious princes and envies [the Swiss Reformed], who are free from tyrannical power. After their first son Gervasius, Paul was now born to them. The Memmingen church is doing well. Best wishes and greetings. Greetings from [Martin] Frecht.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received, my dear Bullinger, from our bookseller the remaining part of that book, which you gifted me when I was with you in Zürich, and I give you immense thanks for that gift, which not only greatly delighted me but also enriched my library, for it is dear to me because it contains the writings and thoughts of the most holy man Zwingli. I wish that nothing of that prophet would exist without reaching my hands as well; so eager am I to read the writings of that once great hero now dwelling among the blessed.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the Emperor is now demanding from us an account of our confession (as you may know). Our allies will convene in Schmalkalden to discuss this matter. May the Lord grant that they commit nothing unworthy of the majesty of the Gospel.</p>
      <p>We, the ministers of the Memmingen church, together with the whole church, have conceived such a response: We wish to stand firm in the confession once presented to the Emperor at the Diet of Augsburg, and then we do not wish to be deprived of our Christian liberty, as far as those external ceremonies or rites are concerned. Pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>For the Emperor is entirely in the hands of the antichrists, he understands nothing of religion, therefore we will obtain nothing from him except steadfastness of spirit for the churches and the just defense of our cause. However, since the Lord has given so many princes who shudder at civil war and would like the churches to be composed in the Lord, I have hope that something can be extorted from the Emperor for the kingdom of Christ; yet concord and steadfastness are needed now more than ever. Oh, how often I think of your happiness, who are not compelled to be under any tyrannical yoke, who have been granted such freedom by the Lord that scarcely any other people on earth have. May the Lord grant you to enjoy it with great gratitude of spirit and to use it for the glory of His name, etc.</p>
      <p>I am well with my wife and children. My wife has now given birth to a second son named Paul. My Gervasius is doing very well by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>The affairs of our church are well in all respects. May the Lord preserve you safe for the Zürich church for a long time. Greet on my behalf your wife, your family, Lord Leo, Pellican, Theodor, Megander, and Erasmus Fabricius. May your whole church be safe, to whose prayers I commend myself. Farewell in the Lord, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, January 9, 1540.</p>
      <p>My Frecht greets you in the letters written to me.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius Scholasticus.</p>
      <p>To the man endowed with exceptional piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zürich church, my most dear lord and brother.</p>
