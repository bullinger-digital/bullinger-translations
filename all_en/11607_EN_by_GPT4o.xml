    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter and apologizes for his own unauthorized actions; although he promised marriage to a girl, he opposes the parents' wish for an early return and wants to wait for the decision [of the school authorities]. Bullinger will hear more news from Christoph Froschauer; praises [Konrad] Suter and [Christian] Wirth; might go to Leipzig; due to the plague and fear of the Turks, the Frankfurt fair is poorly attended. Justifies himself for a book purchase; sends greetings to all those he cannot write to due to time constraints.</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>I have received your letter (most reverend Lord Bullinger) written in the name of the esteemed lords, through which I have clearly understood my imprudence and foolishness, indeed my rashness, for daring to undertake such actions without the consent of all of you. However, I humbly beg your dignity (especially yours) to forgive my audacity. I hope you will assist me with your efforts, advice, and favor, so that you may reconcile the lords, who are now angry with me, to become most favorable.</p>
      <p>I hope to diligently make amends for all that has been neglected so far. I have also learned how foolishly and imprudently the parents think, as they so eagerly desire my early arrival. Indeed, their plans displease me greatly, although (to confess honestly) I have promised my faith to the maiden; yet I promised under the condition that I would marry her after two or three years. Now, since the time is not yet at hand, they expect my arrival. However, in this matter, I will not listen to the parents, but rather to all of you, who have been like parents to me so far, and I hope will continue to be. I will await your common decision. Whatever you then decide, I will adapt to it and see that I can meet the expectations of me, and offer myself entirely, as much as I am, to your service.</p>
      <p>You will hear from Lord Christoph Froschauer how our affairs have been so far. Suter and Hospinianus have been with us. As far as I have seen, they have lived blameless lives, providing everyone with a clear example of good and studious young men, and have given no uncertain hope of future virtue and diligence from themselves. However, how they have conducted themselves in Basel escapes me.</p>
      <p>They say that it is free for the three of us to travel to Leipzig; at the next fair, we will return to Frankfurt to await your decision. The present fair is not very well attended, partly because of the plague raging there, partly because of the terrible strength of the Turks; for in the recent capture of Buda, our people fell with great loss to the Turks as well.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Lord Bullinger, most reverend parent and patron, and love me as you are accustomed. I lacked the books, which I could not find to borrow anywhere; necessity compelled me to buy them and I paid from my inheritance. If the parents take it badly, I ask you to act on my behalf, so that they may be less angry with me.</p>
      <p>There was no leisure to write to everyone now, namely to Lord Master Georg MÃ¼ller, Lord Rudolf Stoll, my most reverend lords, especially also to the schoolmaster Lord Ammianus, who is most favorable to me. But you will convey many greetings to all on my behalf and wish them all happiness.</p>
      <p>Given in Frankfurt, 1541, September 14. Johann Jakob Wick, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man Lord M. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the Church of Zurich, his most vigilant lord and patron.</p>
