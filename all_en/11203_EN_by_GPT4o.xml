    <p xml:id="regest1">Returns the friendly letters of the princes [Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Philipp of Hesse] and Luther; an exchange of thoughts with Luther on the question of errors in [Zwingli's "Fidei expositio"] could serve reconciliation. Agrees with Pellican's judgment on the undoubtedly well-thought-out letter [from Luther] to the Swiss envoys, but cannot yet communicate a position [of the theologians of Konstanz]; it will be advisable to wait with further correspondence anyway. Ambrosius [Blarer] will report on the reasons [for his dismissal] after his return [from WÃ¼rttemberg].</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>With much gratitude, I return the copies of the letters, dearest Bullinger. We judge well of the letters of the princes; for they are friendly and undoubtedly free from any deceit. I judge the same of Luther's letters; for Luther is open in these. You should respond to him sometime when the opportunity arises and discuss with him the errors in the book to the Christian prince, but do everything amicably and reverently. Perhaps mutual discussion, sober and free from all stings, will more and more reconcile minds, even dispelling evil suspicions.</p>
      <p>The letters to the Swiss envoys did not fall by chance, but seem deliberate, nor do I dislike Pellican's judgment. I cannot express our judgment in these letters, but in the next messenger; however, it does not seem necessary to hasten to respond, and perhaps some silence will benefit concord more. It is a miserable fight when one must fight with cunning, having lost the simplicity of writing and the candor of the mind, so that one must think of nothing else than how to outwit another.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius has not yet returned; we await him daily with great longing. When he returns, he will give an account of his return.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell with all the brothers. August 21, 1538.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my brother in the Lord, to be respected.</p>
