      <p>May the dear God be with us in grace here and eternally. Amen. Your letter has fully reached me, waiting to see what you inform me about your messenger, whether there is anything concerning the war between France, England, and Scotland. I have never seen the entire Interim, otherwise, I would have sent it to you myself; it might soon be published; then everyone will have it. Oh Lord, faithful God, what will come of this?</p>
      <p>I am sending this letter with Marcell Dietrich's wife, who is currently here, to Ror, and with it also Marcell the thoughts of Philipp on the Interim, which is, however, presented very weakly. Marcell should send this letter to you immediately. However, please send it back to me along with your writing by next Wednesday to Ror; Marcell will have a message for us again then.</p>
      <p>The two responses to the Interim, which you write about, we have also seen here; it is nothing but fear and distress everywhere. What the old Elector and other princes, as well as Strasbourg, Ulm, and Augsburg, etc., say about it, we still do not know at all, except that I hear it should not have displeased the prominent ones in Augsburg, and there is concern that Musculus, who holds himself very bravely in this matter, will not have a place there for much longer, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding our addition, etc., we have not heard a word yet. May God protect us temporally, spiritually, and physically, and also eternally in grace. Consider it good and pray along with your church with all faithfulness for us, that our faith does not falter and that we may withstand all the world's and its princes' obstacles.</p>
      <p>Given in haste on the eve of Pentecost 1548.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
