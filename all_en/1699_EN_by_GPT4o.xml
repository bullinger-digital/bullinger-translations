      <p>More when I have more leisure; I write this to you hastily and quickly. We have received no letters from you at all for an interval of 10 months now; which I cannot sufficiently marvel at.</p>
      <p>I do not think you have forgotten us, since no reason for this has been given to you. However, on the contrary, this long and pestilent silence of yours worries and distresses us in a remarkable way, lest something more serious has happened to our common affairs. The daughter of the prince has already written to you twice, and the prince himself once, whose letters I have taken care to be delivered to you by the most reliable messengers.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you love me, if you wish to keep your reputation safe, write back to the princely people as diligently and as soon as possible. Above all, make sure to remember Alexander in your letter to the Earl of Warwick and also give thanks for the great benevolence he has already shown us; likewise, I would also like you to do the same towards the Duke of Suffolk. I ask you to do this as much as I can possibly urge you. The gloves, which the daughter of the prince had given me to be delivered to your wife, cannot be conveniently returned before the fair. She wanted to send her a very beautiful gold ring; however, I did not receive it for certain reasons, which would be too long to recount here.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most learned man, and kindly consider these letters, written very rudely and lightly. Oxford, 16th August 1551. I would like you to greet our mutual friends.</p>
      <p>Your humble Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>Cheke has recovered very well. Cox will no longer be the chancellor of this university; I know the election will be held by us within two hours. There is good hope, indeed the greatest, that the Duke of Suffolk will take on this dignity and the patronage of the city.</p>
      <p>There is a constant rumor that Cox will soon be made a bishop. I pray you write diligently to Cheke. I write this to you in great haste.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
