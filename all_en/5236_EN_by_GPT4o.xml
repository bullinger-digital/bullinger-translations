      <p>Greetings. I have received everything you sent and I am as grateful as I can possibly be. I will send them to Schaffhausen to Ruggerus tomorrow or the day after. Besides this, due to the shortness of time, I can do nothing else nor do I have anything to report, except that it is written from Augsburg and St. Gallen that the Pope wanted to capture Marseille through treachery, but the attempts of the most impious tyrant were thwarted. March 23rd.</p>
      <p>I see that the Lord does not consider Navarre worthy, whose efforts to expand his kingdom in France you described to me in a previous letter. Meanwhile, the promises of the Davidic kingdom will be fulfilled despite the gates of hell being against it. But we must pray diligently and fervently that He may be gracious to the afflicted churches and ministers in France. There are also those who say that even among the Spanish and Portuguese, some excellent seeds of Christ's gospel have been sown, which may also flourish beautifully. Then Philippus became furious and insane when our Lord God wanted to draw near to him; this would first cause much bloodshed. If you learn anything more certain about this, let me know, and I will also gladly inform you if I find out anything. To his dear Bullinger.</p>
