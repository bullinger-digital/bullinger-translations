      <p>Grace and peace and very long-lasting safety from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray with all my heart, commending my respect, diligence, and duty to you. The friendship and great connection, most kind father, which has existed between us for many years, has been and is of such concern to me that not only by respecting, honoring, and embracing you with every kind of duty have I proven my faith, piety, integrity, and promises to you, but I wish to appear to have admitted not even the slightest fault, which could rightfully offend you and alienate your benevolent spirit from me, as far as it is placed in my diligence and faithful care. For this reason, having read your two letters, which bore some bitterness and accused me somewhat of negligence and even perfidy, as if I had handled the affairs and matters of Jodocus [Szadkowski] sluggishly and had not responded adequately to your opinion of me, but with the cares, labors, and public affairs (for all my private matters are neglected) known, it is so far from being able to make you angry with me and nourish some suspicion of a more unfavorable deed, that it ought to make you, even unwillingly, more favorable to me and not only preserve but increase your former love towards me. Therefore, be fully persuaded, my father, that no one is more rightfully dear to me in terms of piety and connection than you, and to whom I more eagerly wish to satisfy with all fidelity and readiness of duties. But as for why I have not been able to fulfill your desire until now, know that many obstacles have been placed, which have delayed the most ardent and ready zeal of my will and have made me suspect to you under the name of sloth, to say nothing more serious. Indeed, during all this time in our disturbed Polish affairs, so many things have occurred that I could not express the resulting mental distress in words or commit it to brief letters. What shall I say about the actions of the poor little church, to the variety of which I was exposed with remarkable fortune and even danger, not without slight disturbance? And our affairs, since we are surrounded on all sides by the weapons and siege of enemies, are such that you can easily conjecture that there is no small cause for my long delay, but that I am tossed by the harshness of adverse fate and waves, so that I cannot apply speed to my purpose. I am silent about the journeys, which were long and extended, undertaken in the name of the church. Moreover, it also happened that I always thought and still think that I am of such standing with you and that you have such a clear and explored understanding of my custom and faith that no doubt should rightfully enter your mind. Indeed, I assumed that Jodocus was acting there in such a way that he would use you as parents and that necessity did not require haste. Know this, most kind father, that I promised myself more from you and did not hope that a fortuitous interruption of duty, arising from no wickedness, would in any way sting you. Finally, how many inconveniences are accustomed to occur in this miserable valley of tears and the vicissitude of times and fortune, as the verse has it: "Many things fall between the cup and the lip," which often impede the intention of a most friendly man of the purest will.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I wish you to think, my father, that I have committed nothing that could rightfully harm you. Therefore, I ask you to attribute what has been omitted not to laziness or malevolence but to fortune and time, to which one must often yield and serve.</p>
      <p>Three times I had already prepared for the journey to you and lastly for the sake of a very important matter, but in a strange way, those journeys were distracted and impeded by Satan. However, I do not doubt that for the same reason I will see you sometime, which if it happens, will certainly lead to the incredible edification of our churches. Your letters found me at court, where I lived with great annoyance (sent there by the churches for the sake of our Cracovian assembly to the king himself) for almost five months, and now the diet is imminent, to which I must again set out with some ministers. But so that I do not keep you in suspense any longer or foster your suspicion of me, behold, I send the money which Jodocus contracted with you, along with ten florins, which the guardians give to you and your daughter Dorothea for your benevolence towards Jodocus, to Mr. Gabriel Schlissemberger, and I have carefully and diligently arranged letters loaded with some Hungarian gold coins to you and Mr. Simler in the name of the magnificent Lord Hyeronimus Buzinski, the treasurer of the kingdom, along with this money, and I ask you, my father, to expect from me all things that are accustomed to proceed from pious love and virtue. I will never deceive your opinion, as I embrace you with singular respect and love.</p>
      <p>There is little news and it is not good. The Papists have published a refutation of our confession in our language (which is also entirely yours, of which I sent a copy to you last year), to which we must think of opposing an apology, which also was an impediment to me, so that I could not do everything according to your wish. The state of our church is very moderate, but the fury of the Arians and Ebionites, by which even Duditius the Hungarian-Spaniard, who has perfidiously fled to those sects, is at this time agitated, and they accumulate errors upon errors.</p>
      <p>The Tartars, having made an attack with very well-equipped forces into Muscovy, have so devastated towns, villages, and cities with fire and sword that they have driven the very prince and tyrant of the Muscovites from his seat, forcing him into such despair and fear that by traversing some hundred miles and hiding in the most secret places, he has consulted for his safety and life by flight and concealment.</p>
      <p>If you have any news, I ask you to also inform us of it, and I earnestly ask you, my father, never to think anything sinister of me, but to consider that I wish you and your entire family the most honorable and that I embrace you and all the people of Zurich with the greatest friendship. Farewell most happily with your sons and daughters, to whom I send many greetings. I also greet your fellow ministers, the most distinguished men and my most esteemed teachers, Mr. Gwalter, Simler, Wolph, Lavater, Haller, and all the rest, whom God preserves for the glory of His name and the edification of the church.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, my father, and love me, as I would wish all my duties of connection to remain with you perpetually.</p>
      <p>In Krakow, on the calends of September 1571.</p>
      <p>Most devoted and most observant of you, Christoph Thretius.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, most esteemed lord and [...]issimo. In Zurich.</p>
