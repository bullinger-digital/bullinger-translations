      <p>S. D. I give thanks to my Lord God, who has been with me and helped me with His grace, so that what I wrote in the book against Brenz is not disapproved by you and the pious men. I pray to the Lord that He may bless me and all the ministers in other matters and grant peace to the churches. I expect nothing else from Brenz and Andreae than a cartload of insults; but the matter is the Lord's. I have not slept at all this night and am now being called out of bed; a messenger is announced to be present, who is to take back the response. Therefore, I gather the nearest letters, which I send to you here, beseeching you to return them in time and safely. A few days ago, Mr. Georg Weigel, the court preacher of the Prince of Prussia, was with us; he was sent by his prince to Brenz to confer with him about the supper; he conferred; Brenz objected his ubiquity and monstrosities. He took these indignantly; they could not agree. He came to us, conferred with us; we listened kindly. He is a learned, pious, eloquent man; we agreed very well. He asked us for letters to his prince and to some councilors. I gave them; I added responses to Brenz's book. He returned to Tübingen and Stuttgart to confer once more with Brenz, whom he says is a man of haughty spirit and stubborn, worse than Jacob Andreae. May God make them better and have mercy on us!</p>
      <p>These days, the elder Landgrave from Marburg sent my son to me, who is in his chancellery, and sent the entire action of the princes concerning the Council of Trent and the emperor's response; there are many things, etc. He added very friendly letters to them. Yesterday, I sent off my son, laden with letters and books, whom the Lord bless! From the Palatine court, he also brought many letters and the printed catechism of the prince. Behold, I bring you the gospel: you have never seen the whole matter of religion presented more simply, even the matter of the supper; in all things, we agree. Praise and glory to God in the heavens! While I write this, a guest from the Stork, sent to me by the new envoy of the King of France, who came to Baden for the diet, arrives. He announces greetings from him, promises all good things, seeks friendship and familiarity, offers himself entirely to me; he asks for some books from me, etc. I ask whether Guysius has perished. He replies: "Certainly, and Orléans has not been captured; but it is still besieged in vain. However, the admiral is expected, who is certainly said to have occupied Cadmus," etc. Letters written about the Claronian matter were written by one of the envoys. I cannot say more now; I have not reread them. May the Lord be with you, bless you and yours.</p>
      <p>Greet your brother, Mr. Gregor from Ulm, your sister, all good people, especially your son.</p>
      <p>Farewell. March 24, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The diet is not yet finished. 1500 men from the Five Cantons are going back into the military, a makeshift band also from beggars and wanderers, a miserable, ill-equipped crowd. Pharaoh hastens into the sea.</p>
      <p>To my dear Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
