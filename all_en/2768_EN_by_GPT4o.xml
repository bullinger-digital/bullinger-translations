      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ Jesus our Lord. We have received, most excellent man and brother esteemed in the Lord, that it seems strange to you if we in St. Gallen are instituting a discussion about administering the sacred Eucharist to those confined at home; for it is proven that our church has not always held this opinion, as shown in the most learned books of Aphorisms by the blessed memory of Mr. Vadianus. We, however, are greatly surprised that what was explained to the brothers in a brief and simple narration is being referred to as a controversy or dispute. Although we do not doubt your sincerity, so that no one may form a negative opinion of us, either of inconsistency or of reintroducing papal profanation, it seemed right to briefly write to your humanity about the matter as it stands. A brother, a pastor of the church in Thurgau, a young man and, as it seemed, zealous for piety, who was not part of our synod's fellowship but was admitted to the discussion by the favor of the brothers, was present at our recent synod. Towards the end, when he asked whether we also bring the Lord's Supper to the sick, for he had sick people among his own who greatly desired it, we, the ministers of St. Gallen, responded with the mutual opinion of the brothers, recounting the rite of our church as a response. This is how it stands: at that time, and at no other than when we perform the public sacred rites of the Lord's Supper, we also visit lepers and those who are confined in hospitals or at home, and if there are any among them who seem to desire this communion sincerely, we consider it our duty and faithfulness not to deny them, who due to illness could not attend our assembly, what is imparted with such zeal to those who are well on that day, even though they are separated by place and body, yet by the communication of the spirit, so that nothing is done privately here, but in the same city as in a large temple of Christ and a very frequent assembly, we believe this heavenly feast is celebrated. Here, none of the brothers of the synod added anything contentious or different, much less contrary, well aware that this rite, confirmed by the consensus of the ministers of the church and the decree of the senate, has been held for many years. At the first institution of which, when in the year 1527 the superstitions of ceremonies were rejected and the formula of the sacred supper was written according to the example of Christ, our most learned and prudent consul Mr. Vadianus not only participated but presided with his unique erudition and propriety, whose words still exist in this sense: "Also, as many preachers please and according to the clear ability of the scripture, it is necessary, in their opinion, that now at Easter and hereafter, as often as the Lord's table is held, all our sick parishioners, who cannot come to the community of bread due to bodily necessity, should be brought the most worthy sacrament into their houses, if they desire it, and it should be given to them with the recitation of the words of Christ, with an inner thanksgiving and other things that belong and serve thereto, etc. Therefore, it will not be necessary in the future, upon accepting such a Christian custom, to preserve anyone in bodily needs or in expectation of death with the sacrament, as has happened until now; for it is not instituted for such." And with equal consideration, Vadianus seems to indicate that this rite was instituted under his presidency, when in the sixth book of Aphorisms he inveighs against those bellies who adjudge us to Gehenna because we do not receive the Eucharist when dying, that is, we do not defer the signs of penance to the last struggle. "For the Eucharist is not" (he says) "a clinical sacrament, but an ecclesiastical one, instituted by the Lord to be performed in the congregation, not in corners, but common to the sick who cannot come to the church on the day of the supper; for although they may be absent in body, they are present in spirit, faith, and charity to the church that is supping, and they rightly and legitimately partake of what is taken by the assembly." It is clear from the formula of action that Mr. Vadianus did not only think of this in terms of spiritual but also symbolic participation, nor should it be doubted that the excellent man, in his republic where he held office with such authority, would not have tolerated examples of this after he knew they were contrary to the institution of Christ. But, as it follows in the Aphorisms: "We do not compel the dying to the ceremony," etc., but, when the sick use their liberty. Hence, it happens that this ministry of ours occurs very rarely among them. But here is the labor, where the churches of Christ act under presidents (as in the case of the Rhaetians and others from the vicinity), where it is enjoined by the edict of the presidents that each one, of whatever religion and in whatever health condition, must communicate annually. Who does not see here that the poor sick are oppressed with double sorrow, when they cannot be present at the congregation of those supping and yet at the same time the necessity of communicating is incumbent upon them by command? What do you think these pious and good pastors should do, most vigilant Bullinger, when they sometimes affirm that among the sick they have those who are doubly infirm, both in body and mind, who first call to themselves the sacrificer bringing their own, rather than wanting to experience the wrath of the most hostile president of the time. For it is not that they are defended by the liberty of public peace. In which danger, no more immediate remedy has occurred so far than that at the set time of ecclesiastical communication, the infirm sheep of Christ, redeemed by his blood, are contained within the enclosures of sincere religion by their healthy administration, lest they be deserted as if abandoned to the voracity of wolves to be devoured.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the pastors did not think they were acting imprudently nor contrary to the opinion of Christ and his apostles if they also applied that care to their own, which they have in common with some of the most free and ample churches of Switzerland. Moreover, we still retain the division of the commandments of the Decalogue commonly accepted in the churches, where the first two are combined, although we do not disapprove of this very ancient one, which is now more accurately observed by the more recent, which you use, to such an extent that we greatly wish that from the very beginning of the re-emerging gospel it had been handed down to the catechumens under this your division. But now, after long instruction, both publicly for sacred sermons and privately, we firmly affirm that any change cannot be made among us without grave offense. However, in this our enumeration of the commandments, we omit nothing for the sake of brevity of those things which are comprehended in both tables of the law, but as the Lord spoke in Exodus 20, we express it word for word. Where we do not fear any danger threatening our church from the division, nor do we value it so highly that we believe the tranquility of the church should be disturbed for it; for we see that the perpetual zeal for novelty not only calls into doubt the minds of the simple but also undermines the reputation of our doctrine, which is of Christ. By the grace of God, we have churches well pacified from factions and ours so purged from idolatry that not even traces of the old error appear, so that we consider it dangerous for any of ours to change by private institution in a matter of not such great moment, which mutual consensus for the sake of peace has not yet accepted. We have signified these things, most humane man, so that you may also hear our counsels, and that we retain without any dispute among us what our church has long since received from the words of the Lord, while Vadianus was still living with us. We would, however, have you persuaded that we vehemently abhor all things which the sacred letters do not permit. Therefore, we ask that you commend us and our church to your piety's prayers and vigilance. Farewell, most chosen ornament of the church of Christ, and we wish you to bid farewell in our name to your colleagues and fellow ministers, pious and most learned men and brothers venerable in the Lord. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, November 12, 1555.</p>
      <p>The pastors and ministers of the church in Christ of St. Gallen, your most observant.</p>
