    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller provided a detailed report on various matters [on November 15 with No. 2677], particularly about a pronounced Lutheran [Georg Caesar] and [Rudolf] Schwyzer. He entrusted the letter to [Hans] Vogler [the Younger], who was supposed to give it to the servant of [Hieronymus] Sailer, who was departing for St. Gallen that day. However, Vogler misplaced the letter! Now there is a fear that the detailed letter (which is unlikely to resurface) might fall into the wrong hands. Here, therefore, is the content of the lost letter once again, but in brief.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] On Sunday, November 14, a young and fairly well-read Wittenberg Magister named Georg Caesar (who had served as a pastor near Neuburg [on the Danube]) and his companions, who, like him, had to flee to Augsburg because of the war, were on the marketplace. The Augsburg pastor Leonhard Bächlin passed by. Caesar asked him where he was going. Bächlin replied that he was going to the two Swiss pastors [Lorenz Meyer (Agricola) and Rudolf Schwyzer] (who lived nearby) to join them for the sermon. Caesar, quite agitated, asked if there were no more preachers to be found in Swabia, that they now had to bring in Zwinglian enthusiasts from Switzerland. Bächlin replied that Helvetia was indeed the land of Canaan. Caesar retorted that it was rather the land of Belial, where the cursed seed of Zwinglianism was sprouting! Bächlin should show him a [Swiss pastor] who taught correctly about the Lord's Supper. Bächlin then said that Haller did so. But Caesar said that he was an enthusiast who had already led four others astray. Bächlin then asked him what he thought of Zwingli. Caesar replied that Zwingli and his followers were scum and dregs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bächlin informed Haller, who then informed [Georg] Frölich, [Michael] Keller, and [Wolfgang] Musculus. Subsequently, the Zurich pastors spoke with Caesar alone and reproached him for his statements, which violated brotherly love and the Augsburg church (which had taken him in as a refugee). But instead of making amends, Caesar said even worse things to the Zurichers' faces. In light of this persistent malice, the Zurichers took Musculus with them (so that the matter would not be seen as a private but a public concern of the Augsburg church) and went to the mayor [...], to whom they disclosed everything. The mayor was very indignant and discussed it with the other mayors. Haller learned from Musculus today that Caesar and his companions were ordered to leave the city. Thanks to this incident, the Zurich pastors now enjoy greater support.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Schwyzer knows no restraint and is truly reckless. In the presence of Musculus (with whom one otherwise gets along well as long as he is treated decently), he said that he would have stabbed Caesar if he had met him at the [city] gate. Musculus replied that Schwyzer did not know what spirit he was of, and added as a jab that this was typically Helvetian. Moreover, Schwyzer addressed the incident in a very reckless manner in a sermon on November 15, without considering the current difficult circumstances. He also attacked the fabricated presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper extensively and unreservedly. This also displeased Lorenz [Meyer], who behaves all the more modestly as he is more learned than Schwyzer. Schwyzer is now truly a great burden for Haller! If he defends him, he becomes inconveniently troublesome. If he lets Schwyzer have his way, he will be accused of giving up the shared [with Zurich] cause. Haller knows well what Schwyzer claimed about him in Zurich and on the journey [there], even though he did not make a big deal out of it, especially since with people like Schwyzer, one achieves much more through silence than through dispute. Haller fulfills his duty and strives to promote the Lord's cause, even if it is to his disadvantage. He is therefore not fearful and is as displeased with the [Augsburgers'] chatter about the Lord's Supper as the other Zurichers. Yet he strives to heal the old wound and not to reopen it! He has learned in Augsburg what it means to be "as innocent as doves and as shrewd as snakes" [Mt 10:16]. How much he has achieved through his good example is evidenced by the calling of the other [pastors from the Confederation] to Augsburg. He therefore strives for both the truth and the good reputation of the Zurichers and does not want Schwyzer to undo all his efforts. What is communicated here is intended solely for Bullinger. None of it should reach Schwyzer or the Zurich councilors unless Haller requests it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Frölich will report [with No. 2684] about Vogler. Apparently, he is supposed to lock himself in the office when no one is there. Frölich fears that Vogler might pursue official secrets, which would have dire consequences! If Haller were forced to keep Vogler with him for half a year, it would be very burdensome for him, even though he would gladly do a favor for his father [Hans Vogler the Elder].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Haller lacks money, so that not a drop of wine can be found with him. Because of all the Helvetians seeking refuge with him, he has quite a few expenses! He spent 14 guilders for [Hans Wilpert] Zoller. He lent Heinrich Hermann a Rhenish guilder. And for Michael Hedinger and another [...], who took out a loan of 11 guilders, he acted as guarantor. He would gladly help everyone, but he cannot! The dismissed [Johannes] Huser from Ulm has also been with him for 14 days now and does not want to return to Zurich (otherwise Haller would have applied for travel money for him from the Augsburg council). Huser wants to wait for the end of the war because he has been recruited by a troop leader [...], even though he is obliged to the Zurichers!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [Hans Thoman] Ruman is also staying with his family at Haller's. Tomorrow he is supposed to move into an apartment in the Martinskloster. The councilors were not pleased that Meyer and Schwyzer returned to Augsburg without their wives.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] After Haller has finished his sermons on the second letter to Timothy, he now wants to expound the Gospel of John at the request of the councilors and friends. If Bullinger has notes that go beyond his commentary on John [from 1543], he should send them to Haller. Haller had great success in explaining the Book of Judges, which is so relevant for this time, not least because he was allowed to rely on Bullinger's notes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Keller is unwell, and Bernardino [Ochino] is overly anxious. Haller has recently had many conversations with the Italian Francesco Stancaro. He confessed to the Gospel in Vienna and had to flee from there because of it. Has Bullinger heard of him? He is very skilled in languages and shares the [Zurichers'] view.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Now to the news that Haller has already reported in his last letter [No. 2677], which could fall into the wrong hands due to Vogler's fault. There are hardly any more skirmishes or confiscations of provisions. The Imperial forces are being greatly reduced by plague and pestilence. Many are deserting. Recently, the Imperial forces suffered a heavy defeat. The final battle is expected hourly, without which this matter cannot be decided. May the Lord help, for no salvation is to be expected from the princes!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Unfortunately, the news about Duke Maurice [of Saxony] is all too true. It is incomprehensible that some credit the Duke with this outrageous act as a good deed! Further details will be reported by Frölich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Haller appreciates Ruman's modesty, so he will take good care of him, especially since he senses that Bullinger also likes him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Greetings, also to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Heinrich] Buchter, and the others, as well as to [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and the children. Greetings to the father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli] from both Haller and his wife [Elsbeth].</p>

      <p>S. I recently wrote to you in three full pages very extensively about various matters, especially about a certain issue we had with someone more than Lutheran, as well as some things about the Swiss and other matters both new and old. When I handed these to our Vogler to send them through his master Sailer's servant to St. Gallen, who was leaving that day, he lost them due to his usual carelessness before handing them to the messenger. This greatly upset me. I fear that those who are not well-disposed towards us might have found or have them. I described many things in them more diligently than ever before, and there is no hope of finding them again. Now, therefore, I will condense into a few words what I wrote there extensively.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>On Sunday, November 14, a certain young man, Georg Caesar, who is somewhat versed in letters (as is common with those Wittenberg teachers), who had served as a pastor near Neuburg and now, in these troubles, fled to us with four other co-ministers, stood in the marketplace with his companions. Then came Leonhard Rivulus, also a minister of our church, whom Caesar asked where he was going. "To the two Zurich lords," he said, "to join them for the sermon." - Then he: "Botz seicken! Can no preacher be found in Swabia anymore, that now the Zwinglian enthusiasts from Switzerland must be brought in?" - To which he replied: "Oh, but Helvetia is the land of Canaan!" - Then he: "It is the land of Belial, which produces nothing but the damned seed of Zwinglianism. Show me," he said, "one who truly teaches about the sacrament of the altar!" - To which Leonhard replied: "I will show you Haller." He again: "We know what kind of enthusiast he is, who has barely been here a year and has already led four others astray! What will become of this church?" - He also asked what he thought of Zwingli. - Who exclaimed that he was damned, scum and refuse, with all those adhering to him. And he spewed many other similar blasphemies.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Leonhard revealed the matter to us; we to Laetus, Cellarius, and Musculus. We approached him alone, saying that he had spoken against charity, against his condition, against the whole Augsburg church, of which we are members, by saying that none of us teaches truly. We had promoted him as an exile, to be supported by our church; these were the unworthy thanks he returned to us! We hoped he would apologize; but nothing less, indeed far worse than what we had previously heard from Leonhard, he spoke to our faces! Seeing his obstinate malice, we took Musculus with us prudently (so that the matter would not seem private, but public to the church), and we revealed the matter to the council. He, very indignant, informed the other councilors, and they were ordered (as Musculus told me today) to leave the city. This incident gave us greater freedom, so that it would no longer be free for these scoundrels to publicly slander us. I had written these things before in many more words.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I cannot restrain the immodesty and imprudence of the Swiss. For he said in the presence of Musculus (who is a very good and easy man if treated with skill): "Oh! If I had met him at the gate, I would have stabbed him with a dagger!" Musculus, like Christ, eluded the disciples' reckless desire for revenge, saying: "You do not know what spirit you are of," adding this colophon: "This would be too Helvetian," etc. Moreover, the very next day, he ineptly and beyond reason of cause and time, spewed everything in a public sermon, discussing much about the fabricated presence of Christ in the supper, where, although he spoke truly, he did so imprudently and without fruit, especially with this matter now present. This also greatly displeased Laurentius, who, as he is more learned, is also more modest. Indeed, Bullinger, you have imposed a great burden on me through this man. For either, while I wish to defend and extenuate his importunity for honesty, I will incur the vice of importunity, or, while I wish to leave him to his own head, I will seem to have deserted the common cause (which may it be far from me). I know what words he spoke against me in Zurich and on the journey, which I, like him, do not make much of. And I know it is better to soothe such men by silence than to exacerbate by contending. I will diligently do my duty; and I will uniquely regard and seek the Lord's business, to which I am consecrated, even at the expense of all my things. Nor is it that I may seem timid or faint-hearted (I am equally impatient of this chatter as others), but I consider how the old wound may be healed, not how it may be renewed by reopening. I have indeed learned in this time, in which I have served the Augsburg church, what this means: "Be as innocent as doves and as shrewd as snakes"; I see how circumspectly one must act with this most cunning people, most eager for contentions and factions. And indeed, how much I have achieved in this one year, even their calling will testify. For unless they had been moved by my modesty, they would not have called more from Zurich. I therefore strive to make the truth known to all and the Zurich name pleasing to all. What has certainly been done so far, I do not say this to seem to want to attribute anything to myself, but to testify how solicitous I am, lest what I have built with much gravity and modesty be destroyed by his levity and immodesty. However, I write these things to you alone. I do not want you to write anything about this matter to him or inform the lords, unless I warn you further.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Laetus, my dearest, will write to you about Vogler. He complained to me that he, when no one is around, locks himself in the office. He does not know what he is doing. He fears, however, that he might come across secrets, which could lead to great harm. If I am forced to keep him for half a year, it will be very burdensome for me, although I would gladly serve my father even in greater matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I am so exhausted that I do not have a drop of wine in the house. I incur great expenses for all the Helvetians flocking to me as to an asylum. I spent 14 florins for Zollero. I lent Heini Herman a Rhenish florin, which he has not yet returned. I became a surety for Michael Hedinger and another for 11 florins. I would gladly serve all good people, as far as my means would allow. Huser, dismissed from Ulm, came here. He has been with me for 14 days now. He did not want to return to Zurich, whatever I advised. I wanted to obtain travel money for him from the lords, but he wants to wait for the end of the war! He is enlisted with a certain duke; waiting for the muster. I did nothing for him. For I did not want to, since he is bound and obligated to the Zurich lords. But since he would not obey my advice, I could not force him!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Lord Romanus also turned to me with his family. Today he was given lodging in the Martin's college, into which he will move tomorrow. It does not greatly please our lords that the other two left their wives in Zurich, as they were dismissed to return with their families. But since it seems so to them, let it happen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Having completed the second letter to Timothy, I have decided to explain the Gospel of John at the request of many lords and friends. Therefore, I ask that if you have anything more than your commentaries (which I have), you share it with me. In explaining the Book of Judges, so suitable for this age, since I want to fly with your wings, I have gained great favor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Cellarius is unwell, Bernhardinus is overly timid. I have recently discussed many things with the most learned man Stanggaro, an Italian, who confessed Christ in Vienna and was forced to flee from Austria - whose name or person I do not know if you know. He is indeed very skilled in languages and a most zealous and free defender of our cause.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I now come to the news, some of which I also wrote recently. I do not know, however, into whose hands they have fallen due to Vogler's fault. Little or nothing has been done in the meantime, except that skirmishes and confiscations are no longer rare. It is certain that the Imperial forces are greatly diminished by plague and pestilence. Many are deserting, and they have suffered a great defeat these days. A fierce conflict is expected every hour, without which I do not believe this matter can be ended. May the Lord preserve us and defend His cause, for we see no salvation in the princes!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>What is reported about Duke Maurice is too true! But what some interpret in a good way, I cannot understand! Therefore, I refer you to Laetus.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Romanus has commended himself to me by his modesty, but he will be all the more commended to me as I understand that he is also commended to you.</p>

      <p>Farewell. I wish health to the lords, brothers, and fathers, to Pellicanus, Theodorus, my Gwalther, Buchter, and others, as well as to your sweet wife and children. You will also greet my father-in-law in my and my wife's name. Augsburg, November 20, 1546. Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
