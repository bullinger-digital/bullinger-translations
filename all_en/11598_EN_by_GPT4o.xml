    <p xml:id="regest1">Despite his inadequate language skills, he writes a Latin letter for the first time because Bullinger has often and kindly urged him to do so. He intended to travel to Bullinger with his wife [Anna] this August, but they did not want to do so without [John] Butler, who is currently courting a widow in Strasbourg and was absent with her parents for the entire month; he does not believe - in confidence - in a marriage, as the woman has an ailment. So far, he has refrained from sharing news from England due to his Latin, but now sends excerpts from letters from friends with news from the previous year; Bullinger will have been informed about the events up to his departure from home - Easter 1540 - by [John] Butler, to whom he sent reports for further dissemination at that time. He received Bullinger's letter from the 6th of this month and a previous one at the same time and thanks for the comforting and encouraging words; he now knows better than before how terrible it is to fall back into the former [heresy]. Since he could not stay in England without renouncing his faith, he left the country under the pretext of business reasons; as there is no heresy charge against him, his property is not at risk, and he still sends money there for cloth purchases. He will not return as long as he cannot live according to God's word; he and his wife have settled in well. [John] Butler traveled to England after the Frankfurt Spring Fair but stayed only eighteen days due to the situation there. He asks that the content of his letter be mentioned only to men like Theodor Bibliander, [Konrad] Pellikan, and Leo Jud; he would have liked to give the letter to a colleague for linguistic revision but did not want to risk news of his communication with [the Zurich theologians] reaching England. He thanks for the information about Heinrich Falkner and asks to name more buyers of English cloth - he only wants to deliver on credit to the Zurichers and some from Schaffhausen; may Christ reward Bullinger and support him in his work. Greetings from him and his wife, also to Bullinger's wife [Anna]; they would gladly come to visit. [Enclosure:] Before Pentecost [1540], three men [as heretics] were burned in a London suburb [Southwark], perhaps at the instigation of the Bishop of Winchester [Stephen Gardiner], who also had [William] Collins burned; he had attacked a pilgrimage image, directed prophetic words against the powerful, and sided with the [1538] executed [John] Lambert. Already before St. John's Day [June 24, 1540], rumors circulated that Henry VIII wanted to separate from Anna von Kleve and was courting [Catherine Howard]; the king was often seen visiting [Catherine Howard], and the Cardinal of Winchester [Stephen Gardiner] also held banquets for the two. Execution of Thomas Cromwell and [Baron Walter] Hungerford on July 28 [1540]; Cromwell's fall was planned by the king and resulted from his resistance to Henry's intended divorce from Anna von Kleve; the possessions recently granted to Cromwell were - probably for tactical reasons - given to his son Gregory. God has punished the false trust in people and taken away from [the believers] those on whom they had set their hopes. At the time of Cromwell's arrest, Parliament passed more than 48 decrees; discussion of some of these decrees; while the penalties for the unchastity of priests were mitigated compared to the "Six Articles" of 1539, their marriage still carries the death penalty. The decree on the divorce from Anna von Kleve, of which Hilles wants to send a translation, is based on lies, such as alleged previous reservations about this marriage. The Archbishop of Canterbury [Thomas Cranmer] and the other bishops, who decided on the divorce at Henry's request, even claimed that the marriage had never been consummated, which would be entirely against Henry's usual behavior; the amnesty for the critics of this marriage is also hypocritical. With the consent of Parliament, the king has introduced a new tax system that requires contributions from the clergy, citizens, and nobility; their justification with liberation from the Roman yoke is untenable, and their alleged voluntariness is pretended. Henry issued a general pardon for offenses before July 1, 1540 (except for high treason); certain persons are excluded, such as Thomas Cromwell, the sons of [Henry Pole,] Lord Montague, and the executed [Henry Courtenay,] Marquis of Exeter, some preachers and nobles who do not want to recognize the king as the head of the church, as well as Anabaptists and Sacramentarians, as well as all deniers of transubstantiation and those who exclude the king's influence on the death time predetermined by God alone. Before the issuance of the general pardon, many evangelical preachers had been imprisoned, and [Edward] Crome was also investigated, but he managed to get the king to release the prisoners on bail; through the amnesty, the king perhaps wanted to calm the people, but he also tends to benefit financially from it. On July 30 [1540], the three priests [Thomas] Abel, [Edward] Powell, and [Richard] Fetherstone were executed for rejecting supremacy. The same fate befell the Protestant preachers [Robert] Barnes, [Thomas] Gerrard [Garrett], and [William] Jerome on this day for heresy. Their execution was perhaps intended to keep the clergy and rabble in good spirits. They had not violated the "Six Articles" - at least since their enactment; more details can be found in a German booklet about Barnes' protestations of innocence [VD 16 B 1527-1534]. Subsequently, more people were executed without apparent reason, others, like the Bishop of Chichester [Richard Sampson], were pardoned. The teachings of the preacher [Edward] Crome were publicly attacked by Catholics around [Nicholas] Wilson at Christmas 1540, and a disputation was agreed upon. Even before this disputation, Crome's opponents compiled a list of allegedly heretical statements from his sermons, which were sent to the king and government; reproduction of these theses. Crome insisted on his teachings, but the king pardoned him in writing. However, Crome was obliged to recant his articles in a public sermon during Lent [1541] and read the royal judgment. In court, Crome had unsuccessfully tried to justify his rejection of soul masses by referring to the king's dissolution of the monasteries. The king obliged him to publicly approve the masses as well as the dissolution of the monasteries. However, Crome limited himself to reading the judgment after his sermon instead of adjusting its content. As a result, the king forbade him to preach, as he had done in the case of the Bishop of Salisbury, [Nicholas] Shaxton, and the Bishop of Worcester, [Hugh] Latimer; both have escaped the death sentence but are no longer allowed to preach and also not to enter [Oxford, Cambridge,] London, or their dioceses; Hilles laments the conditions in England and hopes for God's help.</p>

      <p>Patience, so that when you have completed the work of God, you may receive the promise! How great has always been my desire to write to you, and how limited my supply of Latin language, God knows, most esteemed of all to me. He who distributes to each the measure of faith and gifts as He wills, has granted me some understanding of the Latin language, but no skill in speaking it properly; therefore, I have never before dared to send any letters in Latin to anyone. However, because you have so often encouraged and truly consoled me with your letters, you have provoked and (so to speak) compelled me to write something back to you; especially since I am convinced that, in your piety and humanity, you will interpret everything in the best possible way that can be rightly understood; I now send you this unskilled note: which I certainly would not have sent yet, had I not been disappointed this year in my hope of visiting you. I had firmly decided to come to Switzerland this present month of August (especially to see you) with my wife. But my brother Butler, who is now diligently courting a widow in Strasbourg, has been away with her parents all this month; so unless we wanted to travel alone, we were compelled to remain here. Nor do I think I will have so much leisure again for almost a whole year: please keep this secret from others. For he himself is still uncertain whether she wants to marry anyone: I also fear that she may not be able to be a wife to him because of the illness she suffered from for a long time while her previous husband was still alive.</p>
      <p>Many times I have thought of writing to your charity from England about new things and changes as they have happened continuously; but I was deterred by just shame from my intention, because not only do I write as barbarously and incongruously as I speak, but I also lack the very words in Latin. Nevertheless, relying on your wisdom and modesty, by which you know how to be unskilled with the unskilled, to join them to Christ, I have here described the sum of what I have gathered about the state of our kingdom last year from letters sent to me by trustworthy brothers; and which I had decided to make you more certain of by my own mouth, I send to your humanity with these. I only wish that you may accept them kindly and favorably, which are written with a good heart towards you, in a rustic and barbarous style. Regarding the condition of our republic, before the feast of Easter when we departed (namely in the year 1540), I hope you were sufficiently informed by our said brother Butler. For to this end, I diligently depicted everything as it happened and was done there, in my letters to him, according to my limited ability, so that he might later communicate the same to learned and pious men there (but especially to you). I received your writings dated the sixth of this month, and those previously sent to me through that Frenchman of Hermia, almost simultaneously, for which I am greatly thankful to you; especially because through them you have deigned to console me so truly and sacredly with the holy scriptures, and to diligently exhort me to patience and long-suffering (virtues which I greatly need). Furthermore, from your letters, with God working, I have gained this great benefit, that I have considered and weighed much better and more prudently than before what it means to leave one's first love, and how unworthy it is for a Christian to return to his vomit, and how dreadful it is to fall into the hands of the living God. Blessed be God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort, who has undoubtedly comforted you many times in your tribulation and distress, so that you may be more fit to comfort those who are in any affliction. Meanwhile, however, so that you may know in what state my affairs are, they are as follows. When I perceived that there was no place left for us in England, unless, as Ustazades answered the king of Persia, we wanted to be traitors to God and men, we departed from there, with a feigned reason of exercising trade here. This pretext is considered false by all who know us, and is also suspect to dogs and the impious. However, since I was not accused of heresy, nor called before a tribunal, all my possessions there are still quite safe; so that at each fair I send the money I collect here and in Frankfurt to England for new cloths to be transferred here. I insert these things here to make you more certain of our condition here, lest perhaps any rumor among you of our voluntary exile in these parts should be a reason for omitting our thorns in England. Meanwhile, I freely confess to you (although it would not be safe for me to reveal this to everyone) that I have not decided to return there, unless God deigns to change the times first, so that we may serve God there without offense and with the approval of a good appearance of evil. My wife (thank God) manages our condition here as well, or rather better than I do. Although I do not doubt in God about my perseverance to the end, I pray you to ask the Lord for us, that He may complete the good work He has begun in us until the day of Jesus Christ. Our Butler, after the Frankfurt fair, returned to England, and did not stay there more than 18 days. Everything there was so displeasing to him.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I beg you for God's sake, not to share what I am now writing to you with anyone, except for Mr. Theodor Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, Leo Jud, and other such equally pious and learned men; especially as if it came from any Englishman. Nor do I ask that they read my letters, lest they rightly ridicule my rashness and foolish audacity in writing so barbarously and incongruously. I would have given my writings to Butler, if he had been at home, or to another Englishman here to be translated into Latin, except that I would not willingly want (although I do not distrust them) them to know that I have communicated so much to you; lest they perhaps later, with good intention, inform some pious person (when they are about to write to England) through letters, who may not guard them cautiously enough, as often happens, from hypocrites. I am very grateful to you for making me so certain about Falconer. I also ask you, if there are any other pious and God-fearing men there who buy English cloths, to inform me of their names: so that if they ever ask me to lend them some cloths, I may not deny them the same. For I have no intention of trusting anyone with any large sum except the people of Zurich alone (except for a few from Schaffhausen). Therefore, if you show me this kindness as well, you will have greatly deserved of me. I will pray to Christ to repay you in return, for whom I know you love me; just as you hate the impious only because of the devil and his image in them, as the prophet David and all the saints besides. How true we experience this verse of Solomon every day! The righteous abhor the wicked man, and those who are in the right way are abominable to the wicked. Farewell most happily in the Lord, esteemed pastor: and may Christ, the Prince of shepherds, grant that you continue to fulfill your ministry, so that when He appears, you may not be ashamed, but have confidence, and receive the unfading crown of glory promised to those like you. Amen. My wife sends you many greetings, and especially to your wife. We both greatly desire to visit you. There is no reason for you to desire to see us. For we can in no way be a consolation or use to you, but rather a hindrance to your studies and a burden in many ways. Again, farewell, dearest teacher in Christ, and do not forget to greet your pious wife, co-heir with you of the heavenly kingdom, in my name as well, I pray. Yours sincerely, RICHARD HILLES.</p>
      <p>Before Pentecost in the suburbs of London, on that side of the city which lies in the diocese of the Bishop of Winchester, three men were burned for denying transubstantiation, and because not all of them had communicated with the others at the feast of Easter. And since this happened in the diocese of Winchester, many said that they were handed over to the fire through the bishop's diligence; just as shortly afterwards he burned a certain madman named Collins. This man had remained in prison for two or three years before, but I do not know for what solid reason. Once, as he passed by the idol of the crucifix, to which pilgrimages were sometimes made (especially by Spanish sailors, when they had safely reached port), he aimed an arrow at the idol, and wounding its dead foot, he commanded it to now defend itself and take vengeance, if it could. Many, however, say that he was not imprisoned for this reason, but rather because he used to rail against the magnates and nobles of the kingdom, and rashly thrust many passages from the holy scriptures, especially the prophets, against them, which contained some mention of unjust judgment, or cruel treatment of their neighbors and subjects. Meanwhile, I certainly know this, that when Lambert was with him in the same prison, (Lambert is the one who was condemned by the king himself for the matter of the Eucharist shortly before Bourchier's flight,) four or five days before he was offered to Vulcan, this Collins was not so mad nor unlearned, but that he could quite fluently and aptly draw various passages from the New Testament for Lambert against the bishops and other impious men, who were his adversaries and enemies before the king's tribunal, and apply the chief Psalms against them, such as these: "Blessed are those who suffer persecution for righteousness' sake," etc. "The Lord knows the days of the blameless, and their inheritance will be forever. But the enemies of the Lord, as soon as they have been honored and exalted, will perish like smoke." (Psalm 37.) "The wicked will not dwell near you, nor will the unjust stand before your eyes. You hate all who work iniquity; you will destroy all who speak lies. The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. They will not live out half their days," etc. Now to other matters. Before the feast of John the Baptist, many were secretly whispering that the king wanted to divorce his queen Anne, the sister of the Duke of Cleves, although he had publicly married her before the church with the greatest triumph on the day of Epiphany after the last Christmas: the courtiers first whispered this because they understood that the king was now running after another very young girl, whom he now has. It is most certain that at the same time many citizens of London saw the king, too often during the day, and sometimes in the middle of the night, frequenting that girl by boat on the River Thames. The Bishop of Winchester also often prepared banquets and feasts for the king and that girl in his palace. But the citizens meanwhile thought that all these were not signs of the queen being divorced, but of adultery. A few days later, Lord Cromwell, the king's deputy in ecclesiastical matters (for that was his title by office), fell from the king's grace: and at the beginning of June he was thrown into the Tower of London, and did not leave there until the 28th of July, when he was beheaded along with another nobleman, Lord Hungerford, who was said to have attempted to calculate the king's fatal day. I know nothing certain about the cause of Cromwell's death; because he was not brought to examination before a tribunal, as all nobles were always accustomed to be brought before that time, especially when they were accused of the crime of treason against the royal majesty: but it was commonly said by many, and also likely, that he was indeed killed because he did not flatter the king, like the Bishop of Winchester and other courtiers from the nobility, in his attempt to divorce the queen: but rather said that the outcome of the matter would not succeed to the honor of the royal majesty nor to the public good of the kingdom. It was not long before Cromwell's death that the king exalted him, and endowed him with more ample houses, riches, and many public offices, with the greatest domains, not without great gain or profit (in this way he also endowed Queen Anne a little before he beheaded her). However, some now suspect that this was not done without fraudulent counsel: so that people would believe, namely, that he must have been a great traitor, and guilty of all kinds of treason against the majesty; or the king would not have killed him, since he was so dear to the king, as was evident from his gifts to him. For a similar deceit, some think, the king gave Gregory, the son of the same Cromwell, a title of lord, and many of his father's domains, while he was still alive in prison, so that his father would say at the hour of his death that he had offended the king; lest perhaps his majesty, being angry with Cromwell's son, would take back those gifts and paternal lands. There are also others who say (how truly, God knows) that Cromwell was threatened by another deceit, that he would be handed over to the fire, not to die by the sword, unless he confessed at the time of his death that he had sinned against the king; and therefore he then said, "I am utterly wretched and a sinner; I have sinned against my God, the Best and Greatest, and offended the king:" but he uttered these things about the king lightly and tepidly.</p>
      <p>This change was undoubtedly deserved by our sins: for when God sent His word among us, it was not esteemed by us as the word of God, nor did we give thanks worthy of the Author; but we dreamed that it was understood by us through our own strength and ingenuity, and we continually ascribed its success either to this one's prudence or that one's learning, meanwhile imagining God to be sleeping and idle. Therefore, the Lord, wanting to manifest His power in the providence of all things, and His leniency towards us, gradually but not all at once, took away with the purity of doctrine also those on whose wisdom we so relied; wanting His providence to be demonstrated in this, that He frustrated and nullified our hope and boasting in men, which was contrary to His glory: then showing His mercy, because He allowed these things to be gradually taken away with those in whom we trusted; so that we, so often deceived in creatures, might place all our trust in Him alone, and then acknowledge Him as both the promoter and giver of all grace and goodness. This long-suffering of God, thus tempered with our education and much instruction, should have worked repentance in us, unless we had been a stiff-necked people. But this was our miserable state and condition, that we did not consider this discipline of the Lord: but as soon as He rendered our hope vain in one man, we immediately acquired another man in whom to trust; until now at last God has taken them all away from us, and inflicts upon us such a scarcity of sincere ministers of the word, that one may wander from the eastern part of England to the west, and from the southern part to the north, and not find even one preacher who seeks the glory of our God with a pure heart and unfeigned faith. He has taken them all away here: Queen Anne, who was beheaded, with her brother, I understand, and also Lord Cromwell, with Latimer and the other bishops. O great indignation and wrath of God! indeed a much greater mass of our sins, for which the benign severity of God could not but send us this vengeance! But where am I heading? Now it seems that a pig is trying to teach Minerva: but I return to my purpose.</p>
      <p>At the time when Lord Cromwell was imprisoned, the king held a public assembly of the kingdom's nobles, bishops, and some citizens, as is our custom, which is called a parliament by our people: in which new statutes were issued (and as the king calls them perpetual) more than 48; of which I have noted here some of those that pertain to religion, but not all. The title of the first statute follows, thus added by the king and parliament: "A statute for the moderation of the penalty of priests for incontinence." You have heard, I know, most esteemed lord, what kind of statute was issued among us in the year 1539, against the six articles of the Christian religion. One part of it, if you remember, took away the wives of our priests under the penalty of theft the first time they were accused. But by the same statute, it was allowed for priests to fornicate once or twice; but the third time if they were caught, they would be hanged as thieves are accustomed to be there. Theft among us was anciently punished by the gallows, if the theft exceeded the value of six batz. Now as the aforementioned statute, whose title you have heard, has it, the king considered that penalty the third time by the gallows to be too severe or extreme, as we say; and therefore it pleased the king to decree that the parliament should punish priests with money first, then by the loss of one priesthood the second time, if the priest has more, and the third time they would lose all their temporal goods with whatever priesthoods, and be handed over to perpetual custody as long as they live. But meanwhile, it still does not seem extreme to the king to hang priests who take wives, or who retain those they had married before that previous edict.</p>
      <p>Another statute title reads thus: "A statute manifesting the dissolution of the king's marriage, specifically made with Lady Anne of Cleves." (Specifically made or pretended marriage, if I may say so. The English language here has: “The king’s pretensed marriage, etc.“ / pretensed from praetendo in Latin.) I will procure that you have the edict translated into Latin, and verbatim. But where shortly after the beginning it pretends that the people of the kingdom had many ambiguities and perplexing doubts about that marriage, it is entirely false. Nor would people have dared to open their mouths even once to raise such ambiguities or doubts, even if they were (as they were not) to be raised. What end will the pious expect from this decree, which is thus founded on lies? It is also fictitious what the statute has, that the nobles and citizens of parliament asked the king to place the whole matter of that marriage in the hands of his clerics to be examined; when it is certain that none of the nobles or citizens dared to mutter about that matter, openly or secretly, until they understood that the king had alienated his mind from that Anne to Catherine, that girl related to the Duke of Norfolk, whom he immediately married after Anne was repudiated. Where it has the response of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the other bishops to the king's letters about the matter to be examined and judged, they found that Anne of Cleves was still a virgin, and never known by the king: behold how credible! Who, judging the king by his fruits, would believe him to be such a chaste man? Especially since he hastened to summon her before Christmas, and indeed had her daily alone in his chamber as queen publicly, for five or six months. This one thing, fictitious and falsely obtained, is what those beautiful basilides bishops with their co-bishops so beautifully weighed, pondered, and examined: as it is held in their response, which I mentioned before. Our preachers in all their sermons prayed for her with such an encomium: "Anne, most noble queen, wife of our prince Henry VIII, etc. most legitimate." The decree also remits to all those who have spoken or attempted anything against the king's marriage with Queen Anne: and indeed deceitfully, as if there were any such to be pardoned; let all of England come forth, and produce even one such, if it can. And those who first attempted to promote the dissolution of the same marriage do not need the absolution of parliament; for it is most certain that they did not undertake the matter without the counsel and will of the king.</p>
      <p>By the authority of the same parliament, the king imposed many burdens on his subjects. For it was granted to him to extort a fifth part of all the annual revenues of the bishops and clerics' priesthoods, which they receive in one year, besides the perpetual tithes he receives from them annually. From the laity, both nobles and citizens and peasants, a solution of a tenth part of all their annual revenues, patrimony, and lands was given to him. Also, from those who do not have patrimonies or annual revenues, it was granted to the king to demand a twentieth part of their money, goods, cattle, crops, and all other things. The northern part of England, where there was a tumult immediately after Queen Anne was beheaded, was now made free by the king's benevolence from these payments of money, etc. So further, this matter was handled with such cunning, that the Archbishop of Canterbury and the other spiritual lords of parliament (as they are called those carnal ones) in the name of the whole clergy voluntarily offered that payment of money to the king, because the king freed them from the yoke and servitude of the Roman pontiff: as if they had ever been under such a yoke under the pope as they are now, when all their affairs and life are at the king's command. In a similar way, the laity also voluntarily granted those monies to the king, to which they are bound to pay by parliament under a heavy penalty. Yet everything among us is given voluntarily and willingly!</p>
      <p>In the same parliament, the king also published a general, or so to speak universal, pardon, by which he forgave all heresies, some crimes of treason, all kinds of thefts, and many other offenses against the laws of the kingdom or public laws committed before the first day of July in the year 1540, (except for such offenses which can justly be interpreted as having been done or said against the royal person) then voluntary homicides, church robberies, and many similar crimes. However, it was provided that this statute of general pardon does not extend to Lord Cromwell, Doctor Barnes, Thomas Garrard, William Jerome, who were three preachers, and then in chains for the gospel; nor to the two sons of a certain marquis who was beheaded, and Lord Montagu, the brother of Cardinal Pole of England in Rome. His name was the Marquis of Exeter: he would have been the heir of the kingdom, if the king did not leave legitimate offspring. Many other nobles were also excluded from that remission, among whom was one papist bishop, namely of Chichester, and a certain Wilson (also previously, after he had been in chains for two years for the pope, pardoned and released by the king) with some other priests, who, being defenders of the pope's primacy, did not admit the king's title, while he writes himself to be the supreme head of the Anglican church. All Anabaptists and sacramentarians, as they are called, were also excluded; those who do not admit the transubstantiation of bread; then all who say that every kind of death, with its time and hour, is so certainly prescribed, fixed, and determined by God for each man, that neither the king with his sword can change it, nor anyone with his rashness can prevent it. Thus the very words of the statute have it.</p>
      <p>A little before the aforementioned pardon was granted, many people, especially preachers of the gospel, were everywhere in England in chains; and in London, four or five of the chief preachers. They also sought Doctor Crome, a man endowed with the greatest gravity and wisdom: (this Crome, with Latimer, first in our age sowed the pure doctrine of the gospel:) who, when it was reported to him by a certain Nicodemite, secretly left the city for the court; and there he prayed to the king on bended knee for God's sake (after he had first explained to him how the preachers and some citizens were treated in London) to address this evil, and to apply a remedy through his prudence and piety. Immediately the king gave a mandate that no one should be further vexed for religion; indeed, that those imprisoned should be released again, provided they had some sureties from their friends, who would guarantee that they would appear when summoned later. This occasion perhaps, which you have heard, partly moved the king to give this pardon: hoping that after these causes were once settled, and the old speeches (or, as he judged, errors) were pardoned, he would have a more peaceful and obedient people afterwards. Nor do I ignore, nevertheless, that it is his custom to so completely remit to his subjects (always with some crimes excepted, as now), after they have allowed him, as now, to gather a large amount of money from their liberal gift; or to be so absolved and made free by the authority of parliament from repaying the money previously lent to him, that he never has to repay even a penny afterwards.</p>
      <p>Soon after the parliament was dissolved, namely on the 30th of July in the year just past, six of those men who were excluded from the king's universal pardon were killed. Three were papist priests, (names Abel, Poel, Fetherston,) and they refused to admit the king's new title and his power over the clergy. These were treated in the usual manner: first hanged, then immediately cut down alive from the gallows; afterwards their genitals were cut off, their intestines removed, they were beheaded and cut into four parts, with their limbs affixed above the city gates: or especially their heads were affixed high on poles on the great London Bridge to terrify others, as many priests or monks are killed in that city! The other three were evangelical preachers, not from the lowest; names Barnes, Garrard, Jerome: these were first dragged by horses from the Tower of London through the middle of the city to a place called Smithfield, there they were affixed to one stake and burned, in the same place where the other three were killed. That place had never before, as far as we remember, been destined for anything other than burning heretics. In the fire, they remained so quiet and patient without any outcry, as if they felt no pain; and thus they commended their spirits to God the Father through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I could never know (although I diligently inquired) the just cause why these three evangelicals were excluded from the king's public pardon; so that I can divine no more likely reason than that the king, wishing to gratify the clergy and the ignorant rude populace with the stubborn part of his nobles and citizens, destined these three calves, as it is likely the king thought, as a holocaust to appease them, or to newly acquire their favor. However, I think they did not have more than one, or at most two of these in one year, unless so that the clergy and the greater part of the nobles and populace would more willingly pay the money granted to the king by parliament.</p>
      <p>If someone were to say that these three were burned because of their sermons and doctrine, then it is strange that they were not brought before judges, and condemned by due process of law: as was always the custom among us in such cases of death before that example. Then, in my view, the parliament did not act justly if it condemned them for their doctrine. For I certainly know that after the 12th day of July in the year 1539 (on which day their statute, by which they condemned the truth, took effect) until the time they were captured, they never opened their mouths expressly against that edict, in any public sermon or private conversation, unless they were certain they were among honest and pious men, and sufficiently secure from pigs and dogs. They were handed over to prison in the week following the day of Easter 1540: even after they had obeyed the king in many things while preaching during the Easter festivals. So we see that neither the king nor his parliament justly handed them over to death for their doctrine, unless they want to say that all those opinions, which they condemned as heresies by the aforementioned decree, were not pardoned until that set day of the 12th of July. And if that is the case, then it was only deceit and a snare to entrap men, to so fix and assign a certain day on which their edict would take effect and vigor. Here I am briefer because of a booklet published in the German language, about the protestation of the aforementioned Robert Barnes at the stake; where he confesses that he did not know the reason why he was brought there to be burned, etc.</p>
      <p>The week following the burning of those preachers, many others of those who were excluded from the king's general pardon were killed. The reason is unknown to me why they were handed over to death; but the rumor was, because of crimes of treason against the royal majesty. But, to tell the truth, people did not inquire so diligently nor were they investigated as they used to be, because now it is not new among us to see men killed, hanged, dissected, or beheaded; some for words, which were interpreted or explained to have been spoken against the king; some for the primacy of the pope, and some for one thing, others for another. However, the Bishop of Chichester, and Doctor Wilson, a papist like Eckius, were released by the king: although they were also excluded from the king's universal pardon. The crime of treason, as I hear, which they committed against the king, was alms given to that papist Abel, existing in the greatest misery, when he had been long in the most fetid custody, and (as they say among us papists) almost killed by worms. Now I am going to say something about the man both learned and pious, Doctor Crome. At this time, because he saw more necessity (as he was always accustomed, when some storm arose, so that the truth seemed to be trampled), this was more fervently condoned than long before, until the feast of the Nativity approached. And towards that day, those who were his enemies because of the gospel, collected many erroneous (as they said) articles against him. Meanwhile, the clergy raised their athlete Wilson, to resist the purer doctrine of Mr. Crome, and to affirm that whatever true things he had preached were false. These prudent sons of this age did this all the sooner, so that they might have a better handle to accuse Crome (because through him there was still such a controversy in preaching in the city of London), and so produce him to answer for himself before the king or his council. Which thing they accomplished after a few days. For before the Nativity, they were both ordered not to preach any more, before the king or his council heard the cause, and so composed the matter as it seemed to them. After the Nativity (in the year 1540: for our people begin to compute the new year on the feast of the Annunciation of Mary,) when the day was appointed, on which both should appear, namely Crome and Wilson; Crome's enemies had compiled from his later sermons against him almost thirty articles, as impious and heretical; the sum of which, as far as I can judge, is this: No works justify in the way that Christ does, nor do they satisfy, as He satisfied the Father for us. For He is the only offering, and the price of redemption, etc. There is no truth necessary for us to believe, or to obey under the penalty of sin or eternal death, which is not somewhere expressly revealed in the holy scriptures, or can be truly, piously, and justly collected and deduced from the writings of the same.</p>
      <p>To say mass for the dead plainly contradicts the holy scripture, and is superstition: and was first introduced into the church by a vision, indeed an illusion (he says) of Satan, in the time of Pope Gregory.</p>
      <p>The king himself with his bishops in his Institution of a Christian Man confess that masses ordained by the pope as ladders to heaven do not benefit the dead at all. But that kind of masses for the dead is the chief, because of the prayers, etc. Therefore, if those masses do not benefit, much less do others.</p>
      <p>Also, if the mass benefited the dead, then the king with the parliament acted impiously in destroying the monasteries, where so many masses were founded and celebrated for the dead.</p>
      <p>He who teaches men to pray to the saints, that they only pray for us, as we here pray for each other, brings forth a doctrine neither necessary nor useful.</p>
      <p>The church of Christ is the bride of Christ. But she would be a haughty or forward wife, who would speak or command more than her spouse. You call us preachers seditious, and say we introduce new doctrine: but you lie. You yourselves are seditious, who defend superstition and human traditions, and do not want to obey with us the word of God alone, and hear the voice of Christ.</p>
      <p>People wonder that there is no agreement among us preachers. Yet it is not to be wondered at. For they teach the commandments of men, we on the contrary teach only those of God. But if they would cease to preach their dreams, lies, human traditions, and trifles, and with us announce only the word of God, there would immediately be agreement among us.</p>
      <p>The church of Christ suffers and will always suffer persecution: as not long ago some here suffered. And although the world tried to persuade them, they could not overcome them. Nor will you overcome us, I hope, although you persecute us. For you could say you had overcome us, if you could make us speak as you do. And then we would lie as you do, and be chaplains of the devil, as you are. When the king and his council received these articles with similar ones, with which Crome was accused, they gave him some time to respond to the same. When Crome had given his response (as is evident from the royal injunction, which he was imposed to recite to the people), it was undoubtedly a clear affirmation of his articles, constantly asserting that they were true and orthodox. Nevertheless, the king, whether internally fearing or fearing the populace, if he should kill such a grave man, almost a father in religion, or whatever other way God worked I do not know, did not hand him over to the fire to be sacrificed as a holocaust, as Barnes and the others; but he sent him a certain paper, to follow the same in all things, as you are about to hear. For the copy of the same follows: "The king's judgment concerning Mr. Crome, on the 18th day of January in the year of our Lord 1540." After the royal majesty had received the response of Edward Crome, doctor of theology, concerning certain articles with which he was examined before selected commissioners appointed by his royal majesty for that purpose; after the excellence of the king was also admonished, that the same Mr. Crome was so plainly persuaded in his heart, as he confessed in his response subscribed with his own hand and exhibited to the royal majesty: the king from his most pious benignity, usual goodness, and clemency, for this time is content to pass over the rigor and severity of his statutes, which his majesty could justly execute against that Crome. Furthermore, the royal majesty, having in mind to establish Christian peace and tranquility among his subjects, through uniform concord in the office of preaching, thus decreed as follows," etc.</p>
      <p>The king then enjoined Mr. Crome to preach on a certain Sunday in Lent in the cemetery of St. Paul's in London (which is the cemetery of the main church), and there to recant all his preceding articles. At the end of that royal writing, it was also added that Crome should read this, after he had recited the written recantation verbatim. Furthermore, the royal majesty wanted this to be known to all his subjects, that if the same Mr. Crome should be accused of these articles or similar ones afterwards, then the severity of the law should be executed against him without any favor. Against Crome's article that the mass does not benefit the dead, they objected to him before the tribunal, that he had preached in that article directly against the royal edicts, which decreed that the private mass should be worthily retained in the Anglican church, because of the many benefits that Christians receive through it. But that statute does not enumerate what those benefits were: and therefore Crome responded, that he understood those benefits to be the commemoration of the death of Christ, through the ceremonies of the mass and prayers for the living: especially since the king had dissolved so many monasteries.</p>
      <p>This evasion did not benefit him. For in this way the king enjoined him in his paper, to sing a palinode of that article: "Public and private masses are a useful sacrifice, both for the living and the dead. And although masses and other prayers and suffrages benefit the dead, nevertheless the royal majesty with his parliament piously and justly abolished the monasteries in his kingdom." By what reason, it was not added at all.</p>
      <p>Here you have the sum of the king's judgment concerning Doctor Crome in this case. Now when the Sunday came on which he was to recant, he made a pious sermon; but at the end of the same he began to say to the people, how he had received a writing from the royal majesty, which he was ordered to read to them. And after reading the same, and committing the people to God with a brief prayer, he thus departed: since the king undoubtedly wanted him to have accepted that paper as a certain formula of doctrine, which he should follow in his sermon; and also to extol his wisdom, learning, and clemency above the stars, in the way that Doctor Barnes and those two others did, when they preached at the feast of Easter, and were nevertheless afterwards burned.</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly it was not the king's intention that Crome should have read his paper so lightly, and then thus depart. Therefore, I fear that the clergy will not leave him so. For immediately afterwards it was forbidden to him by the king, not to preach any more: just as he had previously prohibited the Bishop of Worcester Latimer, and Shackston the Bishop of Salisbury; who by the providence of God, as I think, (as is also evident from this, that God has preserved them alive for so long in this dangerous world,) were delivered from death by that general pardon of the king. These two bishops were long under guards, because they had never yet been willing to subscribe to that statute, issued against the truth in the year 1539: which the other bishops, the Elchosaites of Ecebolus, immediately did. But how much the king now favors them, and how much he esteems their sound and sincere doctrine, is evident even in this, that he not only prohibited them from the office of preaching, but also from coming within two or three German miles near our two academies, the city of London, nor in their own diocese. O nefarious crime, to so deprive the sheep of their good shepherds, and to intrude ravenous wolves in their place! God cannot permit this tyranny much longer, I hope. But meanwhile, you see how iniquity now abounds among us, and therefore undoubtedly love grows cold in many. Farewell, in the Lord, esteemed and always dearest to me because of your work in the gospel of Christ. May our God, the Best and Greatest, preserve you long for us in safety, for the edification and consolation of His church. Amen. Amen.</p>
