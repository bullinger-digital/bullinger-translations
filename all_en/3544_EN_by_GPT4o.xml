      <p>Greetings. I received your two letters (reverend father) written at different times, one of which informed me more fully about the persecution in France today against the pious, and in which you give us faithful and paternal advice in these extreme times and finally turn to prayer, thereby teaching us to whom we should flee in such a case. If only the salvation of the brothers were as much a concern and dear to all of us who are called by the name of Christ and the church. I foresaw beforehand that, given your modesty and prudence, we might seem to have spoken somewhat harshly to you.</p>
      <p>But believe us, reverend father, we presented the whole matter to the senate with as much modesty as we could. I only briefly summarized the main points in my latest letters.</p>
      <p>With Mr. Aurelius, however (to use your words), we had to act more imperiously because we knew he was very courtly and feared that unless we exaggerated the matter, he would have downplayed it to the legate (as if it were a clerical matter). It is incredible to say, reverend father, how much this single cause occupies me day and night.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I fear I say too little, sometimes too much or too harshly; at times I am completely at a loss. Those who are the best or certainly want to appear so in matters of religion and have not behaved too badly so far are susceptible to French gold; many of them also follow the camp. We do not have a more prudent man who has long acted less fearlessly for the cause of Christ than Hercules from Salice; yet he himself is a leader among others in this kind. What then should be done? I have a mind that is not at all seditious, even if by nature I seem more rigid.</p>
      <p>Something must be endured and granted to the time and the peace of the republic. Meanwhile, the license of those who are more eager for the French and who pursue mercenary service must not spread more widely, and it must be restrained and curbed. This is done more conveniently in the way we have undertaken to conduct the matter, which I could easily prove to you if the entire form of our republic were known to you or if these things could be safely entrusted to letters. As for your other letters, I would like you to know that the most illustrious prince margrave, because of his rare virtues, which commend him to all good people, was also most commendable to us in your name. He has undertaken a very difficult matter, the like of which does not exist among our people, namely, that he should be received as a citizen who intends to reside elsewhere than among our people. If he had wanted to settle in Pünten, it would have been easier to discuss, and you know that nothing should be attempted in this matter by the common council of the Three Leagues, which would be difficult and impossible to obtain because of the malevolent. Nevertheless, we will amicably focus on what we have observed to be most in his interest.</p>
      <p>Your letters carry great weight; our intercession also brings much assistance to this matter. We already have some consuls and others bound to us, promising their efforts.</p>
      <p>But since it would not be permissible for them to receive anyone against the laws without a plebiscite, a frequent senate will be given to us tomorrow (court and council). We will undertake to advocate for the margrave's cause, and there is great hope that our efforts will not lack success. It will matter greatly how everything is presented in the senate.</p>
      <p>Our people are easily led by reason, and we will work to have him received as a citizen of Chur; if this succeeds, he has already won. But I will write to you about the whole matter as it has been conducted from the records.</p>
      <p>I assume you are not unaware that we have the Roman Emperor, namely Ferdinand. I hear he has been declared Emperor under such laws that will not be harmful to religion. It is reported to us that there is still labor among the electors regarding the election of the King of the Romans from the German princes. Although you already know this, I thought it should be added.</p>
      <p>We ask you, if you learn anything worth knowing from the fairs from friends, to share it with us. You yourself see best of all what to hope for from the colloquy.</p>
      <p>If only, first of all, a plan could be devised (which you also foresaw) to reconcile the Swiss churches (but I also include the Rhaetian churches with the Swiss). I think we must work more earnestly on this; for I do not think that the authority of that otherwise learned man from Basel is so great that it could harm this most beneficial institution. Your churches are the foster children of our churches in the Leagues.</p>
      <p>What you can promise yourself about us ministers, you know yourself; we are all yours, as many as we are. I will not add more.</p>
      <p>We all wish you, reverend father, with all yours, the greatest happiness and the longest life. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur of the Rhaetians, March 21, in the year of our Lord 1558. Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed patron. Zürich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
