      <p>S. D. It has been a long time since I last wrote to your kindness; this is not due to forgetfulness, but rather the inconvenience of messengers.</p>
      <p>I have finally decided to renew our friendship; I write, therefore, not because I have something worthy of you and necessary for all of Rhaetia, but because I wish to declare my devotion to you and to all good people. They say that your bishop is called to the Council of Trent. Beware, you Rhaetians, that he does not go there, or if he has gone, that he is recalled. It turned out very badly for you and especially for him when he went to Rome; it will turn out worse for him and for you if he goes on this journey unless you prevent it.</p>
      <p>The council was convened long ago and is continued today for three main reasons, which can be confirmed from the bull of convocation: firstly, to eradicate heresies, secondly, to bring about reformation, and finally, to undertake an expedition against the Turks. You, in your wisdom, see that those who gather at the council will be constrained to these points. The middle one, concerning reformation, is plausible, but in truth, it is fictitious, to adorn the other two. Otherwise, we are not ignorant that these men and their religion are becoming more and more deformed by the day, and to do this more freely, they condemn us as heretics. The Emperor, aspiring to monarchy and dragging his brother along - not long ago he entered into syncretism with the monk George of Hungary and by this act provoked the hornets, the Turks, whom he drove to madness with inflicted wounds -, desires with wondrous schemes to involve all who come to that council in the society of war. Nor is it new for tyrants to cloak their desires with religion, which in the end turned out very badly for them. Therefore, if you wish to enjoy tranquility, see to it that you are not stripped of true religion under the pretext of the council, oppressed by superstition, and involved in the gravest expenses of war, and also shaken by deadly discord among yourselves. Be vigilant, therefore, and strive to maintain a peaceful homeland. - My most esteemed friend and dearest brother Johannes Calvin has gifted me a book, which I in turn send to you. See to it that you read it diligently and, having set aside superstitions, serve God with pure worship; for you are old, you will soon die, and you will be brought to judgment. Therefore, be vigilant and flee from all idolatry. Farewell. Zurich, 27th of November, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, and wise Johannes Travers in Zuoz in the Engadin, his dear lord and good friend.</p>
