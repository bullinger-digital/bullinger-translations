      <p>Even though, dearest Bullinger, love does not allow for suspicion of ingratitude, nor does prudence permit rash judgment, yet delay harms the ardent expectation of due duty and negligence demands a serious excuse for what has been omitted. However, the cause does not allow for accusation; for I am not conscious of any fault: nor does your nature, which is neither suspicious nor irritable, truly demand an excuse.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, either because you might doubt the cause, you need to be informed so that your opinion does not waver; or because you might perhaps wish to know, your desire must be satisfied so that it is not wounded. For you should not think that I have not responded to your letters, sent long ago, either out of contempt for my duty, forgetfulness of your kindness, or any other reason, as if I had acted inhumanely. But because there has been some disturbance at home and great turmoil abroad, so much so that even the seas up to you have been inflamed by daily wars: there was certainly no opportunity to write, nor has there been any means of sending since our Abel was taken from us; nor, if I had wished to write or been able to send, would there have been any certainty of delivery. Now, having found both the opportunity and a messenger, I should not lack a subject for your most loving letters, long provoked, and recently instigated by the most friendly greetings prefixed to the papal bull; nor could the will be absent, having long desired it. I do, however, what those who are heavily indebted do, so that although they owe many things to many people, they cannot fully pay all; they give all they have to one or two creditors, who distribute it equally to others, thus satisfying each as best they can. So, since I owe many things not only to you but also to my Gwalter, Simler, Zwingli, Lavater, Wolf, and other dearest brothers in Christ in Zurich, I hand over all I have to you, so that you and my creditors there may be satisfied. Therefore, share and communicate equally with them whatever news I send you from England, Scotland, France, and Flanders.</p>
      <p>I do not offer you Roman merchandise; for I know they are worthless to you; this is evident in many ways, especially from the most learned refutation of the papal bull, which you sent to us long ago, and which is now being printed to be published to all.</p>
      <p>Our republic has now been dangerously and horribly agitated for almost three full years, being shaken by the treacherous assaults of enemies from without and wounded and disturbed by domestic treason from within. Both kinds of pestilence, as is usual, were generated by that fatal and execrable fury of the whole world, the root and offspring of papism. But our noble and excellent virgin, resting securely at home, broke both forces at once, defeating the former without sweat and the latter without bloodshed. Thus, everything happened almost unexpectedly, as if from heaven, so that it seemed not unjustly that the Lord of hosts and power had taken up the cause of His gospel and defended it with His own hands.</p>
      <p>Their weapons, treasures, and fleets were brought to us by the winds from heaven, as if by spontaneous breezes; the preparations, fortifications, and soldiers of the others were terrified and scattered by the mere rumor of the royal army's approach. Thus, the former were defeated before they were attacked; the latter were completely defeated before they advanced anywhere. Only two nobles, of no authority or name, men of the lightest character, of the old leaven, or, as they like to say, of the ancient religion, certainly of honesty completely antiquated, were involved. They later secretly crossed over and still hide as exiles in foreign parts, and, as it is rumored, wander miserably like the accursed and fugitive Cain. This spark later exhaled some sparks of sedition in other parts of our kingdom; but by the prudence of the nobles, or rather by divine providence, it was easily extinguished and vanished. Thus now, (thanks be to the immortal God!) all of England rests in complete peace.</p>
      <p>And if it had seemed good to the most excellent and greatest God, I wish the same could truly or at least almost be said of the church! For our church has not yet escaped from those rocks of offense concerning vestments, on which it first struck. The helm, as you know, is held by the excellent prince, and she still turns it where she wishes. But we, as much as is allowed, await the breath of the divine spirit, and we all daily invoke it seriously and vehemently, so that it may finally turn the sails elsewhere.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, however, those of us who stand in a lower place do not do what the crowd urges with importunate clamor, (for that would be very dangerous,) to drag her unwillingly to where she does not yet wish to go, as if wrenching the helm from her hands. Rather, we strive to be well-hearted in the work of the Lord, even if poorly dressed: we care less about how finely we wear our garment than about how rightly we cut the Lord's bread: and finally, we do not value so much whether our own tunic appears flimsy, as we care that the Lord's seamless tunic is not torn. However, there are men of lower rank and order, without salt or sense, ignorant and unknown, who, since they see that the church does not yet fit their desires or rather vanities, nor sufficiently respond to their foolishness, but that the wind is entirely contrary, therefore some desert their stations and hide idly; others, building their own boats, call conventicles, elect their own bishops, and holding synods among themselves, devise and invent their own laws.</p>
      <p>They reject sermons, spurn communion, want all temples destroyed, as they were once consecrated to papism; and they not only mock our ministers but also do not value the ministry itself at all. And so, as much as it is in them, they rashly and precipitously bring about a miserable shipwreck of our church: certainly, they do not a little hinder the free course of the gospel. Meanwhile, they themselves, tossed about by I know not what waves of error, and carried away by various winds of vanity, are miserably driven into the most absurd delusions of opinion. Therefore, they cut themselves off from us, as they say, or rather, like Theudas, they depart with their own; and they do just as those who, when they feel a somewhat adverse breeze, and cannot immediately reach where they wish, do not want to reserve themselves for a better wind, but leap from the ship into the sea and drown.</p>
      <p>Here, however, it is amazing how our adversaries of religion seize what seems to them an opportune handle for deforming the gospel: they whisper into the ears of the royal majesty that this is the ripening fruit of our gospel, this is the only harvest of our doctrine to be expected: so that, unless that sacred heart were completely inflamed with love for the truth, it would have long since cooled by their insinuations. Behold! Excellent Bullinger, I have managed, with as much brevity as I could, to give you a comprehensive view of our affairs, both the state of the republic and the form of the church.</p>
      <p>France, long wounded by its own wounds and almost wearied by wars, has now finally somewhat recovered: it indeed admits the gospel, but as if it were a plague; so that it visits no cities, except a few and those very small, or if larger, it stays outside the walls. The court is very careful not to admit Christ even as a guest; therefore, it is ordered to exile at certain miles, under severe penalty. A cardinal and a noble and especially pious man, exiled here with us for the sake of religion, while staying for a few days in our Canterbury, waiting for a favorable and safe return, wasted away, as they say, by the deadly poison of the papists, and it is indeed credible, by their crime and wickedness. But why do I export anything from France to Zurich? For nothing is usually brought from France that is not common to the Zurichers, with which you do not also abound. However, I think you have not received this one thing, or at least it is rarer with you: The Duke of Anjou, brother of the King of France, has become a vehement suitor to our queen. What outcome this matter will have is not yet known. While I do not yet hear that it is fully approved; so I do not yet see anything completely disapproved. If you ask what I think; it is indeed difficult to be a judge in the affairs of princes. I will only say this: what they believe will be, I think will not be true marriages. There are many things that make me fear; there are also not a few that lead me to hope.</p>
      <p>However, I leave these things, as all our affairs, to be wisely and well disposed by divine judgment and goodness. If it will contribute as much to the propagation of the gospel's fruit and the glory of Christ's name as it seems at first sight to be beneficial to the private affairs of individuals and to the public affairs of all, it will have abundantly satisfied both our life and our desire.</p>
      <p>And to interweave some things here about our neighboring Scotland. It indeed, recently shaken by the most foul murders, and stained with the blood of the most noble men, and of its king, a most excellent young man from England, and after him James, the best regent, whom they removed by horrible and mournful slaughter, still burns with mutual hatred of these things.</p>
      <p>The queen, while suspected of her husband's murder, was sought by the nobles of that kingdom either for purification or punishment, as I indicated recently, fled here secretly to England, where she is still held captive. She has often plotted escape, others have plotted theft; so far, however, it has been attempted in vain: for she is very diligently and seriously guarded: for what purpose, few know; with what outcome, it is not yet known; with what hope, or rather with what fear, it is painful to say. He who forced her here, and is easily able, because he is powerful, if it seems good; and will not be difficult to wish, because he is merciful, if he is entreated, to dispense everything according to his will even to our will. Here indeed, how wonderfully all these things, beyond all hope, the God of all goodness and the Lord of glory has preserved intact, since it is certain from experience, it will indeed have been true to say: although because it is rare in outcome, it will have been almost incredible to hear. For both in that French tumult, and in this Scottish contention, and also in the Spanish enmity, all of which could never have been accomplished with scant preparation or little labor, our Elizabeth, as the sole nurse of those affairs, preserved the parts of the pious unharmed for the sake of the gospel alone, which otherwise would undoubtedly have failed long ago. But see the ancient and indeed most convenient and almost principal stratagem of the papists, which has now become familiar to them by daily custom and is plainly their own by long use and possession. They besiege the slender body of the most noble virgin Elizabeth with almost infinite efforts, and most studiously now seek her death, by poison and violence and witchcraft and treachery, and by all other means of that kind that could ever be conceived, which is indeed horrible even to remember.</p>
      <p>However, as God has so far kept her faithful and industrious to His gospel as Deborah; so indeed He has made her triumphant as Judith: we pray that He may also make her an aged Anna.</p>
      <p>You indeed have Scottish merchandise, not only sordid and wicked, but truly dark. Now therefore receive the Flanders news, very few indeed, but which you will undoubtedly say are elegant. A certain man was recently with us, not unlearned, a doctor of law, of the kind, I suppose, who once intended death for Christ among the Jews, by the name of Story, a man as if born for cruelty, a most savage persecutor in Marian times, for whom to kill saints was for profit, to shed blood was for sport: he therefore, after that happy day dawned for us, when God raised our Elizabeth to the summit of the English empire, was immediately captured and imprisoned for the open crime of treason. Shortly after, when his keeper was somewhat negligent, he broke out of prison and fled to Flanders, and became a servant to the Duke of Alba, the capital adversary of our kingdom, residing in those parts. Here he, as if a fury slipped from the underworld, or more truly, like a wicked Davus, it is amazing how he immediately disrupts everything: he plunders, afflicts, and imprisons merchants who have landed in those places, having obtained the duke's permission: he incites the English people to sedition: he acts strenuously and vehemently with Alba to generously provide soldiers and equipment for such a holy business: finally, he does everything with hands and feet, striving to bring about an untimely and mournful slaughter of the most noble queen, his prince, and the most excellent kingdom, his country, with unheard-of cruelty. Here indeed the merchants, who daily suffered from the most cruel beatings of this Davus and would have received a fuller sense of these things with greater pain without any hope of remedy, devised a common plan and with one voice clamored for his removal, which they accomplished with this excellent cunning. Indeed, a familiar of his, suborned by the merchants, came to him, whose loyalty he did not at all suspect, whispering in his ear that a ship had just arrived from England containing I know not what mountains of golden treasure.</p>
      <p>He immediately flew out, inflamed with love of the booty, vowing gold to himself, certain slaughter to the merchants; who, after he had boarded the ship, and crept into all its corners and had already burst into the very innermost parts of the ship, they suddenly closed the hatches and, with sails raised, carried him to England with a favorable and safe wind. Here indeed, if they had encountered all the ships of the Turkish empire laden with treasures or the entire Venetian fleet with their riches, even offered and presented to them on the journey, they would not, I am sure, have exchanged this small cargo of their little ship and its worthless load for all those treasures. And so finally, with great expectation of the people congratulating him on his return, he was brought to London and shortly after condemned for the crime of treason, hanged and dismembered, becoming the second martyr of the Anglo-Roman church after Felton (for he was the one who had affixed the papal bulls to the doors of the Bishop of London's residence), to be numbered among the putrid papal saints.</p>
      <p>I have also sent you, my Bullinger, through this messenger ten crowns, not so much as an honorable or certainly honorary gift but as some kind of testimony of my goodwill towards you; all of which I wish to be dedicated in your common dining room in memory of us, without, however, a sacrifice.</p>
      <p>Farewell, all of you together, and live happily, and I wish you to be persuaded of me as you are accustomed to be, who willingly wishes for your sake whatever can be devised by counsel, accomplished by aid, comprehended by thought, or finally expedited by ability. May Christ Jesus preserve His church, which He redeemed with His precious blood, thwart all the plans of the adversaries, frustrate their efforts, and break their strength!</p>
      <p>Farewell, most beloved Bullinger, and live in the author of life. London, August 8.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Robert, Bishop of Winchester.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder. Zurich.</p>
