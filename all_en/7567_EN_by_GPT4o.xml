      <p>S. Although I have not received any letters from you today, most esteemed and revered father, I still consider it not inappropriate in our times if those from whom wise counsel is drawn for the conduct of affairs are occupied and burdened with more letters. Among these, as far as I know, there is no one who, taught by the experience of many matters, combines greater wisdom with fortitude in assisting others with counsel than you yourself. Therefore, whatever comes to mind, I am less ashamed to write to you, relying on your kindness and unique wisdom, with which you are so adept at tempering all our matters that you do not at all consider them burdensome and grievous. What we have from Italy at this time, I faithfully share with you through letters sent to me these days. Recently, there was also this writing about the clandestine and bloody conspiracy of the most powerful monks of the Christian world, which is such that it quite fittingly matches the beginning and origin of all darkness. However, I am surprised that we have nothing certain from Flanders, as there is talk everywhere of some conflict in which 14,000 of Alba's men are said to have fallen.</p>
      <p>Our Flavius also spreads from the legation that several galleys of Alba's men perished at sea while heading to Antwerp, and there are men of proven integrity who affirm that the princes are diligently working to depose the Emperor as useless to public affairs. - In our matter, there is excellent or rather hateful delay. The Upper League does not want to conclude anything until the feast of St. Martin, as directed by the supreme judge of that League, who also made our bishop a procrastinator and gave him other laws more than sufficiently suitable, so that the decree of the Leagues would not be published until then.</p>
      <p>It is, however, the bishop's role to first handle and transcribe or disseminate such matters. This was the cause of the great delay that intervened before the matter was reported to the communities. I have nothing certain about what the other communities have decided; however, the people of Malans and Maienfeld are entirely in agreement with us. Davos has a lazy minister; therefore, I do not know what has been done there. - Our knight, who wishes to appear as such, rejects those golden insignia like an asp and has instructed his people here to diligently watch the detractors, with whom they will proceed to the utmost law. - It is consistently reported that passage was denied to the exiled and expelled Italians into Rhaetia not long ago by a public or rather secret mandate presented to the inquisitor of Milan. If such a diploma is given to the enemies, what hope remains? - In Chiavenna, two brothers by blood, but very disunited in religious profession, nearly destroyed each other with mutual and fraternal arms, as one said that exiled ministers should not be tolerated, and not a day passes that is not made mournful by some disturbances and discord. I would never have believed that it would come to the point where monks would be expelled; they have taken such deep roots and are so fruitful for many in financial matters.</p>
      <p>These things very quickly, August 16, 1568.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus preserve you, our best patron, safe and sound for as long as possible. Farewell, most kind father. Greet you, Mr. Cosss., Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gantner, Mr. Charles, and everyone who is good.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Church of Zurich, his eternally revered lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
