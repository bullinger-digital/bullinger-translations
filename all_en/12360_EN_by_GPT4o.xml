    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich is very grateful for Bullinger's response from December 4 [not received] to his letters [No. 2289 and No. 2294]. He loves no one more than Bullinger. - Frölich had already thanked for the dispatch of [Johannes] Haller [to Augsburg]. Now he also conveys the thanks of the [Augsburg] council and church. The educated, pious Haller has preached several times about the superiority of the [Protestant] faith as well as about the sacraments of the old and new [covenant]. In doing so, he clearly explained the Lord's Supper. The enthusiastic council is therefore ready to defend Haller against the theologians who have targeted him. Therefore, all church servants are to appear before the council tomorrow, where they will be prohibited from any hostility under penalty of losing their positions. Haller will return to [Zurich] in about two weeks to fetch his wife [Elsbeth Kambli] and child [Agnes]. His employment will be arranged before his departure. - What Bullinger wrote regarding the gift transmitted by Frölich as well as the one yet to be sent by the Augsburg council makes Frölich sad. He seeks a means, no matter how small, by which Bullinger could be honored by [Augsburg]. - The colloquents have arrived in Regensburg. Actually, [Martin] Bucer and [Martin] Frecht should have passed through Augsburg on the shortest route, but they turned off long before, perhaps to avoid the Zurichers. The colloquium will bring nothing. - Bullinger should comfort Vadian in writing that neither a Frecht nor a Bucer or a Musculus can disturb the [Augsburg] church. Regarding the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, Augsburg is well positioned, so that not even Musculus and his followers could reintroduce idolatry. For when Augsburg entered into a concord with the Wittenberger [Luther], it was not at the expense of the truth. - Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Erasmus] Schmid, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Johannes] Wolf, and [Konrad] Gessner. - [Enclosure:] Frölich has heard with joy from Bullinger that Hans Wilpert Zoller would like to make a name for himself in Augsburg. Zoller had already expressed this wish to Frölich shortly before his departure [from Augsburg]. However, Sebastian Schertlin had already departed for the Hessian court. Three days after Zoller's departure, Frölich was dispatched to Constance, so he could only write to Schertlin after his return. He has not yet received a response. He will convey this in a letter that he will entrust to Haller. - Frölich sends the somewhat poorly printed writing by [Heinrich Steiner] [“True Account of the History, What Duke Heinrich of Brunswick... has happened this present year...”]. - Frölich thanks for the news transmitted by Bullinger. - All allied relatives are in favor of extending the [Schmalkaldic] League, including Württemberg. The improvement [of the league's deficiencies] seems imminent. Two electors [Hermann von Wied and Franz von Waldeck] wish to become [members]. [King Francis I of] France, [King Henry VIII of] England, and the Swedish King [Gustav I Vasa] are also applying for it. Denmark is already [in the league]. - Even Emperor [Charles V] has sent representatives to the [Schmalkaldic Diet in Frankfurt] to effect the release of Duke Heinrich, but it seems more like a scheme. - Details about the Brunswick war can be gleaned from Duke Heinrich's [confiscated] letters and writings. This will have dire consequences. - Landgrave [Philip] of Hesse has confiscated a shipment of 1500 pieces of war material initiated by Pope [Paul III] in St. Goar on the Rhine. This was intended for Spaniards and [Italians], who were to enter [Germany] unarmed and therefore unsuspected. - There is a plan to use the [Catholic] Confederates against the evangelical Germans, and then, once the empire [is subjected to the emperor], to also subjugate the Confederates under [his] yoke. - The German bishops and priests are afraid. Everyone is looking to the Diet in Frankfurt. - Greetings to the mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater], who should ponder this difficult situation. - Greetings to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs].</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>S. On the 4th of this month, you responded to my recent letters abundantly, and with such richness and diligence, that I see what you hinted at in the beginning is very true.</p>
      <p>Indeed, because of your love for me, you find no end to writing. Thanks, therefore, to the most gracious God, who wished to adorn my life with such a specimen of humanity. I, in turn, say that I hold no one dearer than you, and so dear that I cannot adequately express my feelings towards you. May the Lord consolidate and preserve us in this bond into eternal life.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>I have already thanked you for the dispatch of Haller. Now I give the greatest thanks not only on my behalf but also on behalf of the council and indeed the entire church of Augsburg, because his learning and eloquence, combined with piety, have endeared him to all good people here, and the fruits of his teaching are not lacking. He has delivered several sermons on the antiquity and excellence of our religion and faith, then descended to the sacraments of the old and new law and clearly explained the knot of the Lord's Supper; this was as pleasing as it was beneficial to our church. I also perceive that the leaders of our council have listened to the assertion of truth with great joy and will be most ready to defend it, as it will indeed be worthwhile. For some theologians, whom you yourself recently partly criticized, have sharpened their teeth against him; but all the ministers of our church will be summoned before the council tomorrow, and they will be forbidden from harboring enmities and hatreds without cause under penalty of deprivation of office. With this measure, I hope this sore can be healed. Haller will perhaps return to you in two weeks to prepare his household and his wife with their child for the journey to us. Before he departs, his ecclesiastical function and reward for his labors will be arranged, as you will perceive.</p>
      <p>What you write about the memorial transmitted by me and still to be transmitted by our council truly saddens me and gives ample occasion to curse those laws by which it is indiscriminately decreed that no good person may receive anything in memory from the best, who think only of virtue.</p>
      <p>I tell you, brother, that I will seek a way for you to partake in the honorarium of our people, even if it will be very small.</p>
      <p>The colloquents from both sides, as I hear, have gathered in Regensburg. Bucer and Frecht, although they could not take a more direct and succinct route there except through Augsburg, nevertheless turned far away from us, perhaps avoiding the Zurichers.</p>
      <p>I see it will be a vain talk, not a fruitful conversation. The only thing we will praise in the colloquium is the levity, to which no one will subscribe.</p>
      <p>Vadian, that excellent man! Comfort and write to him that our church is not yet so narrowed into such straits that either Frecht or a cat or a mouse could easily conquer or disturb it. We have entered into concord with the Wittenbergers over maintaining and retaining the truth, not over defending dreams and opinions. Furthermore, our church, as far as the purity of the Lord's Supper is concerned, has long been so healthily established that it cannot tolerate Lutheranism at all. Indeed, neither Musculus with his followers could reintroduce this idolatry to us, because they themselves have preached nothing else in reality for many years than Haller, etc. I therefore hope this matter will succeed well.</p>
      <p>Farewell and individually greet from me Pellikan, Gwalther, Fabritius, Bibliander, Wolf, Gesner, etc.</p>
      <p>On the very day of Christ's birth in the year 1546. Yours, Georgius Laetus, chief scribe</p>
      <p>In Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, antistes of the church in Zurich, lord and friend as a brother. Zurich.</p>
      <p>What you wrote to me about the pious, well-behaved, esteemed young man Hans Wilpert Zoller, I was very pleased to hear, especially that he is inclined to become known here and that his honorable friendship gives him the will to do so. And although he declared himself to me in this way shortly before his departure, it happened so close to his departure that I could not speak to Herr Sebastian Schertlin (who had also already departed) on his behalf. I was also sent out by my lords on the third day after Zoller and Zwingli departed and came to Constance on the same journey. However, as God has helped me again, I have written to Herr Sebastian Schertlin, who is now at the Hessian court, on Zoller's behalf, but have not yet received a response. I am hopeful he will soon return home. Then I will, God willing, handle the matter verbally with him and write to you through Herr Haller about everything. Please inform Zoller of my entirely willing service, as I could not write to him this time.</p>
      <p>Herewith I send you the true account of the recent Brunswick war, although the copy is somewhat lacking due to the printer's negligence.</p>
      <p>I thank you for your faithful report on matters known to you and consider that it should not turn out badly in appropriate places.</p>
      <p>Our allied relatives are (praise God) all unanimous and of the mind to improve and extend the league; Württemberg, which was a concern, as well as others. And the improvement has now been found very close and an agreement has been reached. Moreover, two electors of the empire desire to join. The French (I tell you with belief, though in confidence) are also recruiting for it, and although their nature is known and they are not trusted more than is reasonable, such a request can still be used for good. England is also in similar negotiations. The king of Sweden is also seeking our alliance.</p>
      <p>Denmark is already in it and desires extension like others. They all have their envoys in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Also, the imperial majesty has its envoys there and is seeking the release of Duke Heinrich, although I fear this legation is more regarded as a scheme and division rather than for Duke Heinrich's sake.</p>
      <p>How and by whom the recent Brunswick uprising was instigated and promoted is clearly found in Duke Heinrich's letters and writings. It may indeed cause a disturbance. The Landgrave of Hesse has stopped 1500 pieces of Italian munitions and guns at St. Goar on the Rhine, and all such armament belongs to the pope and no one else. There is thorough and certain experience of this, and moreover, that the unarmed Spaniards and Walloons, if they wanted to overrun us, could come out without suspicion and arm themselves with this ammunition.</p>
      <p>The plan is made that the Confederates should be used against the evangelical Germans, and then, once the empire is shattered, the Confederates should also be forced under the yoke. We have nothing else to foresee.</p>
      <p>The German bishops and priests sit in great fear, and everyone is looking to the day in Frankfurt. But we will direct our eyes to the Lord and call upon His name.</p>
      <p>Greet my gracious commanding lord mayor with the expression of my willing service. You may still give him cause to ponder these serious matters; for it is about the highest matters, namely the honor of God, the salvation of people, and the freedom of the fatherland.</p>
      <p>I desire to greet the city clerk and all gracious lords. Given as in the letters.</p>
