      <p>Greetings. It has been more or less six months... since... I received your book, most excellent and learned Bullinger, during which time I had received no letters from you nor you from me. For your last letters were dated the seventh of October of the year fifty-five, but mine, when? I acknowledge my fault long before and certainly, Lord Bullinger, I was so ashamed afterwards for not having replied to yours, when I should have, that I am still ashamed to respond. Indeed, there was nothing in them that necessarily required a response from me; yet I know it is my duty not to let any letters, especially from such great old friends as you are, go unanswered. Therefore, for not having fulfilled my duty when I should have, I humbly ask for your pardon. As for the fact that you hold me in such esteem that you continue to honor and gift me with your new writings, I am truly grateful and thank you greatly from the heart, and I pray to the Lord that He may someday grant me the opportunity to reciprocate.</p>
      <p>Perhaps soon I will see other brothers and learned men of ours there; for I am considering your Baden baths, although I have not yet decided anything certain about it nor can I; before I hear from the doctors, to whom I will take my wife, for their advice; my mind certainly inclines towards your direction for many reasons, yet I will do what they judge to be more advisable and beneficial for my wife. Meanwhile, may your piety, as it has begun, continue to pray to the Lord that He may finally restore her to me and put an end to this our long and more grievous suffering than we can bear. We have received three writings which the Papists have spread with their false words, undoubtedly either by the command or at least with the consent of the impious Jezebel. They have claimed that the Archbishop of Canterbury recanted and returned to their church, and they have even confirmed this fabricated recantation with false testimonies of some and then ensured it was printed. When this holy man learned of it, he protested openly and publicly declared to the whole kingdom that this recantation was made entirely without his knowledge, that he had never thought of such a blasphemous recantation, and that he still believed and confessed with steadfast faith the doctrine he had taught, promoted, and ensured was promoted in the kingdom of England by the grace of Christ, and that he would defend and seal it with his own blood even unto death. Meanwhile, after the impostors' fabrications were exposed, a certain doctor (whose name I do not recall, it has slipped my memory) was sent by the queen to Oxford to the Archbishop of Canterbury on the 17th of March. For what purpose, the letters that were later sent to Antwerp to Mr. Kooc, a pious and noble knight, explain. Therefore, yesterday this noble man received letters from Antwerp stating that the holy and pious archbishop, with an unbroken spirit, steadfast faith, and perpetual confession of Jesus Christ and the evangelical doctrine, was burned on the 21st of March and has passed to the Lord. There are those here who, because these letters were sent from Antwerp and none from England, do not believe for certain that he is dead; but nevertheless, both Mr. Kooc and many other Englishmen, and indeed our Mr. Peter, since I had received letters from England itself a little before about the sending of that doctor Lomlino to Oxford and about that fabricated recantation, believe what is written in those letters sent from Antwerp to be true. We have, most excellent man of God, for which to give thanks to God, that He deigns to have the holy gospel of His Son sealed daily with the blood of so many great men, both elsewhere and especially in that English kingdom, to confirm our faith and to restore all the saints. It cannot be that the soil watered with so much martyr blood will not yield joyful harvests to the Lord, from which the church of Christ will grow, and it cannot be that so much blood will not cry out to the Lord from the earth. O barbarous, impious, and utterly inhumane harlot; may the Lord destroy her and declare and reveal His judgments upon her as soon as possible. Farewell, most excellent father.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, April 6, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, H[ieronymus] Zanchi.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man and most worthy pastor of the church of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most revered and esteemed father. Zürich</p>
      <p>That the Archbishop of Canterbury did not recant. D. H. Zanchi of Brescia's letter, April 1556.</p>
