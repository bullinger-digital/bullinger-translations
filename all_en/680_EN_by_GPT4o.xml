      <p>Greetings. I am sending this booklet to you, most excellent and learned man, which, although it is dedicated to Johann Butler of your region, was published here, and I do not think it is currently available for sale among you.</p>
      <p>However, even if you seem to be very busy, you will nonetheless recognize my benevolent and mindful spirit towards you. The subject of the booklet is pious and taken from the midst of the storms of the troubled church, and it has brought me much light in understanding the same matter, so that I consider myself satisfied. I am very pleased with the style of the writing in theological matters, which is pure, Latin, and elegant. Therefore, as I said, you will receive this booklet from me as one devoted to you. I have nothing new to report; there are some things, but they are uncertain; moreover, I do not present myself as [Greek] in these matters. Farewell and commend me to the Lord in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Basel, 19th of September, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Michael Maler, Doctor.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, theologian and faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
