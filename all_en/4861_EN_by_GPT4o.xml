      <p>Greetings. In this workshop of patience, I have been so miserably and ungratefully harassed and agitated almost every moment that I have scarcely had the leisure to breathe, let alone fulfill the duties of writing. Such is the condition of this old world.</p>
      <p>I am sending to you a petition made to the king and a booklet presented in the month of June. Bishops and more learned men from France are to convene in Paris on the 20th of this month to deliberate on the reformation of religion. We must pray to the Lord to enlighten the minds of men with His spirit.</p>
      <p>The Glarus matter has been postponed to the day of Saint Gall. [16.10.1561]</p>
      <p>Greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Baden, July 4th.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich. Zurich.</p>
