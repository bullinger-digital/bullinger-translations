      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I diligently took care of the letters sent to me, which I received on the night of March 9th; for early in the morning, I went to the house of Maurus, who is now in Solothurn, called to the Swiss Diet, where military matters will be discussed, and I found the postman mounting his horse, who undoubtedly delivered them on the same day, as he had promised. I also sent another letter to Strasbourg on the same day, written by Montius, through a trustworthy man, our fellow citizen.</p>
      <p>I will send the books you requested when I find a suitable courier. I promise nothing about the German booklets; for they are not available in any bookstore. I think I have two, which, if I find them after searching the library, I will lend to you.</p>
      <p>The situation with our Oporinus is as follows: He published a booklet by Naus√©e, which they do not want to sell in Basel, and some idle people have stirred up some kind of tragedy about a new booklet printed by Oporinus against our religion. The senate requested the booklets when he was thrown into prison; the brothers read them and said to the senate that there is nothing bad in the dialogues nor anything against our religion, except that we are called heretics.</p>
      <p>He was therefore released without any fine imposed; however, he was ordered to collect the booklets he had distributed, which is impossible, and to give them to the senate, which will never happen.</p>
      <p>Thus, judgments are often made without properly examining the matter and by those who do not understand what is being discussed.</p>
      <p>If he had shown the booklet to the deputies, he would not have incurred any danger.</p>
      <p>The parliament of Ensisheim captured many soldiers, whom they beheaded; the Imperial and Ferdinandine forces are completely mad.</p>
      <p>You undoubtedly know that Baron von Solms was captured by the Landgrave and taken to France. Mr. Schertlin has a large number of soldiers and is setting out for Lorraine against the Emperor's wishes.</p>
      <p>The younger son of the Landgrave came to us on March 6th and is staying at a public inn and barely escaped; he was dressed in women's clothing and rode in a cheap carriage so as not to be recognized. The notable captain Hans von Salzburg was captured by the Ensisheim forces, which greatly troubles Schertlin, a very good man, who will undoubtedly take revenge on them. Herr Bastian has made a green coat, embroidered on the sleeves with: P P P, which means: fight for the fatherland, and on the insignia, he has in golden letters: Freedom of Germany, on the shooting banner a gun, upon which a burning rooster. You can guess what this signifies.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Hastily. March 11, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned gentleman Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my gracious lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
