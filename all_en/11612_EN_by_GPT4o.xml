    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter from August 31 [1541]. On [Heinrich] Falkner's order, Hilles sends red and black cloth through Konrad Eblie [Ã„bli?], which is to be paid for at the next Frankfurt fair; still waiting for Falkner's last payment, which Christoph Froschauer will only pay out under the condition of good business; has also sent more expensive cloth. What remains should be sold for the benefit of poor religious refugees; if there is no need in Zurich, the money should be sent to Calvin in Geneva for the same purpose. Gifts Bullinger a particularly good and popular fabric in England; if he does not want to accept it as a gift, he can pay for it. Hilles cannot write this letter more carefully, as he left almost all employees in England; the only one who came from England could not be prevented from returning home for material reasons, denying his faith; does not know who has obliged the pious W[illiam] Peterson - who asks for the forwarding of a letter to Glarus - so much that he now frequently attends mass; he has a wealthy wife. Falkner should send 100 pounds of butter for Hilles to Strasbourg; if this is impossible, the delivery should be made through John Burcher, who is staying in Basel at the house of Myconius or [Michael] Isengrin; sends English cheese through Froschauer. Will convey greetings to [John] B[utler]; does not fully understand the situation [Butler's] mentioned by Bullinger, but does not want to burden him with further worries; if [Butler] does not comply with a possible return to England, he will lose everything, including his chosen one. [Addendum from September 25:] Hilles is not a citizen of Strasbourg because he does not want to lose privileges in England and Brabant, but the council is friendly to him. In the meantime, Froschauer has settled Falkner's debts; Bullinger should let Falkner know that Hilles is sending him more fabrics in various colors and price ranges through Eblie. Sends theses by [Wolfgang] Capito. Henry VIII is fighting against the rebels in the north and had some ringleaders executed; the king also had [Margaret, Countess of Salisbury] as well as [Leonard Grey, Viscount Grane, and Thomas Fynes, Lord Dacre of the South] executed; apart from the cardinal's nephew [Reginald Pole] and [Edward,] son of the Marquis of Exeter [Henry Courtenay], both imprisoned and sentenced, no one from the royal family is alive: Hilles wants to remain silent about Henry's son from his marriage to [Jane Seymour], [the future Edward VI.]; [Arthur Plantagenet, Viscount Lisle], an [illegitimate] son of Edward IV - whose daughter [Elizabeth of York] married Henry VII - was also captured; Edward IV's brother, Richard [III], had his young sons Edward [V] and Richard killed to seize the kingdom; [Henry Bourchier], Earl of Essex, died after a fall from a horse, his possessions were then transferred to the already executed [Thomas] Cromwell. Thomas [Cranmer] and Chancellor [Thomas, Baron Audley of Walden] represent Henry in southern England; in London, the young [Richard Mekins] was burned for Lutheran statements about the presence of Christ in the Eucharist - similar to [John] Wycliffe's view. [Wilhelm] Zwingli and other students died of the plague in Strasbourg; regards. [Enclosure 1:] 12 theses by [Wolfgang] Capito on the validity and interpretation of the Decalogue. [Hilles' comments on this:] The occasion for theses 3 and 4 was a previous dispute over the veneration of images; Capito relied heavily on Isaiah and 1Cor 8 and also argued that a Christ on the cross in churches reminds people of his sacrificial death and is therefore permissible. Hilles also sends theses by Martin Bucer; he himself rarely attends the disputations. [Enclosure 2:] Theses by Martin Bucer on Lev 5.</p>

      <p>Propositions on the Law. 1. The Decalogue of Moses encompasses a wide scope. 2. For first, the commandments, then the first promise, which is the source and head of all others, is presented, and then faith and love of God are required. 3. Eight words of the Decalogue undoubtedly contain moral precepts and matters inherent in human nature. 4. The second and fourth pertain to ceremonies, and although each has its moral aspect, the former indeed, so that God is not worshipped superstitiously or that what belongs to God is not attributed to creatures, the latter, so that there is a set time for divine worship and rest from family labors. 5. Since the Lord ordained according to the same Decalogue in the polity of the Israelites, therefore judicial laws pertain to it, by which whatever openly opposes it is forbidden and punished. 6. Such judicial laws of God are abolished with the abolition of the Jewish state, which Scripture predicted would be abolished through Christ, as it said the gospel of Christ was to be brought to the nations. 7. All ceremonies pertain to the first four commandments of the first tablet. 8. And if to anyone knowledgeable in the scriptures it is their judgment, and you do not find it explicitly stated, to which commandment each ceremony is to be referred, yet it is not absurd to distribute them thus: 9. That to the first you apply ceremonies distinguishing the people of God from other nations, such as distinctions of food and drink, clothing, to the second the observation of altars, tabernacles, and temples, to the third the rites of sacrifices and libations and most purifications, to the fourth the religion of feasts, months, and days. 10. These, as shadows, have long been abolished by the body of light, that is, Christ the Lord present. For since they were figured by Him as the primary form, and referred to Him as the one to come. 11. Regarding the abolition of the Decalogue, it is to be understood that it is abolished through Christ, not so that it is not observed, but so that it does not accuse and condemn the believer in Him. 12. Therefore, he is free from the Decalogue and from the judgment of the mind accusing him, who by faith in the Lord has overcome all accusation; the rest are left under condemnation as slaves of sin.</p>
      <p>The occasion for propositions 3 and 4 was a certain contention fourteen days ago concerning the use of idols, before these were proposed. For in the preceding propositions from Isaiah, it was gathered that the making of idols was not prohibited by God, provided they were not worshipped. And therefore, it was possible without superstition to display in temples the image of Christ crucified to remind people that the true God suffered as a man for us. Those were the very words of one of Dr. Capito's propositions.</p>
      <p>His main argument was 1 Cor. 8 [4]. "An idol is nothing. Therefore, it will not harm us if we have some idol," he said, "provided we do not worship it," etc. He plainly counts idols among indifferent things.</p>
      <p>Here you also have other propositions of Dr. Martin Bucer, almost new to my ears and, if I am not mistaken, in some respects different from the very pure doctrine of the gospel.</p>
      <p>I do not often attend disputations, and therefore, whether there have been more propositions of this kind or not, I do not know. However, as far as I know, there were no more propositions (in my presence during the disputation) that were, in my judgment and the word of God, different from these.</p>
      <p>Necessary propositions from chapter 5 of Leviticus. 1. It pertains to the discipline of the church and the true pursuit of repentance that people use the ministry of reconciliation even when they have neglected lighter duties, as they seem. 2. It is also part of this discipline to bring the sins of brothers to ecclesiastical judgment, just as it is to bring the sins of citizens to civil judgment in political discipline. 3. Nor is it only a neglect of duty if someone, who heard someone curse and swear unworthily, did not report it, but also if he knew of any other sin for which the use of ecclesiastical judgment is necessary for healing. 4. Not only those who are adjured, but also those who are not adjured, ought to testify what they know, if indeed it is to be judged by human judgment. 5. And not only when a sin is committed, but also when a more serious admonition of sin is made, such as through death or diseases or other abominable things, repentance is to be exercised and the ministry of reconciliation is to be used. 6. It is sometimes an act of piety to bind oneself by oath both to help others and to afflict one's own flesh. However, it can happen that it is an act of piety not to fulfill what you have sworn. Nevertheless, it must always be expiated through the ministry of reconciliation. 7. Those things that are ignorantly neglected concerning sacred ceremonies are to be counted among more serious sins and expiated with greater religiousness. 8. These exercises of repentance and the use of the ministry of reconciliation, while free to Christians, are to be used more diligently by them than by the ancients.</p>
      <p>Probabilities.</p>
      <p>1. The first verse of this chapter seems to speak of a curse made with an unworthy invocation of the name of God and not of an adjuration for speaking the truth. 2. In the neglect of denunciation of someone who swore badly, there is sin from oneself [?], everyone makes a sin by the unworthy neglect of denunciation. 3. The ignorance of which Moses speaks in this chapter is not simple and true ignorance of word or deed, but a certain thoughtlessness and lack of attention. 4. These precepts of expiations were not so demanded that for each such offense and immediately the prescribed expiation had to be made, but it was enough to expiate many at once in their own times. 5. Thus, our ancestors instituted a certain general observation of penance and expiation of sins through the sacred ministry of reconciliation in Lent or before the feast of Easter not without reason. 6. And when a certain public expiation was instituted above for the whole people, it seems consistent with the institution of the Lord that in the church there should be a certain confession of sins by the whole people and also a common absolution received. 7. As the Lord appointed the priestly remedy of expiation for the ancients even for lighter sins, which are neither worthy of absolution nor excommunication, it seems that the use of the keys is in the church in recounting lighter sins, for which no one is bound by the church. 8. There is also some binding to make certain satisfaction to the church, even abstention and excommunication.</p>
