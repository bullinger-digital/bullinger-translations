      <p>S. P. D. I wrote to you last month, most esteemed father, about the plan of the intended journey, which I am entirely convinced is approved by you and my parents, for various reasons, especially because I left Paris at a time when the Antichrist is most accustomed to rage against the true confessors of religion. We saw the cities of Orléans and Bourges, which are flourishing in the studies of law and jurisprudence, and finally, freed from the troubles and labors of the journey, we rested in Lausanne as if in a harbor. I saw or heard nothing on the journey worthy of you, except that in the borders of Bourges, a certain monstrous beast, sent by divine intervention, is raging, which in the previous months devoured several children. Those who suffered the loss reported this to us; it only rages against the innocent age; it has almost the size of a wolf, the head of a cat, and is endowed with incredible speed, a new and unheard-of monster. Necessity and the hasty departure of my companions forced me to leave Paris without greeting Lord Martin Besard; however, I wrote letters explaining the reasons for my departure, and at the same time, I asked him to inform me at the Lyon fairs, where he wants the money to be counted or which messengers he wants to send to Paris. I would have sent the account of the expenses I made (they are 28 crowns) to my parents; but you have already heard the reason why I defer to the Lyon fairs. In Lausanne, I met Ribittus, a pious and learned man, and experienced great humanity from him. I have not greeted Mr. Viret yet, as the opportunity has not yet presented itself. However, I do not miss any opportunity to converse with the learned because of the books, of which they can easily provide me with a supply. I have decided to dedicate this period, during which I am staying in Lausanne, entirely to the Greek language and, if the opportunity presents itself, also to taste the holy language, in which Ribittus has promised me his assistance.</p>
      <p>I have learned that the knowledge of languages is far to be preferred over the study of philosophy. As spring approaches, I have decided to explore Italy, as I wrote to you in my previous letters; for I trust that I will do this without great loss to my life or my family's estate. In the meantime, I will keep the goal of piety in mind, so that I may one day meet my parents' expectations of me and be of service to my country. I understand well what I owe to my father, what he expects of me, and what he thinks; I only wish that I may one day be able to respond in kind and demonstrate the duty and gratitude of a son.</p>
      <p>If it offends my father that I am staying in Lausanne, I ask you to have me excused; for although the studies of letters do not flourish here as much, I will not allow this period, during which I am waiting for a convenient journey, to be wasted. I also beseech you to explain the reasons for my silence to my parents; I will write shortly and inform them of everything, for messengers will easily present themselves. I left the package of my books, which is not large, in Paris with Martin, whom I have found to be most faithful in my affairs.</p>
      <p>There is nothing more that occurs to me to write to you at this time, most humane man, but perhaps I am interrupting your sacred studies more than enough with these trifles. However, as I perceive from your letters that mine do not seem talkative to you, I sometimes write more freely.</p>
      <p>May God deign to keep you safe for our church. Do not hesitate to convey my many greetings to my parents, your entire family, your most honorable wife, and your sweetest children.</p>
      <p>From our study in Lausanne, on the 4th of the Ides of January, in the year 49. Yours sincerely, Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant minister of the Zürich church, Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed father. Zürich.</p>
