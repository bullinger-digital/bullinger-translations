      <p>Greetings. Today (reverend father) Mr. Balingketus arrived, after all our merchants had already departed. He brought these things, which he received from Brescia.</p>
      <p>There was also a teaching on communion under both kinds from the 5th session, which I kept for myself, as you already have it; I am sending everything else. Perhaps you already have these as well; if you do, return them or otherwise distribute them among friends at your discretion. I read the speech of the French orator and the Duke of Bavaria not without some pleasure.</p>
      <p>I have not yet been able to obtain the acts of the council; I will inquire if there is still someone from our side to whom I can give them; let me know if you have received them.</p>
      <p>Farewell; I have not re-read this.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>Mr. Balingketus sends his regards to you.</p>
      <p>I ask that you ensure these letters are delivered to Mr. Ludwig Lavater, your son-in-law.</p>
      <p>After I had already written and sealed this once, Mr. Balingketus came again with letters, in which it was written that nothing was more certain than that about thirty were beheaded at Trento (as was previously reported) and thrown into the Adige, but the reason is unknown; likewise, the Bishop of Verona was beaten to death with clubs, the perpetrators are unknown, except that they are believed to be Spaniards; likewise, about 100 girls were made pregnant by the prelates, most of them; among them was a widow, whose fate particularly angered some of her relatives and, as I do not know what threats were uttered, she was killed.</p>
      <p>The one who reported these things to Balingketus' relative came directly from Trento and affirms that many foul and unspeakable things are being perpetrated in Trento. To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father in Christ.</p>
