      <p>Greetings. On the day after the calends of September, I happily arrived at Winterthur, as if to the desired harbor of my old age, with the Lord prospering me well. However, I am now entirely occupied with sorting, arranging, and organizing my paper belongings; for when I moved here, I packed everything into barrels without any order whatsoever, but rather as each item first came to hand or seemed conveniently to occupy the nearest available space. Now, it is a great trouble to put each thing back into its proper place, a task made even more difficult because the house, into which I hoped we would be received without delay, has not yet been cleared of debris and dust, nor indeed is it sufficiently built, which greatly delays me in my pursuit of tranquility; however, the workers are hastening as much as they can. I found our Hirsgarten in conflict with a domestic and indeed internal enemy, namely a stone, who received me very kindly and dutifully, soon greeting me with a gift of excellent wine. I judged this man's kindness to be of very good spirit, commending myself to him as diligently and accurately as I could, as a sheep to a shepherd, whom I now truly and gladly acknowledge to be mine, since he has been the not unworthy pastor of this town for so many years. I wanted to inform you of this because perhaps you have not yet forgotten that he was somewhat less favorable and less candid as an interpreter of my exhortations nearly eight years ago. And know that all those things are now entirely buried, which I indeed long ago forgave, and hence, for your zeal and love towards us, I know you will congratulate us both, as you will do. But farewell now, my most esteemed lord and by far the dearest brother in Christ, with your whole household and all your fellow ministers and servants in the work of the Lord, to each of whom I uniquely wish to be commended in our common Savior Christ. Again and again, farewell and recognize me as entirely yours forever.</p>
      <p>In Winterthur, September 6, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and incomparable friend.</p>
