    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger thanks for Myconius’ letter [No. 2855]. He has already conveyed his news [with No. 2850] through Christoph Froschauer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Francisco de Enzinas should be informed that Bullinger has received everything well from him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It is certain that the Bohemians do not want to go to war [against Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony]. Bullinger has read the manifesto of their uprising directed [against Ferdinand I.]. Therefore, the Elector does not need to fear them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Myconius should immediately deliver the enclosed letter to Sebastian Münster, so that he can entrust the money [intended for Erasmus Oswald Schreckenfuchs] to the bearer [Andreas Müller] of the present letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings to Johannes Gast and thanks for his letter [No. 2848].</p>
