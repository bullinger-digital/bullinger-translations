      <p>Some time ago, through others, you learned, Hieronymus, dearest brother, that my venerable and dearest godfather Martyr, having left us in difficulties and miseries, has migrated to heavenly joys to the Lord, whom he served faithfully. Now, therefore, it is a matter of appointing a successor to him, and since the minds of many incline towards you, as you are a diligent disciple of his, a faithful defender of sound evangelical doctrine, sufficiently equipped to profess, teach, and dispute, I wanted to try through this letter of mine, if, when it is a matter of choosing Martyr's successor and you are named, what I can promise about you to the most honorable magistrate and the college of ministers. I therefore ask you, without delay and by the first messenger offered to you, to diligently and significantly, so that I can read it, write down your opinion and indeed secretly, so that no one understands; for I would not want this to be made public. It will be especially necessary for you to inform me whether you can leave without detriment to the church and school of Strasbourg, in which you indeed have a stipend, but no profession. For we would not want to do to others what we would not want done to us.</p>
      <p>But if you can leave without harm to the church and school and with the good grace of the magistrate and school authorities, you will undoubtedly bring with you a good testimony accepted from them, which you can show to ours. As for what duties you will have to perform with us, there is no need for me to explain in many words.</p>
      <p>You know what function Martyr of blessed memory sustained; you will succeed him in labors and stipend; however, the stipend of this year has been kindly given to Martyr's widow until the feast of John the Baptist. From then on, both the labors and the stipend proceed together, although I would prefer you to arrive sooner if you were chosen. We are indeed seeking a man in every way like our Martyr, a hardworking, peaceful, kind man, not negligent, not contentious and quarrelsome, but one who fosters peace among brothers, does not sow discord, a man moreover simple and straightforward, not entangled in various opinions and endless questions, not intent on curious matters that do nothing for salvation. And our Martyr progressed in expounding the sacred letters promptly, he did not linger on any one chapter or place of scripture for several days or months, which otherwise is often done by learned men. We desire, however, in our school to progress professors and to have the text, as they call it, well explained and conveniently applied to present matters, so that a clear benefit may return to diligent listeners and, if they ever go out to any common place, to have it briefly and methodically explained and to return maturely to the way. You will be joined as a colleague to Dr. Josias Simler, my dear son-in-law, whom our Martyr loved in a wonderful way and with whom he lived in utmost harmony.</p>
      <p>What faith, confession, and doctrine our church holds, there is no need to report to one who knows many things. However, all ministers and professors swear that they will say or assert nothing against the canonical scripture, and finally that they will persevere in our doctrine and never propose anything new in our church or new dogmas not yet collated with the synod, explained and confirmed by the scriptures, and accepted. All of which I think will seem to you, as it did to Martyr, not unjust but most necessary. And indeed the church of Zurich has stood by the grace of God from its first institution always constant in the same faith and doctrine and has never changed anything, which nevertheless some are accustomed to do more frequently than is just and convenient, in dogmas or rites. It has hitherto by the singular grace of God always been peaceful and harmonious, and dissensions and contentions among brothers have not arisen to afflict the church and disturb the republic. We earnestly wish that this happiness may be granted to us perpetually by the Lord, and as much as we can, we will strive with the most intense efforts to retain it, and we promise ourselves that you will be similarly affected if you were to come to us. We candidly report all these things to you, so that you may not be ignorant of our affairs and our institution, and finally so that you may deliberate more correctly about all these matters with yourself, and finally incline your mind, eager for all piety, peace, and honesty, more willingly towards us and promptly write about your willingness towards us. But above all, you will pray to the Lord together with us, that He, having mercy on us, may give to us, the church, and the school a man who is whole, simple, piously learned and learnedly pious, constant and strong, also peaceful, and who is according to the heart of God, to whom I commend you, dear brother, together with yours. It would also be preferable for me to know what kind of family you are equipped with.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, esteemed lord and dearest brother. You will greet the most illustrious men Dr. Johann Sturm, Dr. Conrad Hubert, Dr. Dasypodius, and others. If you have any certain news about the affairs of France or England and about the Frankfurt assemblies or other matters worthy of mention, please share them. The soldiers and leaders of our allied soldiers write nothing but favorable things to their men, they mention that all our affairs are deplorable and on the verge of collapse, as they are destitute of money and provisions or supplies; yet I hope for better things, until you, who can have certain information from France, affirm the same to me, which God forbid. But, however that matter may fall, this is the business of Almighty God.</p>
      <p>The Council of Trent proceeds very stubbornly and now has a new driver, Cardinal of Lorraine, brother of the Frenchman Guise. He came not long ago with many bishops, abbots, and doctors to Trent.</p>
      <p>May the Lord scatter the councils of the impious and establish His truth, etc. Zurich, December 16, 1562.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich, your brother and fellow laborer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Dr. Hieronymus Zanchi of Bergamo, residing in Strasbourg, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
