      <p>Revered father, I have grieved, I rejoice, I ask for forgiveness.</p>
      <p>How much sorrow I felt in my heart from your illness, which had brought you to the very gates of death, and from the passing of your loved ones, especially your most honorable and to me also most revered wife, I can neither explain nor, as it is not expedient, do I wish to. For why should I renew past sorrow for both you and indeed for myself?</p>
      <p>This one thing I cannot keep silent about: when I heard of your supposed death, I was somehow so terrified and almost fainted, and this was because of the Church of Christ, from which I saw all leaders being taken away, that even though I soon learned the rumor was false, I could not quickly and easily regain my composure.</p>
      <p>Now, thanks be to God, I am filled with no less joy for your complete recovery than I was previously filled with sadness and grief over your illness and the false rumor of your death.</p>
      <p>Therefore, that you have recovered so well that you could return to your duties, I congratulate not only you and your church and all the brethren, but I also rejoice for myself.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that you live long for us and for the whole Church of God. As for the fact that I have not performed this duty of mine sooner and have not yet thanked you for your booklet, even if I could offer some excuses, I prefer to use one Christian word: "Forgive" rather than many Ciceronian ones, and thereby often vainly absolve myself from all blame.</p>
      <p>Everything in the booklet pleases me; but your modesty pleases me greatly. What does that other one testify with his insults and barbaric reproaches after his impious doctrine, that he is agitated by furies and perhaps even given over to a reprobate mind? Otherwise, we are all well here, and indeed the plague has long since abated, certainly by the benefit and singular mercy of God. In this small diocese of ours, over one thousand four hundred have died; in Strasbourg, as I have received from letters, up to the beginning of the new year, three hundred over four thousand. Our Ulysses Martinengo suffered gravely from fever almost to the point of death; shortly, as he writes, he will return to us.</p>
      <p>What is being spread about Occhino throughout Italy, you will understand from my relative Lorenzo Limacio. A league has also been reported to have been made between the Pope, the Venetians, the French, the Florentine, and the Ferrara. The Spaniard will undoubtedly be displeased that our people have entered into a league with the French and have rejected him, and that with insult, as I hear, and injury.</p>
      <p>May the Lord therefore guard and preserve His Church. Farewell, most excellent father, and greet the brethren in my name.</p>
      <p>Frederick greets you with the greatest congratulations. Chiavenna, January 20, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours, Zanchi.</p>
      <p>To the most revered father, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
