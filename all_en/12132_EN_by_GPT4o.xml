      <p>Greetings, my venerable and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I commend to you this pious and moderately learned young man of great promise, Konrad Hofherr, so that through your kindness he may comfortably reside there with his wife and little son; he will be supported by the expenses of Jakob Herbrot, the mayor of Augsburg, who will annually spend 80 florins on him, so that he may devote himself entirely to the study of theology and languages; this generosity I have obtained for him from the mayor.</p>
      <p>It seemed better to send him there rather than to Wittenberg or Strasbourg at this time, and for certain and serious reasons.</p>
      <p>He has been moderating the elementary school at Bischofszell for more than two years, as no better condition shone forth from anywhere. To me, the good young man always seemed born for better things than to waste this best age in such a manner. He came to Bischofszell at the time when our dearest Zwick was performing his duties there during the raging plague, and he acted as a deacon to him, visiting and strengthening the dying in the Lord, and even building up the church with his preaching, so that Zwick greatly approved of his talent, which he also highly recommended to me in writing, so that I often and much thought with myself about ways to support his studies, which the Lord has now provided me with his kindness.</p>
      <p>If perhaps there is a village near your city that desires a minister of the word, but one who might preach only once a week and not devote himself entirely to it, I know you would do a worthwhile deed if you assigned this function to Konrad; I earnestly beseech and implore you to do this also for my sake, as much as I can. For it would be beneficial for the man in two ways, since it would greatly contribute to his ability to speak, and also, however little it may be, what will be counted to him for his labor will be an addition to those 80 florins, from which he may be able to purchase books that will be useful to him.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I earnestly ask you to indicate to him some order of studies according to the number and manner of your lectures, so that he may more happily and maturely advance to the fruit we aim for, and also to diligently admonish and rebuke him wherever necessary, and to recall him to the way if he should happen to stray, although there is good hope that his spirit will be the best moderator of himself. Meanwhile, I am rightly concerned, lest what happens to most people happens to him; therefore, I wish you to also be vigilant here, so that the expenses are not in vain.</p>
      <p>I have decided not to write about other matters now, as I do not know when Konrad will depart for there.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, my venerable and dearest brother, and commend me diligently to the Lord with all yours, to whom you will also convey my many greetings in my words.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, February 17. Yours, Amb. Bl.</p>
      <p>What I have written to you, I would like Theodor and Gwalther to also receive as written to them.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most sincere Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>He will follow shortly, if he has not already arrived.</p>
