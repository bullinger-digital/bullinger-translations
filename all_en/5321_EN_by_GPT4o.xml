      <p>Greetings. I do not wish to detain you for long, most learned man, as I know you are greatly burdened with numerous occupations. But because such a certain, though unexpected, messenger presented himself, I did not want him to bring no letters to your kindness. I am pleased with your advice regarding the Strasbourg dispute, and I am also glad that I can show them that I have carried out what was entrusted to me orally and in writing in this matter, so that they see I have neglected nothing and understand your opinion as well; for in these days I am about to write to them.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, [...] Mr. Blaurer sent to me, written by your hand, yet on the condition that I return it to him, not to you; he will receive it on Saturday. If it cannot be done otherwise, I beg you to ensure that we receive necessary information and news of these times through him; do not doubt our loyalty, as long as the spirit governs these limbs, as he used to say. Moreover, Councilor Peyer informed me of the decree of the Swiss Evangelicals regarding the response to be given about the Council of Trent, in which reasons should be included as to why they do not wish to visit it nor should it be visited; this is to be composed by the most honorable magistrate of Zurich with the help of scholars, and then communicated to the Bernese, etc., so that the response of all is similar.</p>
      <p>If this is composed, we do not doubt we will accept it. You will indeed receive the response of the princes and states from the Ulm assembly regarding the same council. May the Lord be with us.</p>
      <p>Supplications are being made here diligently for the Church of Christ in France. The matter is the Lord's; He will direct everything according to the will of His command.</p>
      <p>Our magistrate received writings from Prince Condé yesterday, as did yours; I have not yet read or seen them. Farewell, most kind Mr. Bullinger, with all who love us, whom you will greet in our name. Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, May 14, 1562.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Jakob Rüeger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious, learned, and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother. To Zurich, to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
