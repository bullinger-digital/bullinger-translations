      <p>Greetings. I received your letter dated the last of May through this messenger, from which I understood that your people responded to the proposal and demands and sent a response to the Swiss delegates gathered at the assembly in Baden. I would wish, if it could be done in any way and it would not be burdensome for you, to have your people's response described to me and sent to me, likewise the response of the Swiss delegates, which I now understand is being sent to you. The essence of your response was orally reported by Treasurer Thomann to Mr. Haller, who explained something of it to me; I would prefer to have the response itself.</p>
      <p>As far as I understand, your letters addressed to Treasurer Thomann have not yet been received before he descended to the Swiss assembly; whether he received them afterward, I do not know. When your letters were offered to me, in which you say you are writing to the treasurer, nothing of the sort was attached to them, so I am completely unaware of what has happened with them. It is rightly said that nothing is done correctly in haste; for while I was hurrying to send my last letters to you, I forgot to include a fragment of yours, to assure you that I have communicated with no one and that nothing will arise from them to your peril; now I have included them and I ask that you do not take it badly. More than I would like, forgetfulness creeps upon the old man; I am also vexed by many other matters, so that I am less fortunate in handling affairs; indeed, I feel my strength breaking in such a way that I earnestly wish to be freed by the Lord, whose will may always be done, etc.</p>
      <p>Nothing new is now being reported neither from France nor from Belgium or Germany. It was recently said that the Kingdom of Granada in Spain has again defected from the king and seeks the dominion of the Turks; whether this is true, I cannot easily say. There are those who affirm that even the Pope is included in a pact with the Turk, and they add the Spaniard, who is considering waging war against us; I doubt what I can safely believe. I pray to the Lord to be merciful and gracious to us. In this, farewell with your entire family and brothers, fellow ministers, and friends. I send 3 copies, one for you, one for Mr. Willi, and one for Mr. Campell.</p>
      <p>Consider this well and farewell once again to all.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 5, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and good friend Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
