      <p>May God's grace and mercy preserve us.</p>
      <p>Dear lord and brother, I have received your letter and thanks to God for me. Thank God, may He have mercy on you until the end, etc.</p>
      <p>According to the new news from the Landsgemeinde of Appenzell held on Sunday: The so-called evangelicals have gained more support, thank God. My lords of the five places have written a letter from Einsiedeln to the community, the summary of which is that they earnestly request that in the land of Appenzell, in all church communities (parishes), in each, mass be allowed for those who desire it. It has been clearly decided not to do so, but that they remain as they stood, and as previously accepted by the communities and the great council, etc. Berweger, the honest one, without hypocrisy, God through him, has earnestly and boldly dealt with and challenged the abbot, whose officials have spoken some words of reproach, and the soup eaters among them at the abbot's, have been honestly addressed. Therefore, I do not regret that I have often defended him against Master Haben and others. May God grant that as little falsehood is in many hearts as I hope in him. I also think a preacher from the land, if God wills, will come to the synod to you, etc.</p>
      <p>Oh Bullinger, you know what I have often told you: when the devil acts as if he is brave, to uphold the truth, he is the worst of all. You have now seen this two or three times in difficult situations. All the pious lament and are offended by this. Well, it is over. May the Lord not let us deny Him three times or be put to shame. It is truly necessary to tell Herodians to their face with great seriousness. May God protect us from the hidden pestilence.</p>
      <p>I have not sold anything yet; I do not want to go. I have also remained here unchallenged for as long as God wills. If God wills, I will come, thank, and pay.</p>
      <p>My wife, who is pregnant, thanks you. Also, greet your wife, children, father, Leon, and others for me, etc. May God strengthen you.</p>
      <p>Done in St. Gallen, on the 30th day of April in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Greet Master Kaspar, the faithful, for me.</p>
      <p>Your poor willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my dearly beloved Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, my dear lord and brother.</p>
