      <p>Greetings. These Hungarians are recommended to us by Mr. Beza, and I recommend them to you. They are traveling to you to see or speak with you. It is written from Geneva that the Duke is gathering troops and preparing, and some cavalry have already arrived at Burg in Breisach; where it will lead, no one knows; there is concern about a bad storm, depending on where the Lord's wind may blow. Yesterday, our people returned from Fribourg. What they bring, I do not yet know clearly; for they have not yet presented their actions to the senate. They are waiting for the decision; it should come to them today. However, I understand that Fribourg and Valais are offering themselves, body and goods, to support my lords, should anything happen to them concerning the land. But how they are inclined towards Geneva, I have not yet understood. Also, whether any points or agreements will be established regarding this or not. Otherwise, I have nothing new. Meanwhile, my son has returned and brought me your letters, for which I thank you. I am sending back to you what you sent through him and what you had sent before. In the compendium you recently sent me, the section J is missing, which begins with the syllable -lis; you could obtain this missing part for me from Froschauer, if you please.</p>
      <p>Mr. Steiger and all the brothers send you their diligent greetings; the same do my father-in-law, mother, wife, etc. I also wish health to yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 25, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, always my esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
