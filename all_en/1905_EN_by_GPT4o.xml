      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, I thought it necessary to send back... since I saw that I would hardly return within 15 days. I know how many duties fall upon him, and I do not willingly lack the company of such a dear son of mine; but I would not have him in the place of a son if I valued my own convenience more than his. He will therefore tell you about my condition, and there is no need for me to write, listen to him.</p>
      <p>However, I will say these three things: the Emperor has summoned a diet at Ulm on August 16 and promises to be present in person. The King of the Romans has settled with the Duke completely, more than 20,000 florins will be paid. This journey of mine will be very beneficial to many, especially for the cause of religion to the glory of God.</p>
      <p>I hear that the Pope has honored me greatly; for he has appointed a legate to retreat to the borders of Rhaetia, reside at Novara, and ensure that the republic does not suffer any harm from me. Certainly, he will not fight with me through writings, but will suborn men to deal with me by dagger, gun, or poison.</p>
      <p>But I trust in the Lord; nevertheless, I will go and persevere: may I become a martyr of Jesus Christ; I do not refuse, if it is the will of the Lord. I wish Moleneus would arrive before my departure. Before I leave here, I will certainly meet the prince again and give thanks in your name... for that good man, etc.</p>
      <p>I heard two things here for certain, which delighted me greatly, the first from the Duke: that the Emperor told him he admits he can do nothing more in the cause of the gospel, and that he burdens the consciences of the princes, the second from Brenz: that this Duke needs a bridle more than a spur. What then will he do now after the settlement, that is, after he sees himself truly a Duke without controversy?</p>
      <p>Returning, I hope to come to Zürich; therefore, I reserve the rest for my arrival. Farewell and be well. May the Lord Jesus bless your labors. Amen. Tübingen, June 21, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind about the Catalog to be inscribed for me. I would think it advisable if you made mention of the former one, namely the one that Giovanni della Casa edited. They did not condemn you in this latter one, so as not to have you angry, of course.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, my honorable brother. In Zürich.</p>
