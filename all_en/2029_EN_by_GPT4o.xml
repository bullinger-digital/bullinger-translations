      <p>To the most distinguished syndics and the most honorable senate of the Republic of Geneva, our most esteemed lords, greetings and blessings.</p>
      <p>We have received through this messenger the letters of your eminence along with the book of Servetus and the articles noted from it, with the comparison written by the preachers of your eminence, our venerable and dear brothers, and Michael Servetus. Since your piety has requested that we diligently examine all these things and add our judgment on them, we, complying with your eminence's request, will explain, with as much brevity and clarity as possible, with God's help, what we think and teach about the whole matter of the unity and trinity of God, and finally about the mystery of the Son of God, and what we judge about the controversy or writings of your church's ministers and Servetus.</p>
      <p>We do not doubt that the adorable mystery of the unity and trinity of the blessed God has been firmly believed by all the saints from the beginning of the world and handed down to posterity to be believed, and also clearly related in the scriptures by the true prophets inspired by the Holy Spirit. Therefore, this principle and head of true theology is so confirmed by the oracles of God, so established by evident signs and unanimous consent by the catholic and orthodox church of both the Old and New Testaments, that it has always been judged a sin to even question it. We confess, therefore, with the holy and universal church of God, that there is one essence of God, three distinct persons not confused; for the Father, testifying from heaven about his Son, says: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased;" the Son is he, to whom the Father bore witness; the Holy Spirit indeed appeared in the form of a dove - three distinct persons in one divine essence.</p>
      <p>Indeed, before the Council of Nicaea, Praxeas, Noetus, and Sabellius emerged, called Patripassians by the ancients, who confused the distinction of persons to preserve the unity of God; but they were skillfully and irrefutably refuted by the vigilant leaders of the church, and the adorable mystery of the triune unity of God was defended by the scriptures and preserved in the church. Hence, it is certain that the leaders of the church in the Council of Nicaea handed down to us nothing else in the creed than what the catholic and orthodox church had retained from the times of the apostles, indeed even of the prophets. Therefore, what Servetus the Spaniard calls the coeternal trinity of God a three-headed monster and a certain tripartite Cerberus, finally imaginary gods, illusions, and three spirits of demons, he blasphemes the eternal majesty of God wickedly and horribly. By calling Athanasius, Augustine, and other eminent servants of God and illustrious lights of the church trinitarians and thus atheists (for so he calls all who acknowledge the trinity), he most indignantly slanders not only them but the whole choir of saints and thus the entire church of Christ with unspeakable and intolerable insults.</p>
      <p>It seems truly abominable in this unfortunate man that he excuses the blasphemies of the Jews poured out against the Christian religion and approves and extols the foul words of Muhammad that the three persons in the trinity or, as he says, three gods were unknown to the fathers and are the sons of Beelzebub.</p>
      <p>What more impious thing could have been spewed by this man against God and more unworthy against the undefiled Christian faith? How, I ask, can Christian ears patiently hear these things? Concerning the Son of God, the church of God has consistently believed and taught from the beginning that he subsists from eternity in his own hypostasis; for this it had been taught from the word of God, the Lord himself saying most openly in the gospel: "Before Abraham was, I am," certainly in substance, not indeed of flesh, but of divinity, according to which the apostle said he is the express image of the Father's substance. Where he also cites that testimony from the old scripture: "You are my Son; today I have begotten you." This Son, who is the eternal Son of God, true God, in time became the Son of man, true man, born not from the substance of God the Father, but from the substance of Mary the virgin mother, whom God made fruitful by his Spirit. Hence that Son is called both the blessed seed of the woman and the offspring of David and the Son of man. He remains, however, in one undivided person, yet retaining two natures unmingled or unconfused; divine and human, which is so clearly and evidently confirmed by the testimonies of scripture that it is now and has long been established that whoever doubts it is insane with reason.</p>
      <p>We therefore simply and consistently believe as we have now explained and consistently preach in the church of our faith.</p>
      <p>Again, therefore, Servetus is found to be a blasphemer against the Son of God, who does not hesitate to call that eternal hypostasis of the Son existing and coessential and coequal with the Father a diabolical idea and a certain fabulous chimera. Moreover, he dares to assert that the Father of the corporeal Son is none other than God the Father himself; from whose substance the flesh of the Son was born.</p>
      <p>Paul, the teacher of the Gentiles, taught quite differently, who said that the Son of God was born of the seed of David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God in power and spirit of sanctification, etc. But why should we proceed to recount each of the blasphemous man's errors? The faithful pastors and learned men of your church have diligently and faithfully collected several of this man's enormous errors and open heresies in that writing, to which they have prefixed the title: Sentences or propositions excerpted from the books of Michael Servetus. We do not find them excerpted or noted by calumny nor do we receive or approve them in any way, but rather we execrate them.</p>
      <p>For Servetus, in his response soon appended, entangles the matter, not explaining it, meanwhile corrupting many of the ancient opinions about the unity and trinity of God and the mystery of the Son of God, which the ministers of the church have sufficiently openly refuted with an opposing response. The reply or scholia of Servetus, besides extreme impudence and dire insults, have little or nothing. For he so often hurls that accusation of his: "You lie, Calvin," so often accuses him of being a magician and Simon Magus, that it is tiresome and shameful to remember, especially since the matter itself cries out and the carefully weighed writings of Servetus testify that Calvin invented nothing, but Servetus rather denies again what he said and colors it with some deceit.</p>
      <p>We hope that the faith and diligence of Calvin, your pastor and our brother, and his outstanding and pious merits towards exiles and the pious are more illustrious than can be obscured by these most unworthy accusations either with your eminence or with other good men. Nor does your eminence conceal this, which (not without joy of mind we read) clearly signifies in written letters that it does not require judgment from us because it distrusts the ministers of your church, but rather so that it may not be unaware of our opinion on these matters.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, how your eminence should restrain this man, who renews heresies once convicted and condemned by the church through the scriptures and attacks the firm heads of our faith and by attacking slanders its saints, we leave to your prudence to consider. If the similarity of the name does not deceive us, this Servetus stirred up this great evil twenty years ago when the blessed memory of Lord Johannes Oecolampadius was trying to bring him back to the way, and then also the doctrine of Servetus was condemned by those who first preached the gospel of Christ in these regions. Yet he, tenacious of his opinion, nevertheless in 1531 took care to have seven books on the errors of the trinity and some other dialogues printed in Germany, by which it is not doubtful that many little exercised in the scriptures and weaker in faith were precipitated into grave danger both of souls and bodies. Yet he was not so satisfied that now, with his most pestilent errors and intolerable blasphemies republished, he proceeds to surpass himself in impiety and blasphemy and to impose his most corrupt doctrine under the guise of restoring Christianity to the church.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we judge that much faith and diligence is needed against this, especially since our churches are ill-spoken of among foreigners, as if they were heretical and favored heretics.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the holy providence of God has now offered an opportunity to purge both you and us from the evil suspicion of this evil, if you are vigilant and diligently take care that the contagion of this poison does not spread more widely through this, which we do not doubt your eminence will do.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ grant your piety wisdom and strength, the way, reason, and just manner of doing his will to the glory of his name and to the sincere faith and faithful preservation of the church. At the same time, we offer our services to your eminence and commend ourselves to the same. Moreover, we have detained this your messenger for three whole days because we could not explain ourselves sooner.</p>
      <p>Given in ZÃ¼rich on the 2nd of October in the year 1553.</p>
