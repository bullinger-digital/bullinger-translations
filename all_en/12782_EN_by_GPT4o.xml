    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] After everything has turned so quickly for the worse, Burcher can no longer remain silent and wants to inform Bullinger of the disaster that is about to befall the Church of Germany. Today, [Christopher Mont], the envoy of the English King [Henry VIII], arrived in Strasbourg. He had left the Emperor [Charles V] and his camp near Heilbronn (in Württemberg) the day before. He reported that the Emperor was quite encouraged and happy by his victory. He also heard the Emperor tell the councilors of the surrendering cities: "Even if you are 'rebels,' I will prove how magnanimous I am!" However, he did not address the religious matter and only imposed a fine on the cities, which is quite clever and in line with his character. Should he subdue all of Germany, his cunning will become apparent to all. Meanwhile, the entire region around Strasbourg fears him, as a siege of the city seems likely to everyone. Also, [Maximilian von Egmont], Count of Buren, has occupied a small town near Frankfurt called Bermstat [correct: Darmstadt].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] From England, however, [Mont] conveyed news that is as pleasing as the previous ones are sad. [Thomas Howard], Duke of Norfolk, a bitter opponent of the Word of God, and his son [Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey], have been imprisoned for attempting to restore the papacy and monasticism. It remains only to hope that [Stephen Gardiner, Bishop] of Winchester, will also be arrested. For only then could the Gospel be reestablished. May the Lord protect His oppressed Church!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] From Strasbourg, Burcher will head directly towards the [North] Sea. He has written to his wife [Adelheit Knüpli]. Bullinger should support her during Burcher's absence.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Richard [Hilles] and his wife [Anna, née Lacey] send their regards to Bullinger and his wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler]. About six weeks ago, a daughter was born to them. The mother has already recovered.</p>

      <p>Greetings in [Christ] Jesus! After such a sudden change for the worse has occurred, I could not refrain from sharing with you, Bullinger, my dearest friend and lord, the evils that threaten the German Church. Today, the royal envoy of England arrived in Strasbourg, who left the imperial camp and Emperor [Charles V] at Heilbronn in Württemberg the day before these were written. He reports that the Emperor is remarkably elated by his victory and unusually cheerful; for he heard him call those who surrendered themselves 'rebels.' "Even if," he says, "you are rebels, I will show how merciful I am." These were the words of the Emperor to the magistrates of some city that surrendered. He adds that the Emperor did not speak a word about religion and only imposed a monetary fine on them, cleverly, so as not to appear contradictory. But if he is allowed to overcome all of Germany, he will undoubtedly show how cunning he is. Meanwhile, fear of him has invaded this entire land surrounding Strasbourg, and this city expects nothing but a siege. Also, Count [Maximilian von Egmont] of Buren has occupied a small town near Frankfurt, called Bermstat, if I am not mistaken. These are the matters concerning Germany.</p>

      <p>From England, the envoy brings news as pleasing as these are sad; namely, there was a certain duke, whose command extended to the north of England, commonly called the Duke of Norfolk, a most bitter enemy of the Word of God, who was attempting with his son and others to secretly restore the kingdom of the pope and monks. But their plan is exposed, and the duke with his son is imprisoned. Nothing remains but one from Winchester, who, unless he is also captured, the evangelical cause cannot be restored. Let us therefore pray to the Lord to protect His oppressed Church everywhere. I thought it necessary to write this to you.</p>

      <p>I will head directly from here, with the lord duke, towards the sea. Farewell. I have written to my wife, whom I beg you to comfort and advise in my absence. Strasbourg, the day before the Kalends of January 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Burcher, the Englishman.</p>

      <p>Mr. Richard with his wife sends many greetings to you and your spouse. About six weeks ago, they received a daughter, and she has recovered from childbirth.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his dearest friend and lord. In Zurich.</p>
