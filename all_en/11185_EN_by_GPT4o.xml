      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I see that there is no occasion left for us to write to each other, now that Bucer has begun to remain somewhat calm, and certainly this silence is fortunate. I wish that we do not fall back into these miserable conflicts for any reason!</p>
      <p>Indeed, I have nothing else to write except what I have written to Pellicanus about the Hebrew, whom I also commend to you. For unless I am completely mistaken, he is steadfast in the faith of Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell with perpetual health along with your mother, wife, children, and all good people. July 7, 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
