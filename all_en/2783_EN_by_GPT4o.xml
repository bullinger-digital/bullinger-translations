      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Most revered (in Christ), as I have often thought of writing to you over these past few months, nothing has come to mind that seemed worthy of being committed to writing, because various [Greek] rumors were being spread. But now it is certain that the bitter scourge of divine justice has been removed from this life, a man in our memory most cruel and most thirsty for the blood of the saints. Although our sins had deserved such great evil and a more severe judgment because of the lethargy and [Greek] which had largely pervaded our homeland, when the free course of the gospel was granted; yet our heavenly Father and the same almighty God has shown His kindness and power as He usually does. The illustrious pair, Dr. Ridley and Dr. Latimer, a little before offered themselves to God as a remarkable and excellent sacrifice; whose ashes and those of others, who departed before and live with our Lord and Savior, I think have invoked God's judgment on the aforementioned scourge of God. We have no other certain or explored matters (as far as I know at present) worthy of you. Moreover, I think you have already been informed of the aforementioned matters more fully or have known them before by others; yet I also thought it was my duty to write to you about the same; for it seems to me a long time since I have conversed with you. Please convey my greetings to Dr. Gesner. Remember me in your prayers and the condition of our homeland: which I do not doubt you do. May God be with you and your ministry, and preserve you for the benefit of His church.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, December 7, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, James Haddon.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and most revered in Christ father, Dr. Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
