      <p>There is no plague among us.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, some people from Falkenstein (if I am not mistaken) came to us here in Lucerne, and another from Uri, who are said to have withdrawn because of the plague. But the episcopal plague is more harmful than any plague, threatening many evils to both the church and the republic, unless God mercifully looks upon us.</p>
      <p>I would never have believed that our bishopric was of such concern to foreign princes and even the Five Cantons (Quinquepagici).</p>
      <p>Nothing has been decided in Rome, as far as I know.</p>
      <p>At home, everything is divided into factions, and those cannot be healed, about which I wrote to you before.</p>
      <p>I would believe this cause to be underlying, that they have made not small expenses and provided funds, which they fear to be frustrated unless the business succeeds according to their mind. The expenses are very great.</p>
      <p>But the other is poor; therefore, he needs patrons. Meanwhile, the remaining canons place all their hope in the Five Cantons and do not keep this secret, but openly profess it.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we present ourselves as spectators of this tragedy, some even as actors. Thus, if God punishes us, the beginning of the evil is from ourselves.</p>
      <p>Wiser counsels have a place among few.</p>
      <p>However, because I advised our senate to be quiet, and by that name, the faction of Beatus fell from great hope and support, which had placed all its strength in the people of Chur, they hate me beyond measure, but through no fault of mine, who preserved the city on that day by the singular grace of God, when I broke their furious attempts, who thought the fortress should be stormed and the envoys of the House of God expelled, and the Saliceans and the rest of that faction's men should be slaughtered. If their plan had taken place, Chur would now be overthrown.</p>
      <p>Thus, for this singular benefit, they return this favor to me, for no other reason, indeed, than that they see their plans hindered by this very thing.</p>
      <p>He, who recently returned from the French legation, with whom I have scarcely used a more friendly man before, and who, when departing, had promised golden mountains, scarcely deigns to return a greeting when greeted.</p>
      <p>And yet this is the one who, with the previous bishop scarcely dead, certainly not yet buried, came to me panting, asked that I be an advocate to our people, that no more bishops be elected; in this, he would put all his effort with me and had good hope that it could be obtained; he dispelled all difficulties, etc.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, I found out that a few days later, he showed himself to be the leader of this faction of Beatus. All this without my knowledge.</p>
      <p>He himself departed to France, now, when he returns and sees the business having fallen out otherwise than he thought, he reveals what he was, who would have otherwise remained hidden. Here you can easily see with whom I have business, and I believe nothing plainly, except what I see and have explored, in such great perfidy of many. - I always stand firm in the same opinion as from the beginning; I focus on this, that, if it can be done without disturbance and sedition, the bishopric be abolished; if not, I choose the lesser of two evils and that which is least opposed to the good of the church and the liberty of the fatherland.</p>
      <p>Certainly, how pernicious bishops are and how clandestine their plans against the fatherland are, I now plainly know. How truly that one, who is deceased, was a great scoundrel! He imposed upon us shamefully, unless he was perhaps a very vain man and laughed at both religions, which I could easily believe.</p>
      <p>Most of his writings or at least the principal ones, which pertain to the reason of the Council of Trent, have come into my hands; on what occasion, there is no need to say.</p>
      <p>I have them, indeed, in the bishop's own hand; for he entrusted these to no one, but wrote them himself. I have not a few letters of the Hermit Abbot Joachim written to our man from Trent, to which he responded to everything; for, as you know, our man used that Joachim as a procurator. Here you would see many things.</p>
      <p>There are also letters which he wrote to Cardinal Borromeo, which also contain many things against the Confederation and religion. He never mentions the Rhaetians except by the name of a depraved nation; he writes that he is placed in the midst of wolves.</p>
      <p>I will not produce these letters until the matter has come to the last resort, so that the Rhaetians may understand what is finally to be expected from these traitors to the fatherland, and there is still some hope that this bishopric can be destroyed. This I can affirm to you for certain and ascertained: Cardinal Emsense is working so that, whoever is chosen by the pope, he himself may be assigned as coadjutor to him. The Bishop of Como also wrote and took care to write to both and desires this dispute to be deposited with him as an arbiter.</p>
      <p>He adds that in Valais likewise two are disputing about the bishopric and that he was sent there by the pope to choose the more worthy. He inclines to the side of Beatus and urges Saliceus to consult for peace now that he is old and retired. What the other replied, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Saliceus replied that this whole dispute pertains to no others than the House of God; he rests in its faith and it is not in his power to refer these things to foreign judges, etc. But why do I trouble you? Certainly, I would like you at least to estimate the lion from its claws.</p>
      <p>You can think about the dangers in which I am involved. But I dare to affirm that in all Rhaetia there are scarcely 4 who understand this; for these things are secretly handled among them.</p>
      <p>Unless Castelmur, who is the bishop's secretary, informed me about these things, it would be impossible to suspect.</p>
      <p>Each faction conceals its plans from the other so studiously that nothing reaches the public.</p>
      <p>I commend my business to you as a father.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that the business of our bishops is also being handled there; for Lusius advocated the cause of Beatus in Rome.</p>
      <p>Chur, September 3, 1565.</p>
