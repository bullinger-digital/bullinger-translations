      <p>Greetings. We send to you, honorable lords and dearest brothers, our beloved brother and faithful colleague, Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, who will faithfully explain to you our plan and intention, and this not without the consent of our most honorable magistrate. We commend him to you as faithfully as we can and beseech your piety and kindness through our Lord, that you may conduct yourselves in this matter as befits faithful ministers and diligent seekers of concord and simple truth of God and the churches. This will, God willing, be a bond by which we will be mutually bound in love and friendship, never to be broken at any time. All suspicions will cease, and the way will be closed to future disputes and dissensions. Love us, your most loving brothers. Live in Christ and farewell; pray for us to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 13th of February, 1566. Yours sincerely, Heinrich Bullinger, on behalf of all pastors, preachers, and professors, ministers of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>"To the ministers of the churches of Basel, Schaffhausen, and Mulhouse."</p>
