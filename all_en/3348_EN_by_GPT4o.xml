      <p>Thomas Lever, etc.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace in Christ Jesus! While others are accustomed to dedicate their writings to princes and great men, in order to gain favor with many or to be rewarded with the most ample gifts, you alone, most illustrious man, have chosen us, the poor exiled outcasts, to whom you dedicate your vigils and studies, whom you adorn with your sermons, and make our condition (if we look at the world, miserable, if at Him to whom we have wholly consecrated ourselves, the glorious cross of Christ) memorable to all posterity. Why you do this, we can wonder no less than conjecture.</p>
      <p>For we are almost all unknown to you, and we have nothing to repay you. But this is your zeal for the house of the Lord, that you not only diligently feed your flock, over which the Lord has appointed you, instruct all other churches with your learned commentaries, but also lighten our exile, by which we are deserted by our own, mocked by many, expelled by some, and cut down by the reproaches and curses of very many, with your learned sermons, so that we, pressed by these evils, may not succumb, and as a good shepherd you care for us scattered sheep, strengthen and confirm us.</p>
      <p>We therefore receive the royal gift, and embrace it with the spirit that is fitting; we send in return, what we alone can, thanks, namely a benevolent spirit, and frequent mention of you, our teacher, in our prayers. For the divine gift, the honorarium, and what no age will bury in oblivion, accept this perishable paper filled with immortal thanks: and whenever we take your book into our hands, we will seem to hear you preaching, or rather the Lord Himself revealing His mysteries to us through your ministry. Farewell, in Christ, dearest father and most esteemed lord, and pursue us miserable exiles always with the love you are accustomed to: for by your kindness we feel today, but not alone, how true it is, as so many histories testify, that the Swiss have always been hospitable. Therefore, continue with your tireless labors and vigils to build the church of the Lord, commend us to your Swiss, and let no opportunity of doing good to the wretched pass by.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus preserve you long for the use of His church. Amen.</p>
      <p>In Aarau, October 5, 1557.</p>
      <p>The English exile church in Aarau, most devoted to you in the Lord, has made the following subscribe in the name of all the rest.</p>
      <p>Thomas Lever, Richard Lant, Robert Pownall, Walter Kelley, John Prety, Thomas Turpin, Thomas Allen</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most learned and pious man, most vigilant pastor of the church of Christ. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
