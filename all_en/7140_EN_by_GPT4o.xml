      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I returned safe and sound with my family by the grace of God from Bad Pf√§fers. There, your letters were delivered to me, from which I felt no small amount of sorrow, as I saw that the matter I had entrusted to you, concerning Mr. Zanchi, was not settled as I had hoped. Rhaetia does not have many like Zanchi; therefore, if the brothers let him go, they will see how to repair their loss. Perhaps the Lord will still grant that the disagreement be amicably settled and Zanchi restored. May the Lord provide help! As you will see in the attached letters, we are asked to pursue peace through the princes. We would gladly hear what you think. For we refer these matters to you as well, as partners in the same confession with us. The Church of the Belgians is greatly afflicted; therefore, the situation demands that we pray to the Lord for it. Various reports are circulating about the Spanish and Italian army, which has been gathered in Milan and Piedmont. Some think it is to be led against the Belgians, others against Geneva. There are those who affirm that, at the instigation of the Pope, the Emperor, the Kings of France and Spain, the Princes of Italy, bishops, and prelates have conspired for our destruction and that of all who believe in the word of Christ. We must pray to the Lord to have mercy on His own.</p>
      <p>Farewell, esteemed and beloved lord and brother. I am briefer than I would like because I am distracted by various affairs.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 4, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful pastor of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
