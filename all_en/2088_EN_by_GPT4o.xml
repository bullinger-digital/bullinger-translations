      <p>Greetings. I am indeed very ashamed, most excellent and sincerely esteemed brothers, that while recently our council was troublesome to you in the case of Servetus, it now again presents a new matter.</p>
      <p>However, there is some just excuse for this matter. For since the wickedness of some boasts more fiercely than those who think rightly and piously can resist, they are compelled to seek assistance from you. Indeed, as much as I wish to spare you, I did not think it should be neglected in such a necessity. Since I returned to this church, the form of discipline, if not perfect and as it should be desired, at least tolerable, has prevailed.</p>
      <p>For a consistory was established to preside over the governance of morals. There is no civil jurisdiction in it, but only reproofs from the word of the Lord: the ultimate punishment being excommunication. Among other struggles, which the ministers of Satan have continually stirred against us for three years, we were violently exercised by this, that a certain shameless scoundrel, attempting to rush to the sacred table against the judgment of the church, when he saw us steadfastly resisting his fury, filled the city with great tumult. Nor was this difficult for him, since he was chosen by the faction of the impious to act out this play. And because he not only had the same patrons, who were not ashamed to loudly defend the cause of Servetus, but also companions and authors, it was achieved with great contention and indeed intemperance by them that the greater council suddenly overturned the order of the church that had been received and maintained until now. We resisted again. Those who had erred decided that advice should be sought from the Swiss churches. Although it is not written to you, since it is certain that the response of your most illustrious council will be only according to your opinion, I thought it right to warn and ask you in time. And the best man, and especially wise, and my uniquely beloved brother, Mr. Johannes Budaeus, willingly undertook this journey, full of labor and trouble, in the name of the church. Therefore, first of all, I beseech you in the name of Christ, to consider that you have not some ordinary business to handle, but that consultation is being held about the entire state of this church.</p>
      <p>For I consider it to be of treacherous cowardice, as long as I sustain this role, not to fight vigorously to the end for holy and legitimate discipline, I have decided rather to leave life a hundred times, let alone this place, than to allow what I know well to be taken from the word of God to be impiously undermined. Not everyone today feels the same about excommunication. Nor am I unaware that there are pious and learned men, to whom excommunication does not seem necessary under Christian princes.</p>
      <p>But I trust there will be no one of sound mind and right study who disapproves of its use. Certainly, Christ's doctrine is not obscure to me. If it cannot be obtained from the people that they take up this yoke of Christ, after the pastors have strenuously insisted on it, their situation is different from ours. For it would be too shameful for the building which Christ committed to us to be defended, to be destroyed and overturned while we are alive and seeing. Nor do I fear that you will condemn my zeal too stubbornly, when the method we have followed so far is understood, and what the impious are trying to take from us.</p>
      <p>But if it will be clear to you that nothing is contained in it except what is consistent with the pure doctrine of Christ, I beseech you to ensure that your most illustrious council testifies the same. For it is especially important that our people understand that the novelty they aspire to cannot be achieved without departing from the rule of Christ, or, if this seems too harsh, without deviating. It remains for Mr. Budaeus to explain to you in person what cannot be conveniently included in letters. The Lord will be a witness from heaven to me and my colleagues, that nothing has been omitted by wicked men for four years to gradually ruin the moderate state of this church.</p>
      <p>I have perceived their clandestine machinations from the beginning. But I have nothing to say, except that the Lord was preparing scourges before our eyes, to recall us to Himself by instilling fear. But because we were deaf and blind, there was no place for remedy. For two years now, our condition has been no different than if we had to deal with professed enemies of the gospel. Now the final act is being played. For having obtained many victories, the enemies of the gospel are thinking of holding a magnificent triumph over Christ and His doctrine and ministers, and finally over all His members. I refrain from saying how inhumanely, insultingly, and barbarously they have harassed the exiles of Christ, whom they had received into their protection. How peacefully, modestly, and patiently they have swallowed all indignities, when they had a refuge at hand, not even the authors of the injuries can deny. Now wickedness has reached its height, so that, with all shame cast aside, they obstinately desire to turn the temple of the Lord into a brothel. And to let you know how foul the deformity is, when our brother Farellus was recently here, to whom they owe themselves entirely, as you well know, and he freely admonished them by his right, such fury flared up against him that they did not hesitate to threaten him with a capital judgment. I know indeed it should not seem new if factious men are found in a free city who stir up disturbances. But the blindness of our council is to be deplored, that it demanded from the people of Neuchâtel that the father of their liberty and the father of this church be sent to them as a defendant in a capital case. I am forced to bring forth the disgrace of this city, which I would wish to erase with my blood. Farellus came: before he had entered the city, a senate apparitor announced at my house that he should not ascend the pulpit. I do not pursue the rest: because it is enough to have given a taste of their ingratitude, which will rightly move the stomach of all good and noble men. But since many causes prevent me from openly lamenting our evils, take this briefly: unless Satan is restrained by you, he will be given free rein. Therefore, it is fitting for you to strive as if the state of this church were in your hand. Nor will it be due to our stubbornness that we would rather yield the place than the opinion. For all good men know that, to meet the disturbances, we have been more than sufficiently flexible so far: although it was by no means doubtful that our patience was being tested by the wicked. But it is not permissible to hand over this victory to them, without knowingly and willingly betraying the entire right of the church: not only because the authority of our ministry will perish, but because the name of Christ will be subjected to the most foul reproaches, the unrestrained license of all evils will become more and more insolent, the condition of the pious will not only be exposed to all injuries but will lie miserably afflicted. Therefore, I am more certain that it will be of concern to you, that by your support those who are faithful here may worship God more peacefully. Farewell, most excellent and truly esteemed brothers. May the Lord be with you, guide you, and supply you with prudence; which may suffice not only for the defense of your church but also for supporting others. Farewell, distinguished men and truly esteemed brothers; may the Lord always be with you, guide and protect you.</p>
      <p>Geneva, November 26, 1553. My colleagues diligently greet you and commend this church to your faith and prudence as earnestly as they can.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>It will be expedient to suppress these letters, at least so that the rumor does not reach our people.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished men and excellent ministers of Christ, pastors and teachers of the church of Zürich, brothers and fellow ministers.</p>
