      <p>Peace and joy, gracious, dear lord and patron.</p>
      <p>On the 5th of July, I received the matter at night and on the 6th of July, at an earlier time of day, personally carried it to Sion, handing it over to Bartmann. He consulted with the young lords and instructed me to write to you; once the matter is completed, he, Bartmann, will write to you himself and let you know how it has been settled. I further asked him about any new developments and the state of peace. He replied that nothing had yet been written to them by the princes about it. They are also waiting daily for both or all three princes. However, others had come from the camp, telling them that on the next Thursday afternoon, peace had been declared and the soldiers dismissed. It was announced that on both sides, the prisoners would be released, all war matters and disputes would be settled, and everyone on both sides should remain with their own and be left in peace. However, how much money the king has to pay, I do not know. 12 tons have been demanded, etc. You will receive a full report on this later. Those from Stockach captured a messenger of the duke, stretched and beheaded him. But I do not know what they were told. They, whatever is notable, have fled from the city. The two princes have the camp from Ehingen up to Salmaschwiler in three groups. They, however, are camped by Riedlingen in two villages, namely Unlingen and Tagendorf. There is a rumor on the mountain that the landgrave wants to depart and ride home to give the bishop of Mainz a prelude of some claim (demand, ownership claims). Bartmann has been told that the evangelical cities have sent a message to Ferdinand, asking him to protect their faith, or they will seek another protector; however, they offer to stand by what can be defended with God's word. Also, the bishop of Constance has sent some artillery to the princes. Furthermore, Brunswick has sent 700 horses within eight days, and many other horses and foot soldiers have come. Additionally, the landgrave has two preachers with him. One is the reader, the other the supervisor. Bartmann has boldly wished for a meeting with them and you and others. He does not fear them at all, rejoices confidently in the simple truth. However, as he says, no one should worry that the prince or duke intends to establish the Lutheran view of the Lord's Supper in his land, etc.</p>
      <p>This is what I have been able to learn at this time. Bartmann will report further to you himself. Farewell, and if I can serve you, do not spare me; for, as I owe it to you, I will always do it loyally and willingly.</p>
      <p>At Stein, 7th of July.</p>
      <p>Your willing Georg Wimpfer.</p>
      <p>To the pious and venerable lord M. Heinrich Bullinger, his gracious and dear patron.</p>
