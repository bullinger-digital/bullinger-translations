      <p> Greetings. The noble Lord Odoardo, Count of Thiene, who currently resides in Patern√≤, has recommended to me this brother, Mr. Jacobus Philippus, an Italian, hoping that a place might be given to him among us to profess philosophy. However, this hope was in vain. We have an abundance of professors, and we also have an abundance of the poor. Therefore, we have provided him with travel funds to set out for the Valtellina Valley. If, therefore, any ecclesiastical function could be assigned to him there, he would undoubtedly perform the duty of a pious pastor; for he has a good testimony from the people of Geneva, so there is no fear that he is infected with heresies, as many Italians are. Therefore, if you can help him, help him for the sake of the Lord. I received your letters along with those of our Lentulus, truly remarkable and containing remarkable things about the Venetians and Turks; I have kept them with your kind permission. From them, I understood that the Turks continue the war against the Spanish by sea. If you receive anything further about this, I pray you will be kind enough to share it. Eight days ago, I informed you in my letters of the cost of printing Mr. Lentulus's book, 70 of our gold coins. </p>
      <p> And as you wish to know: our Haller has returned safely and soundly from Baden with all his family, indeed 14 days ago. You will do me a favor if you continue to inform me of what is decided by the newly appointed judges, and send what you promise to send about what has been done and written. And for your labors, I thank you. Greet all our people, whose names you know. </p>
      <p> Yesterday, I received a letter from Nuremberg, dated July 24, stating that on July 10 (as was written from Antwerp by the papists), the people of Utrecht wanted to supply Haarlem; they were defeated, having lost 8 companies, 10 cannons, and 300 supply wagons, and were in distress for supplies with Haarlem. Also, the Poles have sent messengers, 300 splendidly armored messengers, to the Elector in Leipzig, to obtain passage for their newly elected king. However, by the emperor's command, these messengers were forbidden and arrested, etc. What will come of this, one cannot know. May God send everything for the best. Everything everywhere is turning to much misfortune. May God have mercy on us! etc. </p>
      <p> The Lord be with you and with all your family, our brothers, and all our friends. </p>
      <p> Zurich, the last day of July 1573. </p>
      <p> Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable and dearest lord and brother. </p>
      <p> Chur. </p>
