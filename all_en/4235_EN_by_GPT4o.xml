      <p>Grace and peace through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>After the truth of the gospel shone upon us by the grace of God, Satan, with all his might, does not cease to obscure it and disturb it with many scandals, so that what he cannot achieve through false prophets, he tries to overturn through the many offenses he incites. However, knowing that you, brothers, are the most faithful ministers of Jesus Christ, well-disposed towards us and our churches, and no less cautious of the evils that arise in our churches than those in yours, we turn to you, whose name is renowned among the pious everywhere and feared by the impious or at least the hypocrites, so that you may also prescribe your opinion on this matter to us. We do not doubt that it will serve to condemn the obstinate or at least serve as a more severe rebuke to them among all good people. A controversy has arisen among some regarding the children they begot before the marriage was confirmed, with the same women from whom they received them, whether they should be considered legitimate or illegitimate after the marriage contract. Whether the judgment of the parents should stand, who, after the marriage is entered into, consider them legitimate and assign their goods to them. If they are legitimate, the goods should rightfully pass to them; if they are not legitimate, even if called legitimate by the parents, should the will of the parents be violated, who wish them to be heirs of all goods and testify to this in a public document.</p>
      <p>There are diverse opinions here.</p>
      <p>Some say that if conceived before the marriage is confirmed and born in the contracted marriage, they are considered legitimate with the consent of their parents. Whether those born before the marriage is confirmed can be considered illegitimate, after the marriage is confirmed and by the consent of both are considered legitimate? They say that conceiving before marriage and being born before marriage makes little difference. They also contend about the wives of those who, after having either fornicated or committed adultery with them, take them in marriage, whether they should be considered legitimate wives when they are publicly or by inscription or even testimony received by their husbands as wives. Some also raise the question about the plague.</p>
      <p>Whether it is permissible without sin for a pious man, not having a public office calling in the churches and also not feeling any inner calling of the spirit, to depart? We respond that it is permissible, for the Lord is tempted by such, when the means shown by Him are recklessly discarded, just as a sick person would tempt the doctor by rejecting medicine, a hungry person food, a captive the offered escape, so one situated in the plague would recklessly wish to be preserved by a miracle without cause, when he can be preserved through means. We should not expose our lives for our private gain, unless it is for the glory of God or the salvation of ourselves and our neighbors. Not every flight from public calamities sent by the Lord is a sin, as examples testify. In summary, we embrace the opinion of the most illustrious man, Lord Wolfgang Musculus [in Psalm 86], who has served our church excellently, we only add that not all sin by fleeing, some due to weakness of faith, some so as not to tempt the Lord, and we say this so that sin is not established where it is not, and so that one does not judge another, but each judges themselves in their consciences, whether they act out of weakness. Otherwise, if they sinned here, all who guard themselves from the plague would sin, and those who, by the example of the law of God enacted for the separation of lepers, consider private houses as pestilential, as we know to be the case in Geneva, Venice, and elsewhere. Although we all recognize that we owe mutual love, where those are appointed who serve in the plague, such as the presbyters of the church or any other brothers, this unnecessary love is not required from each brother or the whole church, just as God did not require that all serve the lepers separated from men, even if this love of the second table required it from all. This love would also be unnecessary if, with others serving and providing everything, someone, at the risk of their life, inserts themselves where they can add no more benefit. This thus far.</p>
      <p>Stancarus, the new Nestorius, as you have received in writing before, continues to disturb our churches, calling us Arians because we establish Christ as mediator in both natures. For if He is a mediator in divinity, He must be considered lesser than the one to whom He mediates; if He intercedes, prays as God, He is lesser, he says, to whom He prays. But εντυγχανειν or to intercede, as Scripture speaks everywhere, is not to be inferior or to lower oneself as a supplicant in the manner of men, but to protect us with His advocacy, to defend with dignity, and to stand for us, just as when a king receives someone to be protected, he no longer prays as a supplicant for him nor does he divest himself of the kingdom nor is he lesser than he was before he received someone to be protected, as they say, who always thunder their praying. It would be fitting for someone learned to respond to him and publish a writing with the subscriptions of all churches. For that impious man, with your letters sent to us on this matter, as if by us falsely, discredits all faith. He also raises a controversy about to whom He is a mediator.</p>
      <p>Stancarus says that the man Christ mediates to the Trinity, most say only to the Father according to that, we have access to the Father through Christ, we have an advocate with the Father, Christ, no one comes to the Father except through Christ, He says He will ask the Father, where we see mention made only of the Father. We desire to be taught by you on this matter, dearest men and brothers to be respected by us in the Lord, and we await a response. May the Lord guide you with His Holy Spirit, protect your churches for His glory.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Cracow, March 19, 1560.</p>
      <p>Felix Cruciger, Superintendent of the Churches of Lesser Poland. To the most illustrious and learned men, the pastors and professors of the Church of Zurich, most respected lords and brothers. In Zurich.</p>
