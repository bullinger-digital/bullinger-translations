      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, our most illustrious prince received Mr. Gribaldo with the clemency I hoped for, appointed him as his advisor, and made him a professor at the University of Tübingen with an honorable stipend. Therefore, he happily returns to you, to go home, and will come here within 4 weeks. Praise the Lord. I am glad to have brought such a man and, as it were, such a prize with me into the duchy. Now listen to the news: wise men believe that there will be no peace. The womb of Mary, the Queen of England, has turned to wind. Philip is writing to gather soldiers through Germany, they think, to bring them to England.</p>
      <p>The King of Poland is holding a diet in Kraków, where we hope he will accept our reforms; his consort favors it, even though she is the daughter of Ferdinand. I took her from the sacred font, so let it be an omen of a change of religion in her. See in these letters of the Saxon elector's envoy what is happening at the diet. The Theatine was closer to the seat of the antichrist, than whom, except for the deceased Marcellus, no one in the whole world is more hostile to the gospel; he was once from that sect, which they call the Jesuits, worthy indeed to sit there.</p>
      <p>The Turkish fleet has returned, having heard about peace negotiations among Christians. There is a rumor that Maximilian, King of Bohemia, has communicated under both kinds; certainly, Mr. Ludwig Grempius, a jurist returning to Augsburg, confirmed to me that his father was indeed angry and immediately sent the Bishop of Laibach to his son. He will be removed by the Spaniards if he has done this.</p>
      <p>You know what I said to you on that matter of great importance, namely that you are not excluded from friendship, etc., nor is any inconvenience being prepared against you. When I recited these things, what I said, I confirmed, and they even praised me. Therefore, cast off all anxiety.</p>
      <p>If you have anything in return, H. Bullinger, inform me; for Mr. Gribaldo has been given a guide and will bring your letters to me upon his return. I commend to you and to all my Locarnese brothers; I will certainly consider it bestowed upon me, whatever services you confer upon them.</p>
      <p>I beg you to do something against P. a Soto; take up one or two articles, especially about traditions, and treat them.</p>
      <p>You will indeed help the church, but you can please our prince in no way more. Who knows what many good things may arise from this thereafter.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to Mr. Consul, your sons-in-law, and all the fellow members; pray for me. Stuttgart, the day before the calends of June 1555.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>Share the news with Dr. Martin Muralto.</p>
