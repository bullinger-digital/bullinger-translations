      <p>To Erastus.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Your letter greatly disturbed me, most honorable lord and dearest brother in Christ. For I greatly fear that something bad may happen to the most illustrious and best prince from not very well-considered advice.</p>
      <p>Since he has been abundantly warned about this matter before, what remains is that we commend everything to the Lord, praying diligently that He, in His mercy, may direct all things to a good end for the glory of His name and the salvation of His faithful. Otherwise, I have no doubt that the best prince will immediately experience what all others have who have rolled this stone. Events will teach much.</p>
      <p>It also greatly pains my mind that you two, you and Beza, are in conflict with each other.</p>
      <p>Having experienced it, I know what the fervor of disputation can do. We are human; always something human, indeed very much, intervenes even in the fights of those who are otherwise the best and most modest. I know that both are vehement. Therefore, what I asked long ago, I now repeat: with passions restrained and eyes turned away from the person, handle and consider the cause itself with a moderate mind, and remember that Beza is our brother, a pious and learned man through whom the Lord has done many excellent things. Also, my brother, be careful that our writings are not spread, lest a private matter becomes a public conflagration. I have also written to you about this matter; for I think we must diligently watch that peace, as much as it can be, is preserved in the church, that the way to disputes is blocked, and that we do not give our enemies a reason to rejoice over our conflicts and wound the minds of the weak by offending them.</p>
      <p>I sincerely pray to the Lord that, having mercy on us, He may quell all dissensions and grant concord and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell. ZÃ¼rich, 15.12.1569.</p>
