      <p>I cannot but thank you, most learned Heinrich, for having worked so much on my behalf. However, if my learning, which is indeed nonexistent, had been more known to you, you would not have appointed me to this position. Nevertheless, I do not doubt that God has willed it so, since the matter was done and completed without my knowledge and against my will, and I will ask Him to send down from above the wisdom of His seat to assist me, so that I may be able to promote His glory.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you wish to be informed about the annual income. This benefice annually has 25 bushels of wheat, also ten barrels of wine and twelve bushels of oats, to put it crudely, 26 gold coins. Farewell. I will be with you in a few days.</p>
      <p>Given on the 14th day before the calends of April, 1537.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Kuster.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, his brother and lord.</p>
