    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the kindness shown to him during his recent visit to Zurich. Complains about the indifference of the Bernese country pastors, who neglected the catechesis of the youth, and asks the Zurich church to pay full attention to this problem. Greetings.

      <p>Health and a peaceful conscience through Christ.</p>
      <p>I would be more ungrateful than ingratitude itself, most learned Bullinger, if I were to pass over in silence the great kindness shown to me by the entire choir of the Muses of Zurich. Therefore, although partly my inexperience and partly the brevity of time prevent me from giving due thanks to all and each individually, I preferred to stammer with you, to give never-dying thanks to you, Theodor, and all the others, rather than to remain silent about such evident goodwill towards me. Therefore, I implore your help, that of the intermediaries, to give thanks to all and each in my name. So much for that.</p>
      <p>However, there is one thing I forgot to mention in our recent conversation, namely, to inform you of the laziness of some rural pastors in catechizing. It is indeed astonishing how deeply they sleep in this matter, although, as you know, children are the seed of the republic. If many continue in this negligence, I have no doubt that the gospel will soon be overthrown. Therefore, my dear Heinrich, since the care of the Zurich churches is entrusted to you and your colleagues, I ask you to be vigilant in this matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Bern on the very feast of Michael in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Megander sends you many greetings, as does Franciscus, and also Sulcerus. Berchtold sends his greetings in his own letter. You will also greet in my name Mr. Utinger, Provost Liberian, Pellican, Theodor, and Mr. Steiner. Once again, farewell for many years.</p>
      <p>Yours, Rhelicanus, as before.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, his dear lord and good friend. Zurich.</p>
