      <p>Greetings. Once again, I am going to trouble you, esteemed and dear lord and brother. For an exile has come to us here, still covered with a Franciscan cowl, as you see, having escaped from France, a resident of Angers. He seems to be a man of little malice; we have provided him with provisions for his journey. Therefore, for Christ's sake, be so kind as to receive and help him, and furthermore, to recommend him to the people of Strasbourg. I have no doubt that you will do a work pleasing to God. Farewell and always love us; we love you and yours sincerely. In great haste, Zurich, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Oswald Myconius, faithful pastor of the Basel church, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
