      <p> Greetings. I believe you have been informed from there how I was recently dismissed from Bern. When our adversaries mocked both me and the senate with vile quibbles, which were more than enough for their condemnation, they eagerly seized upon an excuse for them, and in order to exclude me from pursuing my rights, a certain false accusation was twisted against me without any basis, which even children recognize was committed by the scribe. However, the senate decreed that wherever printers err, the blame should be borne by the authors of the books. Finally, it seemed they wanted to instill fear in me from another direction. They accused me of having written letters long ago in which Zwingli is criticized or at least his doctrine is disapproved; but since this was neither new nor unexpected to me, I was ready to present what would serve my defense. Zebedee had treacherously published letters sent privately fifteen years ago when I was in Strasbourg. I requested that they be brought forth, so that the wicked would not fabricate a charge against me out of nothing or a trivial occasion. This was denied by the senate. Finally, a scribe gave me a brief written in his own hand, in which it was written in French that the true distinction of things is confused when the name of the sacrament is simply taken for a military oath, whereas it rather signifies a mystery and is a spiritual covenant between God and the church, and that this opinion of Zwingli is briefly refuted in my Institutes. It was added in Latin that Zwingli's opinion on the sacraments is called false by me, which I do not acknowledge to have been said by me in general: rather, I solemnly affirm that it never slipped from me. However, this escape provided impunity for wicked slanderers, who would denounce me as a pestilent heretic from the pulpit, in public squares, in streets, and at tables. Our brothers in Bern performed their duty well, and it was not through them that a better outcome was not achieved. Furthermore, because I opposed this shield: if there was any offense, it especially concerns you, from whom no complaint is heard: but it is absurd for strangers to rise as patrons while you remain silent. If they persist more stubbornly, I beseech you to consider whether it is not fair, and not more desirable for me than honorable for you, to intercede as mediators, so that the wicked do not abuse the deceptive pretext of your name, since you are neither harmed, nor would you wish to bring a lawsuit against me for a pious and friendly admonition, with which I wished to benefit a then inconsiderate man. I hope something will be brought from the fair soon. </p>
      <p> Whatever it may be, I will ensure it is shared with you immediately. Farewell, most distinguished man and my honorable brother. Diligently greet your fellow ministers in my name, your wife, sons-in-law, and the whole family. May the Lord always be with you, protect and guide you. Geneva, April 20, 1555. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Calvin. </p>
      <p> I ask that you ensure the letters to Mr. Lever are delivered as soon as possible with many greetings from me. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, brother and fellow minister to be respected. </p>
