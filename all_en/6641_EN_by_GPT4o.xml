    <p xml:id="regest1">The people of Heidelberg have received Bullinger's letter and the brief exposition ("expositio") of the true faith, along with a comparison of the reformed and old beliefs, as well as his "exhortatio" to the Emperor, with great approval. The Elector will read the two writings upon his return from Saxony and will show his gratitude. The "expositio" will be translated into German by the people of Heidelberg tomorrow and then printed either in Heidelberg or elsewhere. The "exhortatio" – into which the "expositio" must be inserted – should be accompanied by a preface; Bullinger should send this to Heidelberg, where it will be immediately translated into German. The matter brooks no delay: The Latin version should be printed under Bullinger's name or that of other Swiss and sent to the Imperial Diet. There are currently no capacities for a Latin print in Heidelberg; if it is also not possible in Zurich, success can easily be found in Basel. Similar writings will appear in the name of the Dutch churches and Beza; the English church will also make itself heard. A German writing is also being prepared. At the Imperial Diet, a great reformed consensus can thus be presented against the papist and Lutheran condemnations. The death of Konrad Gessner is very regrettable.</p>

      <p>LETTER FROM EHEMIUS TO BULLINGER.</p>
      <p>Greetings. We have received your letters, most illustrious and excellent Bullinger, along with the brief and clear exposition of the orthodox faith and the antitheses of true and Papist doctrine, with the attached exhortation to the Emperor, not without great pleasure, joy, and gratitude (which we all rightfully confess we owe to you on behalf of the Church). We have read them. The conjectures you have made about the success of the assemblies and the head from which they depend, are so far from being disapproved by us that we completely agree with you and have always felt the same, nor has our opinion, long confirmed by many and very certain arguments, deceived us. The most illustrious Prince indeed read your letters, but could not read the rest due to his departure to Saxony. However, be assured that your efforts will not be ungrateful to His Highness. I will ensure that upon his return, he reads them and shows his gratitude.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, God willing, we will have the exposition translated into the German language and arrange for it to be printed here or elsewhere. The exhortation to the Emperor and the states of the Empire, into which this exposition should be inserted, would be better if it were complete with a small preface and sent to us, so that it can immediately be rendered in German. For there is danger in delay. A Latin version, either in your name or in the name of others or even of the churches or some ministers in Switzerland, would be useful to be published and sent to the assemblies and printed among you. Here, all the printing offices are so occupied that there is no room for a Latin edition. But if it is not permitted to do the same in Zurich, it can easily be obtained in Basel, either with Oporinus or another. A writing of the same argument will be published in the name of the churches in the Netherlands; Beza has promised to do the same. The help of the English will not be lacking. But a German writing on the same matter is also being prepared. All these things aim to show the consensus of so many kingdoms and churches and not to rashly promulgate the condemnations, which I know the adversaries, not only Papists but also some Lutherans, solely aspire to, at the assemblies. The devil tries in every way to overthrow the true doctrine; therefore, it must be countered with these and other timely remedies, which the Lord will provide.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my dear Bullinger, I implore, exhort, ask, and advise you as much as I can, to add a small preface to the Emperor and the states, and ensure it is immediately published in Latin in your name or another's, and send us the preface or beginning, whatever it may be (for there is no need for many words). Haste is needed in this matter.</p>
      <p>I greatly mourn the loss of Lord Konrad Gessner, who was taken from us, both for the school and the church, to which he greatly contributed with his labors.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue to love us as you have begun. Hastily in Heidelberg, January 6, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ehemius.</p>
