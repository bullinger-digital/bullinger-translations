      <p>May the grace and victory of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve us, amen.</p>
      <p>As I was considering who most importantly I should write to you, a most serious man, the Lord Tretius seemed to have knocked everything out of my hand. For whether I write about the state of our church or the affairs of the republic, he can explain everything to you more abundantly by word of mouth than we can with a pen. If, however, I were to fall into recommending my studies to you, I would become more like a courtier than a Christian. Therefore, I thought to follow one thing.</p>
      <p>I had conceived a certain writing with my pen, which I send to the judgment of your piety. I have not yet shared it with anyone, and even the sun itself has scarcely seen it, either because its subject is not so well-trodden or because I was ashamed to submit it to the judgment of ingenious men in a matter otherwise not refined. I have judged you alone, most excellent man, in whose bosom I have not feared to deposit these unpolished things. I have two reasons for this undertaking of mine: one, to give you, who sit as it were in the center of the French and German churches, an occasion to think more extensively about these matters; the other, to understand from you, whom I easily judge to be foremost in recognizing the monuments of the ancients in our age, what you think about this whole business. From this, I will know that you have received this epistolary greeting with a cheerful and benevolent spirit if you will not hesitate to write down your judgment on this matter for the benefit of our people. A few days ago, I also spoke with the Palatine of Kraków about these matters, and he would gladly hear your opinion. What remains is that I wish your excellence, with your very numerous family, whose names Lord Tretius is accustomed to recount to me, to be well. Amen, let it be, let it be.</p>
      <p>Given in Kraków, April 13, 1567. Stanislaus Stadnicki, most devoted to your excellence.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and doctrine, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the people of Zürich, my lord and brother to be reverently honored.</p>
