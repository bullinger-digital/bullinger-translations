    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports secretly about the explanations sent from Strasbourg to the Basel council regarding the Wittenberg Concord; the title of one document falsely claims that the Concord contains nothing new. In reality, Luther has prevailed with his understanding of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist; although [the Upper Germans] have rejected a retraction, they have demonstrated their agreement with the Lutherans by participating in the Eucharist celebration. Bucer has sent [Johann] Herwagen, who is preparing a new edition of his Gospel commentary, a "retraction" of his Eucharist doctrine. Myconius and Grynaeus have drafted the enclosed report at the request of the Thirteen, but the concord-friendly councilors doubt their competence. At the request of Capito and [Bucer], Grynaeus and Karlstadt have traveled to Strasbourg; based on their report, a renewed meeting is to be discussed. Bucer is a more persistent opponent than Luther.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am compelled to write, and time does not allow. Therefore, in brief, receive, most venerable brothers in the Lord, what you ought to know. What I do, I do on my own, with no one else aware.</p>
      <p>You have seen the Wittenberg Article from the document sent, or rather brought, by Mr. Pellicanus with a declaration. Furthermore, two declarations were sent to us, that is, to our senate, one in Latin, the other in German, not dissimilar in meaning, but in form. The German one falsely bears this title: "This confession, set in Wittenberg, contains nothing new, but is included in the writings of Oecolampadius and Zwingli, also in the confession of the four cities, presented in Augsburg, and otherwise publicly known, especially included in the Basel confession, which was set by the messengers and preachers of the evangelical cities in February of this year 1536." Thus reads the title.</p>
      <p>From the articles and the declaration, it is clear (to speak briefly) that they acknowledge the true and substantial presence of Christ in the supper in the manner that Luther has consistently wanted for ten years now, not the efficacy of the body of Christ, as we have understood until now, by which the humanity of Christ would not be violated and the power of faith would remain intact; for if this is taken away, papism returns. They refer to the words "this is my body," we to faith and the faithful mind, what it can receive. To confirm this, Luther requested, where the subscribers agreed, a retraction. Our people, refusing this for certain reasons, joined them as communicants and brothers, completely swearing to the words of Luther.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Bucer sent here a retraction to Herwagen, who has his commentary in hand for reforming the evangelists, where he retracts almost everything he has written so far about the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>The matter, or rather the writing of the Argentinians, came from the senate to Mr. Grynaeus and me secretly, so that we would respond after examining it, but only to the senate, or rather to the Thirteen.</p>
      <p>Thus it was done; the response, which I send here, was displeasing, so that you may return it. For our people seek concord, if it could be done without harm to the truth. Some thought us too crude to understand the subtleties of the Argentinians.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Capito and his duke sent letters requesting that Grynaeus and Carolostadius be sent to them; this was again requested from the senators. However, they did not neglect us, giving us the option to do what seemed best to us. So we sent them. And now they are in Strasbourg. We await what they will report. We entrusted them not to depart from the truth. They will report everything to us. Then there will also be consultation about a common meeting.</p>
      <p>Good God, how briefly this is; but I could not do otherwise. When there is a messenger, I will write everything in more detail.</p>
      <p>Bucer opposes us far more persistently than Luther. Let this be the conclusion.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, July 19, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the lords Heinrich Bullinger, Theodor, Pellicanus, etc., their brothers in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
