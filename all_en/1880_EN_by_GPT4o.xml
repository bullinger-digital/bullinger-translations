      <p>For your singular kindness and benevolence towards me, with which you recently overwhelmed me, unworthy as I am, along with Lord Gilbert Cousin, a most learned man, most illustrious of all men, I give great thanks and wish that an opportunity may arise at some point for you to understand the expression of my grateful heart. You asked, however, that I send to you what we have concerning the tragedy stirred up in Prussia by Osiander, of which, however, no certain report has yet reached us, since in this matter one cannot rely on everyone's letters. We have, however, received from the letters of Peter Artopaeus, which were written to us from Stettin on the first of March, how the matter of true human justification was settled by Prince Albert of Prussia, the senior margrave, who, having gathered the judgments of all evangelical doctors, among which the judgment of Dr. Johannes Brenz and his associated preachers seemed most fair and more in agreement with the evangelical truth, namely that Christ himself, according to his divine and human nature or essence, is our eternal and essential righteousness; his merits, however, are the instruments of our justification and are also called our righteousness: that it is to be apprehended by faith and therefore we are considered righteous and produce in us the true fruits of righteousness, the gift of the Holy Spirit with all its gifts, the remission of sins, works of obedience and charity. When Osiander subscribed to this opinion, the prince rejected all others and seriously commanded that no one should henceforth dispute this matter among his people, etc. I am sending you the response of the ministers of the Church of Christ, which is in Hamburg and Lüneburg, to the same disputation sent in February. However, our Sulzer has the entire account of this matter copiously described and published in print, from whom if you ask, he will by no means deny it to you for a time.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily with your wife and whole family. Lord Marcus Bersius and our Oporinus send their most dutiful greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Basel, 30th of May, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich and incomparable friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
