      <p>S. D. Most distinguished man, esteemed teacher, I derive the greatest benefit from my journey, in that I have seen the principal churches of Germany and have initiated a connection with doctors excelling in piety, doctrine, and virtue. Above all, I am grateful for the memory of your most serious conversation, in which you lovingly and piously instructed us on each part of Christian doctrine and demonstrated your unique benevolence and humanity to us with clear signs. I do not judge anything to be more pleasing to a good and pious mind than to hear the opinions of the most excellent governors of the church of God, agreeing and concordant with each other on the principal articles of the Christian faith.</p>
      <p>For it is most true: "Neither shining gold nor diamond sparkles as much as the harmonious understanding of good men," especially when they embrace the harmony of speech and opinions in the explanation of heavenly doctrine with common will. I fervently pray to the Son of God that He may preserve this concord among teachers perpetually and gently heal the most serious wounds inflicted on the church by the hatreds of some. I eagerly await your Decades and hope that you will soon complete this labor of piously and clearly explaining the entire body of heavenly doctrine for the benefit of the church and the studies of learners. For I see nothing more fruitful for those engaged in the study of theology than this diligence in comprehending the entire sum of doctrine, properly and clearly explained in a just method. I often hear from pious men that these healthy outlines of doctrine greatly contribute to fostering agreement among teachers in the church. Such a sum of doctrine is written by Philipp in the explanation of the Nicene Creed; but I read your writings more eagerly, as they are more comprehensive and encompass more controversies. I do not doubt that you learn about the condition of the churches and states in these regions from the letters of others.</p>
      <p>By the grace of God, there is still moderate tranquility. In the churches, no change, even the slightest, has been instituted in either doctrine or rites. Although the people of Magdeburg captured George of Mecklenburg two months ago, they are now under difficult siege. In the other Saxon cities, all is quiet. The soldiers who had gathered in the bishopric of Bremen have dispersed. The school in Wittenberg has a very large number of students; the diligence of the teachers is also moderate. Philipp was called to Dresden by the prince for deliberations about a future synod. Sidonius now resides in Merseburg and adjusts his speech in sermons with generalities and ambiguities to deceive the unlearned. In the churches subject to his administration, he has not restored any idolatries. The condition of the churches in all these regions is still entirely tolerable; I pray with all my heart that God may preserve them. I send you a speech recited at the renunciation of the degree of Georgius Venetus; I judge that its reading will not be displeasing to you. Farewell well and happily, revered teacher.</p>
      <p>In my words, you will respectfully convey greetings combined with all duty of gratitude to your most honorable wife and to the most distinguished man, Mr. Rudolf Gwalther. Wittenberg, on the calends of March, in the year 1551.</p>

      <p>To the most distinguished man, excelling in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, governing the church of God in the renowned city of Zurich, his lord and teacher, to be reverently esteemed.</p>
