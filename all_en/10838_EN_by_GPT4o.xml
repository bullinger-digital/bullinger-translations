      <p>Benedictus Kromerus Pirnensis to Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Dear Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, I once told you, while I was in Zurich, about my dealings with Sitkust, how he insulted me dishonorably out of anger and was not satisfied with that, but further reviled me with some words, which I supposedly uttered in the printing house regarding the sacrament. He took those words upon himself, twisted them maliciously, and brought them behind my back to the authorities. Despite all this, he was not satisfied, but also came to Basel and further accused me of the same matter, namely to Myconius, to Mr. Markus, to Gast, and to the marriage court, intending to hinder me, a poor fellow, with his false, treacherous heart, as has been reported to me by some, and I have defended myself before the honest gentlemen, as befits an honorable fellow. But it does not surprise me a little, how a person can have such a false, unfaithful heart in his body, to betray someone falsely, behind their back, who has never spoken an indecent word to him. It is true, I did not foresee in Zurich that I would find such people who would act so falsely without cause. Truly, it is also not the practice of the holy gospel to so prejudge one's neighbor. Therefore, I ask you, my lord Heinrich, for God's sake, to instruct such a useless person that he must cease from these matters; for he does not disgrace me, but himself. I am confident that I can carry out my case well without him, and even if he uses all cunning, it will not help him. Therefore, I ask you to help punish such wickedness for God's sake, whose servant you are. For you know well enough that I desired nothing else in Zurich than divine justice; and if that could not be granted to me and those in Zurich do not take up the cause of strangers, then it may be granted to me elsewhere.</p>
      <p>With that, may God be with you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, in the year 1536, on the 18th day of April.</p>
      <p>Benedictus Kromer, your willing [servant].</p>
      <p>To the most humane and learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, head of the church in Zurich.</p>
