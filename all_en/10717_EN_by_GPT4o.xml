    <p xml:id="regest1">He is concerned about his wife and children and asks to bring them to Stein am Rhein. He traveled well to Riquewihr and is glad that Leo Jud remains with the people of Zurich; Pellikan, the initiator [of Schmid's dispatch], should pray for a successful outcome. Upon his arrival, the prince [Count Georg of Württemberg-Mömpelgard] had just departed for Mömpelgard; however, he is expected to return soon. He commends his wife and children to them. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The reason I write little to you, dearest brothers, is, thank God, that I do not have much necessity to write. I ask one thing from all of you, namely, that you ensure my wife and children are well at present, and that they are brought to Stein am Rhein as quickly as possible. If you do this, you will free me from all anxiety. Hereafter, I will write in detail about things you ought not to be ignorant of.</p>
      <p>As for the current journey, I arrived in Riquewihr quite comfortably. But I wish our Leo had not come here, not that I have any complaint, but because I would prefer him to be in Zurich, not so much for the country as for his father and the eye that has not been taken from us. I urge our Pellikan, since he is the initiator of this whole matter, to pray most earnestly to the Lord on my behalf, together with my sweetest fellow ministers, so that his word may run most successfully to the glory and praise of Christ and His word, which is my sole aim, as God is my witness; likewise, we will do the same for you with our church.</p>
      <p>The prince, on the day I arrived in Riquewihr, went to Montbéliard, having waited for me, as the courtiers here say, for almost ten days, which troubles me greatly; but they say he will return shortly. Then you will know whatever you ought to know, once I have spoken with him and he with me. Those who are still here promise me much about him. They are almost excessive in proclaiming his gifts and extolling his virtues. May the Lord grant that I find it to be as it is told, and I have no doubt that the word of the Lord will soon triumph everywhere.</p>
      <p>I commend to you my most beloved wife, likewise my sweetest children, and whatever else is under my authority, as to the most faithful brothers and fathers always.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and preach Christ in harmony and love one another, most esteemed fathers and brothers in the Lord, most beloved.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, 15th of November, 1535.</p>
      <p>Greet for me all who sincerely desire the promotion of the gospel's glory, whoever they may be. Choose them by the fruits worthy of the evangelical profession. I want you to greet Bullinger's mother and your wives on my behalf. And pray to the Lord for the prince and the entire people entrusted to us. May the Lord always keep you safe with your wives, children, and brothers.</p>
      <p>Your devoted Erasmus Schmid.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Engelhart, Leo Jud, Bullinger, Pellikan, Theodor, Batto, Rudolf Dumysen, Zeender, and the remaining fathers, teachers, lords, and brothers in Christ, most esteemed in Zurich.</p>
      <p>To my dear godfather Pellikan.</p>
