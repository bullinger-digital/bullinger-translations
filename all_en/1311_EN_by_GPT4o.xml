      <p>S. I wrote to you not long ago in a few words through Doctor Bruno, who promised to send the letters to you in Strasbourg. Then I also sent to you your booklet on the sacraments, which you sent to me three years ago and have now finally included in your fifth Decade, through the hands of Mr. a Breda, brother of Lord Falesius, although it was printed here under my authority but very incorrectly. For I did not think you would publish it there, since it had been hidden with me for so long against my will. I added to it one of my letters written on the same subject six years ago, to attest to the agreement of doctrine, and I do not doubt that all these things have been delivered to you. As for the domestic use of the Lord's Supper, we here, I think, do not disagree with you, but we teach with you that a public assembly and public convocation of the church is required for the use of the Supper, if it can be done. But when it is either not allowed or not in the public interest of the church to convene the whole church publicly for the use of the Supper, we do not deny the use of the Supper to some brothers who request it and meet privately, following the example of the apostles breaking bread from house to house, provided that no superstition is applied, and that such private use does not delay or obscure the public use of it in the public assembly of the whole church. Otherwise, we immediately hear Paul here: Do you not have houses to eat in? And may it never be that we wish to do privately what is the Lord's, as Chrysostom says.</p>
      <p>As for that Florian, I am very sorry that you too are among those whom he deceived, pious and holy men, with his hypocrisy. I bear more easily that he deceived me, but that he used my name to deceive others, and finally even my hand, that pains me more than I can say. But that he also deceived you, I confess, I am most sorry. Indeed, I have received nothing from him for two years and more, nor can I know where he is, and I suspect nothing other than that he has perhaps hidden himself in some monastic cave, although I know nothing of this either. No one from my homeland writes anything to me about him, so I do not think he is there at all. But even though I do not know at all where he is, nor do I believe that anything is to be expected from him either to me or to you or to others, yet, after you bestowed such a benefit on him for the sake of my name, I am very grateful to you, and I will consider it all to have been bestowed on me by you for your virtue, and I will make sure that you, most holy man, are satisfied at the Frankfurt fair. For I do not want even the deception of my name to be a fraud to you, to you, I say, whom I love, revere, and honor as a father.</p>
      <p>I have not yet been able to read your entire fifth Decade, but what I have read pleases me, and I thank our Lord God for the gifts bestowed upon you.</p>
      <p>What Bucer discussed with me about the sacramental matter before his death and what I replied to him I do not have now: for they are with the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, who is now away from here. When I have them again, I will send copies to you. You will be amazed, I am sure, when you read them. I wrote to you recently about Musculus, Bibliander, and Castellio, if they could be induced to come here.</p>
      <p>I would wish the same now, but I hear that neither Musculus nor our Bibliander are allowed to do this. I would certainly wish them to be here, but if that cannot be done, at least do what you can to ensure that we can have Castellio and Coelius Curio here. If I were more certain of their disposition in this matter, I would arrange for them to be given travel expenses and finally have an honorable position here. I would wish that we were many who felt and taught the same in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have given some instructions to Mr. a Breda, brother of Mr. Fallesius, for you and for Mr. Calvin: therefore, you will trust either one of them or both. Farewell, most beloved brother in the Lord, and please excuse me to the brothers for not writing to each individually, especially to our father, Lord Pellicanus. May God, the best and greatest, preserve and govern your churches, and promote and strengthen your mutual agreement through His Spirit, to the glory of His divine name. Amen. Our Lord Hooper is diligently performing his duty. Our church is also, by the grace of God, growing, though not without great resistance from the Pharisees. Farewell again. London, June 7, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours as much as I am, Johannes a Lasco.</p>
      <p>To the most holy man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed brother.</p>
