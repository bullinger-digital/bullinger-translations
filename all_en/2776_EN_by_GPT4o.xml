      <p> Greetings. I am not as frequent in writing letters as I rightfully should be. This is partly due to illness and partly due to the burden of business. Since I am very busy at these hours and cannot write conveniently, you will only read what I wanted to convey to Master Musculus. Since they are almost the same as what I would send to you, I beg you not to be annoyed by excusing me from the suspicion of negligence and to be satisfied with the reading of this hurried writing. After you have read it, please send it enclosed with your letters to Musculus. I have sent the defense of your confession and the agreement to Master Philipp Melanchthon and asked for his judgment on it. If he responds, which I doubt, you will learn this from me. I have translated that same agreement into the German language, but I cannot find a printer to publish it. It would indeed yield much fruit if it were published in German, especially since the name of the excellent man Zwingli is beginning to be heard better among many than before. I have certainly defeated some Lutherans and drawn them to my side with the sword of the Spirit of Christ, although not I, but etc. Farewell, my brother. I seem to foresee a turbulent summer. Hastily, November 24, 1555, from my estate Schlachteck on the river Brenz. </p>
      <p> Yours entirely, Georg Fr√∂lich from Lemnitz, etc. (...) and highly learned (...) Bullinger, former [of the ch]urch of Zurich, my (...) honor to hand. [Zu]rich. </p>
      <p> To Master Musculus in Bern. </p>
