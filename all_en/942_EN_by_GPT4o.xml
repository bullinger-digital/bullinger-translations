      <p> Greetings. I have nothing of public or private nature to write at present that would be of interest to you, most kind godfather, except that I am sending you the letters received from someone who came from Friesland. Furthermore, which you might find surprising, our Rappenstein has been called to the ecclesiastical ministry and appointed as the head of the church in Frutigen. My family sends greetings to you and yours, as does Musculus with his family, who has not yet fully recovered from his erysipelas. </p>
      <p> Jodocus has gone to some baths in the farthest part of the Bernese territory. Farewell. </p>
      <p> Bern, 19th of June, 1550. I will also add that Mr. Conrad Svertzenbach, a citizen and senator of Zürich, is lying here gravely and fatally ill; the disease is turning into dropsy; he is prepared to die and is expecting the arrival of his wife today. May the Lord strengthen him and transfer him to His heavenly kingdom. Amen. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable lord and godfather. </p>
      <p> Zürich. </p>
