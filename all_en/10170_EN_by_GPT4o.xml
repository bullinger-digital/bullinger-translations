      <p>Greetings. Since I can hardly be present at the appointed hour - for it is not possible to be in two places at once, unless I were to fashion some sort of Lutheran body -, I wanted to remind you, dearest brother, that the ministers of the word should not subscribe to any ceremonies or laws. If you cannot oppose it and the council insists on establishing ecclesiastical laws, we must dissemble and endure it, provided we are not the authors. It will fall more easily at some point, which would not happen if it were to take authority through the leaders of religion. It is too august, that which creeps in under the guise of religion, and more effort is exhausted in abolishing it than in establishing it. For we stubbornly defend what our reason has discovered. Consider with what guise the entire papal apparatus has crept into the church of Christ, and how much trouble it has given and still gives.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Leo.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
