      <p>Greetings. I pray that if the person delivering this letter to you has a good cause, you will be willing to help the man with your faith and authority among good people; you will also do this as part of your duty, and you will greatly gratify us here.</p>
      <p>Regarding the faith of our friendship, I hope for the eternal grace of Christ upon us. I pray that you will diligently greet all friends, especially our dear Theodor.</p>
      <p>I hope that we all unite completely in Christ Jesus, our redeemer. For what reason is there that we, redeemed by the Lord, should not love each other with all our hearts, and why should we not unite all our efforts and strengths in celebrating the praises of the one and the same Prince, Christ?</p>
      <p>Farewell with your dearest wife and children in the Lord. September 6th.</p>
      <p>Your S. Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, friend and brother. Zurich.</p>
