    <p xml:id="regest1">Everyone who comes from Zurich to Chur complains about the [alleged] negligence of the people of Chur because they did not send a delegate to the assembly of the [Four Protestant City Cantons on August 29 in Aarau]. However, it was already communicated that the Council of the Three Leagues had indeed expressed willingness to send someone [to Aarau] if the people of Chur insisted, but they did not want to send anyone other than the one [presumably Hans von Marmels, Lord of Raz√ºns], who would then have had to go [to the assembly] in Baden. But since he is a hypocrite and an enemy of piety, the Chur Council decided that it would be better to send no one at all than that villain. Bullinger should calm the minds.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Furthermore: A man [...], who married a woman [...] with whose sister [...] he had previously slept secretly, is in great distress of conscience since he heard about God's prohibition in this regard [Lev 18:6, 18]. Since Comander himself does not know what to do, he turns to Bullinger. If the man keeps his wife, his conscience torments him; if he sends her away, it will cause a great scandal. The man would prefer to be reassured and keep his wife.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- From Italy, it is heard that many more mercenaries are to be sent to the Emperor [Charles V]. Furthermore, the Duchy of Milan is said to have been subjected to an enormous tax. The war seems to be terrible. God help!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger should share news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings to all colleagues. Johannes Blasius and Mayor [Luzi] Heim send their regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. From all who come to us from you, we hear ill and are reproached for our ingratitude and forgetfulness of the duties bestowed upon us, because we neglected the assembly of the cities that honor the Gospel. We have already given a reason for this matter; for it had come to the point that someone would be sent if we, the people of Chur, had wished, but it was entirely the same one who had been destined for Baden, and no other. Therefore, it seemed better to our magistrate to send no one than that blind man and hypocrite and worst enemy of piety. Therefore, dearest brother, as much as you can, please excuse and appease.</p>

      <p>Another matter: A certain man, greatly burdened by his conscience, came to me seeking advice. The case is as follows: A man married a certain virgin, whose sister he had carnally known long before, secretly from everyone; but he solemnly affirms that he did not know it was forbidden by divine law to contract marriage with such a one. Now he is grievously afflicted in conscience; he fears to retain her, who before God is not and cannot be a legitimate wife; but to repudiate or dismiss her in any way would be with the greatest offense and danger. For he recognizes that both would be most troublesome and difficult for him: To retain her against his conscience or to send her away with the gravest scandal. I did not dare to make a decision in this matter. Therefore, I ask and beg you to advise both, and he would especially like his conscience to be made more at peace, avoiding scandal, and that wife to remain with him.</p>

      <p>Moreover, from Italy, we hear nothing except that they have sent many soldiers to the Emperor. Insubria is burdened with a huge tax of 300,000 scudi. We hear of a most atrocious war. May God, the best and greatest, in His mercy, come to the aid of true piety, I pray.</p>
      <p>Farewell. From the Court of Rhaetia, September 20, 1546.</p>
