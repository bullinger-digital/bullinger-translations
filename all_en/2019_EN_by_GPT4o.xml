      <p>Greetings. The money (in Christ Jesus, eternally esteemed Bullinger, to me) as I promised to your humanity last year, also from the recent spring fairs, I sent to the most honorable order of your senate through letters at the beginning of these autumn fairs soon to Frankfurt to a man very dear to me in many respects, Mr. Hieronymus Agninus, a jurist, with the added mandate that he should count it to Froschauer or to anyone else who would receive it on behalf of your most illustrious senate.</p>
      <p>Later, Froschauer himself arrived with letters to me from you, from which and also from his own words I understood that he is the one who has this mandate. I was very glad; for I began to love this man for the sincerity of his mind and now hold him in high regard. Therefore, to him, providing whatever kind of receipt for the received, he will assign a note to be delivered to you along with letters sent to Frankfurt, both to you and to Gwalther, and to your most holy senate. Behold, with these matters settled according to my mind, after Froschauer departed from me towards Frankfurt, suddenly adverse health, not fatal, so that I can add nothing more to those previous writings of mine at present, with the pen slipping from my trembling hand, except this one thing, as if repeating, for in the letters sent to Frankfurt I also mentioned this matter, that you should command your most holy senate in my name to be safe and furthermore secure about sending the obligations here until the spring fairs of the upcoming fifty-fourth year. If found among the living then, soon enough, if deceased, my executors (among whom the aforementioned Mr. Hieronymus Agninus is chief) will inform you by letters; you then orally to the senate, what I have decided about them, where or how they should be kept, until they are sent back to you along with either the autograph or at least an authentic copy of my last elegy after my wife has also passed away. Meanwhile, eternally beloved Bullinger, through the bowels of Jesus Christ, to whom you faithfully serve and are wholly consecrated, I beseech you again and again, that you would deign to intercede for me with God with your most holy prayers, that He may grant to miserable me to happily depart from here in the true faith of Christ, His only begotten Son and our only Savior, and that with senses intact and mind well composed and sound in Christ; for it is remarkable how many are denied this today among us due to immense headaches. The same, I hope, will not disdain to do for me along with you, Gwalther, truly your son in spirit, and the other God-loving, your fellow ministers, admonished by you. If from the illness, into which I have suddenly fallen, willing and helping Christ (for I resign all this into His hands with a ready and benevolent mind) I recover, I will write to you again; if not, these will perhaps be the last, however, I will depart more joyfully in spirit, after the business concerning those thousands, as far as I am concerned, is now completed, to which may God bless among you, likewise to all of you and to His whole church among you. Amen. Given at Worms on the Rhine, September 19, in the year etc. 53.</p>
      <p>Your most loving and learned Wolfgang Waidner.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most holy church of Christ in ZÃ¼rich, beloved by God, his most esteemed lord and in divine matters a teacher, eternally beloved lord father.</p>
      <p>Written in illness, when he thought he might die and these would be the last. September 1553.</p>
