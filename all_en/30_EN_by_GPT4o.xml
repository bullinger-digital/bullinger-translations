    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger need not have recommended Enzinas so emphatically to John Hooper [regarding a book shipment], as Hooper is well aware that all his orders are executed conscientiously by Enzinas. It would be a shame if the first booklet [«An Answer unto my lord of Winchester's book entitled a detection of the devil's Sophistry wherewith he robs the unlearned people of the true belief in the most blessed sacrament of the altar»?] were truly lost. He will write to Hooper about why he believes the shipment was poorly prepared. Had the booklet been sent to him, he would have ensured its delivery not only to Antwerp but also to England. For the writing [«A declaration of Christ and of his office»?], [whose shipment he is now supposed to handle], he adhered entirely to Hooper's instructions and sent the book to Antwerp, where it will likely arrive soon. He himself has sent many book shipments via this exact route without any losses.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">He took note of Bullinger's opinion on the English book with interest, although he was already convinced that Hooper would only publish scholarly and verified works.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">He dares not write about politics. However, he fears that the world is giving birth to a terrible monster, which cannot be brought forth without a miscarriage and will bring about the downfall of the entire empire.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">He dares even less to report on private matters, so as not to burden Bullinger further. He cannot live safely in Basel and knows no safe place in all of Europe. Therefore, he plans to travel to the Ottoman territories, where he is sure he can spread the true religion with good arguments. There, he wants to establish a city that will serve as a refuge for other exiles from Europe. He will report more on this to Bullinger and Theodor Bibliander before his departure.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Meanwhile, he congratulates these two and the other pastoral colleagues on their leisure, which they dedicate to scholarship, and wishes them with God that it may last forever.</p>

      <p>Greetings. There was no need for such an accurate recommendation in such a trivial matter, especially since Master Hooper is well aware that I will diligently take care of everything that pertains to him. I am sorry that the first booklet was lost, if indeed it was lost. I am writing to the same Hooper about why I think the matter was poorly handled. If it had been sent to me, I would have ensured its delivery not only to Antwerp but also to England. I sent the latter one, which I received, to Antwerp, as he wrote, where I believe it will arrive shortly and safely. For I have sent many packages by the same route and have not yet noticed anything being lost.</p>

      <p>I was pleased to hear your opinion on the English writing, although I was already convinced that nothing should be published by him that was not learned and approved.</p>

      <p>I dare not speak about public affairs. I see the world giving birth to a formless monster, which does not seem able to be brought forth without a miscarriage, which will bring with it the great ruin of the entire republic.</p>

      <p>I dare even less to speak about private matters, lest I bring you trouble with very troublesome matters. We wander, as he said, driven by fate around all the seas. I cannot live securely here, nor do I see a safe place in all of this Europe known to us. Therefore, I have planned a journey to the Muslim lands, where I see with certain arguments the greatest hope arising for the restoration of true religion. There we will establish a new city, where it will be permitted to gather and restore the remnants of exiled Europe. I will write more before my departure to you and Master Theodor and the other brothers, to whom I congratulate on their leisure in letters and tranquility, and I pray to God that it may be perpetual.</p>

      <p>Farewell. Basel, the first of February, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Franciscus Dryander.</p>
