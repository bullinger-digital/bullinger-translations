      <p>Greetings. I hope, dearest and most esteemed Calvin, that you have received all my letters. Now I commend to your charity this excellent brother from Cremona, upon whose shoulders I have placed my fifth decade, which I send to you, not to teach you with my books, for I confess that I have learned much from yours, but to attest my goodwill towards you. Would that I could render you services in other far greater matters. Nothing will displease you, I am sure, in the treatment of the sacraments and in other places. For I have omitted what you once advised would displease certain good men, and I have taken the utmost care that all things agree with our Consensus, etc.</p>
      <p>The Consensus is now being printed with us, the first page of which, not yet completed, I send to you here. It will also be printed and rendered in the German language. I have added what I received from Mr. Vergerio. You will return the copy, if you can conveniently. Write back, I beseech you, promptly. For I am reluctant to be without your letters for so long. At the end of the sermon on the supper, I use your words from the Institutes, so that all may see that we agree, etc.</p>
      <p>A disgraceful concession was made by our people at the Diet of Augsburg. They accepted that most impious Council of Trent. Only the Mauritians, I do not know what, interceded. Now, therefore, it is being discussed about subjugating the Swiss and the English. If ever we have done anything for the defense of piety with the Lord working through us, now at last we must pray that He does not forsake us, and that we may fight bravely for the glory of Christ the Redeemer and for the churches entrusted to our faith. Farewell. I wrote in great haste. December 27, 1551. Commend me to Mr. von Burgund.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>May Gallasius, Farellus, and all good men be safe.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, lord and brother to be eternally esteemed.</p>
      <p>In Geneva.</p>
