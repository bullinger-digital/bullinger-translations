      <p>By the grace of God, Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg, etc. Our greetings to you, highly learned, dear, and special one.</p>
      <p>After we have dispatched the highly learned, our dear and faithful Doctor Philipp Lang, the bearer of this letter, on some matters, as you will learn from him, to the prudent, honorable, and wise, our particularly dear and good friends, the mayor and council of the city of Bern, and since we do not know which persons are currently the foremost in the government there in Bern, it is our gracious request that you inform him, Doctor Philipp, about which persons he should approach on our behalf in Bern and advance the matter, so that he may act more fruitfully, and especially inform him which preacher there in Bern is most agreeable to the council. We will graciously acknowledge this in return.</p>
      <p>Dated Böblingen, Saturday after Trinity Sunday, in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg, etc.</p>
