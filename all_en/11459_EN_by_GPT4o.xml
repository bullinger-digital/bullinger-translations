      <p>I have translated the booklet by Juan Luis Vives of Valencia, titled "Introduction to Wisdom," which Pellican also added to his Bible commentaries, from Latin into the vernacular. I considered it worthwhile, most honorable man, so that this golden booklet may be handled not only by the learned but also by the unlearned, especially since, as you plainly know, the method or compendium of true theology and wisdom can be found in it. Indeed, a better method to piety can hardly be prescribed, and what others have encompassed with meanders and long detours, he has comprehended all that pertains to piety with few words and pleasant brevity. Therefore, the booklet is worthy of being brought to light by my work or that of others, not doubting that much benefit can accrue to piety from it. Since I am aware of how learned and complete in every respect it must be, what is published and proposed for everyone to read, I am therefore sending this booklet to you for the purpose of review. Although I have translated it, I am uncertain how skillfully I have rendered it. Therefore, I wish to ask you, most esteemed man, to review this booklet for the benefit of the Christian cause, to correct, refine, and critique it, so that, through your work and reading, the work may be polished and recommended, and brought to light. If, however, my translation is not worthy of the light, let it go where it deserves, and be intercepted, but let the booklet be kept with you until my arrival.</p>
      <p>Farewell, along with your very dear family, and love me as you do. Given in Glarus, on the 23rd day of August in the year 1540.</p>
      <p>F. Fonteius Glareanus, most devoted to your humanity.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of the Lord among the people of Zurich, his brother and esteemed lord. To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
