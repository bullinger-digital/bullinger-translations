      <p>Greetings. Perhaps Mr. Martyr and Gualtherus will come, although it is not convenient for me to come. If anything seems to be in our interest, but above all to promote the glory of God and the salvation of the churches, I will agree to it wholeheartedly. Meanwhile, consider whether there is any hope for that private conference.</p>
      <p>Friends write from Augsburg that the imperial diet is now ending and that unfortunate conference between the imperial deputies is to be held in August in Worms. Among the Lutherans, after Philipp, there are those you would not want at all, Brentius, Marbachius, and some thick-headed Saxons. Brentius, due to the authority of his prince, is among the foremost: and unless Brentius is present, nothing is considered properly done. On the opposing side, I hear that the most cunning sophists of all are to be involved. However, the more prudent and pious in Germany think that the King is leading the princes around by the nose with such transformations as if they were shape-shifters, so that if he gains victory, he will soon dictate to them: This I want, this I do not want. But what if God delivers Zedekiah bound to the Turks? Since everyone fears the Turkish war, why do they not begin their defense with religion?</p>
      <p>The garrison soldier in Salzburg is said to be enlisted, to be led into Upper Pannonia. And they promised the King aid against the Turks... nor did they want to promise anything unless the conference was granted. But when did he grant it? They will have to fight first and send soldiers, count money before they confer. The King is acting with utterly bad faith. What do you think he will do next? The army of the King of France, having left Rimini, is moving directly to Naples, where they say the Turkish fleet will also come. An excellent collusion. Everything is wounded everywhere. May the Lord our God preserve His church in such great and nearly incurable evils. Everything of yours in Baden has been accomplished as intended.</p>
      <p>Glory to God. Farewell with all yours. All of ours greet you. Zurich, April 9, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
