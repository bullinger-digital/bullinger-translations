      <p>Greetings. After I had sealed the previous letters sent to you, behold, the bookbinder brings a booklet.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I immediately add a brief letter to the booklet, which you see here; for I have enclosed its first lines here, so that you may see what I have written.</p>
      <p>I wrote it for your sake, otherwise I would have written nothing to him; therefore, whatever it is, it stands in your hand. If it seems right, deliver it to him; if it is not approved, keep it for yourself, but nevertheless send me a copy or even the letter itself; give the booklet to whomever you wish. Farewell. March 9, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
