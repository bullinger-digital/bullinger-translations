      <p>Greetings, Reverend Father, this evening, having returned home from a little walk, I found letters from Mr. Martinengo on the table; since there was someone to deliver them, I quickly enclosed them in this letter of mine, without copying them, as there was no time. Therefore, you will return a copy at some point. The matter is of little importance, I admit; but all these collected things can still be of some help. We are very anxiously awaiting news about the French affairs.</p>
      <p>Is Condé conducting himself well? Various rumors are spreading. What is happening with the English, who seem to have little favor returned? We know the German knights have returned; they are owed three months' pay; the German princes are said to have pledged their faith.</p>
      <p>Today I discussed many things with a knight, with a black rider, who otherwise has not healed from the wounds; he has bound himself here. He reported everything in good faith, of which he was also a part, as it has been written to us so far; the narration was pleasant. He was under the blood flag, a single horseman; he speaks of a Züricher, named Uli Müller, who was also a single horseman, whose bravery he praises; Uli Müller is not known to me. He attests very highly and dearly that the cuirassiers and riders were defeated before the Confederates were attacked. Therefore, when I let him read their letter to the 5 places after the battle, in which they reported how they stood alone for 2 hours, etc., it was very strange and foreign to him.</p>
      <p>He does not seem to be vain. He told me many things about Beza, whose sermons he attended several times; for he is fluent in French. Otherwise, he says that the Brunswickers have kept a preacher from Oberen-Baden from the Confederates, a well-spoken man, said to be named Johannes, but he could not remember the surname. He reported everything else in such a way that it appears he was present at all; for he was among the first who were at Orléans. The one from Portian is said to have accompanied them up to Lothringen and dismissed them there; the outstanding pay is said to be settled for them in Cologne by the upcoming Michaelmas.</p>
      <p>These and many other things. Farewell, Reverend Father, with all your family, as happily as possible. All your things have been returned to me; I am most grateful. Written in haste at Chur on the night before the calends of July in the year 1563. Your most observant F[abricius].</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
