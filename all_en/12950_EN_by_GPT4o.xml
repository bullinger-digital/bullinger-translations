    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger is silent, and Myconius can hardly make a selection from the abundance of news! The situation is catastrophic, especially for the Swiss Confederates. In the entire [Upper Austrian] surroundings, people are rejoicing that the last hour of the arrogant Swiss Confederates has struck through the victorious Emperor Charles V in Germany, and now they must pay the price for the blood spilled everywhere. It is time for the Emperor to humble them, for they have brought all sorts of evils, even blasphemy, into Germany!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Such statements deeply affect Myconius, especially since the Emperor and his followers have sown and continue to sow discord among the Swiss Confederates. They cannot stand united [against the Emperor] if they differ in faith! What will happen if the Lord does not intervene?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] If Bullinger sees more clearly, may he open Myconius's eyes. He will say that one must trust in God. Right! But due to the many sins and the lack of repentance, hardly anything can be expected from God. No one wants to hear it when the pastors call for improvement. They themselves are not without fault! Myconius sees this in himself and can conclude from it how it stands with the others. Yes, trust in God is important, but above all, one must lead a better life and always ask God for help and unity. If this were done, there would be no reason to worry about the Emperor's successes, even though Myconius would much prefer peace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] That's all for now, as Johannes Wolf is in a hurry. Greetings, also to Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and Rudolf Gwalther, to whom he would have written if he had known in time about Wolf's presence.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You are silent, and I have nothing to write, not due to a lack of topics, but rather an abundance, from which I cannot choose what I would like. Everything is miserable, and we are especially miserable! No one around us is not shouting that the end is finally near for the Swiss Confederates, with Emperor Charles V victorious throughout Germany; now they will pay for the blood spilled everywhere! And indeed, they say, it is time for their insolent spirits to be curbed. They have brought all sorts of evils into Germany, even blasphemies! In summary: They will be visited by Charles.</p>

      <p>When I hear these things, they deeply move me because of our dissensions, which he himself has caused among us and continues to foster. For minds cannot be united, so to speak, among those who differ in religion. Unless the Lord assists us for a special reason, I do not see what will happen.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>If you have better insight here, please make it so that I too can see what is hidden from me. You say we should trust in the Lord. Well, if our sins allowed it. You know how many and great they are in all of us, and how there is no repentance! We, who are in charge of the word, while urging improvement, no one listens, and we ourselves sometimes fall quite seriously. I know what happens to me; from which I divine what may happen to others as well. But we must trust! Above all, however, life must be amended and we must continually pray that God may look upon us, spare us, and make us united. If we achieve this, I do not care much for the Emperor's success, although I would prefer peace.</p>

      <p>This little I could write due to Johannes Wolf's hurried departure. Farewell in the Lord with your companions, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and Rudolf Gwalther, to whom I would have written if I had known in time about Wolf's presence. Basel, hastily, May 16, 1547. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, the best minister of Christ, his esteemed lord in Christ.</p>
