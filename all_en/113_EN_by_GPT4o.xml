      <p>S. Finally, the book of Cicero, which you requested, and I thank you for the new things you have shared with me. What has been done and is still being done in Bern with the Sulcerians, you probably know better than I do. I saw and read the articles they wanted to propose to the pastors for examination, driven by some unknown spirit.</p>
      <p>The French minds have so far greatly inconvenienced the gospel; they constantly have innumerable questions. Our church is almost overwhelmed by these new people. You are more fortunate, as you lack such people, whose faith is unknown to us, whose behavior is hypocritical, and who deceive us with the appearance of integrity. I do not think you are unaware of the discord that has arisen between the bishops and the princes in Augsburg; what you do not know, Myconius narrates in his letter. However, I know that Bucer has been endangered and tested in various ways. Now in Mainz, a book is being printed, to be sent by the Emperor, containing the concord of the German churches; for the paper is being prepared, the characters are being adorned, and the printer is expecting the book at any moment, which the Spaniards and German monks, Wicelus and Flugius, have printed at the Emperor's command. The bishops are furious against this decree of the Emperor. But the Lord knows what He will do in religion, which is to plant and proclaim His glory, in whose hand are the hearts of kings. Strasbourg daily hosts Spanish and Neapolitan soldiers, whom they receive honorably. Everywhere in the margraviate of Ernest and the baron of Hanau, likewise the soldiers of the bishop of Strasbourg are overwhelming, who devour everything. The bishop pays a worthy penalty; if he wants the soldiers to leave his villages, he is forced to give a sum of money. For they owe the soldiers two months' pay; if the chapter pays them with the bishop, they will want to move on to another bishop or abbot, who is fat and has much money, whom they must also devour. Thus guilty and innocent, bishop and barber, must suffer; there is no difference between the pious and the impious, even if these scoundrels deserve a greater penalty for the idolatry they foster and defend to madness. But hey, we have a new preacher in Basel, who, as the common people say, spreads a new gospel. The crowd of people runs to him; you wouldn't believe the kind of following he has from the common people. I fear that this comedy will eventually turn into a tragedy; for I know the fickleness of the common people, and I also know the nature of some, who tend to abuse even good men with a fair appearance. May the Lord grant us tranquility and prudence, so that we do not act foolishly in calling ministers! You know Valentinus, who perhaps came to us from your region; he is a good man and familiar to me, but he disturbs and burdens the other ministers with envy...</p>
      <p>You will understand well what is to follow. Farewell, and if you have any news, please share it with your Gastius, who wishes well for you and all the people of Zurich. Nor should I omit this: the princes of Saxony sadly want to establish a public school in Jena; but Philipp Melanchthon denies them his assistance; he wants to remain in Wittenberg. Why is that? He has beautiful houses, a garden, meadows. Pomeranus says he is old. What if the Turk were to come, would they stay and deny their faith or approve the religion of the Turks? Poor people. May 8, 1548.</p>
      <p>Y(ours) G(astius).</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his sincere friend, etc. Zurich</p>
