      <p>S. D. I received the letter sent to me on January 8th on February 3rd. I do not blame you for negligence, but rather myself, as I seem to be overwhelmed with all my duties. As for my Jonah concerning the lyre, he himself states in clear words that he owes nothing for it, but that Master Simbler has credited him with a French crown for that instrument, which is also contained in the transmitted account. I would therefore like the complaints of the good man to be settled. I recently wrote about the payment of debts and, with God's guidance, will fulfill the promises shortly. Jonah is so full of ulcers and scabies that not only his limbs but even his mind cannot perform its function.</p>
      <p>I would most gladly undertake the task of translating your books on grace; nothing would be more pleasant to me than to work in your field, indeed in the agriculture of the best God. But since I bear not one, but a hundred burdens, it is hardly possible to begin your work now. Master Laurentius Agricola from Winterthur has given me a huge task, as Prince Ottheinrich has imposed on me the weight of translating his military stratagems. The same prince now calls me to the function of his chief secretary, as does the Augsburg magistrate with excellent promises. You will be amazed if you ever understand these Protean matters from me correctly and at length. Indeed, these vocations have left me in doubt for two whole months as to whose will I should obey; finally, the clemency and piety of Prince Otto, who extended a generous hand to me, an exile driven from Augsburg, prevailed. I have promised him my services, but have not yet fully decided to accept the chancellorship. The people of Augsburg seem to be suffering from some kind of disease, which it will not be my task to cure. May the Lord grant them the spirit of repentance.</p>
      <p>The affairs in England disturb many, but also delight many. Cardinal of Augsburg recently gave a congratulatory sermon on the restoration of the English kingdom to the Roman Church and granted many thousands of indulgences to all who pray for the constancy of the queen and wish happiness for the Prince of Spain.</p>
      <p>The Emperor, as the rumor goes, will soon cross over to Spain, never to return. Time will reveal what thorns he will leave behind in Germany; it is certain that evil is being nurtured again and again by some.</p>
      <p>On February 5th, my daughter Affra will celebrate her wedding with an elegant young man, for whom you will intensely pray with me to the best and greatest God for the married couple and their well-being. Farewell with your whole household. February 3rd from Lauingen, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Frölich from Lömnitz, etc.</p>
      <p>I have a dear friend, Jacob Relinger from Leder, the late Ulrich Rehlinger's son, the former mayor of Augsburg, whom I consider a Christian of honor. He would like to have a church servant of your confession. I kindly ask you to send him one and also write that he comes there at my recommendation; he would have a good position.</p>
      <p>The news in England is about to change. Duke Hans Friedrich and Duke August of Saxony are finally supposed to reconcile.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant churchman of Zurich, as a friend to a brother.</p>
