      <p>My lord Bullinger, most learned and kind.</p>
      <p>Forgive Lismanini, truly yours, for rarely addressing you. This is not due to negligence, but rather the reverence with which I regard you.</p>
      <p>I am aware of your occupations, through which you scarcely have time to engage with our Lelio. From Mr. Mercurius Gallus, who will deliver my letters to you, you will understand the state of affairs of the Polish churches. On September 15th, we celebrated a most general synod in the town of Xyons, belonging to the magnificent Mr. Johannes Boner, a free baron of Balice originating from Germany, castellan of Biecz of the senatorial order.</p>
      <p>Many attended, both of the senatorial and equestrian orders, nearly all ministers of the churches of Lesser Poland, about 40, from Greater Poland not only of our confession, but also two excellent and learned men of the Saxon and Waldensian confessions. From Russia, Podolia, and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, not a few were sent by the most illustrious prince Nicholas Radziwiłł, duke in Olyka, etc., palatine of Vilnius.</p>
      <p>Among other things discussed, the Stancarian cause did not hold the least place, and it was finally concluded that both parties should stand by your judgment, Mr. Peter Martyr's, Mr. Calvin's, and Mr. Beza's, and although I do not think Stancarus will agree, his supporters will stand by it.</p>
      <p>I showed your letter to Alexander Vitellius, in which you most clearly prove the opinion of our confession, namely that Christ is the mediator according to both natures, and I showed your judgment on the infamous pamphlet of Stancarus published without a title of the author in Pinczów secretly against the man of holy memory, Mr. Philip.</p>
      <p>Melanchthon likewise and the judgment of the same pamphlet by the churches of Geneva, Bern, and Basel, also the letter of the church of Lausanne sent by me to the Polish churches, and also the letter of the most learned Mr. Peter Martyr sent by me to the same churches, in which all these most learned men praise our opinion. Lastly, the letter of the church of Geneva, an excerpt of which I send to you (for we have not yet received your letter written to us after seeing our confession), which we know was sent by a certain learned Pole, as reported by the noble Mr. Stanislaus Silnicki and the noble Mr. Nicholas Dlusius.</p>
      <p>To all these things, some supporters of Stancarus responded that it is unworthy for Stancarus to be pronounced a heretic before his confession is condemned. What has been done so far has been done for the instruction of one party, it is fair that Stancarus also be heard before he is condemned. Finally, it was decided that the confession of both parties should be sent to you four judges elected by the synod. Therefore, for your piety, do not fail this kingdom.</p>
      <p>I send certain writings, from which you will be able to know even the smallest details concerning the present controversy. First, a historical narration written by the most illustrious man of holy memory, Mr. Johannes a Lasco.</p>
      <p>Also another history of the Stancarian tragedy by Peter Statorius Gallus, the moderator of this school. Also, the letter of Andreas Fricius Modrevius, a Pole, to the general synod. Also, his appendix to the letter to the most illustrious equestrian... Hieronymus Ossolinski. Also, the letter of Stancarus to Alexander Vitellius. Also, the letter of the disciples of Stancarus to the same Vitellius.</p>
      <p>Also, the writing of Stancarus, titled: Stancar on the Mediator. It begins thus: "Although the holy fathers and the holy catholic church." Here you will read blasphemies against God, insults against the most illustrious man of holy memory, Mr. Johannes a Lasco.</p>
      <p>He makes me a triangle of the devil with the most holy man of God, Mr. Martin Luther, and George the monk, who was in charge of the treasures of the kingdom of Hungary. I ask you not to disdain to hear some boy reciting this blasphemous pamphlet during lunch, so as not to waste other hours.</p>
      <p>You will marvel that the most learned man, Mr. Andreas Fricius, does not abhor this monster, which harms the church more than all the papist bishops, although they are very wealthy. Among others, he has bewitched three most noble men of the equestrian order by birth, wealth, and talent. He also tried to impose on the most illustrious Mr. Johannes, Count of Tarnów, castellan of Kraków, the first senator of the kingdom, but the Lord rendered that blasphemous mouth so mute that not a word was heard when he was with the said prince.</p>
      <p>It will be your duty, my Bullinger, to assist us at this time not with private letters, but with some writing worthy of this church. Would that my father, Mr. Bernardino Ochino, would write in Italian against this miserable Jew. Farewell, my most esteemed brother, and greet your family first, then your sons-in-law and all your colleagues in my name. Would that I might visit this holy church and the rest of Switzerland and Geneva before death, I desire this more than to see Phaeacia and those gardens of Alcinous so praised by Homer.</p>
      <p>Pinczów, October 20, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Francis Lismanini, in his own hand.</p>
      <p>When the confession of our churches concerning the mediator is brought, which you have already read, do not hesitate to act as Aristarchus, so that it does not come forth incomplete. We, as your disciples, write to you.</p>
      <p>There was another reason while the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes a Lasco, was alive, who could not put the final hand to the work, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and prudent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant superintendent of the churches of the most illustrious city and region of Zürich, lord and as a most revered father. Zürich.</p>
      <p>Your letters were delivered to me in the cause of the mediator, most learned, and which completely silenced the Stancarian fury, in which, however, because certain words offend some brothers, it was not seen fit to publish them before this was made known to you. Your words, which offend, are these.</p>
      <p>"If it is asked how Christ is understood to intercede, act as an advocate, and pray to the Father, which is also the work of a mediator, it can easily be answered from what has been said, that the person of Christ does this but insofar as he is man." This is the same opinion as Stancarus. Many things follow in your letters that pertain to the matter, but since even before he became man, he was a mediator and prayed for Jerusalem, it does not seem to fit that 'insofar as he is man.' Therefore, I ask you, my Mr. Bullinger, to resend the same letters without this 'insofar as he is man,' so that your letters may be published without scandal to the brothers, along with the letters of the churches of Geneva, Basel, and Strasbourg, of which I will send you copies if Mr. Mercurius does not depart so soon.</p>
      <p>I have already given the one from Geneva, two copies remain to be described. Would that Mr. Musculus would also add his letters, for his writings are held in the highest esteem among the Poles. Again, farewell and love me in return, yours in Kraków, November 3, 1560.</p>
      <p>Lismanini.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and prudent pastor of the church of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
