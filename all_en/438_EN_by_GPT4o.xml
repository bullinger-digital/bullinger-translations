      <p>Greetings. No matter how the die is cast, you always act as a friend and do not wish to be unaware of me. You write, I reply; what next? We grieve over many things, yet there is one remedy for our troubles: Let us overcome fleeting fates with brave hearts, trusting only in God, for we are shadows. With you offering prayers, the tyrant's back will be turned, he who strives to slaughter the pious. These verses, because they flowed spontaneously, I ask you to consider kindly.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I received a bundle of booklets, your offspring, as I had long requested from our Froschauer. Indeed, I am very gratified by this, especially since I found the booklet on the justification of a Christian man, without my asking, either through you or Froschauer, joined with others.</p>
      <p>As soon as I fixed my eyes on it, I did not cease reading until I reached the end; indeed, that discourse greatly strengthened and consoled me, especially because in recent days I had a chance dispute with a certain abbot, a completely unlearned monk, on this matter, who attributed justification to our works, yet without the scriptures, of which he is entirely ignorant. I reserve the remaining German booklets for my children as delightful, and I wish them to be exercised and imbued in them as much as possible. I could not send the payment for them yet due to the inconvenience of the courier, but I will pay in due time; meanwhile, I give great thanks.</p>
      <p>Moreover, several other letters of yours have been delivered to me, among them those in which you lamented my misfortunes and shared your faithful and indeed Christian advice with me; I replied to each of them, hoping you have received mine. Among other things, I wrote something ambiguous, as the irritation of the times demands, which I hope, for your skill and prudence, does not offend you.</p>
      <p>For by God's kindness, I remain who I always was, as you have also known me, and this has brought me no small amount of inconvenience and danger so far, thanks be to God, the Father of mercies. Furthermore, both treasures and lucrative positions have been offered to me to return to the papacy; but the Lord directed and preserved me by His power. I desire to know the state of the affairs of the excellent man Ambrosius Blaurer and his people. May they all be well; comfort them from me in the Lord and promise that if their needs can be met from my resources, I would prefer my children to lack rather than them; for we know for what reason they have reached such misery.</p>
      <p>Another matter is that almost the whole world knows into what state we Germans have been reduced and how the merciful Lord has chastised us; yet we are so far from repenting and admitting a reformation of life that we openly declare ourselves much worse in treachery, impiety, and arrogance than before. What do you think will happen? Peace? I foresee a much harsher correction.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us. A mission to you would have long since happened to me; but the cause was so honest and plausible that I entirely refused that duty. Oh my Bullinger, how cunningly Satan conducts his affairs. Farewell and convey all my greetings. February 19, 1549. You will further transmit the enclosed.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Spain has recently come to Munich, Bavaria, as it is said, with not a very large retinue. Some say he will celebrate the Bacchanalia in Augsburg, while others say he will quickly go to the Emperor. We will soon witness a new tragedy.</p>
      <p>The Saxons have not yet accepted the Interim.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Frölich (Laetus).</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, etc., a friend as a brother. Zürich.</p>
