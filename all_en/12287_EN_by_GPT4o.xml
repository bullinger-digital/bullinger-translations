    <p xml:id="regest1">Everything is in order; Blarer does not doubt Bullinger's discretion. - Matthäus [Molckenpur is currently recruiting] in [the Swiss Confederation on behalf of the Schmalkaldic League]; there is hope for a [successful mission]. Blarer has delivered two letters [No. 2237 and enclosure] through [Johannes Heilmann], the son of the schoolmaster [Augustin] Heilmann. One concerns [Johannes] Haab's letter to [Konrad Zwick] on the art of war, and the other contains [Martin] Bucer's report on [Hermann von Wied]. - Blarer has heard Bullinger's opinion on the bailiff [Leonhard Holzhalb] and hopes that his reception will be better than before. More on that another time. - He does not know if Bucer instigated the [Second Regensburg Religious Colloquy], especially since he is unlikely to participate due to his dispute with [Johannes] Gropper. The [religious colloquy] is pointless anyway. - Regarding the [Zurich] printers, Blarer only wanted to ask Bullinger to prevent [Balthasar Romätsch] from being disadvantaged. - Blarer has received the mill [sketch by Gerhard Westerburg] from Bibliander; [the construction of such a mill] is pure utopia! - Blarer regrets the defamation of Vadian by [unknown persons]. - [Johannes] a Lasco is undoubtedly a highly educated theologian, who, like other scholars, is in danger, as [Charles V] wishes to be much more a son of the Pope [Paul III] than a son of God. - Blarer is very grateful for Bullinger's commentary on Mark. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Indeed, everything is in order. I have no doubt whatsoever about your discretion, should you be reminded of those things which we do not think should be made public at this time. Everything is fine.</p>
      <p>Matthäus is currently recruiting among the others as well. Hoping to achieve the same success as with you. I have written two letters to you through our German schoolmaster's son, Heilmann, one from the mayor's letter to my dear cousin, in which he wrote that the military preparations should be halted at this time, etc.; the other from what Bucer wrote to me about the bishop of Cologne.</p>
      <p>I have well understood your opinion regarding the bailiff. May God grant that the reception will be better than it has been so far. I do not wish to speak further on this matter at this time; reasons will present themselves later to write more.</p>
      <p>As far as the colloquium is concerned, I truly do not know whether it was instigated by Bucer or others, since I do not think he will be a participant, considering that Gropper and he have become so entangled with each other. The colloquium is nothing more than a pretense and a sham; but whoever does not want to see this is utterly blind.</p>
      <p>Regarding the printers, I do not know how the situation stands. I only wanted to ask you to be there for them, so that they do not cut off the poor fellow's bread here, although they probably will not do so, God willing; but as much as it depends on you, you should prevent it and be there for him.</p>
      <p>The millwork stands in its worth. Theodorus has sent a sample printed on the letter. It will belong to the Republic of Plato and paint pictures, as much as those people in Utopia will need. It is indeed lovely to see on the letter!</p>
      <p>I regret Vadian's situation, since those - I do not know who these obscure miserable people are - abuse the splendor of his name to hinder his cause.</p>
      <p>Dr. Johannes a Lasco, no one who is candidly learned in sacred literature would not call him a most learned and sharp theologian; may Christ the Savior preserve him for his church for as long as possible. Ah, how he will be in danger with other most learned and excellent men, after the emperor prefers to be much more a son of the Roman pontiff than a son of God! May the Lord have mercy on him as soon as possible!</p>
      <p>For that more than excellent gift of your most splendid commentaries on Mark, I owe not greater thanks, but myself, if I were anything at all. May the Lord himself be your great reward and generously pour out from the fullness of his abundance whatever good you can wish for. Farewell well and perpetually in him with all yours. All of ours send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Greetings to the friends and brothers who are there! Commend us to the Lord. September 10th.</p>
