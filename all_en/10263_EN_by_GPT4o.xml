    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends Bullinger the promised items and asks him to pay Schuler's debts to a woman who is pressing him. Praises the friendship with Bullinger as well as the time they spent together in Bremgarten; the meanness experienced now makes the memory of it appear even more beautiful. Hopes for letters from Bullinger until an opportunity for a reunion arises. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dearest brother, what I promised to send, I now send having found an opportunity with the messenger. Therefore, the bearer of this letter will, as if bound by my debt, pay you on my behalf. Furthermore, I beg you to explain, so that the unfortunate impulse of this woman does not trouble me more. As for the fellowship of friends, there is nothing I lament more than not being able to enjoy your delightful companionship on any occasion. I have, my dear Heinrich, something that torments my mind, and the more so, the more I recall our shared friendship. The cause of this sorrow is somewhat alleviated by having once lived peacefully with you, not that I ever regretted my former condition, having spent pleasant days with you, but that having once tasted sweet things among so many bitter cups now almost weakens the strength of my mind and body. While I was with you in Bremgarten, I experienced your integrity as a friend everywhere sound and firm, which, after it had taken root in my mind, God willed that I, forced to go far away, should experience not a little danger to my soul and body from unfamiliar customs, perhaps so that by comparison of both, I might learn how much a sincere mind, ignorant of deceit, prevails. Therefore, the more I am attacked by the deceit of others, the more the memory of our former companionship, what shall I say, happiness, grows. Since, dearest brother, it is not possible on any occasion, especially in my current condition, for us to converse in person, I think you would do a great service if you would support your Gervasius with the soothing words of your letters, until an opportunity is given to unburden my mind in person.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my delight in the Lord. Please convey my warmest regards to your wife, who has always deserved well of me, along with your dearest children. Meanwhile, continue to pursue your Gervasius with your usual love. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given on the seventh day of June in the year one thousand five hundred and thirty-three, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius from the heart, deacon of the Basel church.</p>
      <p>To the man excelling in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed teacher.</p>
