      <p>S. I rejoice that I understand from my brother that your baths have benefited you well, and I pray to the Lord that they may increasingly contribute to strengthening your health. As for me, I am moderately well since I returned home; so also is Lord Brunner and all others who were with me, who also diligently greet you. I thank you and all of ours for your kindness and generosity with which you received us; we will repay it someday, if possible, when the opportunity presents itself. Otherwise, we have nothing new, except what I recently wrote to my brother about, that the matter of the provostry in Colmar (in which the emperor was also involved, as I told you when I walked with you through the city, where the Prince of Savoy acted in bad faith against us) has been settled. This same provostry has long been incorporated into the monastery and house in Bätterkingen, therefore the abbot of Bätterkingen, when my lords took over the land, went to Colmar and took the best foundations with him. However, he came to rest 3 years ago and resigned all letters and rights to my lords, and soon after died. My lords then took possession of the chapter and provostry in Colmar and occupied it. A bishop from Savoy wanted to interfere and brought so many complaints that the emperor took up the matter. But when my lords reported their rights to the emperor, he was satisfied, and the matter came to an agreement that my lords would give him 2000 crowns; with this, he relinquished all claims and all his rights, and the chapter and collation in Colmar, valued at 30,000 guilders, remained with my lords. From the court in France comes news that the Guises have all been dismissed from the court with disgrace. Some consider it a good sign; others worry that there is deceit behind it. The Duke of Guise and the Duke of Nemours are in Annecy, not far from Geneva, therefore the Genevans have strengthened their watches and guards and do not trust the matter well. Otherwise, negotiations are still ongoing regarding the marriage between the king's brother and the Queen of England. I wonder if the English will impose a significant burden on them. Between the king and the Duke of Guise, there is said to be a certain displeasure: The king had secluded himself in a room and instructed his chamberlain to let no one in except his brother; meanwhile, the Duke of Guise sent one of his pages with a note to the king; he wanted to go in (as is their custom and freedom); the chamberlain refused to let him in; the page reported this back to his master; he, enraged, sent him back, telling him to go in, regardless of what the chamberlain said; he wanted to do so; the chamberlain became displeased with him, to the extent that the king heard it, came out to see what was happening, and when he understood, ordered the page to leave with displeasure. Thereupon, the Duke of Guise sent for the chamberlain, expostulated with him, and ordered him to puff up his cheeks, whereupon he (which is the greatest disgrace among them) struck him, causing him to bleed. He then ran to the king, bloody, and reported it to him, whereupon the king became so enraged that he drew his sword and wanted to attack the Duke of Guise in person to avenge the disgrace, but was restrained and held back by other lords and servants. When the Duke of Guise learned of this, he, along with others of his house, quickly departed. Our Diesbach reported this to me; I sell it with the same faith with which I bought it. Otherwise, I have nothing. In Italy, something new is said to be arising. The king is strengthening his fortresses on the frontier, which he still holds, such as Saluzzo, etc., and is concerned that there is a plot against him, sending much cavalry and infantry there.</p>
      <p>Our Aretias has gone to Heidelberg to see if he can bring Ursinus to Lausanne; he is equipped with letters to him and to the prince. Hail has also damaged the crops here in recent days; yet, by God's grace, it has not gone far.</p>
      <p>The wine stands well with us, and the fruit; otherwise, there is concern about a greater shortage of grain than last year. May the Lord protect everything and have mercy on the poverty of the world!</p>
      <p>Forgive me for writing somewhat carelessly. The consuls and treasurers greet you, one of whom will soon send you a description of our republic. The steward of Küngsfelden, who is now with us to render an account of his stewardship, also sends his greetings. He is preparing to describe certain things for you, which he will soon bring to you himself. My father-in-law and the whole company of friends, especially Mr. Diesbach, wish you all the best.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 26, 1571.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends and brothers in my name, especially those of your household.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours entirely.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
