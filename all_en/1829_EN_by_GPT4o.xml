      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I am writing in my private study and for myself alone several volumes, indeed some collections, on the controversial matter of today. The first volume is about Divine Providence, by which all things happen and are governed. The second is that God is not the author of sin, and about the true cause of sin. The third is about necessity and the free will of man. The fourth is about the foreknowledge and predestination of God. The fifth is about election and reprobation. The sixth is about faith. The seventh contains explanations of certain passages such as Isaiah 6, Matthew 12, Acts 28, John 12, 6, 17, Acts 2, 13, 14, Romans 8, 9, 11. The eighth contains various opinions of scholars on this matter. Since I have thus far shared all my private studies with you in friendship, I will also share these my vigils with you, and so I have given your brother the first two volumes to be copied for you. I have outlined the main points of the entire matter. Pray to God to grant me the strength to complete it, if it is to be done for the glory of His name. I am not sending the written work on discipline now.</p>
      <p>For in these days it was not possible to reply. It seems that you have prudently responded. I do not think our people would respond much differently, if they were to ask our opinion.</p>
      <p>We do not know these things here yet. Some seem to be moved by good zeal. For they avoid the licentious and impure life of the pseudo-evangelicals, whom they think to bring into order. But whether this is the way they are entering, I fear and doubt whether they can reach the goal. I fear that under the pretext of discipline, more people are seeking something unknown. May the Lord break their wicked attempts. I certainly see that the ancients, in such disputes about satisfactions and reconciliations, have harshly stumbled in truth, so that from there later arose wrong opinions about satisfactions and merits of works, about auricular confession and I do not know what else. Therefore, I think we must be vigilant, lest, while we strive to lead away from the left, we crash too much into the right. The Lord's Supper, which He wanted to be universal, will be reduced by the laws of these men to a few, and will henceforth be almost a reward for those who seem to have behaved well externally. From these principles, a private examination before the supper will certainly arise. From there, confession will be born to us. What we have barely cast out will return. Therefore, I think we must be vigilant. What Zwingli judged about this matter, he explained in the "Friendly Exegesis," near the end of the first part, folio 150: "Hence we who are brothers in Zurich" etc. You will find it in larger form on page 359b, T2. Those who are punished for crimes are excommunicated. If only we could achieve that those who sin wickedly are restrained. If we begin to mix sacred things with these, we will feel many errors arising. The innovations are burdensome to me, especially those brought forth by those who are ready every day to bring something new. If it is allowed today, then tomorrow it will be something else, and there is no end. I do not know what some are seeking and with what spirit. I fear that pride and the desire for power may lie in many hearts. God forgive me if I am wrong. If I am right, may He set them at peace, so that their minds may be more at rest.</p>
      <p>Farewell eternally with Dr. Musculus and the other fellow ministers.</p>
