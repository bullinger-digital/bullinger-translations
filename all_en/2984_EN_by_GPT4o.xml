      <p>Whenever I sent letters to Mr. Guarnerius and our Mr. Lelio, I earnestly requested them to visit you, to greet you respectfully on my behalf, and to inform you of everything, which I do not doubt they have done. Now, from my letters to Mr. Guarnerius and some writings, you will understand the state of our affairs, and Mr. Julius Maresius of Belluno, a learned man whom the Lord rescued through me from the cave of Francis, will tell you many things. He comes there with the intention of enjoying your pious and learned company. He wishes to be a companion of Mr. Bernardino or Mr. Pellicanus; as he will receive him, he will receive from me each year as much as he orders. I ask that you also embrace this novice in the Christian arena with your usual charity. He was a doctor of theology in the papacy from a noble family. I write this so that you are not ignorant of anything.</p>
      <p>How pleasing your letters were to the Polish church, you will know from the responses that I send to you. May the Lord preserve you for a long time for His church. Greet on my behalf your excellent wife, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, and, if I may dare, the most distinguished men, the consuls, the chief scribe, and the treasurers.</p>
      <p>Given from the Sarmatian Hermitage on August 14, 1556. Yours, Franz Lismanini.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in doctrine and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
