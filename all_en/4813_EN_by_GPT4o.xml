      <p>Greetings. These letters, reverend father in Christ, have been with me for quite some time because I knew they were of no importance; however, so as not to neglect the duty of a good man, I am sending them. Martin has been detained in Avers; but now, having been summoned to the synod, he will be examined, and as I suspect, he will hardly remain. You can understand his level of education from the address on the letters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when he first came to us, we were very surprised why you called him eloquent in your letters. If you wish to reply, he will be here soon at the synod, etc.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Maynard sent us a booklet by Peter Leon, which contains not only many absurdities but also impieties, and indeed Michael Angelus and others are said to have subscribed to it, whom the author also mentions honorably in that booklet. Therefore, since we clearly see what those lost men are seeking, we will not be the authors, as far as it is in our power, to have the confession of the Clavenna church removed. But I already foresee disturbances, and unless God is singularly present for his church, the Italians will overthrow both themselves and the church.</p>
      <p>The one who came to you is quite arrogant and associates in that valley with such people, of whom this region has none more corrupt. It is said for certain that he from the Quadri family, the founder of the Jesuit school, has passed away.</p>
      <p>I have no new news now.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ; for I do not wish to trouble you with the bishop's business, which is so intricate and perplexing that it would take a long time to unravel all kinds of treachery. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Written in haste in Chur, May 24, in the year of our Lord 1561. Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his ever-honored lord and patron. To Mr. H. Bullinger.</p>
