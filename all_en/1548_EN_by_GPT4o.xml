      <p>Truly, the deceitfulness of people in our time is often a great harm to me, as things that I commend with great zeal and diligence are not returned to friends in good faith. Not long ago, a certain man from Thurgau, known to me for many years, received twelve letters from me to be delivered to brothers and dearest friends. He was treated very hospitably at my home for two days and was also provided with a considerable travel allowance. However, when he reached Solothurn, by chance he encountered some soldiers he knew, and, enticed by some strange promises, he went off to serve as a soldier. He neither took care to deliver my letters to those to whom they were addressed nor returned them to me, but either discarded them somewhere never to be found or, though I am reluctant to believe it, still carries them in his pocket, or perhaps has foolishly destined them for some other use. This matter greatly distresses me, especially because of those letters I had written to some prominent friends in Augsburg, although all of them are such that, if he were serving in the Emperor's camp, I would be tormented by a justified fear of not insignificant danger. I received all your letters, but none of them promptly, except for the one that Witenbach sent from Bern on January 20th, dated by you on January 5th.</p>
      <p>My calling to the church in Winterthur is still entirely in the Lord's hands and keeps me exceedingly anxious for various and very serious reasons. As for you, my dear Bullinger, since you have now once and again dissuaded me, I can easily guess by whom you have been persuaded. If only some were as diligent in their duty as they are overly impatient with Christian admonitions. Friends write that I have been reported to you beyond my merit by those from whom I deserved much better, about whom I have always spoken honorably and whose authority I have always greatly desired to remain inviolate, and who rather owed me great gratitude for those on whose behalf they are so unjust to me.</p>
      <p>But none of this would deter me at all; the one thing that troubles me is that I hear the matter, conducted with secret judges, has been reported to you much differently than it actually is, since it is difficult not to trust those whom you judge to be the best men. But I restrain myself; one day time will reveal how much injury I have suffered here.</p>
      <p>You, if ever before, now also diligently implore the heavenly Father through Christ Jesus with full prayers, that He may simply resolve my entangled, doubtful, and plainly wavering plans with His certain spirit, so that I may not deviate even a little from the best rule of His will. I certainly desire that the small remainder of my life be consecrated and devoted to Christ and His church wherever and however He wills.</p>
      <p>For your very learned Antithesis, I am greatly grateful to you, and I do not think you have regretted the effort, especially since none of the topics that are controversial today have been omitted. I sent several German copies to Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Our Johannes Welser has already written to me, instructing me to greet you reverently and dutifully in his name, and to earnestly request that he be supported by your holy patronage before the Lord.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends and brothers, all of whom I uniquely desire to be supported by the Lord's holy patronage, especially yours.</p>
      <p>Greet your household. Farewell, my dearest and best Bullinger, and love me steadfastly. January 27th. Give my regards to our Butzler, a very good man.</p>
