      <p>Greetings. When my nephew Josua Bullinger, son of my brother, decided to travel to St. Gallen to procure certain goods related to his craft, I could not refrain from writing you this brief letter to greet you and to convey my most respectful regards and all my service to your honorable father, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother. I also wanted to inform you that I, along with my family, indeed all of us, are in good health by the grace of God. Everything is quite peaceful, except that our confederates are continually thinking about diminishing the preaching of the Gospel and promoting Papism. You have no doubt heard what they attempted and accomplished in Glarus. Now there is also fear that they may bring great danger to our common homeland with their mercenary wars; for the more prudent believe they will undertake a new military expedition. You are not unaware that the Pope and King Philip, son of Charles V, are engaged in a very serious war with each other. The Pope has involved the illustrious Republic of Venice and several notable Italian princes, including the Duke of Urbino, the Duke of Ferrara, and others I do not know. He certainly has the most obedient support of the French, for he hopes to gain Naples, Sicily, and Lombardy; but our confederates follow the French banners. I see these things happening not without divine will; for God has begun to avenge the blood of His own. The Emperor, the Pope, Maurice of Saxony, Albert of Brandenburg, and German, Spanish, and Italian soldiers have united; they have oppressed Germany with a grievous war and have marked it with the most shameful deeds. Suddenly, however, withdrawing from the siege of Magdeburg, they attack the Emperor and put him to flight. Who would have thought this? The people of Nuremberg also pay the penalty. German, Spanish, and Italian soldiers fall in great numbers at the city of Metz. Albert is driven into flight not far from Magdeburg by the Saxon, and he himself falls with many. Therefore, all and each have received their rewards. The Pope remains; he has now begun to disagree with his defender; he draws with him the French, the Swiss, and some Italian princes. What is this but that the Most High and Most Just is contemplating vengeance. Let us pray: Thy will be done; deliver us from evil. A star has shone forth early on these matters.</p>
      <p>While repentance is inculcated in vain, a more severe discipline follows.</p>
      <p>We receive nothing but sad news from England. Many fall bravely for the faith of Jesus Christ. In Saxony, there are great struggles concerning religion. Melanchthon writes to me that he expects the usual exile of the church; Illyricus has declared war on him. But many are offended by such disputes. Woe to the world because of offenses. From Hungary and about the diets, we have no certain news here; I expect nothing favorable from there. I wanted to share these brief comments with you to provide you with an opportunity to write back.</p>
      <p>I commend to you my nephew.</p>
      <p>Greet the reverend doctors of your church, my dearest brothers and fellow ministers. Farewell along with all good people.</p>
      <p>May Bartholomäus Steck, Caspar Hüseli, Johannes Jakob Graff, etc., fare well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 13, 1556.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man of virtue and most esteemed faith, Josua Keßler, chief scribe of the city of St. Gallen, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. St. Gallen.</p>
