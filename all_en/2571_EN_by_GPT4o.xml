      <p>Greetings. In recent days, I met the noble Mr. Gregor von Ulm, who instructed me to write this to you in his name. Last week, he was in Frauenfeld and the president asked him again for that document about the fine of the Lutheran people of Luggar. Then he asked the president if he had already sent it to him with a preface of forgiveness; for he had seen nothing in it that he could take offense at. Then the president responded to him with these words: "The gentlemen may perhaps have something similar in mind to handle with the Thurgau and all the common authorities; they have ordered to send such a document, so that he may see himself in it, reflect on himself, and prepare himself, so that such a thing may be spared against him; it may happen to him in all good fortune."</p>
      <p>Then he wanted to fully disclose to the president the purpose of his mind and give an account of his life lived so far, as well as his faith, but immediately people intervened, through whom their conversation was disturbed, and in the meantime, he spoke nothing with him about this matter, although he was with him and spoke with him about other things; for he made no mention of it and had no opportunity. He also reported this to me, which he thought should be communicated to you: Dr. Georg von Schwalbach, the vicar in Tobel, told him in recent days, when they were talking about these matters, that the abbot of St. Gallen had advised him to walk cautiously and prudently manage his province, with this reason added: "The five places are finally willing to make a breach through the peace of the land." What he has entrusted to his bosom as a friend, he wishes to remain so, not to be divulged. These are the things he deemed worth writing to you in his name. Therefore, consider these things well and do not cease to watch over us (as you do). Farewell in the Lord, who may preserve you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Hieronymus Emporus.</p>
      <p>On the first of March.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and faithful minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, archbishop of the church in Zurich, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
