Zwick anxiously awaits the report of the envoys about the Bundestag [in Arnstadt]; there are concerning plans heard from the people of Konstanz to ally with the Confederates - even with those who are hostile to the Reformation. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I rejoice in your health, which the Lord in His goodness may make long-lasting. I am deeply affected by the illness of John Butler; for he has always seemed to me to have a most sincere spirit towards God. Hence, I pray that he may be restored.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius has not yet returned, but he is on his way; may the good angels of God accompany him.</p>
      <p>Oh, if only, if only, if only the assemblies do not fall into vice; thus I cry out to the Lord with you. We are now waiting to see what the envoys will bring. But, oh brother, is it permissible to pour something into your bosom? They say that our people, that is, the people of Konstanz, are seeking some sort of alliance with yours; now, I do not understand yours to mean only those who have given their names to our religion, but also those who are almost sworn to the destruction of our religion. Oh, in my judgment, these are slippery plans, oh vain confidence!</p>
      <p>Farewell, my brother, and love me. December 17, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife, children, mother, and excellent brothers.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, esteemed brother. Zurich.</p>
