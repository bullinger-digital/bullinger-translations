      <p>God be with us, beloved son, I would have liked to write to you, but I have no time or opportunity to do so. There is a new uprising planned by the Five Cantons and their followers in France; they are hurrying and intend to arrive in Baden on September 29. But God sees all this; may He direct it according to His will. Amen. Since it has been arranged that this horse is to be brought to Froschauer in Basel, give him the things you have prepared for me. Write to me what it costs, and have it ready in time for the journey in the morning, so that it arrives here by midday on Wednesday. Also, speak with him so that he does not delay or lose anything, and that he is diligent and travels safely.</p>
      <p>Greet Susanna for us, may God grant her health, and Elisabeth as well. I am completely overwhelmed, having to write many letters. I can say nothing more to you than God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated September 20, in the evening around 5 o'clock, 1568. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger in Berg.</p>
