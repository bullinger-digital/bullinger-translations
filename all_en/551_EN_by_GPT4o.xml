      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you recently, when the reformation of the churches had not yet been published. Now, a month or two ago, a book was published, which the English churches received with the utmost fairness. I am sending a Latin summary of this book to Lord Vadianus with the condition that he shares it with you. You will see that the essence of the doctrine is not to be criticized, although certain ceremonies are included in that book, which might seem useless, perhaps even harmful, unless interpreted with a candid interpretation. But in matters of religion, which is the greatest concern in the whole of nature, I believe there should be no playing with ambiguity or verbal tricks. There will also be something to criticize regarding the matter of the Lord's Supper: for the book speaks obscurely, and even if you try to interpret it candidly, you will not be able to escape a great absurdity. The reason is that the bishops could not agree among themselves for a long time on this article, and there was much and long debate among them about whether transubstantiation should be established or rejected. You see, therefore, as a certain argument, that these men do not have true and solid foundations of doctrine, who labor much in the smallest and even absurd matters, and neglect those in which they should have worked especially hard. But this is the fate of the church, that the greater part overcomes the better, and although many things are polished, some things are nevertheless left [in Greek]. We must hope for better things. Meanwhile, this reformation is not to be despised, especially in this kingdom, where previously there was in the public form of doctrine true papism without the name. Now Anabaptists and other fanatical spirits are arising, who will trouble the church. Thus we will always be in this life under the cross and in very trying exercise. Bucer and Paulus Fagius have come here safely. They are currently at the court of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and will come to this university within two months, where they will profess sacred literature. I recently wrote to Lord Bibliander and Gesner, whom you will now greet diligently in my name, along with Lord Pellican and Frisius.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Cambridge, 5th of June, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
