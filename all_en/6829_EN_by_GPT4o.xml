      <p>Most illustrious man, most esteemed friend and brother in Christ, I received your letters, which you wrote to me from Augsburg on March 12th, and I read the booklets attached to them with pleasure. I would have replied and given thanks sooner if my continuous labors had allowed me to do so. I suppose you have learned from your delegates what was done at the Diet in Augsburg, but you will hear these things... and I kindly ask you to place full trust in the excellent man, Mr. Peter Datheen. Please convey my greetings to Mr. Wolf, a learned man and most dear to all good people, in my name. The reason I have not written more to you will be explained by Mr. Datheen. Farewell and continue to love us, as you have begun, without ceasing. Heidelberg, July 3rd, 1566. Yours sincerely, Christoph Ehem.</p>
