    <p xml:id="regest1">Gast is pleased that the [Zurichers] were able to settle their dispute and thus did not give the world any reason for schadenfreude.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The chronicle of [Johannes] Nauclerus is not available [in Basel], but [Johannes] Oporin can bring it from the Frankfurt fair at a cheaper price. So much for [Bullinger's] last letter [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Following [Bullinger's] earlier letter [not received]: So far, Gast has not been able to learn anything certain about [the Schmalkaldic Diet in Frankfurt]. Gast expects a letter from [Mathias] Limberger daily, who will report something reliable. Count Palatine [Friedrich II.] and [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse, the Cologne [Arch]bishop [Hermann von Wied] and the Mainz [Arch]bishop [Sebastian von Heusenstamm] are negotiating in Frankfurt. Also, an envoy [...] of the Trier [Archbishop Johann IV. Ludwig von Hagen] as well as many barons and cities [came there]. Even Emperor [Charles V.] has sent [Nicolas Perrenot de] Granvelle there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [Charles V.] is suffering from [syphilis] again. - [Johann] Funck has not yet published the second part of the "Chronologia"; but Gast will keep an eye on it and send it when it is published. Gast sends [Johannes] Brenz's ["In Exodum... commentarii"]. If Bullinger wants anything further, he should let him know.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger has long heard the story of the chaplain Niklaus [Petri]; otherwise, Gast would soon send it to him, for he has described Petri's life and death.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- There is no reliable news about Alsace. The end of the [Frankfurt Diet] is awaited. [King] Ferdinand demands 2000 guilders from the provosts and abbots [in Hungary]. Myconius will report more about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [P.S.:] [Johannes] Herwagen is printing [the works of] Cyril [of Alexandria] in the translation of [Wolfgang] Musculus and other scholars, as well as Luther's "[Enarrationes seu] Postillae".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The Froben press is printing [the works of] Hippocrates in the [Latin] translation of [Janus] Cornarius and the "Adagia" of Erasmus [of Rotterdam]; likewise, the "Disputatio adversus gentes" in eight books by Arnobius [the Elder].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Heinrich Petri is printing the Hebrew Bible with the Latin translation of Sebastian Münster and the works of Boethius.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- [Hieronymus] Curio is publishing the [“Onomasticon”] and [the dictionary of] Calepinus. [Nikolaus] Brylinger is printing [works for] school use. [Bartholomäus] Westheimer is bringing out almost nothing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- [Michael] Isengrin is printing the works of [Andrea] Alciato. At Oporin, so many different things are appearing that [Gast] cannot write them all down, including the "Loci communes" by [Philipp] Melanchthon in an expanded and improved form.</p>

      <p>S. in domino. Blessed be God the Father through Jesus Christ, that the spark of discord has been extinguished by the best ministers of Christ at the right time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2">
      <p>I also rejoice that you have such right and suitable minds for concord, which, if they stray a little, are easily brought back to the path. May the Lord protect your church from all kinds of dissensions, so that you do not offer yourselves to the world, which desires nothing else than that you should disagree in every way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The chronicle of Nauclerus recently printed is not available; but if you desire the book, I will arrange for it to be brought from the Frankfurt fair by Oporin at a cheaper price than you could buy it. This in response to your last letter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In response to your earlier letters: So far, I have not been able to write anything certain about various matters; therefore, I have remained silent. There are various rumors, but mostly trivial. I expect daily letters from my Limperg, which will provide more certainty, although I know this: the Count Palatine, the Landgrave, the bishops - of Cologne, of Mainz - are negotiating in Frankfurt. The envoy of the bishop of Trier has joined them. Many barons and cities, which give their name to the gospel, are also gathering. Nor is the Emperor absent from his duty; he has sent Granvelle to Frankfurt, who will either disturb the plans of the pious with his cunning quibbles or propose the business entrusted to him by the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Emperor is suffering from a very severe illness. He has fought against the French again and has become French. Merchants report this consistently. The second part of the chronology by Funck has not yet been published, but I will keep watch. If it is published, I will send it. Accept Brenz and, if you want anything else, command me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>You have long received the story of Mr. Nicholas, the chaplain of the Church of St. Peter. However, if you do not yet know it, I will soon send it; for I have described his life and end; he died a Christian in the greatest torments.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I have no certain news about Alsace. They are awaiting the end of those assemblies. Ferdinand demands 2000 guilders from the provosts, abbots, etc., who want to deliberate for a month's time. But in vain do the wretched consult, and unless they give immediately, the sum will undoubtedly increase. See how the poor king gnaws at money everywhere.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Myconius will add much, as he promised. Basel, February 22, 1546. Greet the brothers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Your Gastius. Cyril, augmented with a new volume, translated by Musculus and other learned men, is being printed by Herwagen, and Luther's Postilla.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The Froben press is printing Hippocrates, translated by Cornarius, and the Adagia of Erasmus, likewise the Disputation against the Gentiles in eight books by Arnobius.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Heinrich Petri is printing the Hebrew and Latin Bible of Münster and all the works of Boethius.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Curio is publishing the Lexicon and Calepinus. Brylinger is printing scholastic works. Westheimer is bringing out almost nothing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Isengrin is printing the works of Alciato. However, what our Oporin has published, I cannot now write due to so many different booklets; he has subjected the Common Places of Philipp to the press, expanded and changed in many places.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
