  <input>Heinrychus Bullingerus Heinrycho Buchtero salutem et christianam innocentiam a deo per Christum.

Aristotiles [!] ille Stragirites [!], in philosophorum albo haudquaquam postremus, adeo putabat ad morum corruptelam picturas lascivas facere, ut non dubitarit principes admonere, legibus istas penitus esse proscribendas. Eo igitur flagitiosius foret, si quispiam christianorum eo raperetur dementiae, ut id sibi ceu augustum sumeret, quod tanta indignatione a gentibus videt esse repulsum. Cumque hoc ipsum ego non ignorarem, adeo demens non fui, ut id pingi curarem, quod mihi meam fidem certo senseram obscuraturum. Quod ergo finxi, ita pingi curavi, ut non modo aphrodisium non esset, sed ne a maximis quidem nostrae religionis dissentiret mysteriis. Id quod et libello hoc affatim ostendimus, quem tibi in praesentiarum dedicamus, potissimum vero, ut intelligas eiusmodi picturam, qualem tu Tiguri nuper ex officina primum redeuntem vidisti, non dedecere coenobitas et homines bonis litteris deditos, deinde, ut videas et apud christianos, nedum apud Graecorum Alcibiadem, superesse Silenos.

Vale.

  <output>Henry Bullinger greets Henry Bucher with peace and Christian innocence from God through Christ. 

Aristotle, the famous philosopher from Stageira, was of the opinion that lascivious paintings lead to moral corruption and he did not hesitate to advise rulers to completely outlaw them. It would therefore be even more shameful if a Christian were to be so demented as to take it upon himself to do something which had been so vehemently rejected by other nations. Knowing this, I was not so foolish as to have a painting made which I believed would compromise my faith. What I did have painted was done in such a way that it was not only not erotic, but did not even contradict the greatest mysteries of our religion. This we have explained in full in our little book, which we dedicate to you here and now, principally in order that you understand that such a painting as you saw recently on your return from the printer in Zurich does not disgrace monks and men devoted to good literature, and secondarily in order that you may see that among Christians, at least, there are still some Silenuses, not only among the Greeks like Alcibiades.

Farewell.

3rd April 1527.</output>
