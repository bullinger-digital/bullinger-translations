      <p>S. D. I desire your letters, most excellent man and dearest of friends, no less eagerly than you desire mine; but since the reason for both of us is equally excusable, let neither of us blame the other. Indeed, we are and will always be present even when absent. May the Lord, I implore, remove your illness or at least so alleviate it that you may continue manfully in your salutary endeavors. You will do a service to our common cause and duty if you respond to the Saxons, especially to Westphalus, which I think should be done with little effort, although it requires prolixity.</p>
      <p>I received the copies of the "Sum of Faith" with eager spirit and give you perpetual thanks for such a great gift. The books are now being bound most elegantly, one of which I will offer to the most illustrious Prince Otto Heinrich, Elector Palatine, etc., in your name at the first opportunity, a gift worthy of a prince, and I will make sure that he either reads it himself or hears it read; the other will be my memorial of you above gold, etc.</p>
      <p>The Elector Palatine of the Rhine has passed away in these days. Therefore, Otto Heinrich is now on his way to take the provinces of the Electorate, both of the Rhine and Upper Bavaria, into his dominion. I have been summoned as a companion and hope that within seven or eight days we will arrive in Heidelberg. I am most eager to promote the glory of Christ and will move every stone so that the truth, especially concerning the sacraments, may shine more clearly. In these regions, we have long since torn down and abolished altars and images; now I am focused on how to deprive the sacramental idol of its power. I hope your confession will greatly aid these efforts, and I am hopeful that if this prince survives three or four years, he will overthrow the papacy by sitting and resting. Indeed, I neither trust nor boast in the arm of flesh, but I rejoice and congratulate excessively that the enemies of truth are instilled with fear due to the increased number of electors. For while the papists boast about the peace between the Emperor and the French, they will be disturbed by the entry of our prince into the electorate.</p>
      <p>I sheltered Leonhart Riethart in my house for some time due to the inclement weather, then sent him with letters of recommendation to the prince, from where he has not yet returned. What will happen with him, time will tell. He seems to be well-mannered; others will judge later about his learning and constancy.</p>
      <p>Adelsm端ller is in bad repute at the royal court, although I believe he is falsely accused. What kind of favor he has with our prince, I do not know. There is a rumor that he has promised much in alchemical matters; if so, I pity both the prince and him, because nothing can be achieved in this matter except a certain sweet impoverishment.</p>
      <p>The Pope with his followers is plotting something against Germany. Ferdinand has hope for a truce with the Turk. Therefore, we must be vigilant. You pray for Laetus, and I for my most desired Heinrich. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, as I had to mount my horse. March 3, in the year etc. 56.</p>
      <p>Yours, G[eorg] L[aetus].</p>
      <p>I wish the church of Z端rich, the ministers... individually and Haller... Musculus to be well.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man in piety and doctrine, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Z端rich, a friend bound by the closest ties. Z端rich.</p>
