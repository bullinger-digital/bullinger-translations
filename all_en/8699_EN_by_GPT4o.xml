      <p>As for Merius, a naturally contentious man rightly depicted by you in his true colors, I certainly do not fear that he will receive anything other than the just and due reward for his actions; he has thus aroused the anger and indignation of many against himself. - What I recently added about Flavio Gargano is so serious that I fear to commit the gravity of the case and our danger to writing. He was a Neapolitan monk and a few years ago was driven into our regions from Italy on account of religion, as he claimed. He humbled himself so much that he even took on the duty of preaching at the gates of Italy, and made himself so familiar with the brethren that he deceived all who were there with his flattery and feigned miseries. Seeing that Christ was too poor to be able to indulge in pontifical luxury, he immediately turned his cunning mind to the courts of the princes and gradually insinuated himself into the number of friends of the royal orator. It is said that the Corinthian Lais is the cause of this, that such a man, an exile, if it pleases the gods, was received by such people. After scarcely two years of exile, he returned to Rome, where he could be safe and, as it is rumored, was honorably received and dismissed, having completed an oratorical mission. However, the suspicion grew daily that he was designated as a spy with pontifical privilege and stipend, so that if any religious men from our regions went to Milan, they would be intercepted by his indication, as indeed happened to some from that time; and by the same arts, our good Cellarius was also taken away, etc.</p>
      <p>The suspicion thus grew to the point that there was much talk for a long time about certain pontifical letters, by which he was given the right and freedom to act as a traitor in our churches. Now there are those who not only affirm this but also utter some other horrendous things about such a man. Therefore, having been thrown into chains, he was immediately freed again by the work of mercenaries, having promised bail with a pledge of 2000 crowns. However, the distinguished man, so involved in such suspicions, is not driven to a confession of more certain deeds. But he feigned illness and will also escape safely with impunity; thus, those great captains and bloodthirsty men of ours labor for him. We will await the outcome of the matter, but not without great danger to ourselves, the account of which can only be explained in person. - The Roman beast is trying to subjugate this Rhaetia not only through such spies but also by another far more cunning and pernicious way. I have already sent you a certain pontifical diploma to read, in which the pope gives John Planta the power to invade and occupy all ecclesiastical benefices, which the regulars have long used, so that they may be restored to their former and idolatrous use, the privilege of which I send to you again with the condition that I receive it back as soon as possible. What would that Rhaetian do?</p>
      <p>They occupied the monastery of St. Ursula and Margaret Tell in the Valtellina, certain Guiccardi, serious and honest men, and not by their own or pontifical authority, but with the consent of the lords of the Rhaetians, to whom such benefices uniquely belong, and which were once converted to a good end, serving only poor Christians and the propagation of the gospel. Now, however, on October 22, that Rhaetian went to Tell and brought his son with him along with his brother Conrad and, without consulting the lords of the Rhaetians, warned the Guiccardi family to remember the pontifical mandate to leave that monastery of the Humiliati and restore everything. When they refused to do so, since it would go against religion and the commands of the lords, he proceeded and by the immediate authority of the pope took possession of it and conferred all the benefices on his son and, having made a proclamation, ensured that the tenants were ordered not to recognize anyone other than himself as the legitimate lord. This was confirmed by the prefect of Tell and the prefect who resides in Sondrio; all did this against right with the greatest contempt for the lords. Now that case will be dealt with at the Martinian fair. Thus began the fury, which, having started against us by the Italians, will end, and in those places, the drones will reign, etc. We must certainly be vigilant, lest that beast can achieve these things.</p>
      <p>The Planta themselves downplay everything and say that nothing significant is being dealt with, as you will understand from the letters of Mr. Conradin... I ask you to write your advice on this matter; for we are troubled because of it. We will not endure this tyranny."</p>
