      <p>To the honorable and pious Marx Rosen, «grace and peace from God the Father and our Savior Jesus Christ» [Titus 1:4].</p>
      <p>Since you have conducted yourself honorably, honestly, and in a Christian manner among us, especially in loyalty and service towards everyone, but most of all towards me, I could not refrain from writing you something from which you might receive improvement and benefit, so that your service to me does not remain unrewarded.</p>
      <p>«First, I thank God through Jesus Christ» [Romans 1:8], that He has led you, by His grace and boundless mercy, into the knowledge of His divine word, so that you recognize your insignificance inherited from Adam and therefore seek Christ alone, «whom God has set forth as a mercy seat» [Romans 3:25], advocate, reconciliation, redeemer, righteousness, savior, and wisdom. «For it was God's good pleasure that in Him alone all fullness should dwell and that all things should be reconciled through Him to Himself, whether on earth or in heaven, thereby» - as Paul says -, «making peace through the blood of His cross through Himself» [Colossians 1:19f].</p>
      <p>And truly, we are by nature «nothing but children of wrath» [Ephesians 2:3], from which God's unfathomable mercy shines forth: «For by grace we are saved through faith, and that not of ourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast» [Ephesians 2:8f]. But we are obliged to do the works, namely those that God teaches us through faith and scripture, not self-invented works, which never pleased Saul: 1 Samuel 15 [1 Sam 15:1 ff]. Solomon speaks of this in Proverbs 3: «Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not rely on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight» [Proverbs 3:5f]. See, these are Christian works: doing all things in faith, surrendering everything to Him and letting Him govern, while loving others and doing to others what we would want them to do to us [Matthew 7:12]; Romans 12 [9ff] and 13 [8ff]; also 1 John 3 [11ff]. «Blessed be God and the Father of Jesus Christ» [2 Corinthians 1:3], who has enlightened you so that you can recognize how God works all things in all [1 Corinthians 12:6]. For as the prophet says, His is the day, His is the night [Psalm 74:16] and He changes times and seasons; and Paul: «There is one Lord, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all» [Ephesians 4:5f]. If this had been known to the pious Job, he could have been very patient; for he knew that his sickness and poverty were from God. Also David, when he said: «If it pleases the Lord, I will return to my kingdom. But if He says: you do not please me, then I am ready» [2 Samuel 15:25f]. So learn, my dear brother Marx, to thank God, your Lord, and entrust everything to Him, trust God, your Father, in all things and in heartfelt prayer. You have, thank God, shown a good beginning towards me in that you attribute your affairs solely to God the Lord. You now visibly see and hold how God, without your counsel, action, and merit, has placed you in honor and good. He has done this so that you may learn to trust Him and thank Him. For thus He has always drawn the children of Israel to Himself through goodness. Therefore, you should now conduct yourself in your affairs, have God before your eyes, and trust Him, for He not only gives the body and honor but also all good things.</p>
      <p>It is written in John 10 [28], that no one will snatch the sheep of Christ from Christ's hand; therefore, He also calls Himself a shepherd [John 10:11]. From this, it is clear that we must entrust our souls to God the Lord, and if this is so, who would not be willing to entrust their body to God? But He offers Himself, how He will be preserved by Him, when we have God's word spoken through the prophet in Psalm 37 [Ps 37:3-5, 7, 25]: «Trust in the Lord and do good, dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness. Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the Lord, trust in Him, and He will do it. Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for Him. I have been young and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his descendants begging bread».</p>
      <p>See, dear brother, these are the words of God; they cannot fail. If you now have faith in His aforementioned words, well for you, and you should daily ask God to grant you grace so that you may believe in them. No less is it, when temptation comes, and so hard that you think you must perish, remain steadfast in faith. For if you are faithful, «God cannot deny Himself» [2 Timothy 2:13]; He must keep what He has promised. We read that He tested the pious Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Job. He allowed Abraham to take his beautiful wife Sarah, called him out of his father's land, yet gave him not even a foot of ground to possess [Acts 7:5]. God took Job's body and goods. But they remained steadfast in faith, they were not forsaken and came to great wealth. So you should work earnestly according to God's command, for it is written: «By the sweat of your face you will eat bread» [Genesis 3:19], and let God govern. Leave the care to Him and take upon yourself the work or labor and read in the Gospel of Matthew 6 and Luke 12 [Mt 6:25ff; Lk 12:22ff]. Do not let Jacob, the holy patriarch, leave your heart, who, although he had not a handbreadth in Mesopotamia, Syria, became rich through God and his labor: Genesis 29 [1 ff; 30,25 ff].</p>
      <p>So I have spoken, that you have received honor and goods, and that is why it is written in Genesis 1 and 2: «And God blessed them and said to them: Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth» etc. [Genesis 1:28]. «A man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh» [Genesis 2:24]. From this, you should understand how you should conduct your marital status and how you should keep your wife, so that you remain in honor and good.</p>
      <p>First, the marital status is rightly conducted when one raises children to the honor of God, of which there is no need to speak now, as one otherwise knows well what belongs to marital duty. But that you always have the word of God before you, take for yourself and read the 7th chapter of the first to the Corinthians. How one must and should raise children, you have in the last book of Moses: Deuteronomy 7 [6,20ff].</p>
      <p>Secondly, you should keep your wife as your own flesh. Therefore, Paul says: «Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her, to make her holy» etc. [Ephesians 5:25f]. «So also husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church» etc., Ephesians 5 [28 f]. So also Peter says: «Husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered» [1 Peter 3:7]. See now, that it must not proceed with boasting, fighting, beating, and therefore be cautious; where there is quarrel and strife, there is no good. But many say: I want to master you with clubs, they are fools and know nothing; they should have stockfish for wives, for they themselves need many clubs.</p>
      <p>See, this is now the intention of God, why He has called you into the marital state, yes, that you have Him before your eyes, trust Him, seek Him, thank Him, live lovingly, friendly, and Christianly with your wife, raise children, etc. See, my brother and beloved of God, is this not being set in honor and good? O, thank Him night and day, for you cannot thank Him enough! Honor be to Him alone! Yes, I say again, you should not squander the given grace, but live in the will of God. Therefore, it will now become most necessary for you here, that you do not forsake His eternal divine word, but, if God has granted you the grace to read, buy a Testament, from which one recognizes the will of God, and practice it at home with yours at the appropriate time. You can well see what misfortune befalls those who do not accept the word, and what happiness awaits those who hold to the word: Leviticus 26 [3 ff], Deuteronomy 28 [1ff]. It is written: «Cursed is he who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out. And all the people shall say: Amen». Deuteronomy 27 [26].</p>
      <p>Beware that you do not break your marriage vow; for there is no greater theft on earth than when you take away your own spouse's own flesh, which is a great sin before God and is always severely punished on body and soul, even though it is now, unfortunately, God have mercy, considered lightly, with the sword of justice. It is written: «Cursed is he who sleeps with his neighbor's wife. And all the people shall say: Amen». Deuteronomy 27 [20.22].</p>
      <p>You should not take too much from anyone, but only receive your rightful wages, for no unjust gain can prosper and a penny with peace of conscience in God is better than any ship of nobles ever will be. What is it, if others do the same? Should you therefore do the same? Simply put, the aforementioned taking is a godless act, for all those who accomplish it are desperate for God, wanting to prosper and become rich, whether God likes it or not. They see to it, it is written: «You shall not have in your bag differing weights, a large and a small. You shall not have in your house differing measures, a large and a small. You shall have a perfect and just measure, that your days may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you. For all who do such things, all who act dishonestly, are an abomination to the Lord your God». Deuteronomy 25 [13-16].</p>
      <p>You should avoid foreign lords and foreign wars like deadly poison; for what misery and great heartache, godlessness, and sickness spring from it, we unfortunately see in our hasty blinded troops. It is written: «Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. And all the people shall say: Amen». Deuteronomy 27 [25].</p>
      <p>You should also not engage in any way in parties. Let this one be Lutheran and that one Zwinglian, and be you a Christian. Let everyone do as they will; you do not have to answer for everything. Be conciliatory and always speak the best in all matters. Be friendly towards everyone, for you know well how your business stands. From the streets and wine fights rarely comes any good, 1 Timothy 6 [3 ff].</p>
      <p>Avoid untimely eating and drinking, drunkenness, and sleep-inducing drinks. If you desire something, do it with your wife and with yours. Once a month, go to the wine; that you may make and keep favor, settle for hospitality and with yours. Be diligent, modest, cheerful, and serviceable. It is written: «Do not get drunk with wine, which leads to debauchery» etc., Ephesians 5 [18]. Gambling and bad company you should flee as your ruin, swearing and costly clothing avoid, never take unchaste words into your mouth. For it cannot be sufficiently expressed here how evil and harmful gambling is and bad company, also how it makes one so disreputable. So our speech should be yes yes and no no [Matthew 5:37]. So it also needs no silk; for if we are covered, it is enough. «We bring nothing into the world» [1 Timothy 6:7], «naked we must go out» [Job 1:21]. Keep what is yours for seed and keep house, as befits a pious man. It is written: «But fornication and all uncleanness should not even be named among you» etc., see Ephesians 5 [3].</p>
      <p>And that I now end my writing, do what befits a Christian; hold fast to the divine word, which can guide you rightly in all things, and for an honorable, Christian, God-fearing life, so that after this life you possess eternal rest. Amen. Now take this my brief instruction for the best, for it is written in great haste. Greet for me Mr. Mayor Rüplin, Sigmund, Mörickover, the preachers, and other brothers in Christ, and «the grace of God be with you» [1 Timothy 6:21].</p>
      <p>From Kappel, the 5th day of February 1525.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, your willing servant.</p>
      <p>Psalm 127 [Ps 128]:</p>
      <p>«Blessed is everyone who fears the Lord, who walks in His ways! You shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands; you shall be blessed, and it shall be well with you. Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table. Behold, thus shall the man be blessed who fears the Lord. The Lord bless you from Zion! May you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life! May you see your children's children! Peace be upon Israel!»</p>
