    <p xml:id="regest1">Answers Travers' questions about the Worms Religious Colloquy and the understanding of the Eucharist by the people of Strasbourg and Basel; must be brief due to time constraints. In Worms, there is an attempt to eliminate religious dissent; both parties have eleven voting representatives each, along with four presidents; the results are to be presented at the next Imperial Diet in Regensburg. List of participants. The colloquy was supposed to begin in early November, but the imperial envoy [Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle only arrived in Worms on November 20; in his opening speech [on November 25], he urged all parties to unity; opinions on the stance of both parties. The Protestants made it clear that they would not deviate from the Augsburg Confession; the representatives of the opposing side raised their objections regarding the individual articles, revealing that three of their eleven representatives - the envoys of the Palatinate, Brandenburg, and Jülich-Cleves - were not inclined to agree to a rejection of the Augsburg Confession; the opposing side subsequently tried to influence the voting ratio in their favor, which took a lot of time. Granvelle suggested that the statements of both sides be formulated by a small committee. Bullinger cannot report more about the Worms Religious Colloquy - the last news he received dates from December 23 [cf. HBBW X, No. 1441]. He expects little from this colloquy. The Emperor has issued a ban on Reformation writings in Flanders and is persecuting the Protestants, as is the French King in France; the policy of the English King Henry varies greatly, he is now said to be seeking an alliance with the Emperor; it is better to place one's trust in God rather than in princes. Sends him a copy of the Augsburg Confession, along with a report on last year's consultations in Schmalkalden; Travers is to return this report, as well as the records of the negotiations with the people of Strasbourg in Zurich in 1538, which demonstrate the unity of Zurich with Basel and Strasbourg [on the issue of the Eucharist], with the next messenger. Dispenses with sending the [First Helvetic] Confession, its explanation in the letter to Luther [cf. WA Correspondence XII 241-275] as well as Luther's response [WA Correspondence VIII 149-153]; Travers can view the mentioned pieces with [Johannes] Comander or Baling [Nikolaus Pfister]. Does not want to defend Bucer, who gives no rest, but also does not want to accuse him. Greetings to Anton Travers and others. Had to write in haste, asks for indulgence for the illegible handwriting.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. Your letter of humanity was delivered to me, most esteemed Travers, in which you ask two things of me: first, that I inform you of what transpired at the Worms assembly of princes and cities, and second, what the people of Strasbourg and Basel think about the Eucharist; for many are spreading among the populace that they openly assert the truth of the body and blood of Christ in the supper. However, as I am overwhelmed with many storms of business, I cannot describe these matters with the abundance they otherwise deserve and demand; nevertheless, so as not to fail you anywhere, I will briefly touch upon the main points of the matters. For a long time now, and in several assemblies, at Frankfurt, Hagenau, and other places, discussions have been held between the legates of Emperor Charles V and the Protestants - for so they call those who follow our side, because for many years they have protested against the mandates of the Pope and the Emperor for their religion and freedom - about resolving the discord in religion, pacifying Germany, and convening either a national or general council. Finally, it was agreed that a certain number of princely men should be designated to confer among themselves and diligently seek out ways of pacifying or reconciling, and this is the purpose for which they have gathered today in Worms. Each side has been assigned eleven votes; for the adversaries have eleven voices, and our side also has eleven voices, that is, twenty-two men have been appointed along with the highest counselors, who are to discuss all and each of the controversial articles of religion through mutual conference. From this, each is to give their opinions, which are then to be presented in writing at the next Imperial Diet in Regensburg for the consideration of Emperor Charles, the King of the Romans, and all the states of the empire, so that they may jointly deliberate on what needs to be done. To these twenty-two suffragators, as it were, four presidents have been added, who are to moderate everything and keep everyone in order, etc. Therefore, from the opposing side, the legates of the Emperor and the Pope, the bishops of Aquileia and Feltre, the masters of the sacred (if it pleases the gods) palace, and the legates of the King of the Romans have gathered - although I hear the former have no votes - as well as the bishops of Mainz, Trier, Cologne, and many others: the elector of the Palatinate of the Rhine, the elector of Brandenburg, the dukes of Bavaria, Brunswick, the elder Heinrich - for he has nephews who follow our side much to his dismay - as well as the legates of the Duke of Jülich, Cleves, Gelderland, and Berg, etc. From our side came the legates of Denmark, Holstein, Saxony, Meissen, Thuringia, Hesse, Lüneburg, Württemberg, Brandenburg, Prussia, Pomerania, Westphalia, Nassau, Anhalt, etc., as well as the free cities of the empire and the Ocean. The assembly began around the calends of November. But the Emperor's legate, the Spaniard, Lord Granvelle, only arrived in Worms on November 20 with some learned Spaniards. Having convened the parties in the senate house, he delivered a rather eloquent speech explaining what he had been instructed by the Emperor: that he had come as a spectator and listener of the friendly conference and would present himself as an impartial and equitable mediator to all parties, although many seem to think he leans more towards the opposing side; he added the benefits of concord and the evils of discord; hence he urged everyone to concord. Meanwhile, rather fierce words were exchanged back and forth by the adversaries: that this would be the last colloquy the Emperor would allow; that if he saw our side obstinate, he would proceed in any way to restore and return tranquility to Germany; from this, the wise could gather what would follow; therefore, it would be best and most beneficial for our side to show themselves tractable and flexible. From our side, these words are thrown back: that truth is invincible, the mistress of things; that no good person can concede anything about it; that they seek nothing else, desire nothing else, and want nothing else to be procured than religion, peace, true freedom of Germany, and the integrity of the churches, and that not by arms, but by canonical scriptures, law, and equity, although they also do not lack those to repel injury and violence, injustice, and tyranny. Finally, ordered by the Emperor's legate, the vicar, to speak openly and clearly about what they think of religion, in which they intend to persist and persevere, so that even by that response the colloquy might begin, they responded through each of the eleven votes that they had presented their confession of faith to the Emperor when the Diet was held in Augsburg in 1530; that they would remain in it; at the same time, they presented it written in Latin and German to the Spaniard. Thus, the opposing side also began to explain through their votes which articles they wanted to attack, which to grant to our side, and here immediately the voices of the adversaries were divided and clashed among themselves. For the legate of the elector of the Palatinate of the Rhine openly confessed that he saw nothing impious in that confession, nothing alien to true piety, and nothing contrary to the Catholic faith; therefore, he did not want to attack anything in it. The legate of the elector of Brandenburg followed, who subscribed to everything the legate of the Palatinate said; finally, the legate of the prince of Jülich, Cleves, Gelderland, and Berg, etc., D. Conrad Heresbach, also joined them in the opinion of our side. But what were the adversaries to do here, seeing only eight voices left to them, three having defected to the side of the heretics, who now had fourteen votes? They consulted for a long time and moved every stone to weaken our votes. Therefore, they attacked our side with threats, promises, and various tricks, that is, those who were in their company but approved of ours, to see if they could shake their voices; messengers were sent to the princes themselves to ask them to change the legates or order them to give other votes; but they refused this so far. They thus twisted themselves in this knot for almost a whole month and more, while our side remained quiet and awaited a response. Finally, on December 22, the Emperor's legate, the Spaniard, came, summoned our side, and requested a new colloquy, to be conducted by very few, in which only two opposing voices would be recorded, and that this written account of the votes and opinions and actions should be presented to no one but the Emperor at the next Diet, etc. So far, I have not been able to learn from the best men what the adversaries have done at Worms. I do not know what response was given to the adversaries by our side; for the last letters from Worms were dated December 23. I expect little fruit from such certainly deceitful assemblies. Meanwhile, I see the gracious Lord taking care of his own and promoting the glory of his name against all enemies; for which we owe him the greatest thanks, and at the same time pray that he may have mercy on us, increase our faith, suppress wicked counsels, and destroy inventions against the truth. The Emperor is cruelly persecuting the truth through Flanders: he has proscribed the books of Luther, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, Melanchthon, Vadian, etc., by name in a publicly issued edict, of which I have a copy; he calls us heretics, enthusiasts; he burns books and the good men who use them. The King of France does the same throughout France. The King of England, Henry, the most inconstant of all princes, now persecutes and kills papists, now our side; he is more changeable than Proteus. They say he is now plotting an alliance with the Emperor. What is true, I do not know; I know this, that he did not lie who said: "It is easy to engrave the images of all good princes on one ring," and he who said: "Do not trust in princes nor in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation." Blessed are all who trust in the Lord, and blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord. I have added to these our Augsburg Confession, in case you desired it, and I give it to you as a gift, if such a small piece of paper deserves the name of a gift. I have also added the consultation of our people made at Schmalkalden last year, when the Hagenau assembly also consulted with common votes on what they could concede to the adversaries and what they could not. But I send it on the condition that you return it in good faith with the next messenger, along with the other papers describing the Zurich assembly of 1538 held between the people of Strasbourg and us, from which you will understand how true it is that the people of Strasbourg and Basel have defected from us. You will also understand that the Protestant princes and cities have accepted, that is, not rejected, our confession, from which we have never deviated even by a single transverse line for anyone's favor, and God willing, we will not deviate. The republics and churches of Strasbourg and Basel are most closely connected to us, and we are most grateful and acceptable to them. I did not add our confession along with the declaration to Luther, nor Luther's first response, because the dearest and most esteemed brother Comander or Balingius can supply it. If I am mistaken, you will let me know, and I will ensure you have them. Although it has been agreed between us as you read, Bucer continues to tie some knots in a clear matter and speak more perplexedly. Now perhaps they take the opportunity to speak both good and ill of defection. Meanwhile, I do not want to defend Bucer, who can hardly defend and excuse all his actions among good people; but as I do not want to defend, so I do not want to accuse. Each stands and falls to his own Lord; we are all servants of Jesus Christ; to him alone is all glory always due. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 21, 1541. Greet D. Anton Travers and other good men. Forgive the poor handwriting; I wrote very quickly and was not able to reread.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
