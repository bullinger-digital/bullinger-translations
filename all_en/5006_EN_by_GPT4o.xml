      <p>[...] On the 24th of September, we came to Poissy.</p>
      <p>There, Beza refuted the cardinal's sermon on many points. He spoke about the church, the authority of scripture and the church, the laying on of hands and rightful succession, and the Eucharist. It was shown from the words of Augustine that councils can err...</p>
      <p>The cardinal declared that he would not proceed further with us unless we agreed with him on the Lord's Supper, and he kept insisting on the Augsburg Confession, even though he and his followers abhor it. Therefore, he was asked by our side whether he himself would accept it.</p>
      <p>He said no, but only adhered to it regarding the article of the presence of the Lord's body... and demanded that we either agree with him or not proceed further with the conference.</p>
      <p>The queen, Prince Condé, and Admiral Coligny were displeased with the cardinal's imperious speech; they saw that they were avoiding the conference and seeking a reason to break it off. Beza also complained...</p>
      <p>All these things were conducted in French.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since I cannot speak that language, although I understand it, I said nothing nor was I invited to speak. However, at the end, I asked the queen to grant me the opportunity to speak in the future, which she graciously granted. I asked in which language she wanted me to speak; she replied: Italian.</p>
      <p>On the 26th of September, we met again.</p>
      <p>We were advised to avoid discussing the presence of Christ's body in the supper first, so that before we reached that point, they would be convinced of the gravest abuses and errors...</p>
      <p>There, I took up the speech and first defended the ministry of our churches. I also responded to the accusation by which we were portrayed as seditious.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I objected that he was greatly mistaken in daring to affirm that there are no tropes or figurative expressions in God's commandments, in histories, in testaments, and in sacraments, and I demonstrated from the scriptures that tropes are found, from which it cannot be concluded by him that the words of the Lord, which speak of consecration, are to be taken simply. There, the Spanish leader of the Jesuits, who had come with the papal legate, took up the speech and delivered a very sharp oration in which he reproached the queen for taking up the knowledge of these matters when it did not pertain to her, but to the pope and bishops, nor was it right, while the Council of Trent was being held, to hold such a private conference. This speech greatly offended the queen, and if she had not respected Cardinal Ferrara, she would have taught the Jesuit modesty. The cardinal turned the speech to me and began to complain that he did not understand my language, although he knows it very well.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he began to respond to me in French, which he would not have been able to do unless he had understood what I had said. And when I was about to refute his solutions, the queen advised me to use the Latin language so that all the doctors and prelates would understand. I obeyed and said what was appropriate for the time.</p>
      <p>Beza intervened and briefly responded to the Spanish lawyer. Then he began to deal with the cardinal about the supper.</p>
      <p>There, I introduced the evangelist's narrative, which says that the Lord took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and I demonstrated that these words have no other accusative than bread. He tried in vain to explain it.</p>
      <p>Mr. Depensius began to interject some things, but since he did not refrain from the noise and clamor of the Sorbonne, the matter turned into a tumultuous action, so that even the cardinal did not refrain from clamorous vehemence. Therefore, by the queen's order, the assembly was dissolved when it was already night.</p>
      <p>That action seemed unworthy of the king's presence, so much so that the queen decided not to be present anymore, nor did she want the matter to be discussed henceforth among so many, but she appointed five interlocutors from the adversaries' side, and likewise five from ours. From the adversaries, the bishop of Valence, the bishop of Sées, Mr. Botillerus, Mr. Salignacus, and Mr. Depensius were chosen.</p>
      <p>From our side, these are the names: Beza, Gallasius, Marloratus, Spina, and myself.</p>
      <p>Notaries were appointed from both sides, but we converse without judges and other witnesses, quite amicably and peacefully because we have adversaries who are quite mild and do not differ much from us.</p>
      <p>We have already been with them three times, and in summary, only the presence of the body in the supper has been discussed. I stand firm in our opinion.</p>
      <p>My colleagues seem to concede something. However, they maintain that the bread and wine are not in reality the body and blood of Christ and that the perception of the things signified is spiritual and obtained through faith. However, they are compelled to express the term substance, which they used in their catechism and in the confession they presented to the king before my arrival. We are now in this deliberation, and nothing could be concluded.</p>
      <p>I seem to be harsh so that some of the interlocutors say that it is because of me that agreement is not reached, and I do not doubt that this makes me less pleasing to the queen mother and the other nobles, who would like by all means to obtain agreement between us quickly. For the more the settlement of religion is delayed, the more they fear the seditions of the people. When we have something certain or established, I will not let you remain ignorant.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and brother in Christ, greatly to be respected. Help us with your prayers.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire family and all the dearest fellow ministers in Christ. All my colleagues greet you, as do Julius and Stuckius.</p>
      <p>I will write to the magistrate, but briefly.</p>
      <p>You will communicate to him what you judge to be expedient with your prudence.</p>
      <p>On the 2nd of October 1561, in the royal court at Saint-Germain. I took care to inform Legate Cognetius of what you wrote to me about the Rhaetian affairs.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I do not want to hide from you that we are not being supported here at royal expense, but from the contributions of the French churches, which I did not know, but learned two or three days ago. I am rarely summoned to the queen, and that secretly.</p>
      <p>It is not obscure by whose work this is done: but I will explain it to you another time. Farewell again and love me as you do.</p>
      <p>The king was ill for those two days and quite dangerously. About this, I wrote to the senate.</p>
      <p>But now he is recovering.</p>
      <p>It is true, as they proclaim, that he is of weak and frail health.</p>
      <p>I pray that you greet all yours in my name, as well as all the fellow ministers and dearest brothers. On the 4th of October.</p>
      <p>Take care that the letters I gave to the honorable senate are delivered to you to be read, for there is more in them than I have consigned in yours. All my colleagues greet you again.</p>
