    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Emperor] Charles V is a hypocrite. While he flattered the [Protestants], he incited the Italians, Spaniards, Hungarians, Belgians, and Germans against them. He has not shown such zeal even in his fight against [Suleiman I]! He has also sent envoys to Strasbourg and elsewhere, offering peace to all if they would only be willing to support him in punishing the "rebels." By "rebels," he means all those who reject the articles of the Leuven theologians, with which he seeks the restoration of the papacy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The cunning of the Emperor is evident in that Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] knew nothing specific about the extent of the danger as of June 20. It is said that he will take over the [German] army that has so far been in the service of King [Henry VIII] of England; thus, exactly what the Emperor feared is happening.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger is to report on the Lucerne envoy [...]. Myconius does not understand Bullinger's statements about the "Roman" nobility, unless Bullinger meant the convocations [of the nobility] from Swabia, Franconia, and Alsace, which the Emperor initiated in May.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Myconius is also unsure how Bullinger assesses Duke [William] of Bavaria. He believes that the Duke, who relies on his friendship with Augsburg, [will not prove hostile towards the Protestants]. However, Myconius must admit that the response the Duke [gave to the Emperor] is indeed surprising, especially since the Duke is a great friend of the Emperor and an enemy of the Gospel. This response might have led the messenger [...] from Landsberg [am Lech] to claim that the Duke wants to join the Protestants.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Greetings and a call for continuous prayer!</p>

      <p>Greetings. You mix joyful and sad things in your letters. However, the joyful things are more joyful to me than the sad things are sad. May the Lord be present with His word, as He will surely be with us if we are faithfully intent in our prayers.</p>

      <p>The unheard-of treachery of Charles V should incite all men to hate him. I have said a thousand times that I have never encountered such a hypocrite. While he flattered everyone, he arranged for us to be surrounded by enemies from all sides: from Italy, Spain, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Germany. He has never prepared himself so against the Turk. He sent envoys to Strasbourg and to others, offering peace to anyone and many advantages, provided they assist him in punishing the rebels. Rebellion will be in rejecting the religious concord he wishes to establish, namely according to the articles of the Leuven theologians, and by which the Pope is to be restored in full. The foolish man does not yet see the impiety of the Leuven theologians, which is clearer than the sun.</p>

      <p>The Landgrave (Philip of Hesse) knows nothing solid yet about this great danger (and especially prepared against him as the heart of the Schmalkaldic League) as of the 20th of this month. See the most impious and arrogant cunning and fox-like mind of the Emperor! Rumor has it that the army, which was with the English, is being received by him (the Landgrave); this is what the Emperor once feared would happen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I wrote about the Lucerne envoy. You will inform me at your leisure whether the matter stands thus. What you write about the Roman nobility (unless you mean those whom he summoned in previous months, and the Swabians, Franconians, Alsatians, etc.), I do not understand what you are writing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There is also an ambiguous word about the Bavarian: "He wants to behave properly," etc., which I do not interpret in a bad way: He is a neighbor of the people of Augsburg, whose friendship he could lose to his disadvantage. However, I am then surprised that such a great friend of Charles and such a great enemy of the Gospel dares to speak thus to Charles. From this response, it is indeed what the messenger from Landsberg said, that the Bavarian has joined the Protestants. May the Lord Jesus, whose cause is at stake, extend His mighty arm against the enemies of His word and grant us steadfastness in faith until the end.</p>

      <p>Farewell with all good people and let us pray without ceasing. Hastily, Basel, June 29, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, O. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned D. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother and lord in Christ, to be respected.</p>
