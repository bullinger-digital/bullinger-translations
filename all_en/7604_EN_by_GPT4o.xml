      <p>S. D. I am sending this message to your esteemed consuls with letters. It is not convenient to write what is contained in them; you will easily understand from one of the consuls. I received your letter written on September 14. It is false that the army of Uri was destroyed during the inspection. It is affirmed to be true that Philipp's son was killed in prison by poison. I pray that you send this package safely to Ulrich Campell.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever. September 20, 1568.</p>
      <p>It is absolutely necessary that you know what I have written to the consuls. Ask Willi and encourage everyone not to take up arms against the innocent and those obedient to the king, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, my honorable and most beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
