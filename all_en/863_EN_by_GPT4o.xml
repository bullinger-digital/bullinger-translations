      <p>Greetings. I came here at the beginning of winter, as I wrote to you, relying on the fine words and kindness of certain people, which later turned out to be like a woman who turned into a fish, and I left my school and family with great expense, labor, and loss, with the intention and will that during the winter, in my presence, some small booklets would be completed, and then at the beginning of spring, I would return home, but first appointing some suitable man here, who could oversee greater matters even in my absence. But it turned out far differently than I expected; for I was deceived by those who said they were ready, and not much more has been done by me today than on the first day. Therefore, I made huge expenses in vain and was absent with great trouble and loss from my own, afflicted with illnesses and other difficulties. Now, to avoid falling into this predicament again, I have decided to have my own printer, although at great and almost unbearable expense, to print my works; for I have not a few in both Latin and Spanish, on which I have worked for many years. Therefore, when I was considering here about some faithful man skilled in the art of printing, to whom I could safely entrust this matter, Peter from Mechelen came to me, whom you might know, and he praised much the faith and diligence of your printer Augustin Fries. He also added that it would be a pious work to help a man oppressed by debt and otherwise deprived of all support.</p>
      <p>I preferred to confer a benefit on a good man struggling with poverty rather than on another not equally proven in virtue. So he came to me, and I made an agreement with him, as he himself wanted, since he will print for me at not a little greater expense than others were asking from me, as you will be able to learn from him. He asked me to write to you and to request you, that either through you or through your friends, whom you consider suitable for this matter, you would ensure with your magistrate that with their good permission, he would be released to his offered benefit and indeed with an accurate commendation of his virtue to our magistrate. You will therefore do a pious work and one most fitting to your profession if you help a good man. Furthermore, since I hear that he is more pressed by a certain paper merchant from Bern than by other creditors, whom he thinks will soon come to Zürich to press him, if this paper merchant comes down here with the printer, we will ensure that their matters are arranged in such a way that over time not only will the paper merchant be satisfied, but he will also know the place where he can sell all the paper he can produce. Therefore, make sure that the good man feels how much you favor the piety and virtue of the afflicted. If I could once extricate myself from these most troublesome cares, nothing would be more desirable than to come to you, so that after long troubles I might be somewhat refreshed by your company. Farewell with all the brothers and companions. Basel, March 17, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
