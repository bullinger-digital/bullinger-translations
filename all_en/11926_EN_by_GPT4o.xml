    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a gift [Bullinger's writing "Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio"?]. Veit [Kappeler the Younger] will be dismissed from teaching service at Pentecost [June 1] (or earlier, depending on behavior) due to negligence in teaching and poor conduct; Comander therefore requests, on behalf of [Johannes] Travers and the other school supervisors, a recommendation for a suitable candidate and offers an annual salary of 100 guilders as well as accommodation; they would welcome [Johannes] Pontisella, but a prophet is not without honor except in his own country; requests a response by Pentecost. Travers orders Bullinger's Matthew [1542, HBBibl I 144] and John commentary [1543, HBBibl I 153f], bound in one volume; Comander will have the book picked up by someone from Chur and send the desired amount. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, his S. D. P. (Salutations and Best Wishes).</p>
      <p>We have received a most welcome gift from your generosity, most learned man, for which we do not express the thanks we ought to, but we do express the thanks we can. Veit, due to his negligence in the schools and intemperance outside the schools, has been deprived of his position. He will leave the position by the feast of Pentecost, and if he continues in those vices, he will be dismissed sooner; therefore, we will be in need of your assistance. The school supervisors, namely Mr. Johannes Travers and the others, have instructed me to write to you, so that you might seek out someone endowed with good character and learning, suitable for this office; and if they find such a person, they will support him with a stipend of one hundred guilders and comfortable accommodation, namely, each year. They would gladly accept Pontisella; but a prophet is not without honor except in his own country. Please apply your usual diligence on our behalf and deign to give us a response by the feast of Easter. Furthermore, Mr. Travers requests that you prepare your writings on Matthew and John, collected into one volume, and I will arrange for it to be transported here by someone from Chur and will send the sum of money as soon as you write to me. Farewell.</p>
      <p>From the Court of Rhaetia, March 24, 1544. Please convey our greetings to all the brothers in our name. Your Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant minister of the Church of Zurich, his special friend.</p>
