    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Bullinger must have been annoyed with Frölich, and rightly so, because he has not written for so long, nor has he come to Zurich, even when he recently visited his sick son [Jonas] in Constance. Bullinger, please forgive him! Countless problems are causing him worries. However, he also knows that despite the interruption in contact, their eternal friendship is not at stake. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] If only the misery in Augsburg would come to an end! The people of Augsburg will probably have to suffer even more if God does not intervene. A victory of the enemies of the Gospel over Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony would lead straight to servitude. Hopefully, he will not be trampled down! His cause is just and pious, and he has strong troops. He has already captured Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and 1500 horsemen at Rochlitz, and defeated Landgrave Christoph of Leuchtenberg. The Bohemians support him. Moreover, his subjects and those of Duke Maurice of Saxony have agreed among themselves not to let any foreign army roam their land. Many soldiers have also defected from the Duke to him. But who knows God's plans? </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Emperor Charles V and King Ferdinand are in Eger in the Bohemian Forest. Soon it will be known where they are heading! The Bohemians are cutting off their supply lines and are ready to fight for freedom and religion. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] It was not easy to keep Johannes Haller in Augsburg, given the dire situation there! But since a faithful servant of Christ must persevere as long as there is a prospect of being useful, he has complied without too much resistance. If necessary, Frölich will protect him with all his might. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Just now, news has come of an agreement between the Duke and the Elector! The Emperor and the King will therefore have to move against both Saxons! If only this were true! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Greetings to the mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab, to the city clerk Hans Escher vom Luchs, to Rudolf Gwalther, Konrad Gessner, Konrad Pellikan, Johannes Fries, and to the other scholars. From the town hall in Augsburg. </p>

      <p>Greetings. Are you upset? You have every right to be, my most esteemed and beloved brother, because I have not written to you for such a long time, especially since I was in Constance a few days ago with my sick little son and did not come to see you. Oh, my dearest brother, there are many, indeed countless things that trouble and distract me. Therefore, I ask for your forgiveness. For although I have somewhat neglected the duty of writing, our mutual love and bond have not diminished in the least, but will endure even after this life, eternally in the heavenly homeland. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You know our calamities, and I wish the end would finally come! We have endured much. We will endure even graver things unless the Lord, that merciful Father, in His divine mercy, has arranged otherwise. For if the enemies of the Gospel triumph over Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, nothing but pure servitude awaits us. However, I hope that the Elector's affairs will fare better than to be trampled underfoot by the enemies, as they threaten. He has a just and pious cause, and he is not lacking in strong troops. Moreover, he has defeated many adversaries, captured the Margrave with 1500 horsemen at Rochlitz, and defeated the Landgrave of Leuchtenberg. The Bohemians support him. The subjects of Duke Maurice have agreed with the Elector's provinces not to allow any foreign soldiers to roam their land. Many of Maurice's garrison soldiers have also defected to the Elector. Who knows what God will do?</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Emperor and the King are in the city of Eger in the Bohemian Forest. Where they will turn, the coming days will soon reveal. The Bohemians are cutting off supplies to King Ferdinand and the Emperor, and they are taking up arms, ready to fight bravely for freedom and their altars.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have so far managed to keep our excellent man Haller here in these turbulent times. He has often wished to leave, and it is no wonder amidst so many dangers and calamities! But a faithful minister of Christ must persevere in his ministry as long as there is hope of bearing fruit. Therefore, he has easily agreed with me. I will support him with all my strength and would rather face danger myself than allow any adversity to befall him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>While I am writing this, news arrives that an agreement has been reached between Duke Maurice and the Elector, so now the Emperor and the King will have to wage war against both Saxons. May the outcome match this news!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Convey my warmest greetings to the mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab, to the city clerk Hans Escher vom Luchs, to Rudolf Gwalther, Konrad Gessner, Konrad Pellikan, Johannes Fries, and to the entire house of the Muses. Given in the Senate of Augsburg, April 12, 1547. Yours, Georg Frölich (Laetus), etc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, former (Antistes) of the Church of Zurich, my particularly gracious lord, to be delivered. Zurich.</p>
