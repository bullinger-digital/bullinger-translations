      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You have in this message, dearest Leo, the use of agaric, which our Valerius, a pious man, has noted for you. You will also receive again the other letters from Valerius that you had sent to me, by a messenger, I believe a reliable one, the pastor of Gachnang, who, I say, has complained to us of the great misery and, to put it in a word, the suppression of divine truth and all innocence in the Thurgau region. And because we could not but believe the man, as he seemed to us, pious, sincere, and wise, it pleased us to write to you, our dearest in the Lord, and to most earnestly ask that you be willing to assist the brothers there with both counsel and action, lest one or another withdraws, and finally leaves the church, and thus, to our own detriment as well, the work of the Lord and the structure again collapses. For you are not unaware of what a man, however pious and learned, sometimes contemplates and to what extent he is reduced by the lack of things and the burden of misery. What will you say about the unlearned and those pious only in words? Therefore, dearest ones, it will be your duty to assist the brothers in their need. We will also do our part.</p>
      <p>We all long to know what has been done about Onofrius. Whether he confessed under torture and what he revealed, I pray, if it is allowed, that we may know as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 22, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, in the year 32.</p>
      <p>Kaspar Megander, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>You will give these letters to Bullinger and Erasmus to read.</p>
      <p>To his Leo in Zurich, to Bullinger and Erasmus, dearest brothers.</p>
