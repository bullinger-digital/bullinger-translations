      <p>Greetings. A few days ago, one of our citizens was in Krakau, Poland.</p>
      <p>Upon returning, he brought these letters addressed to you, dear brother and honorable lord.</p>
      <p>Our Sarnicius requested that I ensure they are delivered to you safely and promptly, which I have done.</p>
      <p>If you wish to respond and cannot conveniently send it to Krakau, please send it to me; for through St. Gallen, it will be most safely taken care of by me.</p>
      <p>Sarnicius writes that the kingdom's assembly has concluded and that the jurisdiction of the Roman pontiff has been entirely abolished in the Kingdom of Poland. The pontiff's envoy tried once and again to overturn the kingdom's statute before the king and senate, but was always dismissed without success, and was finally driven out with great indignation by the king's knights and nobles, and covered in mud.</p>
      <p>Gregorius Paulus has been dismissed.</p>
      <p>Felix Cruciger was ordered to leave and bid his final farewell to his church on the day of the Lord's resurrection; however, as he descended from the sacred pulpit, he suddenly collapsed to the ground, and no word was heard from him again; he expired the next day.</p>
      <p>This event terrified many; most who had strayed returned to a sounder mind.</p>
      <p>Sarnicius writes all this in detail, and I hope he has also written extensively to you; therefore, I am brief.</p>
      <p>Sulcerus has joined the party of Martbach in Strasbourg and subscribed to the Augsburg Confession and Apology.</p>
      <p>On his return to Basel, he visited the lady of Rapoltsweiler and the Countess of Erbach; with them, he boasted of that victory and added that he would not rest until he has brought the Palatinate and the Zwinglians here and subdued them.</p>
      <p>They say he will soon come to Bern, and I wish he does not also start contentions there! However, I have diligently advised the wise men there to be vigilant. You will greet Beza, my dearest brother, most kindly from me and mine, to whom the church owes much indeed for his most beneficial labors, which he endured in France for Christ and the church.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently together with all the colleagues and brothers.</p>
      <p>If you have any news about French affairs, let me know.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 24th of May, in the year of our Lord 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the Geneva church, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
