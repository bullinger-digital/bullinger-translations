      <p>Greetings. I am sending back Calvin's booklet to fulfill my promise to you and not to disappoint your expectations, although I was not able to read it entirely, but I did read a good part of it, from which I can easily infer the nature of the rest. I would be very surprised by Heshusius's impudence if he were to come forward to fight again, so miserably pierced and flayed. I wish he would soon come to his senses and recover his sanity.</p>
      <p>I recently sent you Moschus's response to Ferdinand, which is now well-known to everyone, but no one with any sense believes it was fabricated by the Papists, especially since Ferdinand's petition was not published at the same time. But they should not have dared to present such a blatant lie to the Emperor; he might not have taken it well. However, in the long run, it is good to lie and bad to ask questions later.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, who would consider Moschus so insane as to believe that his ancestors ruled over the Ruthenians centuries before the world was created, which this document attests to in full words, so that no one might think an error was made in the figures of numbers. In summary: it looks like a good piece of fiction.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received any certain news from anyone about the princes' assembly; but I am waiting with impatient desire to receive it at any moment. It is certain, and I have good reliable information, that some large pieces of artillery have been transported from Innsbruck to Bregenz. I cannot interpret or calculate this at all, but it is certain and true.</p>
      <p>A notable nobleman, who is, however, Papist, writes that the Turk is giving the Pope and Philip a lot of trouble and they are in great distress. Let us continually implore our Lord Jesus Christ to soon deliver us from these restless evils of the whole world, which are increasingly gathering, and to refresh us with heavenly and eternal tranquility. In this, may you and all yours fare well.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers and friends, and commend my impending funeral to our Christ, who is truly the vital life, diligently and carefully together with you. March 7, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his D. Bullinger.</p>
