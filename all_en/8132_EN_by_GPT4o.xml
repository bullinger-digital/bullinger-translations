      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, know that by the grace of God, all is well with us, and although I have not been very strong for a while and have been in poor condition, it has now, by the grace of God, become better. This will last as long as it pleases God; for now, I cannot expect anything other than eggs or young every day. Fiat voluntas domini (May the Lord's will be done). In 4 or 5 weeks, I have not received any letters, which surprises me; therefore, I cannot write you any news. It is certain, however, that the messenger to Solothurn has postponed the departure of the 6000 Swiss to France; for he writes to the places and shows that this is done at the king's command and out of his utmost need, where he trusts that the Swiss will not abandon him, etc. I do not know what will come of it. It seems to me that if one were not completely blind, one would see the great loss, and that now many thousands of Swiss have died and perished in France. I wonder when it will be enough and when the pensioners have led or ruined enough people.</p>
      <p>Now it has its time. May Almighty God soon bring a good resolution.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God and greet Susanna and Elisabeth for me.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich on Sunday, the 8th of January, in the year 1570. All our people greet you.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>Greet for me also young master Hans of Ulm in Tiefen and all his people.</p>
      <p>To my dearly beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
