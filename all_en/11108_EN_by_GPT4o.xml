    <p xml:id="regest1">Upon his return [from the Zurich Autumn Synod], he can only praise the state of the Zurich church and expresses his gratitude. He leaves it to the people of Zurich to judge an opinion by Capito, which seeks to reconcile the contradictions between the [First Helvetic] Confession and the Bern Synod regarding the recognition of sin from the preaching of the law. He has learned that a follower of Bucer wants to disseminate and promote the printing of Bucer's "Retractations" in German translation, while another is advocating for the introduction of Bucer's catechism. To counter this new threat, Zurich should remind everyone of the obligation to undertake nothing before Luther's response arrives; for this purpose, Bullinger and Theodor [Bibliander] could request a hearing by the Bern Council, as their names have been mentioned in discussions with Capito and Bucer. He has received the Englishmen recommended by Bullinger together with Erasmus [Ritter], Rhellikan, and [Thomas] Grynaeus, although due to his wife's absence, he accommodated them in an inn.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We have returned home with not an unfortunate omen, dearest brothers, with some considerable expectations; I do not know what matters they hoped we would bring. But we assert that we have found nothing other than the Zurich church to be holy, sincere, free from all division and quarrels, and indeed beautifully and peacefully settled in the Lord, and we commend and extol it for the immense benefits shown to us, and not without reason. For so many and such great services have been rendered to us, and we have been received with such great kindness by all of you, that no one can easily give equal thanks, let alone repay them. May God grant that we repay all of you for what we have received!</p>
      <p>First, dearest brothers, as I returned home, I found a rather lengthy response and explanation from Capito regarding our Basel Confession and his published synod, which attempts to reconcile what seems to us to be contradictory about the preaching of repentance through the law or from the law to the nations. But what he achieves with this reconciliation is for you to judge, who undoubtedly hold both the confession and the synod.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I understand from a certain faithful friend that Bucer's "Retractations" in German, handed down by a certain extreme Bucer supporter, are being secretly circulated in the corners and gatherings of people of his kind, and that they are working diligently and eagerly to have it printed and published in our city. I also certainly understand that another person, not only a busybody but a veritable chameleon, not yet known to all of you, but soon will be, is trying to impose a catechism written by the same Bucer on us, undoubtedly because it encompasses all of the "Retractations." Even a foolish and unwise person can easily understand what these things mean, which is why I did not want them to remain unknown to you. I certainly see that Satan, unless God averts it - and He will not, due to our ingratitude - will confuse and change all sincerity into obscurity and light into darkness itself. For what seemed dormant and extinguished is clearly re-emerging and resurfacing, unless there is someone to suppress, extinguish, and suffocate it. And certainly, in my judgment, there is no mortal who can more effectively and conveniently provide for our church, alter and break these kinds of attempts and wicked plans than Zurich, especially since you hold the letters of our mutual agreement, which state that nothing more should be done or attempted in this matter until Luther responds to what has been sent to him. Therefore, with the response to Capito and Bucer recently given by us in this matter, you hold the perfect opportunity to remind and exhort us not to attempt anything further in this matter until Luther sends a response. Without a doubt, dearest brothers, if this is carried out, not only will the Lord's work among us be helped, but it will also greatly benefit and serve certain excellent men. In my judgment, the Lord's work, which is now faltering among us, could be helped in this way if Bullinger and Theodor, brothers, would request and ask for a day and place to clear themselves before our council and people, since both were named and criticized in our assembly by the other side: one, as if he agrees with them in all things and supports them, the other, as if he spoke in the epistolary preface in a way that is not entirely sincere and consistent with Scripture. These, dearest brothers, seem to be the means by which the evil intent of certain people, which in my judgment is not only harmful to our church but also to the Zurich church in the future, could be delayed and broken, and that without effort. Therefore, consult among yourselves and consider what should be done, I pray through Christ. I am indeed of the opinion that if this or at least one of these is faithfully undertaken, attempted, and pursued, it will bring us not a little benefit and advantage. I therefore entrust the matter to you to consider more diligently and deeply. Satan does not slumber. I, for my part, as much as it is in me, with God's help, will be a man, will vigorously resist, oppose the worst efforts, and, if possible, will also break them. But what I cannot accomplish with my strength and bear on my shoulders, I must necessarily abandon.</p>
      <p>Farewell, remain safe for a long time, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 11, 1537.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>The Englishmen recommended by you, Bullinger, were not received by us as they deserved and as would have been fitting, but as necessity dictated and advised, we accommodated them in a public inn and lodging, dining with Erasmus, Rhellicanus, Grynaeus, and myself. My wife was not at home nor in the town either.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the church of the divine word in Zurich and to the preachers and professors, men distinguished by piety and doctrine, brothers to be always respected in the Lord.</p>
