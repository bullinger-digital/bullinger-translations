      <p>Greetings. I have personally delivered your letters to the treasurer and Hagius.</p>
      <p>They have promised to assist with this matter at the earliest opportunity, so I continue to hope more and more positively in this regard. I am returning to you the letters of Vadianus, the mandate of the Emperor sent through Artopaeus, and the most cruel instructions of the inquisitors, and I am greatly thankful to you. I am also sending letters addressed to Mr. Blaurer, which I ask you to send to him quickly. Public and domestic affairs press upon me, so I cannot write more now; for today the markets are very busy; moreover, yesterday we had the synod of our classis, so I am more than usually occupied. Furthermore, the Lord visiting my family in these days has taken away a maidservant from me, and now our Blattner, the school supervisor and my table companion, is lying ill, about whose life I am very concerned, as he is a learned and very noble young man of modest and great promise.</p>
      <p>Everything else with me is still well. The plague has become so strong that about 50 have died this week, among whom is also my relative Cosmas Alderinus, a notable musician and composer, as they call him. Thus we are in the hand of the Lord; may His will be done, to whom I have consecrated and dedicated myself and all mine. Pray to the Lord for us, and you will have me and mine perpetually commended to you. May the Lord diligently protect the health of you and yours. My wife, Mr. Musculus, Mr. Treasurer, Hagius, Rümlangus, and others greet you. You will also greet yours in my name. Farewell. Bern, November 11, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I have not seen Sultzberger, about whom you write. A letter was delivered to me by a certain girl from Zürich, who also says she has not seen him.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
