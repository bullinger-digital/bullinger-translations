      <p>Greetings in the Lord. If you do not wish to submit that story about the Viennese painter to the press, send it to us, and we will ensure it is printed. If you have received anything from England via Strasbourg, do not hide it from me, as I do not wish to know mysteries. This is what I have from Strasbourg:</p>
      <p>"Our priests began their service with such success that it is worthy of abomination; for the disturbance and shouting of children in their assembly, crying out:</p>
      <p>"Priest, priest, rogue, liar" etc., became so strong that, having barely read the text of Malachi 3, he was ordered by his own to step down and take refuge. However, nothing more violent was attempted against them except for mockery, harassment, and the pulling of their white garments. This matter so moved those tender ones that they immediately wished to desist from their services and accuse our council of breaking the most recent agreement, also claiming that their preachers pour cold water to incite sedition, and that they are forced to leave for fear of their lives, intending to report all this to the Imperial Majesty, and they threaten with unknown dire consequences to such an extent that they cannot be appeased and refuse to return to their idolatry. Although the council would prefer the unruly youth to have remained quiet and left those blind ones to the judgment of the Lord, since no citizens were involved, none were killed, none were injured, none even struck, they believe their accusation can easily be refuted before the Imperial Majesty.</p>
      <p>Only one mass was held in the Minster; they sang it in a subdued voice; two guards had to be stationed at every door to ensure no one entered the church and disturbed them. No citizen or resident wanted to build the old altar, so they had to bring a stranger with them to erect the altar. The church is now closed, and the priests from Freiburg are glad they escaped with their lives; for they disguised themselves and slipped away one by one. The wicked fears the leaf moved by the wind. Farewell. Greet Dr. Theodor in my name and the other brothers in the Lord. February 15, 1550.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest teacher.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
