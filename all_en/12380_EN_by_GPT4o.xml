    <p xml:id="regest1">Erb received Bullinger's letter from October 30 [1545] along with six copies of [Bullinger's "Resurrectio"] on December 28 [1545]. From this, he could gather that his letter [HBBW XV, No. 2213] with the justified excuse for not accepting the call to Augsburg had arrived at Bullinger. Erb prays that the [people of Augsburg] will find a suitable preacher of the Word of God; he himself, however, remains in [Riquewihr], where he has been serving for eight years.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The beautifully printed "Resurrectio" is gladly read by the pious. The booklet is of great benefit to the faithful in this world threatened by Satan, for there is no better comfort than the hope of resurrection. May the Lord grant him this hope permanently as an old, weak man.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The church [of the County of Riquewihr] has more enemies than in previous years. The Anabaptists have taken root everywhere; they have even settled in the vicinity of the church of Nikolaus König [in Hunawihr]. After the fall of Duke Heinrich, the neighboring Papists are even more rampant and incite against the [Evangelicals] when they go to the neighboring towns for the weekly market. Some weak ones have already fallen away and, despite the threat of severe punishments, despise the ordinances of the sovereign [Georg of Württemberg].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The church of Mömpelgard, pacified against all hope by the old Duke [Ulrich of Württemberg], is again administered according to the former [order of worship] by French church servants. Erb sends the [Zurichers] a copy of the closed agreement in a transcript by Gerold [Meyer von Knonau the Younger]. [Pierre] Toussain was called back to his church [in Mömpelgard] with an even higher salary than before. The opponents grumble but do not dare to express anything against it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [King Henry VIII of] England devastates France and raises troops everywhere. This winter he captured a large fortified city, the name of which Erb has forgotten. Subsequently, a hundred mounted Englishmen killed five hundred [soldiers of Francis I], including nobles. This news came today from Chancellor [Sigismund Stier] when Erb was about to seal the letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The criminal [Duke Heinrich of] Brunswick desires his admission to the Schmalkaldic League; may it not come to pass!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The council, postponed for some time, began on [December 13, 1545] with great effort. The legates and cardinals should be careful not to burst like the frog in Aesop's fable!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- For the [Second] Regensburg [Religious] Discussion, [Martin] Bucer, [Johannes] Brenz, [Erhard] Schnepf, and Martin Frecht from Ulm have already arrived. Until a few days ago, they were still waiting for Melanchthon. From the opponents, Julius Pflug, a Carmelite from Cologne [Eberhard Billick], the auxiliary bishop of Mainz [Michael Helding], [Pedro de] Malvenda, confessor of the Emperor [Charles V], and the Colmar [Augustinian monk] Johannes Hoffmeister arrived, who is said to have said before his departure that if the world was seduced by an Augustinian monk [Luther], it could also be converted by an Augustinian monk like him. The chairmen of the religious discussion are the Bishop of Eichstätt [Moritz von Hutten] and Count Friedrich [II] of Fürstenberg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [Charles V] tortures the [Evangelicals] to death in the Netherlands. On [November 29, 1545], he had an Antwerp printer [Jacob van Liesvelt] beheaded for no other reason than that he had printed a Bible with Luther's scholia.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The Elector Palatine [Elector Friedrich II] held a meeting in December of all nobles and governors and the neighboring counts and princes, including [Georg of Württemberg]. The most important agenda item was the preaching of the Gospel throughout the Palatinate. By divine providence, it was decided that the [Gospel] would be accepted. Above all, [Friedrich II] wants to reform the [University of Heidelberg] by appointing good professors of the arts and pious theologians. If [Elector Johann Friedrich of] Saxony permits, Melanchthon is to be called for this [educational reform] initially. Some groundbreaking decrees are reportedly already published. There is hope that if this succeeds, those living in and around Speyer, the people of Hagenau, Sélestat, Colmar, Kaysersberg, and other small [Palatine] places will join.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Greetings to [Rudolf] Gwalther and the other [Zurich pastors and professors].</p>

      <p>May the grace of the Lord be with you. Your last letter, written on October 30, finally reached me along with six booklets on December 28, most learned and dearest of all brothers, Bullinger. From this, I understand that my previous letters, in which I did not disdain the call to Augsburg, as I hope, but excused myself with fair and worthy reasons and with the modesty I could muster in my simplicity, have been delivered to you. I pray to the gracious God through Jesus Christ that He may someday respond to their pious wish by sending someone who is suitable for preaching the kingdom of God, and that He may also continue to support me in the position I have administered for almost eight years, so that I may bring greater fruit not for my own, but for His name's glory. Amen.</p>

      <p>The booklet on resurrection is not mine, but yours, and it is printed with sufficient chastity and elegance for the pious who long for eternal life. Therefore, it is widely distributed and handled by many, which I do not doubt happens with great benefit, especially in this perverse and almost ruin-threatening age, where Satan rages more vehemently than ever against the faithful sealed by God's spirit. For what more comforts a dejected and storm-tossed soul than the undoubted hope and glory of resurrection? The deeper the Holy Spirit has implanted this in the hearts of the pious, the greater the benefit they will undoubtedly receive in the future. How others are moved by it, I do not know. It certainly affects me deeply, as I, now an old man, pray incessantly to the gracious God through Jesus Christ to place this hope in my bosom in my declining years. Amen, amen.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Now I will outline the state of our church and some other matters so that you may understand the machinations of Satan. We indeed suffer more adversaries than ever in previous years. The wicked seed of the Anabaptists has taken root throughout the entire field, especially around Nikolaus König, where they have secretly nested, so that the church is almost universally shaken, to the extent that no reasoning or scriptures or certain arguments, not even chains and prisons, can persuade them from their hypocrisy to the sincerity of true religion, etc. Moreover, the neighboring Papists, after the downfall of the robber of Brunswick, are more ferocious, miserably slandering the cause of piety and inciting their own against us. Our people, when they go to the nearby towns for the weekly market, are badly slandered and cursed. Persuaded by their example, many of our own, especially those who are not firm, gradually fall away from good morals, despising the decrees of the prince in which they were raised, and have become so hardened that they can scarcely be brought to modesty by any severe punishments, chains, and prisons. Meanwhile, we cry out until we are hoarse, but little is achieved. It seems to me they are nurturing a monster, which I wish would be crushed by the power of God as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>The church of Montbéliard, pacified against all hope by the old Duke, will henceforth be freely administered by French ministers according to the original institution. I send you a copy of the concord written by Gerold. Toussain has been sent back and restored to his church with an even higher stipend than before. However, the adversaries grumble and gnash their teeth, not daring to whisper even a little against it, etc.</p>

      <p>Various rumors, but how true, I do not know, especially about military preparations. The Englishman still devastates France, raising troops everywhere, whose services he will use this spring. He captured a large and fortified city during these winter months; the name escapes me. Then a hundred English horsemen killed five hundred Frenchmen, among whom were noblemen. This news came today from the chancellor, etc.</p>

      <p>The robber of Brunswick demands to be admitted into the Schmalkaldic League, a notable traitor who should be taken up to the greater ruin of Germany, etc.</p>

      <p>The council at Trent, postponed for some time, began again with great pomp on the third Sunday of Advent. There, the legates and papal cardinals magnify themselves. Let them see to it that they do not burst like the frog in Aesop's fable.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The colloquium at Regensburg has begun. There are from our side Bucer, Brenz, Schnepf, and Martin Frecht from Ulm. Philipp Melanchthon was still expected a few days ago. From the opponents, there are Julius Pflug, a Carmelite from Cologne, the auxiliary bishop of Mainz, Malvenda, the emperor's confessor, and Johannes Hoffmeister, that Colmar monk with one eye, our neighbor, who said before his departure in a public sermon: "If it is possible that the world was seduced by an Augustinian monk, then it is also possible that it will be converted again by an Augustinian monk, like me," etc. The presidents of the colloquium are the Bishop of Eichstätt and Count Friedrich of Fürstenberg.</p>

      <p>The emperor in Lower Germany miserably tortures the Christians. On the eve of St. Andrew, he beheaded a certain printer in Antwerp for no other reason than that he printed a Bible with Luther's scholia.</p>

      <p>The Elector Palatine recently held a meeting in December of all nobles and governors, inviting the neighboring counts and princes, among whom was our own. The most important discussion was about preaching the Gospel throughout the Palatinate. How varied the plans were, how varied the minds were, is easily gathered. But the gracious God, who does not regard our merits or justice, mercifully looking upon them, finally led them to agree that Christ should be received. He will first reform the academy, appointing good professors of the arts and pious theologians. For this work, if the Saxon permits, Philipp Melanchthon will be called. They say that some decrees have now been published, which, as a kind of prelude, indicate what is being conceived in their minds. If it succeeds, there is considerable hope that the people of Speyer, Hagenau, Sélestat, Colmar, Kaysersberg, and other smaller towns subject to that principality will follow. We pray, therefore, that the kingdom of Christ may be expanded. But let this suffice for now, until the new year soon brings forth many new things with which it is pregnant. Then more abundant, etc.</p>

      <p>Farewell with the church of Christ and your family. Greet Gwalther and the others, etc.</p>

      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
