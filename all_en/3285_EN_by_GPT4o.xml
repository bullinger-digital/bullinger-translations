      <p> Greetings. When it is well known to me that your school is a fruitful nursery for producing pious teachers, and I am not unaware of how useful the labor of our venerable brother Peter Martyr (Pietro Martire Vermigli) is in its holy and pure instruction, I fear that I may seem to ask you with little modesty to have him serve the office of pastor among the common people rather than educate future ministers of the word in a renowned and splendid auditorium. And certainly, if a teacher were to be sought for our school, which neither in frequency nor in other endowments matches yours, I would rashly attempt to bring a man from you who is perfectly suitable. But because I am compelled to grant this by the requests of our Italian guests, there is no need for me to excuse myself further. Would that, as I am persuaded this request will not be troublesome to you, I had equal confidence in obtaining it! And yet, given your concern for the church of Christ, if you can grant him to us without your greatest inconvenience, I hope that the people deprived of their pastor will be of more value to you than to reject such earnest prayers. </p>
      <p> Master Peter Martyr himself knows what kind of man our Martinengo was, in whose place he is now called. </p>
      <p> I am the best witness of how faithfully he completed the course of his duty. Certainly, his memory makes it so that few are found suitable to bear the burden: because it is to be feared, if the successor does not measure up, that he may be held in contempt and thus gradually the church may decline. Moreover, the number of people who demand Martyr is not small (he was elected by the common vote of all) and there are many wise and serious men, some even learned, so that our Martyr, in undertaking this province, will not make a regrettable effort. But if the whole matter is weighed in the balance of our guests, if he concedes to come here, they do not doubt that the fruit of his labor will be more abundant. Although I do not dare to pronounce it, I know that it is a matter of no light importance to preserve the state of this church intact, from which the light of heavenly doctrine has been spread far and wide until now. Therefore, since the common edification is dear to you, consider again and again whether your church can do without this man, who is not only sought with the most ardent prayers but, if he obtains a mission from you, will devote his work to his own people and to us with incredible progress. Farewell, most upright brothers and truly to be respected by me. </p>
      <p> May the Lord continue to protect and bless you and guide you in this matter with the spirit of prudence! Geneva, the day before the calends of September 1557. My colleagues greet you respectfully. Your Johannes Calvin. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent men and faithful servants of Christ, the pastors and doctors, fellow ministers and brothers of the church of ZÃ¼rich, to be respected by me. </p>
