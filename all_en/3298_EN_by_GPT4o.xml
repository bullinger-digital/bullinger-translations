      <p>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father through our common Lord Jesus Christ. We received your gift of the vigils, venerable father, on the Apocalypse of John the Apostle with open and most grateful hearts. Therefore, for the greatest matter of your beneficence, who deemed us worthy of such a gift, we give the greatest and immense thanks for the immense labors undertaken for Christ and the church, and thus on behalf of all of us. You have indeed undertaken a difficult task, but one that is useful and very necessary, and worthy of your singular and manifold learning, with which you are endowed by God. Therefore, we rejoice in your happiness, as we see you daily ascending to greater and higher things in the investigation and narration of sacred matters, and finally being admitted into those secret chambers of the most hidden heavenly things, so that pious minds may not dread these dark recesses with you as their guide, but having entered, may see more clearly in the light who Christ is, who that antichrist is, what the fate of the church is, and what the expectation of the elect is. We also received from the gift of our Frisius, Mr. Gwalther, the works on the Acts and the same work of immense labor and admiration, which will be of great use to the church and its pastors, which we have joined with yours not incongruously; although different, they nevertheless mutually regard each other. For just as in that work the history of the purer apostolic doctrine and the nascent church is described, so in this work of yours, the type of the now declining and most impure apostolic profanation is revealed, so that the pious may not be ignorant of what is to be followed or avoided on both sides. Therefore, we give thanks to the immortal God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, residing in the heavens and giving gifts to men, pastors, and teachers for the restoration of the saints in the work of administration, in the edification of the body of Christ. It will be our duty to also pale with equal vigilance at the same things, which your inexhaustible labor has written for us with the grace of God. But we each burn with a vehement and eager desire to read.</p>
      <p>We give thanks and pray for success.</p>
      <p>However, the reward, which we cannot provide, you will receive from God in the heavens most abundantly. Moreover, I recently saw the confession on the Eucharist of the pastors of some Saxon churches, or the conspiracy or heap of slanders in a book especially against our Calvin, which he addressed to the Saxons. Where, lest I say anything harsher, I pray for a better mind for them; but since, in their drunkenness of sense, they do not know what they are doing, may this sin not be imputed to them. However, I see that although they like to rage beyond measure in their own way from the beginning, they are nevertheless particularly offended by the vehemence of that little book.</p>
      <p>And to confess frankly, I too am offended in some places; for in my judgment, the most excellent man seems to have somewhat forgotten his dignity, being moved by the indignity of the matter. I am grieved that the gravity of such a man and his incomparable learning are turned into old wives' quarrels with sincere warmth, and that so great a mind is moved from its station. I would wish, according to the modesty of my judgment, that this cause of Christ be conducted with a calm and more composed mind, following your example, not because I consider them unworthy of a bad knot, but because it has been enough to contend with importunate reproaches on both sides.</p>
      <p>For what does it avail in the meantime to detain peace-loving and truth-seeking readers, good men, with the most troublesome entanglements of disputes, insults, and anger? Especially when we see those whom we greatly desire to be brought over being driven astray by such bitterness. I feel the same in myself, how little slanderers achieve whenever I hear this impure petulance of theirs. For those whom the truth of the matter and the evidence of the scriptures do not convince, scurrility is attempted in vain.</p>
      <p>The things you write are seasoned with salt and with the sharpness that is appropriate in its place, but combined with humility, modesty, grace, and that sincerity of mind, so that they can instruct the unlearned and soothe and heal wounded minds. In this Saxon pamphlet, if I remember correctly, I hear nothing or little more irate or virulent said against you, thanks to your moderation making them more placable. Indeed, the asperities should be diluted; however, I would not wish to open a wider window to mordacity by my example. But should we leave these wagons of insults to those for whom it seems customary and beautiful? Yet that method would seem to me the most advisable for defending the cause of our truth and dignity, unless we wish not only to expose all authority and reputation of our name to the ridicule of the popes and papists in view, but also, with great danger to the truth, to be utterly consumed like rabid dogs by mutual bites. These things, my dearest lord and father in the Lord Bullinger, I write to you, a man most fair to me for your humanity; you, for your singular and Christian prudence, confirmed by long experience and careful observation of things, know best what needs to be done. Consider my owls favorably.</p>
      <p>Keep us and our church commended to God in your prayers. May God, in His mercy, preserve you along with the other pillars of the church strong and unharmed for a long time for the glory of His name and the preservation of sincere doctrine. Farewell in the Lord, venerable father.</p>
      <p>We wish you to bid farewell to the pastors, fellow ministers, teachers, and the other best and most learned men of your church.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, September 3, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kessler, your paternity's most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, venerable Antistes of the Zurich church and his father in the Lord to be observed.</p>
