    <p xml:id="regest1">Zurich's Confession of the Lord's Supper from October 1534: Like Zwingli, Oecolampadius, Bertram Ratramnus, and Augustine, the people of Zurich confess that the body and blood of Christ are eaten and drunk by the believers in the Lord's Supper. Christ is present, but not in a physical, sensory manner; for bodily, he sits at the right hand of God in a place in heaven. In the Lord's Supper, he is present in the special manner of the sacrament, which is known only to believers. Therefore, transubstantiation and other carnal opinions, as well as the opposite view that it is merely symbolic, are to be rejected. This confession of faith is written on behalf of Jud, Pellikan, and Bibliander. Blarer is to show it to Grynaeus, Philipp Melanchthon, and Osiander, who do not oppose Bucer. According to his own testimony No. 443, Bucer teaches like Oecolampadius and Augustine, which corresponds to the Zurich doctrine. Instead of opposing each other, they should fight together against the Antichrist. Even if their friendship is scorned, the people of Zurich want to remain on the Lord's path.</p>

      <p>To Ambrosius Blarer, Heinrich Bullinger wishes grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>What the blessed memory of Huldrych Zwingli wrote to the most illustrious princes of Germany against the calumnies of Eck, what Johannes Oecolampadius responded in a dialogue to Melanchthon's letter, indeed, what before them Bertram Ratramnus and Saint Aurelius Augustine wrote and acknowledged about this sacred matter, especially in the book "On Christian Doctrine" and in the "Tractates on the Gospel of John" and other places, this same thing we assert today, namely that the body and blood of Christ are truly eaten and drunk by the faithful in the Lord's Supper. Hence, it follows that Christ is neither absent nor can it be called the Lord's Supper where the Lord is not present. But here we reject all carnal servitude. "For Christ has given us nothing sensible," as Saint Chrysostom says. "He has given sensible things, but all are intelligible." Therefore, we confess that Christ sits at the right hand of the Father in some place in heaven due to the nature of a true body, but in the Supper, he is present in the manner proper to the sacraments and known to his faithful, who venerate the sacraments not with carnal servitude, but rather with spiritual freedom. Thus, we do not approve of those who assert transubstantiation or obscure this sacred mystery of the Supper with carnal opinions. We also disapprove of those who, in the meantime, deny the presence of Christ so that in this sacred mystery of the Supper they recognize nothing but bread and wine, mere signs, I say.</p>
      <p>This is our confession, we who preach Christ in Zurich, of Leo Jud, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and others, who have ordered these things to be written to you, dearest Ambrosius. Furthermore, if it seems advisable to you, communicate this also to Simon Grynaeus, Philipp Melanchthon, and Osiander. We hear that they are not very opposed to Bucer, who nevertheless continually testifies that he asserts the same thing that Oecolampadius and Augustine taught before him. Since we do the same - for we have not yet read all of Bucer's works ourselves - why are we still judged as enemies? That confession of ours was not born recently in our home, but was proclaimed centuries ago by Augustine, whom no one ever denied to be an orthodox and catholic doctor of the church.</p>
      <p>Enough has been fought on both sides to the great scandal of the weak and the joy of the impious. The matter itself would finally demand that, with all enmity set aside, we move together with united forces against the Antichrist. We promise our efforts and will continue to be brothers, forgetful of old injuries and quarrels. But if anyone despises our friendship or condemns those who think orthodoxly about the Eucharist, we, relying on our innocence, will continue by the grace given to us in the Lord's way and commend our cause to the highest and most just judge, God, who knows what we aim for in this matter. However, we write these things with no affection or prejudice, hoping for the best, especially since you, Ambrosius, together with our Grynaeus, hearts dedicated to God and holy concord, understand how much it is fitting for us to strive, endeavor, and labor here.</p>
