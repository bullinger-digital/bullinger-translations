      <p>Greetings. So as not to interrupt your many affairs, most reverend lord, with my unnecessary letters, I will be more sparing in writing to you now, especially since we have nothing from Italy worthy of writing about. There is one thing, which I believe you have already known for some time, namely how the inquisitor was recently killed with his ministers in certain disturbances in Lucca. Nor do I think it is unknown to you that the son of our orator was recently anointed with spit and salt by our bishop. Meanwhile, I have arranged for those letters to be sent to the Republic of Bern; you can send and take care of the remaining ones, which pertain to your most honorable magistrate and a certain citizen, through Lucius, so that they do not cause you any trouble. From Turkey, there is nothing, as Mr. Ruinella informed me today, who had invited me to the lord in the castle. This to you more verbosely than I had thought.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent and most reverend lord father. May Jesus, the savior of the world, preserve you safe and sound for all of us for as long as possible. Mr. Consul, Mr. Karl, Mr. Bonett, Mr. Gantner, Mr. Pontisella, and especially Mr. Ruinella send their greetings to your excellency. You will also greet for us Mr. Wolfgang Haller, Mr. Erni, and your entire excellent and most gracious household.</p>
      <p>Chur, October 10, 1569.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your lordship, Tobias Egli.</p>
