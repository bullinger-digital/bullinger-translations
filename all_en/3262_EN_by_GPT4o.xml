      <p>Greetings. While I am occupied with the defense of our common doctrine, behold, our neighbors wage a cruel war against us, intending to destroy both this church and the city completely. But this is the reward that Christ's servants must expect from an ungrateful world.</p>
      <p>I can scarcely express my grief.</p>
      <p>Because the exiles had not ceased their slander for a whole year and a half, and the Bernese, having been asked repeatedly, responded that the matter should be taken up with the governors, our people, at their urging, complained about the insults. And because they suspected (as was proven by the outcome) that they were being cunningly and maliciously tested, so as not to unwittingly fall into traps, they explicitly stated before the contestation of the lawsuit that they were acting under the condition that the governor would only restrain the insults and slanders and would investigate the actual matter (as they say), but would not touch the sentences passed by our senate against the exiles. However, after the governor showed by clear signs that he had declared himself an enemy, he finally inquired whether the city's attorney wished to desist from his protest. When this was not granted, he denied that he could render justice.</p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter, he was ordered to pronounce judgment.</p>
      <p>He then said that he would investigate the entire case from the beginning and instructed the attorney to submit to his examination whatever had been done here. There was no cause for appeal because he pronounced outside the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he protested the nullity, since the judge was neither competent nor did he keep within the limits of his office. While they usually grant forty days to the most contentious to pursue an appeal, our people were condemned again in Bern on the eighth day thereafter. An even harsher sentence was given, that all our expenses should be repaid immediately.</p>
      <p>No one had appealed, yet they judged: our people had not been summoned, yet they were condemned under the pretext of contumacy. I do not think such a shameful example of impudence has existed in this age.</p>
      <p>The governor not only hastens to execute, but again pronounces, since the previous sentence has not been satisfied: that the exiles are innocent, and condemns the syndics, the senate, and the entire body of the city to undergo the same disgrace and to repair all damages, as if he were subjecting us to plunder and holding us besieged within the city walls.</p>
      <p>I do not speak hyperbolically: know that by this alone the citizens are stripped of all their fortunes and thrown into custody, so that no one dares to leave. Here you hear a portent of barbaric cruelty, which was not to be feared even from beasts. If this is tolerated, where is humanity? And our good brothers, the Bernese, remain idle and at rest.</p>
