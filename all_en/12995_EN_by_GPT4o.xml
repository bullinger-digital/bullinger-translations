    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Last evening, the [bearer], the Bohemian Wenzeslaus Fronta, sought out Vadian. He stated that he traveled from Padua over the Gotthard Pass first to Feldkirch and then over the Rhine to St. Gallen because he wanted to meet him personally and obtain money for his further journey. He also wishes to visit Zurich. Therefore, he asked Vadian for the present letter of recommendation, a request that Vadian easily complied with, as he is always willing to help students, even though he has often been deceived. But Franta seems intelligent, eloquent, and pleasant in manner. Moreover, he does not appear deceitful, but rather sympathetic, so Vadian does not want to refuse him his support. Bullinger, his best friend, should also assist him, according to the duties owed to strangers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Vadian's fever illness is nothing new. He has already been afflicted by it five times and had to stay at home because of it. However, on June 1st, the fever rose so much that people feared for him for days afterward, and he himself felt close to death. But with the help of medicines and by the grace of God, the fever and stomach problems, which had caused him to lose so much weight, disappeared at the beginning of July. Now he can consume drinks and more solid foods again. He is getting better every day, and after almost a whole month, he can resume his duties as mayor. Death must have another appointment for him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] There is no news about Emperor Charles V and Hungary. The previously so eager correspondents write less to avoid exposing themselves, as the rumors and informants are currently unreliable! Bullinger can be sure that Vadian will not be overwhelmed by any misfortune, for he knows what awaits the pious, and the malicious, impudent enemy of faith, who lives among them, has long since made them hard and thick-skinned. Nevertheless, things look good for the [Protestants], for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Last evening, Wenzeslaus Franta, a Bohemian by birth and nation, visited me here. He stated that he came from Padua, having crossed the Gotthard Pass first to Feldkirch, then crossed the Rhine to reach me in St. Gallen. He wished to meet me personally, as he only knew me by name, and to greet me. Additionally, he hoped to receive some financial assistance for his journey, as he was destitute, to proceed directly to Zurich, which he was very eager to visit. Therefore, he requested that I commend him to your exceptional kindness through my letter, which I certainly did in my usual manner, as I always wish to assist students, even though I have often been deceived by many false brothers. However, since he is of quick wit and not lacking in eloquence, and his manners are not such that I would find them objectionable, and his appearance seemed genuinely honest and generous, do not deny him my assistance. I wanted to ask you, as the most esteemed friend of all whom I hold dear, not to withhold any duty we owe to strangers and to get to know the man better than I could in such a short time.</p>

      <p>Regarding my illness, nothing new or unusual has happened to me. I have suffered from fever five times, both at home and abroad, but on the first of June, it attacked me so severely that many feared for me in the following days, and I was convinced that I would depart from this world. In the meantime, I applied whatever remedies I could and should, and with great pain and effort, I managed to break the illness. By the grace of God, as things turned around at the beginning of July, the fever completely left me, and soon the stomach discomfort, which had caused me to wither remarkably, was lifted. I can now enjoy more solid food and drink, and I am improving daily to the extent that I have resumed my duties as mayor, having been on leave for almost a whole month. I no longer doubt that another time has been appointed for my death.</p>

      <p>There is persistent silence regarding Emperor Charles V and other matters, especially those concerning Hungary. The unreliability of news and the variety of rumors cause those who previously shared much with us to write less now, to preserve their credibility. However, do not think that I allow myself to be broken or overwhelmed by any misfortune. I know the state of those who wish to live piously in Christ, and the enemy of our religion, who is not only malicious but also pestilent, has long since made us resilient, as we endure him within our walls. But our people are well, for they are destined and decreed not for temporary, but eternal goods.</p>

      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 8th day of July, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours, Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, president of the most ample church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
