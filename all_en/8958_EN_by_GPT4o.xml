      <p>God with us. Since you so faithfully ask for news, I am sending you here what I have received from Augsburg; I have nothing yet from Strasbourg, waiting every hour. However, Lumaga the merchant has come up here, confirming everything that is in the Augsburg news, and so much more, that the Duke of Alba and Medina Coeli have moved with all their might towards Antwerp, the beautiful city badly damaged by the demolition of houses; for they are preparing for a siege.</p>
      <p>He also says that the Count Palatine has captured the one from Frundsberg along with a Spanish lord and declared himself an enemy of Alba, as have Saxony and Hesse. If I receive anything from Strasbourg, I will share it with you. The other news has come to me from Paris from the young lord of Hohen-Sax, who has come out on the post towards Solothurn and Baden and was delivered to me the day before yesterday. Heinrich has written it down for your sake. Send it back to me, yes mine, not Heinrich's, soon. If we catch fish, I will send it to you and Susanna. Greet her faithfully for me and the children, and if you no longer need the Frenen and their needs, and the weather is good, then send it back home. Pray to God earnestly for health, keep yourself right, so that you may be strong, and write to me how you are doing and about your situation. I think it will not be long before the king will demand soldiers and the Spaniard will cause trouble in the lands through his influence as in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>God with us eternally; may He strengthen you and make you truly healthy. All our people greet you all.</p>
      <p>Postera Margarita, July 16, 1572.</p>
      <p>This [...] I send to you.</p>
