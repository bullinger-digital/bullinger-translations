    <p xml:id="regest2">- Even if the news of the capture of the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] was false, Bullinger still fears worse. For [Duke Heinrich of Brunswick], who was accused of the worst crimes before the Emperor [Charles V] and the Imperial Estates, is now spared by the innate leniency of the princes. In the past, the Emperor was accused of tolerating the wrongdoer. But now [Duke Maurice of] Saxony and [Duke Eric II of Brunswick]-Lüneburg are gaining a good reputation because they are advocating for the criminal.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Pension recipients were handed over to the people of Zurich, after which the Bernese and others advocated for them, so they were spared. But soon Zurich will be handed over to the pension recipients, by whose hand their opponent Zwingli died. The same fate awaits others as well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Marquis [Alfonso d'Avalos] gave [the Swiss envoys] a written response advantageous to himself and also behaved arrogantly. It will only be decided at the future, not yet scheduled, Diet whether to respond to it. Blarer will surely have heard of the plot against Turin. Soldiers have returned from Piedmont. The Bernese have sent 1000 men towards Geneva. They also wanted the Confederates to muster 5000 men, but there is no more talk of it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The [Zurichers] proceed as before with soldiers: captains, recruiters, and paymasters are not allowed into the city under threat of the death penalty. If mercenaries participate in a campaign, they are dispossessed, arrested upon their return, and their swords are confiscated. As before, their weapons are returned to them after a long time if they behave well. There was such an edict shortly before [June 24, 1545]. What [Joachim] Mötteli [of Rappenstein] or others say is not true.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger had the letter delivered to [Barbara, née von Ulm], the wife of [Jakob Röist]. He has no doubt that the Emperor, the Pope [Paul III], and [King Francis I] conspire against Christ. Enclosed he sends back [the copy] of the letter from [Elector Johann Friedrich I] of Saxony [and Landgrave Philipp of Hesse to the Council of Strasbourg] and asks for news about the [Schmalkaldic] Diet in Frankfurt.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings from [Rudolf] Gwalther, who was present when Blarer's letter [HBBW XV, No. 2316] was opened.</p>

      <p>May divine goodness grant you, most esteemed man and dearest brother in the Lord, that this year begins, progresses, and ends most happily for you and your entire family.</p>

      <p>Even if the news about the capture of the Landgrave is false, I still expect worse, for they accused him of the most cruel acts in the world before the Emperor and the Imperial Estates, whom the Lord has delivered into their hands, and he is spared by the so-called innate clemency of the princes. The Emperor was criticized for tolerating an adulterer, a violator of virgins, a sacrilegious person, a robber, and an arsonist. Now the merciful princes of Saxony and Lüneburg, who interceded for the criminal, are well spoken of.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The pension recipients were handed over to the people of Zurich. The Bernese and others interceded, and they were spared. But soon our people were handed over to the pension recipients, and Zwingli, who singularly persecuted them, was struck down by the hand of a pension recipient. The same fate awaits others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Marquis gave a written response, drawing much favor to himself and giving good words, otherwise behaving arrogantly and carrying himself highly. Whether the Confederates will respond will be known on the future day, which is not yet set, as my lords do not intend to set one. You are undoubtedly aware of the treachery over Turin. Some soldiers have been in Piedmont. There have been serious warnings that the Bernese have sent 1000 men to support a small force towards Geneva, want to organize 5000 for a banner, and have called upon all the Confederates; but it has calmed down again.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>My lords have not broken their statutes regarding the soldiers; captains, recruiters, and paymasters remain outside the city under threat of the sword; and there is no mercy. The common soldiers have never been outside the city, so they need to be let in. When they run away, they are taken in with what they have. When they return, they are put in the towers. This has been the practice until now. After that, they are let go without days. It is true that the common soldiers were allowed to carry their swords again before the feast of John the Baptist. If Mötteli or others say otherwise, it is too much. It is also not new that they are allowed to carry their swords again, as it was practiced 16 years ago when the common man behaved well, did penance for a time, and waited for a time, so they were allowed to carry their weapons again.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I took care to have the letter delivered to Röist's wife immediately. I have no doubt that the Emperor, the Pope, the French, and many others conspire against Christ, but He who dwells in the heavens will laugh at them. I am sending back the letter from Saxony and ask you to share what you receive from the Frankfurt Diet.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell with all yours. All the brothers greet you, especially Gwalther, who was with me when I opened your letter.</p>
      <p>Zurich, on the day of the Circumcision, in the year 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, always, entirely.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, always to be esteemed and loved brother.</p>
