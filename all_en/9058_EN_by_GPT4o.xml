      <p>Dear sir and friend. Doctor Erastus has written to me, saying that if I wanted to write to my daughter or to him, I should send it to your grace. Since I intend to make a journey home in a few days, I am sending you this letter. If you happen to have any messages to send to Heidelberg, I kindly ask you to send him this letter, with the request that if there is any new information to report, he should inform me. May the Lord God keep you in His grace and turn away all evil plans devised against His word; for I fear evil plots. All of this to you in haste.</p>
      <p>From Uster, 8th of October.</p>
      <p>Your faithful friend Ulrich Philipp von Sax, Baron. 1572.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my dear and trusted friend, to be delivered.</p>
