      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, excellent man, dated June 20th in Chiavenna, promptly.</p>
      <p>I could not respond immediately due to business, and now I am compelled to respond very briefly. First of all, I urge you not to withdraw our son Johannes from his studies; I hope that if he lives, he will someday be an ornament to the Rhaetians. Greet him most kindly.</p>
      <p>I have placed Hector, his brother, with Mr. Sebastian, the schoolmaster, etc., whom our Johannes knows.</p>
      <p>I have settled accounts with Mr. Antonio, with whom Josue, the younger brother, resides, in his presence, and his father owes me nine gold coins, calculated at 15 batzen of Constance per gold coin and batzen with 3 heller. I wrote the calculation on a slip and included it in the letters written to your father; please excuse me to him for dismissing him. Furthermore, I have paid seven and a half batzen of Constance for the transport of your Johannes's small barrel from Basel; it remains in my house. I have asked Ziegler and Antonio Besuzio to arrange for its transport; but it remains in my house.</p>
      <p>In England, the parliament ended on May 8th, and by common vote, the following have certainly been decreed, as is written to us from London: 1. The Roman pontiff and church have been renounced forever. 2. The jurisdiction that the Roman pontiff had is given to the queen, who has accepted it except for the title of head of the church. 3. The mass has been abolished along with all papal impieties. 4. The reformation of King Edward VI has been received again in doctrines and rites. 5. Bishops have been reduced to order, their castles, wealth, and secular dominions taken away. 6. Visitors have been sent to reform schools and begin reformation through the bishoprics.</p>
      <p>In Scotland, a commotion has arisen; the free course of the gospel is demanded; they demand their queen, so that either she or the king presides over the kingdom of Scotland; they do not want to be governed as a prefecture. It is said that some Frenchmen have been killed, etc.</p>
      <p>In France, which I write to you for certain, the king is preparing for a severe persecution of the faithful and is already capturing some, harassing the Poitevins. He has gravely threatened the King of Navarre and the Count of Aran... etc.</p>
      <p>Thus he is instigated by those to whom a worthy reward will someday be paid.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell with your father-in-law and all good people. Most hastily.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 7, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Friedrich von Salis, most worthy commissioner of Chiavenna, his most sincere and always beloved lord and friend. Chiavenna.</p>
