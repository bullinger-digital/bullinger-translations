      <p>Your inclination towards England, most learned Bullinger, is such that I can easily persuade myself that your kindness will equally care for the matters I have requested from you in my letters of intercession, as if I were to address the same matter with many letters and much more detail. Therefore, I commend to you my petition for my England, whose affairs, the more miserable they are, the more they are worthy of greater compassion. Indeed, our affairs are becoming worse by the day; for I have already received from England that the Earl of Sussex has been sent with some military force into Norfolk and Suffolk to compel the evangelicals to attend masses. And what tyranny is this? Do you not think that the truly pious now need consolation, and the weak need exhortation? Therefore, if you have the time, best father, visit our people with your letters. Philippus asked the counselors to be inaugurated, that is, as it is commonly said among us, that the affairs of England be crowned, and to send ten thousand Englishmen to serve under the Emperor in the French war; but both requests were denied to him. From here, from here, deadly evils will arise for England, unless the best and greatest God averts them in his supreme mercy; that he may do so, pray to our God through Christ, and make some mention of me at the end of your prayer.</p>
      <p>Yours, Thomas Sampson.</p>
      <p>October 13. Lausanne.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, these are given. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
