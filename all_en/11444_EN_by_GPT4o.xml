    <p xml:id="regest1">He does indeed stand by his promise to Bullinger and Froschauer to send his booklet about the old monasteries of Germany, but due to the council, which is struggling with [the Abbot of St. Gallen, Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee], he cannot have it appear at the [Frankfurt] Autumn Fair. In it, he mercilessly criticizes the depravity of monasticism - particularly Benedictine - already in its early days, while attributing the little he finds praiseworthy more to the care of some princes than to the monks; although others have spoken just as clearly against monasticism, a publication of his writing would arouse great hatred.</p>

      <p>To keep my promise and faith, most honorable Bullinger, you ask for the reason because I promised to give you and our Froschauer my booklet about the old monasteries of Germany. I truly confess that I promised and am increasingly concerned every day that what I have promised, and which I will give not without grave hatred of my name, should be published as conveniently as possible. However, it cannot be published at the next fair, for various reasons which are not worth mentioning, especially because I am certain that our council will not allow me to publish it, and I would not dare to commit to having it published by the printer either against his will or without his knowledge. However, we will undoubtedly have an opportunity soon to publish whatever work it is far more appropriately than it could be at present. But I would like you to be convinced that I am so inclined that if this delay of mine, or rather fear, were to harm the promotion of piety, so that it could be thought that by not publishing it, any harm would be done to the churches, whether local or foreign, who worship Christ with us in one spirit and one faith, I would certainly comply with you even against the will of the magistrate and without regard to any danger. However, since I am certain that there is no need for any hasty action for any slight reason, and in the meantime, as the situation with our council and the new daily machinations of Antron (the Abbot of St. Gallen, Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee) stand, it could come into the hands of many not without some serious public or private inconvenience and loss. For there I pursue other monasticism, especially Benedictine, with such freedom that I demonstrate it was not very good even in those centuries when the Germans revered and increased it with a certain admiration, and from there I expose and discuss the laziness, ignorance, barbarism, and also the ambition and greed of both the ancient and recent monks with certain old and new indications, monuments, and arguments, so that they convincingly prove that this artificial religion, disgraced and ruined by so many abuses, can no longer be endured or tolerated. Meanwhile, I praise certain old rites and not impious studies; but I praise them in such a way that this praise reflects more on the care and diligence of the princes, who wanted monasticism to be as intact as possible, than on the sobriety or abstinence of the monks. But how do you think I praise monasticism, which I advise to be removed and abolished? Therefore, even if I commend a few things, those which I reject and condemn outweigh them, so that, although the same subject has been treated repeatedly in recent years and by the most learned men, I still consider that a considerable amount of hatred will arise when the booklet is published. 3rd day before the Kalends of June 1540.</p>
