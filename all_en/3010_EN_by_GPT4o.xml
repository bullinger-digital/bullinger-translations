      <p>Greetings from God through Christ the Savior.</p>
      <p>If, according to the opinion of the pagans, the wise and the strong have a homeland everywhere, because their own virtue commends them and patience in difficult matters greatly comforts and helps them, then much more, by Hercules, will the companions of one and the same religion, that is, the faithful of Christ, be at home wherever they come, provided they come to the household of faith. Therefore, such people need no other recommendation, especially among good men, than the nobility of their spirit and character. This is what my relatives and fellow countrymen Johannes Pincier and Caspar Corilius (crossed out: Johannes Hernandi) seem to bring to you, who, at the expense of their parents, have devoted themselves for a time to true wisdom in Strasbourg and, after Peter Martyr left there, requested by letter from me to either obtain or arrange their departure to you from their parents and furthermore to commend them to your faith. Indeed, I did this willingly and voluntarily, relying on the good hope that by conducting themselves rightly and with integrity of life, they will please you more than by my recommendation. I therefore pray that they may have access to your humanity, so that they too may return to us more humane. I pledge and promise on behalf of these two young men, if anything is entrusted to them in my name for the advancement of their studies there, that I will fulfill the trust placed in me, if necessary. For since I myself have been the author to their parents of sending them to you, I must not fail them in any way that I understand can make this journey easier and more beneficial. However, I hope that this my humble service of letters will at least be of such benefit that they may use your counsel, which they will need in many of their affairs, a little more freely and without suspicion of impudence.</p>
      <p>Thus far concerning these young men, for whom this writing was mainly undertaken. But, to also mention something about myself, I will pour into your bosom certain complaints, partly private, partly public, about our princes and especially about the eldest among the younger ones, who, although he seems to many to display some example of learning and virtue, I have discovered by certain indications that it is greatly to be feared lest he fall short of the hope and expectation raised about him. For in the past winter, by chance, it happened that the prince father was with us for three whole days in a boar hunt with his two elder sons. Meanwhile, while the father was engaged with the wild beasts, the elder son arranged through his procurers to have a prostitute brought to him from Marburg. Knowing this, when I was to preach in the court to the princes and courtiers, I directed the whole sermon to the morals of the princes and courtiers as best I could, and particularly inveighed against the fornication of the younger prince, although I also touched upon many other vices of the courtiers. But that matter then passed with good peace and pardon for me, so that no one openly said a word to me. However, very recently, when the same princes returned for a deer hunt, I was summoned to Prince Wilhelm, who, still mindful of the previous invective, to avenge himself, was throwing some jests at my age, inexperience, and position, which he did willingly. He also reproached me for having digressed from the usual manner of preaching and, like Proteus, having assumed various forms in the sermon, now noting this, now that. Then he remonstrated with me for having too scurrilously rebuked vices; that a preacher ought to be gentle and mild, etc. That the crime of fornication was known to all and there was no need for a herald to publicize it. That I was manifestly blaming the magistrate for the occasion of tumult and sedition. He also interpreted my freedom in speaking as ostentation and arrogance, and when I excused myself, saying that I had spoken quite modestly, compelled by the necessity of conscience, he laughed that I mentioned conscience and called me unfit for this office, who was so easily moved by conscience. He also complained that I had introduced examples of pagans to confound the princes, asking me whether I thought Christians should be instructed from pagan histories.</p>
      <p>Finally, he prescribed to me a form of preaching and referred me to Aphthonius the sophist... He also presented examples of some of our preachers to imitate, who would recount various opinions on each part of the gospel and, if the place allowed, would descend into allegories. Although all these things are childish, I do not know how, yet they seem to me to presage nothing good, so that it is greatly to be feared that, with the father deceased and he himself in power, we will have, if any, a miserable state of the republic and church. I do not yet perceive how even the liberation from chains has made the father better for us, since the subjects are more and more burdened and harassed every day, and perhaps not without reason, because our sins deserve such vengeance. However, the princes themselves are not excused for this. Last May, when the senior prince was in Saxony, he had summoned Philipp Melanchthon to him, whom he had asked, among other things, about the grievance of the wild beasts, which has grown so much among us that the peasants living near the forests cultivate their fields more for the beasts than for themselves and their children; for they are not allowed to keep dogs to drive away the wild beasts, and fences a little higher than four feet are torn down.</p>
      <p>In short: bread is taken from the children and thrown to the deer and wild boars. Meanwhile, the wretched farmers groan with their families, and no one dares even to whisper. The prince had asked Melanchthon about this tyranny, whether it was possible to maintain the wild beasts with a good conscience to the detriment of the subjects. He had replied that this was no complaint of our peasants compared to the grievances, exactions, incursions, with which the Hungarians and the inhabitants of the Danube are daily oppressed by the Turks, against whom he had indeed piously and bravely encouraged the prince; but in that he had diminished the domestic calamity, it seems to me he acted somewhat inconsistently. Now, the prince, moved by the authority of such a great man, since he is otherwise by nature more than enough given to hunting and also has flatterers among the court preachers who approve and confirm the tyranny itself, will he not be angry with me and my kind if we sometimes speak against it on behalf of the subjects? Therefore, seeing such crimes defended at court, what else, I ask, can I divine but mere contempt of the word of God, which will most certainly be followed by the final judgment? May the Lord of hosts preserve in us the remnants, lest we all become like Sodom and Gomorrah, proclaiming our sins as they did. It would be desirable, however, that the prince be rightly admonished by some great man, if perhaps he would descend into himself, acknowledge his sins, and amend his life.</p>
      <p>That your humanity may do this on occasion, I implore again and again in the name of our common homeland. There are still other much graver matters about which I could rightly complain to you, if they could be safely entrusted to letters. And since I now think this is sufficient, I end my writing and commend you all to the most good and great God.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your whole family and church. Given from Wetter on the seventh day before the Ides of September in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>Pray to God for us, which we also diligently do in return. Yours, Johannes Pincier.</p>
      <p>To the most constant herald of the divine word, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful overseer of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his esteemed teacher in Christ.</p>
