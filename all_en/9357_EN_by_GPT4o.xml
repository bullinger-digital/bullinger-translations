      <p> Greetings. How much that most serious illness of yours grieves good men, most illustrious man, lord and most revered relative, is known to the best and greatest Lord, whom we fervently invoke for your health and safety. Just now, Lord Treasurer from Grafenried and Mr. Vurstenberger have arrived here, who send you many greetings. They have just offered the prince, in the name of their magistrate, an honorary gift, a well-fattened ox with a cart loaded with oats; the prince will depart either on Monday or perhaps later. I fear that he may be offended today because of that doctor from Lucerne, on whose behalf Helmlius from Lucerne, Ibergius from Schwyz, and Hessius from Glarus are now negotiating with him. Mr. Linerus is thinking of handling his matter in another way, since the president of the prince's chamber, Schürpfius from St. Gallen, is from his mother's side, and with his intercession, Mr. Samuel also hopes to achieve something. He sends you many greetings. Mr. Samuel was very busy and still is, since yesterday the prince of the Swiss received the envoys at a midday banquet and presented himself very generously. I would very much wish for you to write to the countess and to instruct her to educate the remaining children about the origin of error and the councils, not newly, not added from a composition, to explain the subject of those books and to encourage their fair reading; I would hope you would do this with great benefit. </p>
      <p> I will ensure the letters are delivered to her secretly. The ladies from Bappenheim were at Königsfeld yesterday and ran into Mr. Treasurer from Grafenried. </p>
      <p> As the prince departs from here, I understand that a marriage is being arranged between Ludwig of Württemberg and the daughter of Margrave Karl of Baden through his efforts. The great commendator's significant efforts to make incursions into Holland and Zeeland are being circulated here, which rumors I hope are false, and I wish the efforts to be in vain. And these things are written very hastily while my Felix is waiting. </p>
      <p> Farewell with your family and esteemed colleagues and brothers as best as possible, lord and most honorable relative. Forgive me. </p>
      <p> At the Swiss Waters, June 17th, very hastily at 2. Your Excellency's most devoted Wolfgang Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most honorable lord and relative. </p>
      <p> Zurich. </p>
