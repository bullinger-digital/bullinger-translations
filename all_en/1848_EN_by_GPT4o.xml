      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings, dear friend. We have received your recent letter to us dated the 14th of this month and were pleased to hear that your physical weakness is improving and that God has so arranged it that you must continue to work in His vineyard to honor His name and for the betterment of many, etc.</p>
      <p>We have received the three sermons on repentance that you sent us, but due to some of our business, we have not yet been able to read them. We have given them to some preachers to read, who have found them very pleasing, etc.</p>
      <p>We are glad to hear that Hans Haller, pastor in Bern, upon our inquiry and your writing to him, has named a pious learned man who might assist Tossano in Mömpelgard. Therefore, please convey our gracious thanks to the aforementioned Haller for this Christian work and promotion on our behalf, and also inform him that he should feel free to gain further and specific information on how, when, and under what conditions this man can be obtained, which you can write to us at any time (as soon as you receive a report from him).</p>
      <p>We have previously received the King of France's letter to the German princes in Latin and German. Dated Tübingen, the 14th of April, anno etc. 53.</p>
      <p>The new times send so much and so unexpectedly that we do not know what to write first. Margrave Albrecht has defeated the Bishop of Bamberg's cavalry and infantry, capturing 6 companies on foot and 400 on horseback within 10 days and has held the field. However, we are greatly concerned that it will take a harmful and evil outcome; the beginning is as it may be. God alone knows the end. Please patiently inquire on our behalf with Hans Haller regarding this preacher, as long as you think he is suitable and not contentious. With that, may God protect you.</p>
      <p>To our dear, special Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
