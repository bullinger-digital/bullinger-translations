    <p xml:id="regest1">Received both letters, but can only respond briefly. Regarding the first letter: what Bullinger has heard about [Paul] Fagius cannot be true, and Fagius would laugh about it; he was recalled from Strasbourg and will soon move to take the position of the deceased [Wolfgang] Capito; the dispatch [to Hans Welser in] Augsburg was forwarded. Regarding the second letter: Bullinger should no longer worry about the messenger, Blarer has already written to Vadian about it. The inflexible attitude of the Emperor, who already believes he has subdued France, is regrettable; only God can change his plans; with God's help, even the Emperor and hell can be overcome, if only the [Protestants] would repent. Bullinger's moderate response to [Martin] Frecht, which Blarer will also share with others, can only be approved, and the instigators of the unrest should be hated. How Bullinger transferred the statements of a Wittenberg friend [...] to Frecht is unclear to Blarer; Frecht appreciates the [Zurichers], and also desires - like Blarer himself - the commentary by [Theodor] Bibliander on Revelation; arrangements for its transcription may also be made in [Constance]; Blarer will soon forward a copy of Luther's letter to [Christoph] Froschauer to Frecht. Returns the satirical poem on [Andreas] Osiander, whose frank and malicious criticism he can only condemn. Bullinger is recommended to [Hans] Welser for his own virtues alone; but if Bullinger needs further recommendation, he can count on Blarer. Thanks Bullinger for speaking with [Jakob Ruf]; the pious widow [...] of the brother [Michel Ruf?] deserves that [Jakob Ruf] takes on the education of his nephew [...], especially since [Ruf] himself is childless; they are waiting for his letter. Bullinger should excuse his careless handwriting. Greetings, especially to Gwalther, to whom he will write soon.</p>

      <p>I have received both of your letters, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, to which I respond with only a few words, as I am not permitted to write much.</p>
      <p>First, regarding your earlier letter: Whoever wrote or said to you what you know about Fagius did so beyond his merit; rest assured, nothing of this ever crossed Paul's mind, and he even laughed when I informed him about it as much as I thought necessary. He has recently been recalled by the people of Strasbourg, where he will soon move to succeed the late Capito; may this be fortunate and auspicious for him! We could not manage to keep him entirely for ourselves despite many attempts, so we must acknowledge the good will of the Lord here as well. I have diligently ensured that the packages are faithfully delivered to Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Regarding your later letter: I earnestly beseech you not to be concerned about that messenger. I have written to Vadian, earnestly requesting him to inform me of the amount he paid, so that I can promptly reimburse him.</p>
      <p>It pains me greatly that the Emperor is so utterly inflexible that he cannot be appeased, yet the Lord can easily bend his heart wherever He wills.</p>
      <p>If we have Him on our side - and we will, if we sincerely repent - we will be superior not only to the Emperor but even to the very gates of hell. Moreover, what he has already devoured, he will regurgitate, still raw; he is far from being able to rejoice that he has truly devoured all of France, as he now hopes. May we overcome in time! If not, we can expect nothing but certain destruction; we are indeed urging repentance, but it is a tale told to the deaf, except that the Lord's word will not return to Him empty, so we should not regret our labor.</p>
      <p>Your moderate and Christian response to Frecht's letters cannot displease me or anyone else who is even slightly fair-minded. Although we act according to the Lord's will, we sometimes lose even what is permissible when it is deemed less expedient. I strongly detest these instigators of evil, who, if they did not exist, our churches would have been more peaceful long ago. But thus, those who are approved must be made manifest. Since I can do nothing else here, I will fervently pray to the Lord to crush these growing and dreadful evils with His mighty hand as soon as possible. I will ensure that what you have written is made known to others as much as necessary, but in such a way that it will not harm anyone.</p>
      <p>Regarding Frecht, I do not know how the error crept in, as if he wrote that you are breathing and hoping for victory, when a certain friend of his from Wittenberg wrote this to him. I believe Frecht thinks well of you, and he also earnestly requests, as I did recently, to receive some annotations or scholia on Revelation; if you desire a scribe, send him here, and as much as is permitted by the authority granted to us by our Theodor, it will be transcribed.</p>
      <p>I will diligently ensure, on my word, that Bibliander's copy is returned to you. I will send a copy of Luther's letter to your Froschauer to Frecht at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>I am returning Osiander's "Speculum," and if it truly represents him, I am very surprised if he does not shudder entirely when he contemplates himself more closely in it. In the meantime, it displeases me; for I frankly confess that this detestable license of the tongue to revile should be curbed early, if each person preferred to look at their own tumors rather than others' warts. In the meantime, it is the Lord's judgment that he who says what he wants will hear what he does not want.</p>
      <p>You have already been recommended to Welser by your own virtues before me. He is indeed unskilled in the Latin language; but he greatly loves all learned men, if they are also pious. If perhaps something can be added to the previous recommendation by my office, it will be added as surely as all my things are most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>We thank you greatly for what you have done with the surgeon, and we are expecting the man's letter; the woman is very pious, and he will have done something worthy of a good man if he takes on the care and education of his nephew from his brother, especially since he himself is childless. Your encouragements, which you provide, will greatly incite him, I beseech you.</p>
      <p>But now, farewell, my venerable Bullinger, and kindly forgive my very careless writing for your human leniency, and intercede with our common Savior Christ for us and our church with perpetual prayers, so that we may happily grow in Him to every good work. Greet your entire household with all friends, especially Gwalther, to whose most loving letters I will respond as soon as I have the opportunity. Our people greet you, especially my brother and Zwick. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>From Constance.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
