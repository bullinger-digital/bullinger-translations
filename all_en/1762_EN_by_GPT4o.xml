      <p>Most illustrious H[einrich] Bulling[er].</p>
      <p>In summary: I am compelled, whether I want to or not, to return from Chur and the synod to my church, yet with the intention of coming back here after the Christmas festivities and then to you. You can believe that it is not a pleasure to cross the Rhaetian Alps at this time of year; but it is necessary for the glory of God. I beg you, make sure that the letters I send are delivered to the duke as soon as possible. I am also expecting a small vessel brought from Basel to you.</p>
      <p>The matter of the Valtellina is what keeps me here, indeed a very serious one and in no way to be abandoned. For I am indeed of little value; but whatever I am, I was clearly necessary to handle it. Unless you press from there with your authority, and even with the authority of the council, I affirm that Camillus will infect our entire Rhaetia with his poison. The matter is most certain: the foundations have already been laid and some have been corrupted with money (listen to what I say), and he triumphs while the others turn a blind eye. I think you should move that council of yours to write to the mayor of Chur and demand the removal of the evil serpent in Rhaetia. If you do not do this, H[einrich] Bulling[er], the plague will rage so that it can no longer be extinguished. God knows how sincerely I write this, inflamed with zeal for the glory of our Lord God. With as much diligence as I could, I tried to persuade some here about expelling him and achieved nothing. Farewell and greetings to all the brothers. Chur, 20th of November 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich, brother and honorable lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
