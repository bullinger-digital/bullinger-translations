    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger should know that Johannes Haller was elected as the pastor of the Bernese church on October 9th by the [Bernese] Great Council with a large majority of votes and will be appointed with a letter addressed to the Zurich Council and delivered by a public messenger. What God has undoubtedly decided through providence and grace for the glory and salvation of His church should now be implemented in the best possible way! For if the two largest churches of the Confederation [Bern and Zurich] are sound, everything will likely develop for the best, and the Lord will not neglect the other churches either.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger should therefore ensure that Haller promptly follows the call and travels to Bern as quickly as possible, so that the devil cannot sow weeds through any delay and destroy God's work. Bullinger knows how much the Bernese church needs pious pastors and how tirelessly Kilchmeyer, with God's grace, has strived despite his old age to prevent the ship [of the Bernese church] from sinking. Therefore, he should do everything possible to send Haller, who is destined for his homeland by divine providence, to Bern. In doing so, he will perform a deed pleasing to God and the Bernese, as someone who always strives with great zeal for the welfare of his homeland.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Kilchmeyer will report in detail in the next letter how the two deceitful enemies of the cross of Christ [Beat Gering and Simon Sulzer] have ridiculed God's grace in their interpretations, contrary to the vow made in the [Bernese preachers' register]. But now he must close, because the great joy that Haller's appointment has brought him has already taken much time, and he must prepare the imminent public sermon through the study of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger and his entire family are greeted. Greetings also to all colleagues.</p>

      <p>S. On the ninth day of October, know that Mr. Haller was elected to the ministry of the Bernese church by the most ample votes in the most distinguished council and is now being called by the senate through a public messenger with letters sent to the magnificent Zurich council, so that what God, the best and greatest, has decreed by His singular grace and most holy providence, may be granted for His glory and the salvation of His church and, as much as possible, be promoted, about which we have no doubt. For with the two most distinguished churches of our Helvetia being safe, there will clearly be the best hope, and the Lord will by no means neglect the others.</p>

      <p>It will therefore be your task to move every stone, so that Mr. Haller promptly accepts the call and hastens to be sent to us as quickly as possible, lest perhaps, with a delay made, the enemy sows weeds and dissolves the work of God with his machinations. For you know how much the Bernese church needs pious pastors. You also know with what labors, worn out by old age, I have strived, as much as was in me, by the grace of the Lord, so that the ship would not be completely endangered. Now, therefore, with all forces applied, insist that he be sent to us, whom the Lord has undoubtedly destined and chosen for his homeland. In this, you will do a deed most pleasing to God and the Bernese and will acquire immortal glory for yourself, as one who has both managed and sought the care of Helvetia, our homeland, with the most ardent spirit.</p>

      <p>How falsely and against the given oath those two enemies of the cross of Christ and transferring the grace of the Lord to lasciviousness have taught in recent days, I will inform you in detail in the next letter. Now it is not possible to be longer, partly because of the excessive joy received from Mr. Haller's call, partly because the hour has compelled and led me away to the imminent public sermon to be made through the reading of the sacred scriptures.</p>

      <p>Farewell with your entire family and all the brothers, whom I wish you to bid farewell in my name. Given in Bern, October 9, 1547. I. K., always yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor at the provostry of Zurich, his fellow brother and always to be honored colleague.</p>
