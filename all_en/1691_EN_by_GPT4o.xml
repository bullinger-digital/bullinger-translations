      <p>Greetings. It seems like an age, my dear Bullinger, since I have received any letters from you. For after my letter dated May 8th to you, I have received none from you. The messenger returning here at that time affirmed that you were not at home, but at the baths. However, no matter how much you delay, I would still perform my duty in my usual manner, if either faithful messengers or subjects worthy of writing to you had come to me. Everything is brought here late, and I do not wish to be a nuisance to you, though I would be, if I were to persist in reiterating to you things you have already heard from me. Now, having obtained a messenger of utmost trust, my dearest son and fellow minister Funck, I did not want to let him come to you entirely without my letters, although he will explain to you in person and also present some things worth reading, which would be worthwhile to know, even if we assume you have already received them from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Germany will see (I greatly fear) bloody slaughter in its very bowels, with God justly angry at our execrable ingratitude and sins no longer to be borne. Meanwhile, let us implore Christ, the best shepherd, with unceasing sighs amidst all evils, that he may guide and comfort his little flock with his rod and staff, so that their faith may not fail.</p>
      <p>Prince Otto Heinrich of the Palatinate recently invited me very graciously by his letters to the ministry of the churches in his domain, which the people of Memmingen also did through their consul, as well as another notable city of the Holy Roman Empire. However, there are many reasons why I neither wanted nor ought to comply, which our Musculus, also called by the same prince, could not do, so that now both of us are accused by some of refusing to serve the churches out of fear of danger. But those who reproach us with this love dangers and are plainly worthy to perish in them. As for me, I am prepared, strengthened by the spirit of the Lord, to pour out this little soul for the glory of Christ when the occasion demands, but I do not wish to bring any danger upon myself voluntarily, but to preserve myself intact for a while, until I understand that the Lord has determined something else for me. The rest Funck will tell you, whom I wish to commend to you as another self as accurately as I can.</p>
      <p>All my people commend themselves to you and your household, as well as Treasurer Fuchs, Wittenbach, Dr. Jacob, the most pious and best old man. May each of your fellow ministers greet you very reverently and intercede with the Lord for me with their holy prayers.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my soul.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>I ask you, my dear Bullinger, to send me those articles, which some say I left there after I departed from Winterthur and which are affirmed to have been sent to you, now through our Funck; for I am very eager to read them. If you love me, do not deny me this, whatever it is; I will return everything to you in good faith. It truly grieves me that the minds of some are alienated from me through no fault of my own.</p>
      <p>To the man of most illustrious virtue and learning, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and most dear friend and brother.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
