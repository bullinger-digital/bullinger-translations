    <p xml:id="regest1">Requests to confidentially inform Felix Zimmermann of the following: [In St. Gallen], at the city clerk's office [Augustin Fechter], he co-sealed the document for a surety by Jakob Rainsperg and Martin Murer for Konrad Kapfmann, whom Felix Zimmermann is taking on as a partner, and noted that the document does not specify the amount of money being transferred and that the guarantors are only liable for part of the risk; he wants to bring this to Zimmermann's attention - even though he considers Kapfmann to be an honest man.</p>

      <p>Dear etc. In haste.</p>
      <p>My request is that you confidentially inform Felix Zimmermann, to do him a favor and speak with him privately, as I have written to you, namely, as he should be aware of the situation with Konrad Kapfmann from St. Gallen, whom he is taking on as a partner, and so forth. In summary: Jakob Rainsperg and Martin Murer, citizens here, two good friends, came to me today and informed me that they want to have a surety and a document from Konrad Kapfmann, which they would gladly do against Felix, and they had the city clerk make a document, asking me to seal it, which I did, etc. So I heard the letter, I cannot know how they agreed on the surety or how the letter should stand, whether it stands so that Felix is satisfied or not, I also told them and the clerk that I do not know the agreement, if Felix accepts the letter, it is up to him, etc. What I have done, I have done to serve them and Felix, etc. However, it is said quietly, there is a lack in the letter (if Felix does not approve), that it does not state how much money he is to give, no sum, also that they are only liable for part, if Konrad Kapfmann now withdraws something from Felix from the half of the sum and not from the full sum, etc. I do not trust Kapfmann; yet things are strange and often need to be handled carefully, etc. In this, Felix may consider and not mention me; for I would not have done it willingly. I ask you not to withhold this from him, so that he does not suspect that through my seal, which I did for everyone's sake, he was misled. When he gives Kapfmann an answer, receives the document, I hope they will agree. For I truly believe Kapfmann to be an honest fellow.</p>
      <p>Done in St. Gallen, in haste, Tuesday after Easter day in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
