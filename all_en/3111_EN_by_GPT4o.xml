      <p>In these days, most illustrious Bullinger, I have translated Athenagoras' oration for the Christians, addressed to the Roman Emperors Antoninus and his son Commodus, from Greek into Latin: since it seemed to me to be very pious, learned, and quite clever: for these reasons, and for the sake of antiquity, so that the sincere and simple profession of faith of the ancient Church might be confirmed by this testimony, I judged it not unworthy to be presented for your humane consideration. For I ought long ago, on account of your perpetual benevolence towards me, and the many great benefits, to offer you some token of a grateful and mindful spirit: although your generosity does not require it. But there was hardly anything in my many laborious studies so far, which I could judge either suitable for your profession or worthy to be read by you. For I have written most of them in such a way that they are more suited for inquiry into something, rather than for the continuous reading of them. Now at last, having interpreted this little book, I rejoice that an opportunity has arisen by which, in some part, I might not say satisfy the obligations of the name by which I am bound to you, but acknowledge the debt.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it was fitting that the most learned theologian philosophers should offer and dedicate to the philosopher emperors a reasoned account of our religion, and to you also, theologian philosopher, that is, the best and wisest man, I say to you, to whom I owe greater things, indeed myself. You, in your kindness, which I have always found most accommodating, will weigh my spirit more than the small gift: you will consider the subject of the little gift rather than its magnitude: and you will think that if it had been allowed by my talent and leisure, I would have adorned it more elegantly and worthily of you: you will take it in good part. If not everything in it, I do not doubt that many things will be pleasing to you.</p>
      <p>Since your prudence is such that you will not immediately criticize that a serious Christian philosopher brings forth the testimonies of the Gentiles, philosophers, historians, and poets everywhere: that he uses arguments derived from human reason to bring forth the nature of the Divine and its unity. These times demanded it: Emperor Antoninus, before whom he pleaded, was a supreme philosopher: as is apparent from those twelve books which are even now written in Greek by him, απθδ με εχταντ, λθψθλεντερ αππαρετ. Ψθμ ηοψ ιγιτθρ πηιλοσοπηαμδθμ σιβι αρβιτρατθσ εστ. σεδ ηοψ but he does this sparingly: he adds a conclusion, that such human reasons are not entirely true, nor worthy of everyone's assent: such as the oracles of the prophets, on which we Christians rely. But why do I tell you these things? Owls to Athens. Therefore, read, when you have time, I beseech you, Bullinger: if you do not approve of anything said by the author, or if you think something has been less correctly translated by me, please advise: so that either now, or at some time, it may be allowed to correct those things about which you have advised, or to insert them into our annotations, for public utility. For I wish you to be not only the patron and defender of both Athenagoras and Gesner the interpreter, but also the arbiter and judge.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, on the Nones of February, in the year of Salvation 1557.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, Conrad Gesner sends greetings.</p>
