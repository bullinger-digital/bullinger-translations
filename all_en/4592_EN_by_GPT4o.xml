      <p>Greetings. From your letter written on the 22nd of this month, I have learned of your poor health, which I believe is caused by excessive wakefulness, labor, the intemperance of the air, and excessive humidity. You ought to be more concerned about it.</p>
      <p>Would that my efforts could contribute something to its preservation! But I hope the Lord will restore you to strength for yourself and your people. Great hope has been conceived regarding our king, and that the King of Navarre will not fail them, and that all will be more peaceful in France. Perhaps also the plans of some, who were plotting much, will remain disrupted.</p>
      <p>We will hear more certain news shortly.</p>
      <p>My son responds to yours.</p>
      <p>Eight days ago, his mother asked him if he would like to be the King of France; he replied that he would much rather be Bullinger; he is very fond of you. If I can travel to France at the beginning of spring, I will send him back to you; I would wish that Mr. Walter would be willing to take care of him. I will ensure that the letters you sent are safely delivered to Orléans, and I wish I could demonstrate my greater regard for you in a more significant matter. The Bishop of Rennes wrote to me that there is great hope for a council soon to be held and that bishops will be convened within a few days. That foolish astrologer Nostradamus, among his countless lies, may perhaps speak the truth by asserting that there will be no council in the coming year, but only empty words. My wife sends her greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends and love us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, December 26.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
