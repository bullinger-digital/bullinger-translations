    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not received any letters from Zurich from the Frankfurt Fair, at least a greeting would please him; he is happy to be instructed by Bullinger's pious and learned books - he owns almost all of them - as can be seen from the letter that Matth채us Aurogallus had forwarded. After the death of the wealthy Breslau Bishop Jakob von Salza, Joachim von M체nsterberg, descended from the family of King George [Podiebrad] of Bohemia, was supposed to become his successor, but he renounced for reasons of faith; [Balthasar von] Promnitz was elected. Greetings, especially from the brothers in Bohemia.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocent life from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>During the recent Frankfurt Fair, dearest Bullinger, I received no letters from Zurich. I am completely unaware of the reason; but you have a just reason for excusing yourself, for your published books, which are for the use of all the pious, sufficiently testify to the many labors you are burdened with in promoting truly Christian studies.</p>
      <p>For I do not ask for lengthy letters from you, but only a single greeting, with which I can also cheer up the brothers who sincerely wish well and favor your church. For you speak with me in your most Christian commentaries in a most familiar brotherly affection, piously, learnedly; in these you clearly teach and instruct me.</p>
      <p>From my letters, which I have often sent to Zurich, especially those which recently Mr. Matth채us Aurogallus sent to Frankfurt through the Wittenberg booksellers, you will understand that almost all your books are with me.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Breslau, Jakob von Salza, died in the past month of September in his city of Neisse, leaving behind a vast amount of money; they say it was divided among the bishop's brothers. The illustrious prince Joachim von M체nsterberg is called to the bishopric; these princes trace their lineage from King George of the Bohemians. The diploma of the Roman pontiff and the consent of the king are present; the oath is offered. Upon inspecting and seeing it - for it was exactly as you expressed in your book On the Authority of Holy Scripture - this good prince plainly said farewell to the bishopric, although it had been promised to him by the king for many years. There are, however, four brothers, and the duchy is small, as they tend to be in Silesia. This prince loved piety more than the world. The bishopric was handed over to a nobleman named Promnitz.</p>
      <p>With these few words, farewell for a long life, most learned Bullinger. The brothers, especially from Bohemia, greet you.</p>
      <p>Given in Zittau, on the 25th day of the month of February in the year 1540. Oswald Pergener, etc., from the letters (City Clerk).</p>
      <p>To the man of pure religion, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant minister of the Christian church in Zurich, dearest brother and friend.</p>
