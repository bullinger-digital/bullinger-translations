      <p>Greetings. Your letter, reverend father in Christ, was delivered to me today, but in the evening. Our merchants were delayed by the storm and arrived late.</p>
      <p>You can hardly believe how gladly I learned from you that everything with you is safe and sound. Now I am filled with great hope; I will go to see if I can obtain the letters that were written to our people from the consul himself; I will send them if he gives them, on the condition that you return them. Often I recall what Denadis said, who claimed that the Athenians, because they engaged in war untimely (or not in time), never decided on peace unless they were in mourning; but I am pleased, and all good people should rightly be pleased, with your modesty. Otherwise, I confess, I have had dealings with many; but I have so much to do that I inform the strangers of all the business, who are present here in large numbers at this market. For many pious people have been persuaded that the matter is entirely correct and on a very good path, etc. What if this duty were given to our people, if it came to arms, that they themselves would repel foreign and adventitious soldiers? I have had many discussions about this with Hercules from Salices, who gave the greatest hope that if three thousand men were provided, he could easily impede thirty thousand men, as he knows the narrow passes and defiles. But this is nothing to us, as it must be left to the leaders of the troops.</p>
      <p>All our hope should remain fixed in one God, who will undoubtedly remember mercy in his anger; for no Christian can easily deny that we have deserved all this. The only way to escape evil will be sincere and timely repentance.</p>
      <p>The bishop's business itself would require many pages; nothing is more perplexing, nothing more intricate. That old man is the author of all evil.</p>
      <p>There are many good men among us who are greatly displeased with him, whom they almost worshipped before. Nothing is more wicked than that man, which you should not think I write with a more agitated mind. It would be an Iliad if I were to describe his virtues to you.</p>
      <p>No good person can be pleased with his deeds. The day before, he called our painter to the castle; there he wanted his insignia, which were painted in the bishop's chamber, to be erased and more august ones to be painted.</p>
      <p>But because the painter could not do it due to the cold, he nevertheless had a crowned, gilded helmet painted on paper. Where he got this, I do not know; but I know that he had this painted in this very act.</p>
      <p>Without a doubt, he is adorned with his virtues. He has been here for several weeks now; but after the first greeting, not a word with us, which is a sign to me that he is not so much averse to our company as to the truth. The two leagues (though it is known that the councilors have no command from their communities, therefore the country people are very unwilling) have so often and earnestly admonished ours by honor and oaths, also by the league letters, that they are finally compelled to withdraw their envoys, but with the condition that the foremost article, namely whether the bishop or his advocates should sit in the councils, etc., should be announced to all communities at the next league day, which will take place eight days before St. Paul's. They could not oppose this; for ours have admonished them as highly as they had previously admonished ours.</p>
      <p>This is unpleasant for the bishop; yet it will be announced and has already been intimated or delivered to the announcement. Regarding the other articles, which only concern the God's house, ours have given nothing away and have reserved their freedoms and rights in all respects. Our envoys have not yet returned home; they are awaited at any moment. Meanwhile, the bishop travels and gathers some God's house people at this market, writes to his confidants, holds a God's house day, brings a heavy complaint against the city of Chur, Fürstenau, and Bergell. The councilors sitting admonish ours again by honor, oath, and league letters to sit with them; ours briefly refuse. The others promise ours that they will not undertake anything against the city of Chur this time, admonishing them as before. Some of ours are sent to listen.</p>
      <p>There is the first thing, that the Fürstenauers and Bergellers are accused (the city of Chur is kept silent); ours stood up, protesting, and left. Some other envoys, whose communities stood with us and gave letters and seals, remained seated, but only to listen. The others also protested and proceeded with the day, absolving the bishop, reinstating him in his old glory; they have made no insight or improvement; they are related or allied to the bishop from afar.</p>
      <p>Also, the bishop has given them an account (which is a great sign that he is trembling), and thus they have always made judgments behind the host's back, so gross that even the peasants understood. This was done outside here.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the majority of communities have stood with us and have given letters and seals.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the bishop's account will not be much inquired about. The city of Chur has the God's house seal; they wanted to take it from them by force, but in vain; ours did not want to seal. Thus, today the God's house day is over, and the envoys return to the city with great anger; but it does not matter much to those envoys; they have no command from their communities. I will write the rest another time.</p>
      <p>No sedition is to be feared; every bean will be ground on the bishop's head. If he incites sedition, ours will close the gates and storm the castle.</p>
      <p>But, as I said, no sedition is to be feared, as everything is quiet, and if things come to a head, ours have decided to try the bishop and the God's house by law. If they had wanted to take the seal by force now, ours would have proposed the law to them. These things in passing.</p>
      <p>When ours return, we will know more for certain. The Jesuits are now indeed rejected, but at the next assembly, they will leave nothing untried. We are vigilant and do everything.</p>
      <p>May God bless our labors! Farewell, reverend father in Christ. But I will also add this about Beccaria, in the next assembly it was decreed that his case should be decided by the votes of the community; that they should not allow what the three places write; but what is more in the community should prevail, regardless of the five places. Otherwise, nothing could be done now.</p>
      <p>The mayor of Misox was with me; he reports that there are many hundreds of papists, not a hundred of theirs; yet he has good hope, they will not make the majority any less; but it is uncertain, etc. Chur, November 25, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Johannes Fabricius.</p>
