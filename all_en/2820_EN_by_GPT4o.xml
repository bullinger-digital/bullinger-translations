      <p>The people of Bern are withdrawing the citizenship rights from those of Geneva.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and godfather. The people of Geneva are sending their council envoys to you, my lord, for advice. Although they have conceded in many matters in the renewal of the alliance with Bern, the Bernese want to overpower them and not act like the old Confederates who made alliances, only so that each city, each village, etc., could remain in its freedom and peace.</p>
      <p>However, they are at odds in this. When they come into disagreement with each other, they have a right determined to appoint an arbiter. Bern wants to choose from Basel or Schwyz, Geneva from Basel alone, as it has been from old times, or if it must be from two places, from Zurich, as they share their religion. Bern does not want this. 2. Geneva has a freedom that whoever is indebted in their city, they can imprison them, and it is their freedom. Bern does not want their subjects to be imprisoned for debt. Geneva does not want to give up their freedom. 3. In 1540, there were many disputes between Bern and Geneva, Basel made a treaty as long as the citizenship rights lasted.</p>
      <p>Now Bern no longer wants the treaty. Geneva believes: since they are extending the citizenship rights, the treaty should also be extended. What kind of alliance or citizenship rights do they want to make, and start such a quarrel again? If they want to be citizens and friends, they should not renew such disputes, but let them be as they are. Bern does not want this. 4. Bern demands that Geneva make no alliances with anyone else and be bound only to them. Geneva believes: it is difficult for them, especially since Bern in 1539 gave them letters and promises in Geneva to help them so that they could come into the Confederation as friends, like Rottweil and Mulhouse. Bern does not want to hear or consider this.</p>
      <p>And they have also refused to renew the citizenship rights with them, yet they want to be good friends and neighbors to those of Geneva. Geneva has replied to them: they also want to be good neighbors; hoping, even if they have long been withdrawn from them, and the citizenship rights expire in 14 days, thus being left without human protection, God will still protect them, who has protected them until now, etc. They had otherwise taken up the matter a year ago with the extension of the citizenship rights with Bern, but Bern has always withdrawn from it until now in the end, and since they have many penalties, they let the good German people: if perhaps they would become submissive to the bear by surrendering their freedom, etc. Therefore, the honorable people ask you, my lord, to advise them: if there would not be a way to find: since Geneva is well situated for the common Confederation, and if they came into the hands of a foreign lord, it would be detrimental to the Confederation, but they would rather be with the Confederates than anywhere else, that a day be set and they be heard, and accepted as allies and you, my lords, help with this, or if you do not see it as good: if you would send to Bern with the help of Basel and Schaffhausen at their expense, and negotiate with them so that they would be satisfied with the decency, etc. as you will hear more specifically tomorrow, for they are coming for advice. And send this writing back to me with this boy, or that I have it back soon. It would be good to speak with some honorable people, for certainly much is at stake in this matter.</p>
