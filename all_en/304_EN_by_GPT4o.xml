      <p>S. I gladly read about England, which that learned man wrote to you.</p>
      <p>There are those who write that it is being torn apart by foreign wars and internal dissensions, not only by the Pope's means but also by the Emperor's. May the Lord therefore grant that nation a desire for concord, so that they may understand the great evils they are involved in by neglecting it.</p>
      <p>Our Constance, thrice miserable today, swears allegiance to Ferdinand, with two cohorts of soldiers admitted and all power handed over to those who are sent by Ferdinand to occupy that old city. The general opinion of the most wretched populace there is that they would rather have their city incorporated into the House of Austria than be vexed by so many inconveniences in the name of the empire. If they have accepted the Interim, as the Emperor has urged them to; now they can no longer remain with the Interim, they will become servants of all things and altar servers. This must now be allowed to happen, as they wish it so. Thomas Blaurer has slipped away to I know not where. They say the same of Zwick and Ludwig Hyruss; for Hieronymus is still in the city and among the principal ones is Christopher Schultheiss; but they say only the scribe has turned. Thus we see that discord brings about even more bitter Babylonian confusions. I send you the letters from England with a copy of the German Pasquinade, and I have nothing else to send along. When anything is brought, I will make sure you have it.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you wrote about Philip, I am very surprised. However, I would wish that he might hide somewhere in Switzerland, which I certainly would not consider unfortunate with such a guest. For Germany today does not have another man of whom I could promise myself greater and firmer things against the satanic wickedness of tyrants than I am accustomed to do of Philip alone, nor would it be necessary for everything to be published immediately; many things must be suppressed and reserved for their own time, nor will the face of affairs remain as miserable as we see it today. The churches of Christ have often suffered similar and, if I am not mistaken, even harsher things, and indeed from princes bearing the Christian name, as you know.</p>
      <p>Our Jacob Br√ºllisauer departed from this life on the 7th of October, at the eleventh hour of this day, remarkably constant to the very last breath and with such faith in Christ that it was a miracle to me how his mind could have been so suddenly converted by the Lord's gift, who was suspected by many good men for the mere name of despised religion. For three whole days before he passed, he spoke so piously and abundantly about our death, the life of Christ, and leaving the world, that it was a wonder to all.</p>
      <p>He was vexed for about eight nights by a certain specter or rather an angel, whether good or bad the Lord knows, who often after, and even before midnight, approached his bed, first with a noise, turning over papers found by chance and opening books placed here and there, then closing them, then moving stools to Jacob's bed, then lifting things nearby and dragging them here and there with a great noise, finally even throwing some things towards the approaching day, but more rarely. He was earnestly entreated once and again by Jacob to leave and cease to trouble him and his pregnant wife, but in vain. But when he explained the whole matter to me in the presence of his wife, it seemed that a separate bed should be made for Jacob himself in the lower room, with watchmen who would pray together and be at hand for the sick man, who was daily getting worse. When this was done, everything was better and more peaceful, and his wife with their two children was completely freed from that inconvenience. Jacob himself interpreted it so obstinately as a message of his death that he said openly, for the sake of redeeming one conscience, he would submit to the doctors, even if he were certain that his life would not be longer. This much about our Jacob. Farewell and greet the Lord Musculus in my name.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 15th of October, in the year 1548. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most distinguished city of Zurich, his esteemed lord.</p>
