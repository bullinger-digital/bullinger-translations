      <p>Greetings. When our Hotomannus was setting out to visit you, my father, I could not, nor indeed should I have, let him go without sending my letters to you. Therefore, receive the reason for our long silence. Indeed, there were too many things occurring daily about which I could write, but I thought it best to wait for some resolution of these disturbances, so that I might write everything to you at once. While I was waiting for this, much time passed. Behold, while I was entirely focused on this, Mr. Calvin, who was present at all events, and whom even the adversaries, as they are the most imprudent of all men, are not ashamed to accuse as the author of these evils, has freed us from this labor. From his letters, therefore, you will learn everything abundantly: you will learn, I say, the singular care and solicitude of our God in preserving His miserable exiles, so that it is plainly true what David wrote, having often experienced the same in himself, that the keeper of Israel not only does not sleep but does not even slumber. As things stand now, an incredible tranquility has followed these disturbances, and there has never been greater agreement among all there. But I fear that they will find more patrons of their wickedness than I dare promise myself this peace for a long time: nor do I see any refuge left for us except in prayers alone, which, however, will be enough to defeat all adversaries, provided the Lord grants us that we may pray rightly.</p>
      <p>As for the other controversy, which followed these controversies, we have freed our souls, expressed our opinion, complained about the indignity, and predicted what evils might threaten. No one has yet believed us. It remains for us to prepare ourselves to endure what the Lord will impose on us.</p>
      <p>What will happen, He alone knows, but we cannot help but expect the worst in such great human insensitivity.</p>
      <p>This is what I had to write now, my father. We hear nothing negative about your scholars, by the grace of God, and we hope they will fulfill their duty. We indeed have resolved not to fail them. As for what you wrote to me about the New Testament translation, it is as you had heard. For I began long ago to compare the old interpretation with others, and now the work has begun to be printed. For all these things which are either changed by us (which are few) or retained from the old interpretation, since they were changed by Erasmus, we give an account in the annotations which are printed at the same time. Would that this labor of ours might be as useful to the church of Christ as it was undertaken by me promptly and eagerly at the advice and almost command and order of friends, who thought that I could accomplish something in this field. Farewell, my very good father. May the Lord Jesus strengthen you more and more each day and keep you safe for His church. Lausanne, July 21.</p>
      <p>Th. Beza, truly yours.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of God and my especially esteemed father, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church. In Zürich.</p>
