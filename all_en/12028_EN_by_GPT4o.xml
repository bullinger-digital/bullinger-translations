      <p>Learned, honorable, especially gracious, dear sir and good friend, we send you our friendly greetings, willing service, along with whatever kindness and goodness we can offer, beforehand.</p>
      <p>Gracious, dear sir. The son of our late citizen Alban Hoppler has appeared before us with his guardian Rudolf Kuster, informing us, as we are well aware of the good boy's poverty, and he has now attended school for some time, hoping to advance somewhat in learning, yet, as mentioned, he cannot pursue it due to his poverty.</p>
      <p>Therefore, his very friendly request would be for us to share with you a favorable recommendation, in the good hope that you will assist him, so that he, as has happened with other sons of our citizens, may be admitted to the alms. And since we are inclined to support him, we extend to you our friendly request to assist the good boy in such a way that he will be helped in some manner. We would be grateful for your friendly service in this matter.</p>
      <p>Written in haste, on the 11th of September, in the year 1544. The mayor and council of Winterthur.</p>
      <p>To the learned, honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, our gracious, dear sir.</p>
