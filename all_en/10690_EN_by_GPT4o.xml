    <p xml:id="regest1">Is concerned about the outbreak of the plague in Bullinger's house and recommends a preventive measure. Capito has apparently unsuccessfully sought the release of Grynaeus to Tübingen in Basel; several details of the incomplete report that Capito has provided about Gereon [Sailer's] negotiations with Luther make Myconius fear adverse consequences of the concord efforts for the evangelical Swiss cities. Disapproves of Zurich's anxious policy towards the Five Places. Erasmus has moved to Basel; Bullinger has not yet commented on the edition of his letters [left to him by Myconius]. Has unsuccessfully tried to obtain [Bullinger's commentary on four Pauline letters] through Froschauer or [Georg] Binder.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You have instilled horror and fear for you in my heart by writing that the plague has invaded your house, but faith in all things gives thanks to God, allowing Him to act with us according to His good will. Nevertheless, we will pray to the Lord to keep you safe and sound for us and His people for as long as possible. For He knows how untimely it would be for us to lose you. I add that last year Gallus confirmed to us that keeping a piece of nutmeg in the mouth when the air is pestilential, and eventually swallowing it, is an ultimate remedy against the poison of the air.</p>
      <p>Regarding Capito, I do not know what he has done with the senate, but if it concerns Grynaeus, I believe he acted in vain, as he requested to be sent back to Tübingen. Among the brothers, he expressed the same thing as there, with many words, but without a head, so to speak, and without a tail. For he did not say what Luther had proposed by the Augustinians and to what end. He instructed us to be of good cheer about the hope of concord, although he mixed two things into his speech that left me utterly astonished: first, that he said Luther promised to send a learned man to Augsburg, whose doctrine they would support and rejoice in. Secondly, when he asked about Bullinger's age and, upon learning it, added: "I wish he would write to me," Gerion replied: "Bullinger is not yet entirely ours." Then Luther said: "It does not matter, as long as we agree on the main point." I say this not to make you think against concord with me, but to equally cast doubt, so that it may suspend you with me. I could add a third point, which seems to completely reveal the mind of Capito and Bucer. For while we were sitting and talking about truth, the solid foundation of concord, without which whatever labor is expended would be in vain, indeed the danger would be far graver than it is now, Capito replied: "Das müssen wir nicht begehren" etc. Who, I ask by the Lord, would not understand from this what kind of concord they are planning? Let one consider the other a Christian brother, let no one attack anyone either in preaching or in writing, but meanwhile, let them teach and act concerning the sacrament of the supper as they have done so far. What kind of concord will this be among the people, among the adversaries, for whom it is more prepared? Here I can do nothing but confess that snares and war are being prepared for us, that is, for the evangelical cities through Switzerland. Threats are flying, unless there is agreement in concord, something like this will happen. I could write a book to you about this matter. Now I do not have time to deal with this business with you in more detail.</p>
      <p>Your people are also acting in a way that greatly displeases good men, but fear has besieged their hearts, so they cannot act otherwise. It has not yet been forgotten that someone from among you once said that the Tigurines have already failed five times against the Pagans, and henceforth they will be cautious forever. Let them be cautious, I allow, but let them be more cautious not to be struck by famine at any time. I see that it is not so much doctrine as prayers and the holy life of the guardians of the word that must be relied upon. Therefore, you will exhort your people to keep these things as faithfully as possible.</p>
      <p>To conclude: Erasmus has moved all his belongings to Basel, and has put his house in Freiburg up for sale. I do not know what more. You have not yet indicated about the letters I sent.</p>
      <p>Froschauer has given nothing. He ordered me to write to Michael. I entrusted the matter to Binder with words, but so far in vain. Make sure that I have not warned you in vain.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours. May God protect you and all your companions from the poison of the plague.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 28, 1535.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Tigurines, his brother in the Lord to be respected.</p>
