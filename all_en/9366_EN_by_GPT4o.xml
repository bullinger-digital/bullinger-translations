      <p> Greetings. I received your letter dated June 18, dear brother, but from it, I could not understand whether mine reached you, which causes me no small anxiety. I wrote a letter to you immediately after the Baden assembly at the time when the public courier was sent, who was to request the public assembly of your people on July 5 with the delivered letters. I gave this letter to the treasurer Thomann, who told me he had taken care of it with the utmost fidelity. In it, I revealed everything to you that was discussed about your case at the assembly, and that this delegation was designated for your, indeed all of our common good, and for what purpose. I added some noteworthy points about the foreign practices against you, etc. I urged you, along with your colleagues, to encourage your people not to dismiss such a significant delegation with contempt; the risk in this is not small. I still urge you to do this, whether you have received my lengthy letters in the meantime or not, and whether they have been delivered or lost. Eight days ago, I sent another letter, which was entrusted to a certain person from Maienfeld, who promised to take care of it in good faith so that it would reach you as soon as possible. In it, I indicated what I had accomplished with Froschauer regarding the matter of Scipio Lentulus's book. Now I write this again, unsure if I can take care of it properly. Since you do not indicate anyone to whom I can deliver it, and our Lucius, who always took care of everything beautifully, has long since departed, I am hesitant and will write less frequently in the future. Now I send news that I received from a certain friend; whether all and each are entirely accurate, I cannot affirm; truth is the daughter of time. </p>
      <p> As it was told to me, so I share it with you and Mr. Campello and other good friends; believing you, as much as you are dear to me. I did not want to be called a gossip; therefore, use this information wisely. I deeply grieve for both your and your beloved wife's situation; may the Lord restore her and console you! </p>
      <p> Farewell. </p>
      <p> I wrote this in great haste on June 26, 1573, the day the Helvetic assembly is held here for the sake of the 7 Cantons' currency. Greet Mr. Consul and our friends, whom you know, all of them, etc. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. </p>
