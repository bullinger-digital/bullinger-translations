    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Even though Altieri and the addressees have not written to each other for a long time, the indestructible bond between them in the spirit of Christ has not weakened. And since Altieri has always greatly appreciated the people of Zurich for their teachings and piety, he now wishes not to let the pious and learned traveler [...], who had to suffer much in Rome for the sake of the Gospel, go without a letter. The bearer desires nothing more than to get to know the people of Zurich. However, should they do something for him, it would be as if they were doing it for Altieri!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The people of Zurich should know that Altieri acts in Venice as a representative of the German princes and the [Schmalkaldic] League. Thanks to his efforts, the Gospel is thriving very well in Italy (apart from Venice, [where this is already the case]). Indeed, Altieri hopes for an even greater spread of the Gospel, especially since the Venetians, given the current situation, are quite inclined to support the German [Protestants]. Perhaps there will even be an alliance between Venice and the [Schmalkaldic League]! For the time being, however, [Bullinger and Gessner] should keep this secret.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The situation of Emperor [Charles V] is getting worse day by day. Hopefully, the [Protestant] princes will soon achieve victory! Altieri does not yet know the decision of the [Protestant] Confederates regarding the [Habsburg and papal neighboring territories]. However, he does not doubt that they will prove to be loyal allies. Should Altieri be able to assist in this, he is ready to do so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings. News about Italy can be obtained from the letter bearer.</p>

      <p>Most excellent and revered in the Lord. Although we have not written to each other for a long time, that heavenly bond, which we have mutually contracted through the spirit of Christ, has not been diminished in any way; since it is eternal, it cannot be erased by oblivion or the passage of time. I have always esteemed you highly for your singular doctrine, great piety, and your inclination towards charity for all, and I could not allow our brother, who is to travel there, to go without my letters, and not to commend him to you again and again. He is indeed a pious man and has suffered much for the name of Christ, especially in Rome, and he is endowed with learning and a good nature. If you do anything for him, I will consider it as done to myself, even though he asks nothing more from you than to know and embrace you.</p>

      <p>It remains for you to know that I am here acting as a representative of the German princes and the other confederates. This has resulted in the Gospel of Jesus Christ taking deeper root not only here but also in the rest of Italy. And I hope it will grow daily. For the Venetians are not slightly affected by this matter, so much so that they are very inclined to assist the affairs of the Germans. And perhaps, if God wills, they will also enter into an alliance with them. These matters, I beg you, since they are of great importance, require silence, so that they are kept among you; I have written this more willingly because I knew for certain that this matter would be most pleasing to you.</p>

      <p>The affairs of the Emperor in Germany are getting worse every day. And we hope that soon our princes will achieve victory against him. However, we still do not know what you have decided. But we do not fear, since this cause is suspect because of the Gospel and the defense of public liberty, and for this reason, it seems to be common to you with Germany, that you will support, cherish, and preserve it in whatever way you can, as allies of an eternal covenant. If I can do anything here for your benefit, I ask you again and again, that you may use and enjoy my services as familiarly as if they were your own. For you know how much I love and uniquely observe you.</p>

      <p>Farewell in the Lord, in whom, as you have long done, love me mutually. You can learn the rest of what is with us from this man. Given in Venice, on the Ides of November 1546. Your most observant Balthasar Altieri.</p>
