      <p>Greetings. I had promised to write upon the arrival of our Froschauer. He has arrived and brought letters from friends; I have therefore summarized what is more extensively spread in them, had it copied for you, and am sending it. Please convey my greetings to the king's envoy and to Charles, but especially to the consuls and Pontisella, as well as to Ganthner. I have received your letters, and I advise you not to be anxious about them.</p>
      <p>I have seen what you wrote about the controversial matters of the Rhaetians with the bishop, and I have reported it to Mr. Chaam. Due to the disturbances of the grape harvest, I am being brief.</p>
      <p>I have greeted my relative Aernius, who continues to follow you with his usual affection and sends you his regards. Farewell. October 3, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, most faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To Chur, to Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin.</p>
