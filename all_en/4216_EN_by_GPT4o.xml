      <p>The state of affairs in Trier is most afflicted, about which I think I recently wrote to you, and I would send the complete history; but it is not at hand now, I will send it when I have received it. The Scots have defeated the Guise under the leadership of the Earl of Arran; the elder brother of Guise is contemplating revenge for the defeat. May he also be confounded by the hand of the Lord.</p>
      <p>The Confederates are said to be bound by certain laws with the English and Scots; but we will write more certainly about this when we have more certain information. The persecution in Paris is raging beyond measure; a certain chief among the judges was recently killed by a cannonball, and the author of the murder escaped, which causes the cardinals and similar tyrants to fear beyond measure, and no one comes to the court unless surrounded by a band of armed men. In Provence and Aquitaine, such cruelty is not exercised.</p>
      <p>The young king is more miserable than miserable, as he is afflicted with very poor health and is governed by the madness of insane people. The people of Nuremberg are severely harassed by Grumbach, and peace seems unable to be bought except with a large sum of money, as he has powerful allies. Otherwise, there is deep silence regarding the affairs of Germany.</p>
      <p>Calvin is reported to be gravely ill, whom we commend to the church as a notable instrument of Christ. Farewell well with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 17, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Simon Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
