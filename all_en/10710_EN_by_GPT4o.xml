Urges more attention to be given to the training of preachers. Greetings. It is now up to [the Zurich and Swiss theologians] to strive for a preparatory meeting, as they could otherwise be excluded.</p>

      <p>Greetings. When I returned home from Basel the day before, a letter from Luther was delivered not long after, of which I am sending a copy. We replied with our own messenger, asking him to set the date and place for the convention, although it does not seem convenient for us before spring. We also responded that your people similarly aim for concord and are not very averse to the convention. Therefore, my dear Bullinger, make sure we do not miss this opportunity. We know how weak everything is here as well as with you, even if we seem to excel in some respects. God is the author of peace. Furthermore, the authority of the ministers has collapsed, and there is a certain way to restore it, which will be discussed at that convention.</p>
      <p>But studies are also declining; how little is nurtured among you compared to the weight of affairs. How will you fill the vacant places when the plague ravages the villages and takes away some of them? Even if you had sixty, it would not be a sufficient number. So rare is the one who dedicates himself to the ecclesiastical function. The world appeals to the younger generation. Therefore, I beg you, my dear Bullinger, to show yourself as a salutary and peaceful bishop, and to inspire the spirit of peace, which has grown too cold among many. Everything is divided and dissected, while there is one Christ, the anchor of hope, to be preached by all.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to the brothers, and commend us to the pious lords of the senate.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, November 9.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Capito.</p>
      <p>It is necessary for us to meet as well, in which your care is needed. We have so often lost expense and time for the sake of common salvation; do not be reluctant to endure some rightful inconvenience for the restoration of the churches. Write back, I beg you, and indeed quickly; for we must also be prepared, unless you wish to be considered alien to the fellowship of other churches, which I know you do not wish.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zurich, to be respected as a brother in the Lord.</p>
