      <p>God be with you. Your letter along with Mr. Martinengi's has reached me, thank you all. Now I have what I desired; praise be to God.</p>
      <p>As soon as I can, I will sit down and make an extract; for it seems to me that it will be useful.</p>
      <p>From Basel, Nuremberg, and Strasbourg it is written that a secret alliance has been made in Italy and that Philip has made an agreement with the Moors, that he is ready for this. The Pope has deceived them; he will send the decrees of the council to all estates and announce: those who do not accept them will be deprived of all freedoms and everyone is allowed. King Philip is supposed to want to carry out the execution.</p>
      <p>I write all this to you as I have seen it in letters; but whether it has any basis, I do not say, nor do I know. Accordingly, it is written that a meeting of the princes and estates is now in Worms concerning the council, and how to behave, also concerning Grumbach, who has been outlawed by the emperor and has taken refuge with the young princes in Saxony, where there is supposed to be great armament. Hesse, Palatinate, Württemberg, etc. are all supposed to be in great armament.</p>
      <p>Thus it is written; I do not know further details to give, whether it is true or not. It is otherwise certain that the meeting in Worms is taking place.</p>
      <p>Bèze writes to me on March 6th that Calvin is very ill, that the Cardinal of Lorraine has insisted vehemently on introducing the council; however, his first attempt has failed; yet there is no cessation.</p>
      <p>The Pope has peremptorily summoned the Queen of Navarre to Rome; the Spaniard is worried about her. She has sent her own messenger to Geneva, announces this and requests the church's intercession; before she yields, she would rather lose her life and land, continues and reforms. It is thought that the king will come this March to Lyon.</p>
      <p>From Nuremberg, it is written to me by an honorable man that Bernardino is hiding there, writing against us, wanting to go to Poland; for he is not tolerated in Nuremberg.</p>
      <p>Many strange practices are being conducted. Praying to God and urging to pray to God for grace and help.</p>
      <p>Our lords, the mayors, have written to you that nothing has been made with Philip.</p>
      <p>Greet them faithfully for me, and God be with you and all yours. Let us pray diligently to the Lord; the matter demands it. March 17, 1564.</p>
      <p>Watch, explore; make acquaintances where you can. In haste.</p>
      <p>Yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, esteemed and dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
