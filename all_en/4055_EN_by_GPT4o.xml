      <p>Greetings from the Lord.</p>
      <p>On August 20th, the good and venerable father Wimpfer passed away to the Lord, not without my great sorrow; for I loved and respected him as a father, and he reciprocated with no less affection. He left behind a pious and honorable widow, several children, and grandchildren, all deprived of any assistance. He lived content with a small stipend, having spent all the inheritance left to him by his parents in the service of the church, which I can say not without lament. It is certainly a deplorable situation that good and faithful men spend their own inheritances in ministry, while church goods are squandered by many others in unworthy ways. The poor widow now fears, because her husband passed away before autumn and the harvest, that she will also be deprived of the modest stipend that was set for the healthy Wimpfer. I wrote to Mr. Consul Habium, earnestly pleading that the widow, consumed by tears and lamentations, should not also be deprived of sustenance. Therefore, report to the senate, so that the steward may be informed of what he should do, who is certainly good towards us. I therefore ask you, venerable father, as much as possible, not to fail the widow in this matter, but to labor with your usual humanity towards all the pious, especially widows and orphans, and be entirely devoted to this, so that the wine, which was set for Mr. Wimpfer but was not given at all because the harvest time had not yet come while he was alive, may now be received by her, and if nothing further can be hoped for, at least with the wine, she may also receive what was set for each harvest in other matters.</p>
      <p>It brings in 10 guilders in cash, 3 malters of kernels, 1 malter 1 müt of oats, 1 fuder of wine for a whole year; to each harvest and yet now Steiner measure, which is very small; but it has never been given to him. Do your best in this matter, so that it may be hers.</p>
      <p>Approach Mr. Consul; you know with your prudence what needs to be done. Regarding my affairs, there is not much to say; I have entrusted the matter to the Lord, in whose mercy I hope. Perhaps another time will be given, so that I may discuss more with you; now, pressed by the constraints of time and other matters, I cannot say more.</p>
      <p>We wish your wife, our venerable lady and godmother, and your entire household, along with your brother, our father, and his wife, our dearest mother, to be well.</p>
      <p>May Mr. Gwalter and his household and the remaining brothers be well. Stein am Rhein, August 22, 1559.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours in humanity, Christian Hochholzer. To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord and godfather.</p>
