      <p>Greetings. I received the letters from you, dearest brother. To the previous ones, I respond briefly: Ganthner's insolence and ferocity seem to me to be broken by the help and work of the [sacred?] magistrate, as well as Marius, if he continues to be similar to himself.</p>
      <p>For such temperaments, unless they are restrained, will someday bring great harm to the church. I do not want you to be anxious or to incur any expenses for my bath; I love you, and your goodwill, with which you are affected towards me, has completely satisfied me. Continue, as you do, to love me, and things are well. The people of Schaffhausen are in disagreement with the 8 Old Cantons over the monastery called Parendys.</p>
      <p>While the people of Schaffhausen have possessed it until now, the 8 Cantons contend that it belongs to the dominion of the county of Frohburg or Thurgau. They have acted legally; now there is a dispute over the judge. The people of Basel, Fribourg, Solothurn, and Appenzell have intervened as mediators; but so far they have achieved nothing. The assemblies will be repeated at the All Saints' Day, etc. Camulius and those like him are unworthy to be borne by the earth, not to mention tolerated by the Rhaetians. To the crows with them! I send back, as you requested, the example of the papal privilege. In a Christian republic that does not wish to perish, such privileges are not tolerated, and if the privileged wish to live by their privileges, they are less to be tolerated. The Pope thus scatters gunpowder among you. May the Lord curse him! I also send back the articles of the treaty against the Turk and give you the greatest thanks I can. This confederation reminds me of that which is found in Jeremiah of Zedekiah and his allies, etc. The people of Geneva were not admitted to the Swiss Confederation at Baden, which they requested. What will happen next, I do not know. Geneva writes to me that Beza in France is certain that a most savage war will occur between the French and the Spanish. It is said that the French have drawn the English and Germans into an alliance. I cannot say for certain whether these things are true; if I receive anything more certain, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell forever along with all yours. All of ours greet you; greet for me the honorable consuls, Mr. Gregor, Campell, Pontisella, all friends in order, and Bonet. I do not quite understand your last letters, nor do I think it will ever happen that our republic will block the grain market for the Rhaetians. Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>July 27, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ Jesus, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
