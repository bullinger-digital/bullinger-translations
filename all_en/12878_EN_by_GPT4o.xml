    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger's letter [not received] brought Lavater great joy, as it shows that Bullinger is thinking about Lavater's [further studies]. Lavater has never doubted Bullinger's goodwill, but feared that he might be kept in Strasbourg longer than necessary (because people are too worried about him). He is by no means ungrateful to Bullinger, who is his benefactor. Nor did he want to hold him responsible for the [inconveniences mentioned in his last letter], as he knows well that these are due to the difficult times.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is important that Bullinger takes care of Lavater's further studies (while Lavater will strive to better organize his [choice of subjects]), especially since he does not doubt that his parents [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Anna, née Röichli] will agree with Bullinger's plan. Currently, he is simply unclear about what he should do: A move to Basel will hardly benefit his studies, but neither will staying in Strasbourg if Emperor Charles V takes control of the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It strengthens and pleases Lavater to see how many excellent citizens of Strasbourg would rather die than submit to godless servitude. The city is well-prepared for an attack by the Emperor, so he will hardly dare a siege. Jakob Sturm and Mathis Pfarrer have set off for negotiations in Ulm. What they have achieved is not yet known. When they return and it becomes clear how things will proceed with the city and the school, a decision can still be made about what to do. If the city approves a godless peace, Lavater will probably not be the only one who has to leave. Submission to the Emperor would be worse than a siege. For thanks to a peace with Strasbourg, the Emperor could better wage war against the Swiss and Francis I, and then, after his victory, rule over Strasbourg. The people of Strasbourg, who are not foolish, know this. Although there are several respected citizens who support the Emperor, the rest of the citizenry, enlightened by the fate of other [cities], will probably prefer to take up arms.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Lavater is pleased to hear that the people of Zurich do not succumb to the song of the sirens. Many have already been seduced by this and have, as Bullinger rightly writes, fallen at the feet of the servant of the Antichrist, the Emperor. Lavater would have sent their [homage] speeches if he did not assume that Bullinger has already seen them. If only the Confederation remains united! However, Lavater fears that the Five Places, which so stubbornly hold on to their faith (as Bullinger reports), will bring great suffering. They prefer the yoke of the Antichrist to the sweet yoke of Christ! But they could only recognize this through true repentance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In Strasbourg, there is a rumor that Constance also wants to surrender to the Emperor. Lavater still hopes that [the Confederation] will not abandon the city. The Emperor could devastate the land from there with a few horsemen. Even if this concerns [the politicians] more, Lavater is allowed to worry about his homeland!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Now to the matter of the Lord's Supper. Bullinger wants to know how the response of the people of Zurich [No. 2745] to the letter [HBBW XVIII, No. 2704] from Strasbourg [about the participation of Zurich students in the Lord's Supper] was received: Contrary to his promise, Bucer never delivered this response for reading. Bucer might even have destroyed the letter. For when Lavater recently spoke with Kaspar Hedio about the situation at home, he did not mention the matter. Bullinger is surprised that Matthias [Zell] (Lavater's host) did not sign the Strasbourg letter: Zell found it inappropriate to revive the dispute over the Lord's Supper with such a letter. Incidentally, the reputation he enjoys in Strasbourg prevents many of the clergy's plans. Lavater was astonished that Luther even condemned the [Zurichers] as heretics in his latest writing [“Contra 32 articulos Lovaniensium theologistarum”]. For him, the Lutherans are no longer credible. They [i.e., the Strasbourg Lutherans] did not deserve a response. However, Zell is grateful that Bullinger made the effort, while Lavater believes that Bucer deserved an even sharper response! Meanwhile, some Strasbourg pastors recognize Zwingli's pious care for his homeland. However, they refuse to change their [theological] view in the slightest.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] May the Lord protect Bullinger and the homeland! Greetings, also to Bullinger's wife, Anna, née Adlischwyler, and to the children, as well as to Lavater's parents. Zell also sends his regards.</p>

      <p>S. D. I took great pleasure from your letters, reverend father. For I felt that you have been concerned with my situation. Although I have never doubted your goodwill towards me, I have always feared that, out of excessive concern for me, you might think I should remain in Strasbourg longer than necessary. Therefore, I cannot but appreciate your efforts, unless I were to be very ungrateful. I will not blame you, my benefactor, for the matters I wrote about recently, but rather attribute all the blame to the difficulties of the times.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I ask that you continue to look after my studies in the future. I will henceforth, if given the opportunity, better organize my studies. I wanted nothing more in my previous letters than for you to be accommodating to me in the future, since you have somewhat taken on the care of my studies; and my parents, if you continue to be an advisor, will not disdain to promote me. However, I do not see what I should do in these times. I do not think it would be well advised for my studies if I were to move from Strasbourg to Basel, nor would it be beneficial for me to remain in Strasbourg if the Emperor were to take control.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It strengthens and refreshes me to see that the Republic of Strasbourg is adorned with many excellent citizens who would rather endure the worst than submit to impious servitude. Moreover, they are fortifying the city, and the Emperor (if they act bravely) will not easily be persuaded to besiege the city for many reasons. Whatever the case, Mr. Jakob Sturm and Mr. Mathis Pfarrer have set off for Ulm. I do not know what they intend to do. Once they return, they will inform us of what will happen to the citizens and the school. Then, in due time (I believe), I will be able to see what I should do. For I have no doubt that I would have many companions on the journey if they were to accept unjust terms of peace. However, surrender is more to be feared than a siege. And perhaps Charles will prescribe tolerable terms of peace so that he can more easily wage war against the Swiss and the French, and once they are defeated (which God forbid!), he could then exercise his tyranny over Strasbourg. However, I do not think they are so unjust or foolish that they cannot weigh all these things. Indeed, there are many among us, not ordinary people, who follow the Emperor's side; yet the remaining citizens, taught by the calamities of others, will be able to restrain them with arms.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I was greatly delighted to hear that you pass by the deadly songs of the Sirens with a deaf ear. For we see many seduced by these songs, as you truly write, throwing themselves as supplicants at the feet of the satellites of Antichrist, whose speeches I would send to you, if I did not think you had already seen them. If only Switzerland would strive for concord! But I greatly fear that those of the Five Places, whom you write hold onto their religion with a tenacious grip, will bring us great harm. For they do not want Christ to reign over them. They prefer to bear the yoke of Antichrist rather than that of our Savior. We recognize the state we are in, if only we would turn to God with true repentance.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There is a rumor among us that Constance will also come into the hands of the Emperor through surrender. I still hope that our people will not fail in this matter. For the Emperor could devastate the land with a few horsemen from Constance and afflict us, and take refuge in the city as a hiding place. But perhaps these matters should be left to others. Yet love for my homeland sometimes compels me to write more freely about what I hear from others and from very distinguished men.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Now regarding the letters about the matter of the Eucharist. You wish to be informed about what has happened with us after these letters. Briefly, Bucer, although he promised, when he wrote his own, that he would give me a response, is pretending. Perhaps he suppressed the letters. For in the meantime, Hedio spoke with me about the state of the homeland, and did not mention this matter in a word. You wonder why Matthias was not mentioned. The reason is this: He did not want to sign, nor did he think it appropriate to stir up that question and the odious dispute over the Eucharist with a new letter. The authority of my lord stands in the way of many of their efforts. I could not sufficiently marvel that Luther, even in his latest writing, so seriously considers us heretics. Let anyone who wishes be a Lutheran; all his authority ceases with me! A response was not necessary; for this time could have been better spent. But since you did not undertake this task reluctantly, it was very pleasing. And certainly Bucer would have been worthy of an even more vehement response! Some of the ministers are now finally beginning to recognize Zwingli's exceptional piety towards his homeland. Yet they do not yield a hair's breadth from their own opinion.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>May God deign to keep you and the homeland safe for a long time! Do not disdain to convey my greetings to your most honorable wife, your sweetest children, and your whole family, as well as to my parents. Mr. Matthias also sends his regards. In Strasbourg, the day before the calends of March in the year 1547. Yours sincerely, Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, his uniquely esteemed father. In Zurich.</p>
