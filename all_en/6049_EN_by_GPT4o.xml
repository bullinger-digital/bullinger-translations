      <p>S. You will understand what our senate writes to yours about the machinations of Cardinal Lorraine from what is sent. At this hour, when the messenger is about to leave, the consul now summons me and communicates certain things about these matters; he desires to divide the faithful among the French, in order to establish his impieties. May the Lord scatter and shatter his efforts!</p>
      <p>Regarding French affairs, the prefect of Lausanne writes that it is certain the king has not yet subscribed to the decision of Trent; Cardinal Lorraine has come to the court and indirectly requested that he do so; but when he saw it was received with indignation, he extricated himself with cautious evasion. In Lyon, it was almost the case that the parties would attack each other with arms, but this was preempted by the governor's diligence.</p>
      <p>It is reported about the king that he is still to undertake a journey to Lorraine and afterwards proceed through Burgundy to Lyon.</p>
      <p>Concerning the endeavors of the Swiss, strange and dire things are reported. It is confidently expected that the matter will break out on the day in Lucerne.</p>
      <p>It is known to my lords in secret that the plan is for the Fribourgers and Solothurners to work against my lords and hinder them, so that the Five Cantons can approach you and Glarus all the better, for which my lords have secretly instructed their war councils to make provisions for what may come, so that it may be seriously addressed. Therefore, be cautious, and also warn the good people of Glarus; for it is confidently expected that it will have to be so. The Fribourgers present themselves very arrogantly against my lords, having wanted a preacher's child, who died before baptism and was buried in a papal cemetery in a common lordship (since the preacher had his seat there), to be exhumed, which my lords took offense at and would not allow to happen without right.</p>
      <p>They are very unruly about this.</p>
      <p>Thus, the Lucerners also start a new affair with my lords, which had already been settled once before, and one does not know, and yet one knows, how to understand it.</p>
      <p>May God graciously help us and stand by us for the sake of His truth; for I have never felt so troubled as now.</p>
      <p>Steiger diligently greets you; the same do all friends and brothers. Excuse the haste; I will write more fully and diligently next time.</p>
      <p>May all yours be safe.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 25, 1564.</p>
      <p>Today our envoy also departs for Lucerne. Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and compatriot, to be honored with perpetual observance.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
