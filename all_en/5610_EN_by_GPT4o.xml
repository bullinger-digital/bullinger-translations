      <p>Greetings. Today I received your letter, dear brother, and I am writing this one immediately, in which I enclose letters from some of our dearest friends and brothers, Calvin and Beza.</p>
      <p>From these, you will understand that Beza is alive and well by the grace of God; you will understand what is certain today from France, although the rumor of a second conflict is not yet certain to me.</p>
      <p>In these days, a rumor has begun to spread that Brisach, one of the leaders of the Guise faction, has defeated the English in Normandy with the help of the Rhinegrave and that over 5000 have fallen. However, I prefer to wait for more certain information than to place faith in rumors with no reliable sources.</p>
      <p>See to it that the letters entrusted to you alone do not come into anyone's hands except your own, etc., and then return them quickly and safely; I cannot be without them for certain reasons for long.</p>
      <p>Further, I cannot write to you at this time; for there is so much writing to be done that I do not know where to begin.</p>
      <p>Quickly, I pray, return these of ours.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for me. February 8, 1563.</p>
      <p>I have not reread this.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer, residing in Winterthur, my most revered lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Winterthur.</p>
