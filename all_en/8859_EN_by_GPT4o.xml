      <p>Greetings. I have thought it necessary to inform your most esteemed reverence in the briefest terms, which points composed by judgment can be revealed to the communities and brought into action not without the greatest danger. Some, seeking to favor the Spanish more than the public good, wish that under oath no one should receive royal gifts or pensions henceforth, or be entirely deprived of their office or magistracy. Conversely, the treaties, that is, those trades which are conducted and managed through immunity from the Milanese dominion, are permitted. Immortal God, what change will this bring upon us? Shortly, the matter would come to such a point that, with the regional treaty violated, the Spanish plots would prevail, and their friendship, which can be amplified under the pretext of treaties, would undermine our most noble passage. This new danger must be countered, lest those favoring the Spanish cause disturbances and, by enticing the populace, prepare not freedom but a papal yoke and perpetual war for us. Thus, the most prudent will have to be removed from office, and the less wise will be substituted, not without the greatest dissension and offense of minds. However, we ministers are tasked with the labor of educating the common people. If we do not do this, they will be led astray; if we do, we will bear the suspicion of corruption. When will there finally be an end to these labors? I send the points so that they may return to me at some time. - If I can again obtain a copy of the bull written in my hand, I will also send it in both languages, the very one that the bishop also requested from me.</p>
      <p>You will see whether I have translated it faithfully or not. - Mr. MÃ¼ller brought letters, from which I understood that you desire to have the bull. I also think you have received mine through Mr. Signifer. - It is feared that the people of Engadin may arrive with their banners, whose fear may also bring that Baptist from Salices into danger of his life. The League of the Grey is also clamoring and will not rest until the family of the Salices has likewise suffered some disgrace. 14 from the House of God have been summoned to answer for their deeds and words, among whom two of our highest are numbered. It pains me greatly whenever I think about how the face of our republic is to be entirely changed. This will not happen without the greatest danger even to the pious. The people are so agitated that they could not be more so, because they fined the aforementioned Baptist with a monetary penalty of 2000 crowns. They want him punished not with money, but with body and life, if he has deserved so much. Hence, the house of the Salices will also exercise its hatred upon us. May the Lord Jesus be our protector and the defender of his most afflicted church. But these black little men must depart diametrically, as the miraculous variety of the sun splendidly attests. 1572, April 8.</p>
      <p>Your pains of the stone grieve me, which I also feel lightly at times.</p>
