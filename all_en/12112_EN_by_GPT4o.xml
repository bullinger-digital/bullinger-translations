    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer has forwarded the letter from the [Zurich] mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater] to [Thomas Blarer], but he knows nothing about possible negotiations, as he rarely sees his brother due to the political restructuring of the city [after the mayoral and council elections] and does not ask anyone else. However, he knows that [Konstanz] is truly interested in peace with everyone and that Emperor [Charles V] does not wish to give any reason for war, which is advisable in these times. - Blarer asks Bullinger and also [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater] to keep his information about these negotiations confidential, especially regarding [Konrad Zwick's military art]. He has revealed more to Bullinger in service of the cause than he admitted to the [impetuous] Zwick, and he did not relay everything Bullinger expressed to Zwick; hopefully, this will not be considered deceit. It would be detrimental to his relationship with Zwick and also disadvantageous for him if the Zurichers were to write to [Thomas Blarer] or the "Secret [Council Members]" about the matter. He trusts Bullinger and now wants to stay away from the matter. - [P.S.:] Bullinger should inform the [Zurich councilors] in due time. The matter is important. A pastor [...] has informed Blarer that a farmer [Jakob Knecht] will travel to [Zurich] and back and [could carry any letters]. - [Enclosure:] [Charles V] has not yet arrived [at the Imperial Diet] in Worms due to his gout. Much is being said about his plans, but nothing certain is known. - [Andreas] Osiander has responded to the "Speculum" [by Georg Frölich] with an apology in which he defames the Zwinglians. Blarer has not yet seen the work himself, but [Martin] Frecht has sent a copy to Vadian. - [Wolfgang] Musculus is working [reformatively] in Donauwörth; may he be successful! - [Paul III] has appointed the Bishop of Augsburg [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] and the Bishop of [Arras], [Antoine de Perrenot], son of [Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle, as cardinals; the Papists are breeding vipers and basilisks. - The Württemberg court preacher Kaspar Gräter writes that [Duke Ulrich of Württemberg] is upset about Luther's ["Short Confession"]. Blarer is convinced that the Zurich response ["True Confession"] will testify to Christian moderation and dignity, but together with [Thomas Blarer] and [Konrad] Zwick, he expressly asks Bullinger and Theodor [Bibliander] that neither [Martin] Bucer nor anyone else (except Luther and others who have publicly attacked [the Zurichers]) be mentioned. The Marburg [Colloquy] can also be addressed without mentioning Bucer. The latter must not be exposed to danger for significant reasons.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have diligently delivered the letters from your councilors to my brother. However, as you love me, Bullinger, I am completely unaware of whether or what has been further discussed regarding the matter; for at this time, when our entire republic is being renewed, I rarely meet my brother, and for significant reasons, I do not ask anyone else anything. Nevertheless, I clearly understand from our people that they earnestly desire solid peace with everyone and will not provide any reason for war, nor will they be persuaded to engage in war by any means. If I judge correctly, it would be far better in these times to pursue peace with everyone and to be extremely cautious not to provide any new occasion for the emperor to wage war against you or others, so that there may be a stronger hope for the Lord's assistance if he, perhaps without just cause, initiates war and continues to provoke the innocent. For it is all about having a clear conscience before God.</p>
      <p>Then, I also implore you through Christ Jesus to keep all that I have written to you so far about this entire matter, in mutual faith and love between us, eternally buried with you, and that your councilors and whoever is aware of these matters do not divulge anything about this to anyone, should they happen to encounter our people and discuss these or other matters with them, especially regarding what I have entrusted to you about my cousin and his invention. For I have sometimes written more to you than he has discovered, and often revealed less to him than you have given to me, and sometimes even altered your opinion with him, and done everything to delay the man who sometimes seemed determined to proceed. This would now be a fraud against me with him and an unbearable revocation of my trust. Therefore, you will ensure, out of your love for me, that I can be secure in this matter as it pertains to you and yours. It would serve as a great disadvantage to me with my cousin and otherwise, should your people perhaps write to my brother or the secret council members about this matter, which often happens easily. But I trust you completely, you will prevent and guard against all this and always be vigilant; therefore, I want to have asked you for God's and all love's sake, for I now want to withdraw from all matters and do not inquire at all what is further negotiated or written from yours to ours or from ours to yours.</p>
      <p>Given on January 15, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>Hasten, I implore, to inform your people of this admonition; for it is of utmost importance to me, and I am exceedingly anxious, not without cause.</p>
      <p>A certain minister of the word indicated that a certain farmer from a nearby village is about to travel to your city and will soon return, should I wish to write anything.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
      <p>In Worms, the emperor is still awaited; he suffers from gout, which has prevented him from being present there so far. They boast greatly of his greater efforts, about which, since I have nothing certain, I do not write to you.</p>
      <p>Osiander has responded to that "Speculum" you know of with an apology, in which they claim he made a very odious mention of the Zwinglians. May God finally deliver us from these internal evils! I have not yet seen the booklet, but our Frecht, who sends you his most dutiful greetings, writes that he has sent a copy to our Vadian.</p>
      <p>Musculus is planting a new church for Christ in Donauwörth on the Danube, which may be successful and fortunate.</p>
      <p>The Pope has sent cardinal hats to the Bishop of Augsburg and then also to the son of Granvelle, the Bishop of Arles, to retain them as the best sons in obedience to the Roman Church. The papists are all brooding, I do not know with what eggs, to soon hatch vipers and basilisks, if the Lord permits. Caspar Gräter, the court preacher of Württemberg, writes that his prince is very offended by Luther's booklet and vehemently detests this insane desire for slander and abuse. We do not doubt that your response will emerge with Christian modesty and gravity, where I implore and beseech you, as well as our venerable and dearest Theodor, by all that is sacred and by whatever can move you, not to make even the slightest mention of our Bucer in it; my brother and Zwick request this from you for very serious reasons, although we believe that you, in your prudence and sincerity, will temper everything so that, apart from Luther and others who have publicly attacked you, no one else is involved. If anything about the Marburg Concord is to be touched upon, it can also be done without mentioning Bucer's name. He must be placed entirely outside the risk of these others, and that for more than one reason, as I am sure you will also willingly acknowledge; and yet my anxious love for him and on his behalf has compelled me to remind you of this. It will be your task to ensure that we obtain this from you and our Theodor; we will not hesitate to provide you with anything in return, even if not so much requested.</p>
      <p>Greet your household and all the brothers.</p>
