    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for two letters. He has read the report sent by Bullinger to Johannes Zwick about the meeting in Basel; the people of Konstanz, who have always been concerned with the unity of the churches, accept the [First Helvetic Confession] adopted there despite papist overtones. It is not a big issue that Konstanz, contrary to Blarer's advice, did not send any pastors with [the council delegate] Joachim [Maler] who could have advised caution, as the new doctrines can only claim authority insofar as they are in accordance with scripture. However, unlike Paul, they speak of what the officeholders administer and offer in word and sacrament in a way that nourishes superstition. If statements that may barely be defensible as concessions in mediating conversations among scholars are elevated to new dogmas, there is a threat of a relapse into the Babylonian captivity of the church. Through the renewed introduction of human authorities, hierarchies, and ceremonies, Satan wants to reestablish the bondage of consciences; this can only be countered with simple and clear teaching. Willingness to understand is commendable, but the healthy side must not become infected. There is a danger that now more than ever, all those who question Luther's doctrine of the Lord's Supper will be excluded as "sacramentarians"; the criticism is directed against this, not against the mediators. Only turning to the Lord in prayer offers hope. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have understood your diligence in exploring the census from your two letters, for which I am immensely grateful. You, my dear Bullinger, please take it in good part that I have called you to these trivial matters. Command me in return, when the opportunity arises, so that I may be able to gratify you.</p>
      <p>My cousin Johannes Zwick has shown me your letters written to him about the recent meeting in Basel. You know, Bullinger, how much it has always meant to our people to unite brothers in a peaceful spirit; therefore, as it was troublesome to have this kind of disputing, provoking, and condemning, by which the Lutherans and the opposing party were set against each other, so now the return to grace among the surviving ones is considered both pleasant and beneficial. Therefore, we not only did not hinder the Basel congress, but we also hastened it, especially since it seemed to be an honor and ornament to the Swiss churches converted to Christ, indeed not so much to the Swiss as to those from whom the Swiss were hearing ill and for unworthy reasons. If the doctrines decided there remedy this vice, we will also interpret them favorably and set aside suspicion. For the peace we have long implored, if it comes about through moderate meetings, will be a delight to our church, which will overlook that certain things seem to be sprinkled with papism rather than open Christianity. You will ask what? This is not the place to recount, nor, if there is simplicity, do we complain. But if those who dealt with you, honorable, pious, learned, dear men to our mind, have proceeded to deviate from that simplicity, which they laudably maintained during Zwingli's lifetime, we will pray to the Lord that, if no other churches can be retained, the Swiss may at least remain with the purity of Christ's words and deeds and be a refuge for others newly joining.</p>
      <p>You will ask why our preachers did not attend with Joachim, where, if anything imprudent were said, there would be admonition. I think the reasons for this absence were. I, being sick at home, advised that they should not be absent, but in vain. Although I see no loss here; perhaps it was better that this peace was not disturbed, nor, if we rightly use it, will there be danger in these axioms. For even after many meetings, which they are still contemplating, I do not think these examples of human thoughts will be held as oracles. But if the substance of these doctrines will stand with the divine word, they will not prevail by the authority of new synods, or because these have agreed among our people and the Saxons, but because the same have been divinely attested before this age. For it is indeed safer to seek the oracles of our salvation from the source than from the pools. The form of faith, charity, patience, or hope is abundantly prescribed, all other things are exactly prescribed.</p>
      <p>It is a wonder that no one has understood the ministries of the word and sacraments or too few, especially since they were treated much more plainly and solidly many years ago than they are now treated with trickery. Paul boasted that he had baptized no one except one or two; now, I think, the world will be called together to make a consensus for preaching and elevating exhibitions and ministries of the elements - but elements? indeed, even sacraments, that is, a thing never understood nor plainly today. For although they concede all power and efficacy to God with singular favor, yet a certain mode of offering is still imagined, and that, as I said, understood by no one. Now they call it a privilege when God acts without sacraments. This order obscures both the sacrament and the privilege. For we live in Christ and are reborn often and reach greater age without using sacraments. But why should humanly invented words obscure, when the venerable and immortal body of Christ is henceforth so covered with ministries, subministries, exhibitions, that they affirm this body is eaten in the supper in another way - that is, miraculously, celestially, in short: not understood -, than it is eaten by the pious outside this use of the supper? What is true is declared by this word "offering." For if you consider the bread, it is true that this is a peculiar mode of celebrating the body and memory of the Lord; but if the thing they establish in the sacrament, the thing is not different in the supper than in the heart of the faithful outside the supper. What then do we contrive? Why do we nourish the impiety and idolatry of papist men with this old leaven? Is it expedient to deceive the minds of the pious in this way, so that they do not see what is present, think they have what is absent, that is, a third kind of body of Christ unknown to scripture and pious minds? But the bilge is still foul to me when it is governed by new doctrines of offering and ministering.</p>
      <p>But, as I said, we forgive this to good brothers, if they confer such things among themselves, if one yields to another in disputing, if they contend with prayers, not curses, if they lay down hatreds and enmities, if they bear with each other even erring somewhat in externals, if they cease to quarrel, if they change insults into entreaties, if they lay down in the midst their reasons for faith, charity, tolerance. If the meetings of the learned are conducted for such causes, great fruit will follow without danger. But to expand and publish in synods what is barely given by peace-loving people out of a desire for concord, as if they were of some value and worthy, in which all churches would conspire, is a matter full of fear and danger. For we will degenerate in this way from divine to human counsels, and there will always be something new that will flatter the senses of the common people, until we fall back into the place from which the pious were led out in this age, repenting with a strong hand and much blood. How much more excellent it was to set before our eyes the voices and canons of the prophets and Christ and to be fed by these than to continually burden the people of Christ with new doctrines! But they bid us be secure, that nothing of the sort is being prepared. I know, the prudent will not do, to lead us back into papist servitude, of which this mention is made. But the imprudent will be seduced with the imprudent, I do not know whether with greater harm or disgrace, who, with what beginnings, to what end (if, however, as I hope, there is an end) the papist hierarchy has fallen, we see and feel even now. Ah, my Bullinger, where will our joy and congratulation vanish, with which we boasted that we were led out of this Babylonian servitude and planted in a land flowing with milk and honey, of sweet and rich nourishment! Do not think that we are ready to slander those things that are a pretext for this evil. For unless the process of the business evidently extorted this fear of ours, we would not be such anxious observers. Thus without great cause we do not reject councils and we do not reject them without discrimination, but we believe the experienced Nazianzen, who writes that he has seen no good end of a synod and that they have not more increased evils than resolved them. For we feel the same from one or two meetings only, neither frequent nor very meditated. But what will happen in the dry?</p>
      <p>Let us agree to propagate the name of Christ by another institution, than that new canons are published to extend our purpose, by which we mix flesh and elements with spirit and also repeat the old teachers, such as this of Augustine: "the word comes to the element, and it becomes a sacrament," which voice has begotten nefarious errors, which still exist and are sought where they do not exist; then that: sacraments are visible words, which is now everywhere inculcated by our people; but oh, the clear proclamation of a thing not understood! We will be caught by these verbal tricks with the restored authority of the fathers, from whom now to depart is affirmed to be a crime unless with manifest scripture. Are we so conspired against the writings of men so infinite and rash, that it is not allowed to depart from them unless with scripture conquered? Now, however, at the very threshold we are not only glued to their sentiments with scripture, but now without any scripture. It is added that it will be that very pestiferous hierarchies will be restored to the churches by synods, and yet they dare to object to us that it is only from Satan if anyone impedes the meetings, and they urge us with the promises of Christ, as if every meeting must be from a good spirit, if only the name of Christ is prefixed, or as if anything reduced to canons by the pious must be taken from the middle of scripture, if it obtains this title, and they would plainly prove this to us by their dissertations, unless examples testified to the contrary. Thus they begin to admit ceremonies, the fomenters of superstitions, whatever does not lead away from Christ. But this dispute will still require infinite synods. What more? Satan builds a new servitude of consciences under the guise of religion and charity, in which discerning there will be need for prudent simplicity and sound judgment. But we will not obtain chaste religion unless we treat clearly and, as befits the children of light, the words that pertain to Christian life and morals.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my Bullinger, give attention and notice that the love of truth remains a handmaid. I write all these things without gall, and the brothers I criticize, learned and pious men, are dear to me, as much as anyone. I also approve of that ease and readiness with which our people (I mean those taken from the world and given to Christ) are so beautifully and peacefully reconciled. For charity covers many sins. But we must aim at this in cultivating friendship, that each one recalls his brother and neighbor from danger, lest the healthy part of friends be carried away by the affected, and as members play together with mutual help, but which is for salvation, nor do they reject each other in turn. Thus brothers are to be cherished, until the firm part restores the weaker, and if it does not restore, yet tolerates, so that what is still whole is preserved.</p>
      <p>As I am about to finish the letter, I add this example: What more pestilent has invaded our recently restored republic led and taught by the divine word, than that those turned to the Lord from the heart were rejected by Luther for light reasons, I also add unworthy ones, into I know not what Tartarus, who did not want to adhere to his doctrines about the Lord's Supper? The zeal of the best man, by neglecting charity, lost even the truth itself. The same is happening now: After the reverence for Luther moved our people, that with Bucer's intercession they accommodated themselves to his obscurity in handling the business of the supper, it does not seem enough to allow each one his own way of speaking, unless the matter is reduced to canons, which will later be spread throughout the world by public consensus. I ask, for what other use, unless those who contradict these and have spoken sincerely and in a German manner, as Zwingli and Oecolampadius did, are to undergo the same judgment as before, those who opposed Luther? But now even more seriously because of the multitude of supporters, and a new term "sacramentarians" is prepared, which will not rest until it finds, on whom it first inflicts ecclesiastical censures, as they call them, then also civil penalties. So that you may understand, the sacramentarians, that is, as they were formerly called, the Zwinglians, are exempted from the public peace in the Cadaic transaction. This zeal will not rest until the reason of love is corrupted for unworthy causes. These judgments and zealotry should have been most remote from Christians. But how will we tolerate foolish brothers, who are nevertheless pious, if we cannot bear even those who think better than us because of our imaginations! I deprecate this cruelty and these manners, and I think they should be avoided, by which this evil is so matured, not even otherwise holy and pious authors, who without retracting their former writings, overturn them, so that they seem not to know what they are doing now, worthy of pardon, because they themselves are commonly the instruments of evil appointed by the Lord, so that it is altogether not a private, but a public fault that should be alleged.</p>
      <p>This one thing consoles: that all are invited everywhere to prayers, to which if we indulge more than to impertinent zeal, the Lord will be propitious to this imprudence, and he alone will preserve and restore the Christian republic, which we expect.</p>
      <p>I have been more prolix than is proper. Forgive the verbosity and measure the letter not by the speech, but by our mind. May Christ preserve you with your companions, whom you will greet all eagerly in my name. If I have offended with these writings, I wish to amend.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest Bullinger, and love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, March 19, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Blarer.</p>
