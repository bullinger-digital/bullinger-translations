      <p>Greetings. I sent a letter from Mr. Beza that was shared with me at a time when I had no doubt that you had received it on January 16th. But behold, while I was expecting another, my letters were returned to me, which I was forced to unseal and write others, and in the meantime, I could not send what I had to you through reliable messengers, having been informed of the forgetfulness of this intermediary, who had previously received mine; for I fear, and not without reason, that if any of the letters you send to me and those writings as well were lost, you would suspect it was due to my fault; therefore, I prefer to hold onto them longer and ensure their safe delivery.</p>
      <p>However, you have long excused your silence towards me, and I am well content. May God, the best and greatest, be with you by His grace, grant you health, so that you may successfully complete the work you have begun, which you are engaged in, and may you continue to enjoy being the father of our churches for a longer time. But it is still the case that you should allow yourself some respite from the long-endured labors, your adverse health, and great cares. The poet said: "What lacks alternate rest," etc.</p>
      <p>But I do not doubt that the Lord will be with you; so many prayers of the pious are held for you before the Lord. However, we hoped to hear something from Mr. Gwalther; for we fear that perhaps what we wrote to Mr. Zanchi about his theses and Marbach's was interpreted by us in a worse part, and we did not first explore or hear your opinion; yet he pressed so insistently that we thought it would be wrong to deny; we added, however, a writing in which we excused ourselves in that manner and with attached conditions, so that we hope you will not take it badly; for we acknowledge, as we ought, that you are superior to us in all ways, fathers, lords, and teachers to be respected, and therefore we have submitted all our matters to your judgment. Furthermore, the news I write is nothing but what is already well known to you.</p>
      <p>I received letters these days from Mr. Blaurer, because he faithfully communicated to us everything he received from you.</p>
      <p>Mr. Peyer in good faith communicated certain things he received from Basel, namely that the Emperor, the Pope, Savoy, and Philip are consulting on how to destroy France and Switzerland; the Emperor, if he does not help, at least connives; the Venetians, if not soldiers, will at least provide money. The people of Bregenz will soon have 2500 Italian soldiers; our people are taking care of their arrival. You will have more certain information about the diets in Rapperswil.</p>
      <p>Mr. Peyer tried to dissuade the Abbot of Rheinau, as he was called by only 5 Cantons without the knowledge of the most honorable magistrate of Zurich, but in vain, although he could have easily excused himself. He thinks that everything should be observed and reproached to him by your people, whom he should rightfully recognize as his superiors and also respect yours; they might perhaps have excused him. It is suspected by many that a certain sum of money is to be contributed by the abbots, which will later go to Philip for the military expedition undertaken. Then a legate is to be sent to the council, who, if he goes to Trent, will approve everything. Hence, they will make themselves participants in the execution of the council, not only the abbots but also the 5 Cantons. Hence wars and dissension will arise in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Many think the Cantons are now more moderate because they lack the opportunity they are still expecting; then many will see what they are going to do; for they have promised more than they can perhaps fulfill. But these things are still in secret.</p>
      <p>I do not wish to trouble you longer, as you are too busy. We have nothing certain yet about the diets in Ulm, what was done there; if I hear anything sooner than you, I will immediately inform you. We are completely ignorant of what was done at the recent diets in Lucerne; there are many intrigues, etc. Farewell in the Lord with all the pious.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you and wish you well.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, January 29, 1562.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Jakob RÃ¼eger. To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, to be honored as his own father.</p>
