      <p>Greetings. These brothers have come from the Val d'Angrogna and other neighboring areas to request aid for their poverty. We did not mock their misfortune, as they took up arms rather inconsiderately, certainly against our advice. They are so ruined in all their fortunes that their miseries move all who are endowed with humanity to compassion. Among us, a smaller sum was collected because a third of the guests have left, leaving only the poor behind. However, we have contracted a foreign debt of four thousand crowns, at which time, even if not wisely, we acted rightly.</p>
      <p>He who ought to have paid is deaf.</p>
      <p>Thus, it will be shameful for Navarre, we will have to pay what ought to have been rightly recorded in his accounts. Now they are setting out to you, as instructed.</p>
      <p>It would have been foolish to recommend them to Bern; it was not possible to deny letters to you. If you deem it so, when they wish to pass through Schaffhausen, you will guide them with advice and assist them with your grace and authority. Farewell, most excellent and sincerely revered brothers.</p>
      <p>May the Lord always guide, protect, and bless you. Geneva, July 14, 1561.</p>
      <p>Johannes Calvin, in the name and by the mandate of your brothers. To the most illustrious men and faithful servants of Christ, the pastors and teachers of the ZÃ¼rich church, truly esteemed colleagues and brothers.</p>
