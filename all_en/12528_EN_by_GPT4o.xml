      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have received the money for the spices. I will inform you of the price of the Boethius edition if I see Mr. Heinrich Petri.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The people of Strasbourg have sent four companies of Landsknechte to the Landgrave of Hesse.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I also read a letter written by a captain from the camp of the King of France to his mother, who lives in Basel, saying he would have already returned home. The Landgrave of Hesse has recruited the troop unit after peace was made between the French and the English.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>There is talk among us that the Landgrave of Hesse and the Duke of L端neburg are planning to attack Brabant, where there are many armored horses and foot soldiers. May God grant success and salvation! I know the Lord will not abandon us, but with His help, He will destroy that Pharaoh and cast him into hell.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Many mercenaries are returning. The reason is that they are not being told where they are supposed to go or against whom.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Our people have raised a banner and a company. The Emperor is furious, blowing his last breath. The priests must go to the devil.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I wanted to write these few things to you; the rest Myconius will report. The Saxon is preparing and fortifying the places facing Bohemia to prevent an unexpected invasion. I know well that the envoys from Strasbourg have returned home in three days from Regensburg, where no one has said anything about the imminent danger. God can break and annihilate all the plans of the wicked; at least let us trust in the Lord, call upon Him with heart and mouth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell. June 29, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Yours, G.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The people of Strasbourg are still recruiting mercenaries. They have about seven companies. In Alsace, no one wants to enlist, as the Margrave has forbidden anyone to join any lord, whoever he may be, under penalty of life and property.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>To the honorable Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my gracious and dear lord, to his hands.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
