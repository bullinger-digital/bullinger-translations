      <p>Greetings. You accuse me quite severely for not writing, and you are not entirely unjust; for I could have written at some time, if other matters had not delayed me, and I would have had to write to many if I had written to one. However, the fatigue and tremor of my hands, which I contracted from the severity of a prolonged illness, greatly hindered me. And even today, I am not lavish with letters for the same reason I mentioned. I will say what surprises me: when my hands warm up, a very strong tremor occurs; when I immerse them in water containing salts, the original strength returns, and then I can write. But enough about this matter; there is no doubt that you will hear my excuse with the same ease with which I have heard you in similar situations. Nevertheless, I honor and revere you as long as I live, even if I never write; for Bullinger is such to me that his memory will not fade.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have not yet had the leisure to read your latest Decade. I await and desire the time to do so; it is the Lord's to grant this. There is no news, except what I experience daily in my body, which is indeed not surprising, not certainly because of age, which is still tolerable, but because of illnesses that are excessively troublesome, and all are due to salty humors, and there is no one who can either stop or expel them.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, one wrote from Leipzig, another from Wittenberg, but neither brought pleasure. I found only that the former seeks peace with the Emperor, which I interpret entirely well; for whatever comes from him is suspect to me. There is a rumor from Schertlin that the Turk has renounced the peace truce with Ferdinand, for this reason, he is demolishing the towers of Vienna a little higher, lest the Turk harm through them if he perhaps besieges the city.</p>
      <p>If the Emperor is negotiating peace, this could be the reason for treating the people of Magdeburg somewhat more mildly.</p>
      <p>It is certain that the peasants are being driven from many miles by Maurice to continuous labors against the city. A courier from Wittenberg told me that he was among the laborers; there, from the city, now from one side, now from the other, they perished by bullets with such force that he left with three coins exposed for his labors. And he added that such a multitude of the Emperor's men were killed that no one could believe it, and they leave daily in great numbers. It is said that Maurice has raised three fortifications surpassing the city in height; he hopes for something from these. However, in the city, whatever they attempt outside, there is not a single man who is afraid, nor do they ever have the gates closed. May the Lord Jesus deign to be with them, as He has been so far; for what they suffer, they truly suffer for Him, whatever reasons the enemy may pretend.</p>
      <p>I wish to learn from you about Parma. German soldiers come here, they come from Switzerland and disappear; and the Emperor's leaders, great men, come, but they pass by scarcely having drunk a cup of wine. I can predict that serious tumults are at hand.</p>
      <p>All is silent about the diets; however, I hear that the envoys of the French, the Pope, and the Emperor are present; whatever they propose, they are intent on distracting us. Then indeed it would be over for us.</p>
      <p>Here, through your people, make sure that the ill-intentioned men and haters of our peace do not achieve their wishes. May the Lord be with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and brothers in the Lord. Basel, June 24, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned D. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of ZÃ¼rich, in his Lord.</p>
