    <p xml:id="regest1">Is little pleased about a letter from the Zurichers to [Karlstadt] regarding the question of the doctorate, as he fears his suspicious surroundings might think he initiated the writing. Capito advises against public disputes about the Lord's Supper, but reports nothing new [about the concord negotiations], while [Markus] Bertschi has learned from Gervasius [Schuler] about an agreement between Luther and the Swabians. The bishops' solicitation for support in the war against Münster is said to have been rejected by the cities.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Gaspar mentioned to me in passing that you sent some letters to our doctor regarding the doctorate. If this is indeed the case, I would have preferred either not to have written them or to have written them as gently as possible. People are so suspicious that when they hear such things, they think it is instigated by me, although I am more silent here than a fish. I have a reason ready with which I can counter these trifles. I will use it, unless God wills otherwise. Throughout my life, I have hated those who are quick to suspect evil, and now I live among such people. However, the more I get used to them, the easier it is for me to disregard them, so that now they are hardly bothersome at all.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Capito wrote again and advised that if you wish to meet, you should do so under a different title and name than that of the Eucharist. He fears, I understand, that the people might suffer some harm from the known dissension. Meanwhile, he commends your gentleness and diligence in your efforts for the concord of the churches. He understood this from the letter you wrote to Berchtold consoling him. He writes nothing new, and I am surprised, as Gervasius recently informed our Bertschi that Luther agrees with the Swabians on the matter of the supper. He clearly states that Bucer and Philipp wrote this to him.</p>
      <p>Hear one more thing: They say that some bishops have acted with certain imperial cities and those along the Rhine regarding expenses and war against the Münsterites, and that these cities have responded that they are entangled and have other matters to attend to. It is pleasing if this is the case.</p>
      <p>Farewell with Utinger and the brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, April 7, 1535.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To his lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
