      <p>Greetings. I received your letters along with those you sent to Tugginer and the magnificent consul Stegner. I immediately delivered them to Tugginer and also recommended the matter of the orphans with the best note; he promised to provide good and faithful service. I hope he will fulfill his duty. I immediately sent the letters to Consul Stegner via courier; he was away in Bern, but Quaestor Grafrius will take good care of it. There are those who deny that the King of Spain is coming to Italy; others say this is deceitfully concealed, for he has obtained from the Pope half of the revenues of the benefices of Flanders, and also to sell from the ecclesiastical revenues of Spain up to 40,000 crowns, furthermore, that each parish should provide the salary of one foot soldier. Much is also said about the Spanish preparations. We shall see. Nothing further.</p>
      <p>I pray for much health from the Lord for you and Lord Gwalter. Farewell, most esteemed man. Yours sincerely, P[omponne] Belli√®vre.</p>
      <p>They also write that pardon for all crimes and indulgences has been granted to the Spanish soldiers who wish to take up arms against the Turks from Flanders.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the Church of Zurich. Zurich.</p>
