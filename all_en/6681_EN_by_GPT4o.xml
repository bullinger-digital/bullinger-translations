      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I have nothing to write at the moment, since Mr. Beza is a living letter. From him, you will hear how they wish to join with us in the agreement of your exposition. This pleases us greatly, and it will not be ungrateful to our senate either, as you recently understood. And if only a way could be found by which the people of Basel could also be brought into the same agreement, so that they might once again unite into the same body. You will consult about this among yourselves; if there is anything we could do to assist in this, we would do it gladly; at least they should be attempted; however, we await what will be pleasing to you. Farewell, most esteemed lord and father. All of ours send you their utmost greetings. Johannes Zehender, your relative, who had been the prefect of Tscherlitz, passed away the day before yesterday, not from the plague; he had been ill for a long time from one leg, which has now completely finished him. Bern, February 12, 1566.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and compatriot, to be perpetually respected. Zurich.</p>
