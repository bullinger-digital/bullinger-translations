      <p>May the Lord bless your bath and keep you and your family from all evil. I am sending you the letters received from our Lyner, as well as from the widow of Buttler, so that you may discern from them what needs to be done.</p>
      <p>It is not pleasing that the imprudent young man began his business immediately with that which has also earned him the utmost hatred among his relatives and kin. I had suggested a different plan to him. Furthermore, it is certain that the remarkable Zviccium did not want to hear even a little about arranging the marriage unless he first transferred his inheritance to Germany. It is also certain that the pious Buttler initially migrated to us for the sake of religion in the year 1536. I am doubtful about what more can be written and done in this matter. The widow's letters are kept for you, so that you may act more expediently in what you are going to do; at least return Lyner's to me. I have no faith at all in the Anglo-French marriage, especially because of the coronation being so hastily attached; certainly, if papism were to be brought back to England, that kingdom would perish.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant better things.</p>
      <p>We are all well by the grace of God; I wish that you too may be well with yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 2, morning, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my beloved relative Mr. Rudolf Gwalther in Urdorf.</p>
