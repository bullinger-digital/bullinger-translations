    <p xml:id="regest1">Various hints in the last letter from Myconius [No. 521] have remained unclear to him. Regarding the speech about the offering of the body of Christ, no concessions have been made. It must remain clear that Christ alone, or faith itself, offers. He defends himself against Bucer's accusations regarding his absence from the meeting in Constance. Criticizes the willingness to compromise that is expressed in the opinions for Chelius. Has just learned more about the disputes over the theological doctorate through Theodor [Bibliander] and encourages Myconius in his stance. Recommends the messenger.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We do not know, dearest brother, what business oppresses you, except that you mentioned the university was stirred up against you. Therefore, we wrote our opinion on this matter to you and awaited your response. Now, as you write, we still do not know what Capito has done among you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding the offering, namely the new word of contention, if anything has been done, we do not know. Certainly, we have done nothing either in words or letters, except what is expressed in our confession. No one offers the body of Christ to the faithful except Christ alone. The minister offers ministerially and only offers the sacrament. Thus, only God forgives sin, yet the apostles are also said to forgive, but in their own way. For they forgive nothing to him who does not believe. And in this manner, Augustine also wrote about sanctification in his "Questions on Leviticus," Book 3, Chapter 84. And we ourselves have written about the offering in our confession. Therefore, when they say the matter of the Eucharist has stumbled among the Swiss because of the offering, I can see nothing else than that they attribute too much to the external ministry, as if Christ were present by the power of words or ministry, when in truth he is present by the benefit of faith, and each one eats and receives as much as he believes. However, if we admit the word of offering, the power of the keys and the Lutheran absolution will stick at the door. Here, too, a mediator will be needed, who will finally command us to subscribe to Luther's words in this matter. But in short: If anyone after God offers the true body of Christ, it is faith itself, which is also a gift of God, that offers. Without this, the minister offers nothing but a sign. But where there is faith, the body of Christ is offered by the benefit of faith - not by words or ministry. Therefore, we will in no way accept these obscure words unless a clearer explanation is added at the same time. It is a great plague that we must now have disputes. Before, everyone had to subscribe to the Saxon confession, now everyone must subscribe to the MÃ¼nster book. And what will be the end? If they cannot bear our confession, I will give nothing more unless compelled by clearer scriptures. What should we patch (fix) here and there (forever)?</p>
      <p>Bucer was displeased that I did not come to Constance. Who am I, he wrote, from whom you fear for your faith? Certainly, by not coming and refusing the meeting, you acted against the example of all ages. I replied to these many things: We do not fear for our faith from him, whom we believe to be its patron. Furthermore, that I did not come was not only due to ill health, but because the synod at Constance convened more hastily than we could attend. For at first, as you know, he had arranged a nocturnal meeting, from which our minds recoiled, and it was decided to handle this matter in writing. When this was done, it was not permissible for us to go to Constance without consulting you and the Bernese. Furthermore, our intention was to persist in what we had confessed. Therefore, what was the need to go to a meeting, when we were present in writing, unless we suspected they were establishing another presence than that of faith? Hence, perhaps we have not yet satisfied them. But after much, I added that we do not reject the meeting nor fear for our faith. Therefore, let him make the attempt, convene a synod, but in due time, in a convenient place, not only us, but the Bernese, the Baselers, and others, and if we do not come, let him accuse us of treachery.</p>
      <p>The plans that Chelius circulates are completely displeasing. If the titles (authors) do not lie, I fear that we may eventually come to the point where no papal dogma, no rite will remain, which we will not almost recall with our moderation. I want these things written to you as to a uniquely dear one, into whose bosom I safely pour out my heart. In short, the quarreling does not please me. Certainly, if we descend into this arena, we have succumbed. For we have wicked adversaries, who would wish for nothing more than for us to abandon simple purity for slippery compromise. I do not like it; simple and clear are the just things, white or black or nothing at all!</p>
      <p>Now indeed, our Theodor returns from you and, oh good God, what wonders he tells, which I would not have expected! Indeed, it will be well when again the faculty is given to you, or to Paul in Ephesians 4 [11], if it pleases the gods, to create teachers. But I myself am also foolish, who have always shuddered at degrees. But the Lord will soon provide better for our affairs. You persist in your simplicity and purity.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>February 13, 1535.</p>
      <p>The man who offers you this seems to be a good man. I wish I could have treated him with dignity in your name! But what do you have from Gallus, I beg?</p>
      <p>Farewell again, most beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Your entirely, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, most worthy bishop of the renowned Basel church, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
