      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ.</p>
      <p>What you request from me, dear brother, regarding the explanation of certain passages in Paul's letter to the Romans and their difficulties, is like drawing water from a stone. But so as not to burden you with lengthy excuses, nor to appear to dismiss your earnest request, accept in brief the opinion which I consider worthy of Christ. However, I do not want you to attribute anything to me in this matter, as I have barely greeted the sacred scriptures from the threshold. I strive, indeed, with God as my guide, to understand more and more of His matters each day, but "it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" [Romans 9:16], to whom you should give credit if I have expressed anything worthy of Him.</p>
      <p>I once heard Huldrych Zwingli, a man of sincere and sharp judgment, whom I also use as a teacher in sacred scriptures, explaining Paul's Epistle to the Romans from the public pulpit, where he expounded this passage: "The righteousness of God is revealed through the gospel from faith to faith" [Romans 1:17] in the same way you noted in your collections. For πίστις (faith) signifies not only belief but also truth and the constancy of a promise. This is also frequent among the Hebrews in the word אֲמוּנָה (emunah), which is derived from אֲמֵן (amen). For אֲמוּנָה (emunah) signifies truth, firmness, as you wisely gather from Psalm 32. Thus, the Hebrew has וְכָל-מַעֲשֵׂהוּ בֶּאֱמוּנָה = "and all His work is in truth" [Psalm 33:4], for they often use the singular for the plural, especially in the word כָל (kol) which means "all": "God is steadfast, truthful, faithful," etc. But according to this exposition, I think the aforementioned passage should be arranged so that the first πίστις (for this word is used twice here: ἐκ πίστεως εἰς πίστιν) is taken for the certain trust and belief of the one who adheres to the promises, and the second for the truth of the one promising, who certainly fulfills what is promised and does not deceive. Thus "from faith to faith": from trust and belief to the faithful and true promise of God. For righteousness is indeed from this, when we believe in the promising God, and we are not only righteous when He promises, but if we adhere to His promises with firm trust. Therefore, the sense is: when people recognize, indeed believe, that God will fulfill what He promised through the mouths of His prophets. "The just shall live by faith" [Romans 1:17], that is, by what he believes.</p>
      <p>Zwingli explained the other passage in chapter 2 [14 f] as follows: to the Gentiles, to whom the written law was not given, God writes the things of the law in their hearts. Where you will first observe that Paul speaks here of nature in the manner of the Gentiles, as if he says: "You Gentiles, since you think this nature is to do to others what you wish to be done to you, let me grant you that nature can do this, you will extort nothing else except that the law is also in you, and thus you are sinners and transgressors of the law." Therefore, nature is not taken here (if you consider Paul's mind) for what is from us, for nothing is more adverse and contrary to our nature than the law, which is to love one's neighbor as oneself [Matthew 22:39]. Therefore, you must understand nature as that continuous and perpetual operation of God. Paul, therefore, approaches somewhat the manner of the Gentiles (when they speak of God) in this place, not because he himself thinks so, but because the Gentiles thought so, among whom he acts as a mediator between them and the Jews. Hence, he also said in the first chapter: "The knowledge of God is manifest to them" [Romans 1:19], cautiously adding: "For God has shown it to them" [Romans 1:19], lest anyone attribute this to nature. Therefore, nature here signifies the operation of God, which works even in the most impious, by which He shows them the law and manifests His will to them. However, the impious, blinded and overwhelmed by their passions, do not follow this operation, even though they perceive it. And there is no need for you to be troubled by these words ("the things of the law," "the work of the law" [Romans 2:14f]), for by these Paul understands the meaning, the tenor, and the mind of the law: the intention, the content of the law. Paul, therefore, wants to say: although the Gentiles do not have the written law like the Jews, God nevertheless writes, manifests, and shows the things of the law, that is, what the law commands, in their hearts, which their consciences and thoughts testify to, so that they cannot say they are immune and free from sins.</p>
      <p>I write this to you, my dear Heinrich, not because I despise the judgment of others or because our own offspring pleases us (for it is not ours), but to satisfy you, as far as I can; for I do not know whether this will satisfy you. I pray to God that He may advance this study of yours day by day.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Zurich, 6th of the Nones of March 1523.</p>
      <p>Your Leo Jud.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pious and etc. [?].</p>
