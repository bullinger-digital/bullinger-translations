      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, my willing service to you, etc., in advance.</p>
      <p>Gracious sir, this is with the lord governor Kamli. Be assured, you may not have known anything about his journey; for our dear lords are very concerned, I am with him, according to the news from the lord of Beza, hoping that more has come to you since, for which I thank God more and more for his grace. Our adversary is completely silent; may God reveal their false plans. I have little news from Augsburg; from other places it is reported that Duke Wolfgang is not dead, but has been in England, which I do not believe; whether he is dead or not, our Lord Christ lives. With this, I write to the lord governor Wagman, who will soon send his son or another messenger; there you may find certain news. Our dear lords, the city scribes, send you friendly greetings with a request to greet the other lords on my behalf. With that, may God the Lord, along with yours, be graciously entrusted at all times. Amen.</p>
      <p>My brother is with me; his dear wife has died. He sends you many good wishes.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Hans Liner. To the venerable and well-learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, faithful servant of the church in Zurich, his gracious commanding lord in Zurich.</p>
