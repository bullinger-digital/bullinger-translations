      <p>Be safe in Christ, excellent Bullinger. On February 2nd, I wrote to you and sent along with the letter twenty crowns or ten crowns and cloth for a gown; for I left this to Abel's discretion. I received yours on May 23rd. Shortly after, the Bishop of London sent me a copy of your response to the letters of Laurence Humphrey and Thomas Sampson. What you wrote is being printed here both in Latin and English. Furthermore, on July 12th, I received the confession of the orthodox faith, a most beautiful booklet.</p>
      <p>In the month of March, a certain Italian (called Senior David, skilled in the art of necromancy) who was in great favor with the Queen of Scotland, was forcibly dragged from the queen's chamber (in her presence) and miserably perished, stabbed with several daggers. A certain abbot there, who was wounded, barely escaped, but shortly after died from his wound. A friar named Black (Niger, Swarts), a leader of the papists, was killed in the court at the same time.</p>
      <p>Thus this black rascal, also taken by a black death, Unwillingly descended suddenly into the black underworld.</p>
      <p>The counselors, who were then gathered together in one room to consult on certain difficult matters, upon hearing of these murders (for they had suspected nothing of the sort before) fled in different directions, some through the windows, each striving to escape, and thus with the danger to their lives, they took counsel for their own safety. The Queen of Scotland gave birth to a prince, and whereas she previously did not hold her husband in high regard (I do not know for what reasons), she now values him greatly. Sir James, her brother from her father's side, whom she previously despised, she has now reconciled with, and not only him but all (if only it were true!) evangelical nobles, as I hear; the gospel, which was temporarily suppressed, now raises its head again.</p>
      <p>While I was writing this, behold, a certain Scot fleeing from his homeland, a good and learned man, told me that the queen gave birth to a boy ten weeks ago and he has not yet been baptized. I ask the reason; he responds that the queen wants her son to be baptized in the main church of Edinburgh with the celebration of many masses. But the people of Edinburgh will not allow it at all; for they would rather die than allow the abominable masses to creep back into their churches. The people of Edinburgh fear that she may call for auxiliary troops from France to more easily oppress the evangelicals. Let us pray to the Lord for our pious brothers. She has ordered a certain pious earl to expel Knox, who is staying with him, from his house. May the Lord convert or confound her! I cannot write more; I have been ill for a long time and have not yet fully recovered; this is the weakness of my hand in writing.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest Bullinger. Please convey my greetings to all yours and indeed to all the pious in my name. May the Lord protect the dominion of the Zurichers with His right hand!</p>
      <p>Hastily from Ludham, August 21, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
