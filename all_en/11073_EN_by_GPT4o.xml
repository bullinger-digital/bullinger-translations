    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the detailed report on the case of his relative Heinrich Wiederkehr [No. 1030] and regrets having caused Schmid so much trouble. Wiederkehr did not slander Schmid in Zurich, which Bullinger would have reproached him for; moreover, he and Provost Brennwald do not approve of his behavior towards the bailiff at all. Since Wiederkehr has behaved in such a manner, further details of the incident hardly matter anymore; thanks for the reduction of the fine and asks to be patient with the collection. Schmid should understand if he receives another letter on the matter from Mayor [Diethelm] Röist. Best wishes.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Pious, steadfast, honorable, prudent and wise, kind, dear sir and good friend, I have received your friendly letter and thorough report on the matter of my cousin Heinrich Wiederkehr. However, there was no need for the effort and work, as you have described everything to me so precisely. I regret, therefore, that I have caused you this trouble, but I am also pleased to have sensed your friendliness and entirely favorable, good will towards me. Therefore, I should rightly be grateful and entirely willing to reciprocate, wherever possible, in friendliness and service to you.</p>
      <p>As for your concern that my aforementioned cousin has slandered you to me and other good gentlemen and friends of yours, you should be without worry. For, to my knowledge, he has not done anything of the sort, and I would not have allowed it either. You are also held in a different regard by me than to easily believe that you would behave improperly; moreover, it is not useful to rely on a one-sided account. Beyond all this, the matter itself, as it stands, has not entirely pleased either my lord Provost Brennwald or myself. He has not found any support from us, especially since he has been so impetuous and scornful in this matter against you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the main issue, there might have been room for mediation if he had approached you more amicably. For Bernhard Tratz has confessed that he spoke to the woman, saying they wanted to catch someone who had broken the peace, so that she would run away from him. This happened in the morning. My cousin then believes he can inform you well that the peacebreaker did not leave before and after, as your messenger came, etc. However, whatever the case may be, his wife did give the warning, and he was indiscreet with words, which I will not excuse in my aforementioned letter, but rather ask you further not to rush in imposing the punishment. For the reduction of the 30 pounds, I truly consider it great and thank you most highly, most kindly, and most faithfully for it. If I could reciprocate this to you, I would do so.</p>
      <p>However, if you also receive another letter from my lord Mayor Röist, who is a very friendly, beloved lord of mine, you should not be angry, nor think otherwise, for Provost Brennwald, your brother-in-law, and I have requested him to write to you and ask for a delay in imposing the penalty until you might come to Zurich, where we would then discuss the matter further with you in friendship. Otherwise, you should not consider us to be insisting, just because it concerns our relative, that he should go unpunished or be allowed to speak as he wishes.</p>
      <p>With this, I kindly ask you to take this letter in the best way and to indicate where I could serve you; I will always be willing. May God protect you along with your household.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, on the 19th day of August in the year 1537.</p>
