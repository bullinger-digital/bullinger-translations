    <p xml:id="regest1">The situation in France is highly uncertain due to the unpredictability of King [Francis I], as evidenced by the execution of [Jean Poncher] despite assurances. It is wrongly claimed at the court that the [German Protestants] have softened their teachings; the opinions [of Melanchthon, Bucer, and Hedio] were not signed by any church but are private expressions in favor of [Guillaume du Bellay], and essential points have been omitted in their summary. Capito does not have Hedio's opinion and only recently read Bucer's in Constance, and he attaches little importance to them; even Philipp [Melanchthon] has not conceded more than Luther in his [Admonition] to the [spiritual] princes assembled in Augsburg. Regrets that Bullinger did not respond to Bucer and suggests a meeting in Basel, which is also convenient for the Bernese. Emperor [Charles V] is considering the plan of a council; although under the influence of the Pope, he persecutes Christians even worse than the religiously indifferent King of France, his seriousness gives hope. To be able to account for their faith, theologians should now come to an agreement, especially in view of the impending persecution, as the council will be dominated by German and Spanish military power. Greetings. Sends writings from Philipp [Melanchthon].</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is certain that the affairs of France are the most uncertain of all in this century due to the fickleness of the prince. Recently, despite having been given letters of public security, a great man was treacherously treated. The day after he arrived, he was seized, thrown into chains, subjected to many tortures, and finally tied to a gallows with a noose and ignominiously hanged, with his body guarded in contempt of a most noble family. Even now, the pious perish in Paris.</p>
      <p>What is said at court about the softened doctrines is utterly false; remember to excuse this gravely. It is an impudent lie that any church has subscribed to it.</p>
      <p>Private individuals have poured out their thoughts to a private individual, to offer a handle for consulting such a proven man in troubled matters; for Langius is said to be disliked by that most corrupt court in the name of Christ. The rest is gathered in fragments from three writings. There is nothing of what they preface, nothing of what they add in the epilogue: that there can be no concord with those who are not of Christ, so that they are not denying the justification by faith. There is nothing that excludes almost all bishops from the discussion, let alone from ecclesiastical concord. Therefore, oppose most of all that no church anywhere has subscribed to it. Indeed, I have not yet seen Hedio's opinion; I recently read Bucer's in Constance while passing through there. What do we care about the three little men, whom we nevertheless venerate as brothers, although Philip has given nothing else than what Luther wrote in the books published to the princes in Augsburg and which the papists strongly rejected.</p>
      <p>I wish you had responded to Bucer, and yet, if you fear the argument of dissension might arise, it is better that it be smothered in silence while it is still a spark. But the matters are much weaker than most of us want to appear, therefore I would strive by all means to have a meeting among us. Basel would be a convenient place; it is easily accessible to the Bernese and the churches of that vicinity.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is considering a council, which in this matter surpasses the Frenchman, as he does not allow the beginnings of Christianity to take root, but soon suppresses it with flames as it sprouts in the grass. He, however, has given space for deeper roots to grow, so that it cannot be extinguished by so many burnings and exiles of the good. The reason is that the Frenchman is not serious about religion; such is his life. The Emperor, however, suffers the Pope to reign in his conscience, to whom he is devoted as another hypocrite. Therefore, there are those who fear more harm from our (Emperor). Indeed, I would rather willingly hope for better and pray to the Lord for the Emperor, that He may enlighten him with the knowledge of the truth, to whom He has given such a mind towards religion; but it is necessary for us to be prepared for every occasion. What do you think the spectacle would be if at one time a response on religion and the foundation of salvation were sought from each minister, how great the diversity of opinions? Then how many foolish and impious ones perhaps? Would it not be beneficial to condense the matter into a few and sincerely conspire in the Lord, while it is still possible, before the persecution, which now seems to be contemplating its beginning; for what kind of council, I ask, do you expect, whose authority will be held by German and Spanish soldiers?</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and pray for the churches laboring everywhere.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 18th of October.</p>
      <p>I send my best regards to Leo, Pellican, Theodor, Erasmus, all good men.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Capito.</p>
      <p>I am sending the booklets of Philipp.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, most learned man, pastor of the Zurich church, to be respected in the Lord.</p>
