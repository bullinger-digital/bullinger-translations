      <p>Greetings. I think you have seen what came to my mind regarding the king's institution.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await your judgment.</p>
      <p>It happened very conveniently that the King of Navarre came to the king's court on the 19th of this month; I hope he will share your writing translated into French with him. I believe the Constable has left the court.</p>
      <p>The king went to Reims for the anointing and inauguration. On the 20th of this month, the emperor went to Vienna, and all the princes have departed. The pope died on the 18th of this month [Paul IV died on August 18, 1559]. I will not neglect to ensure that the post remains for Master Ciconia; for others will be removed from the payroll, as their services are not needed in times of peace. Greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, August 28.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
