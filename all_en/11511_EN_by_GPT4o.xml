    <p xml:id="regest1">What Megander reported is true: Because Ritter opposes the Lutheran teachings, he is being attacked by his fellow officials. His opponents have circulated a letter from Vadian, which not only criticizes the Zurichers' restraint towards Luther but also personally slanders Ritter; Vadian, who recently gave him a good testimonial, has written and objected to this. He has arranged for the Zurich envoy [Johannes Haab] to be recommended to the council.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, etc.</p>
      <p>Megander, our brother, has told you the truth; but as for the contempt of this, I do not know on whom to place the greater blame. There is no doubt in my mind that my adversaries, in the presence of all the pious and learned, are excellently defaming me, especially since I alone am delaying them from subjecting the Bernese church to the doctrines of the Lutherans and thus achieving full and complete concord with them, as they think, who are most devoted to novelty. However, in their judgment, this is the greatest sin, and they impiously slander me as unjust and innocent concerning other matters. Hence, they not only consider me unworthy of the name of ministry but also of being a Christian. Here, indeed, Christian piety and prudence would require that before legitimate knowledge, they should not burden me with such rash prejudice, but also keep the other ear open, so that they might first hear my defense. What more can I say? With me, there was nothing more candid, nothing more innocent, nothing more alien to these customs than the unique Vadian (Joachim von Watt), a most celebrated man, who not so long ago bore excellent testimony to my integrity as if it were most certain, but recently wrote a letter to Bern, which they copied and translated into the German language, so that they might conveniently circulate it throughout the entire city. In which, first, he excuses himself for responding late, then says that he has labored with tireless zeal until now to reconcile the minds of the Zurichers with Luther, indeed he recently wrote to the brothers in Zurich, but received too brief a response, namely that there is a confession and other means by which they wish to stand, as was concluded in the Zurich assembly in the year 1538; however, Vadian promises that he will soon go to Zurich and try everything to bring them back to the right path. Then he magnificently admits that he is in agreement with Luther and Bucer, whom he almost places beyond the reach of human fate, calling them most divine men, and finally he specifically attacks me: "Your Erasmus," etc. "But if he (as he is slippery) thinks that Bucer's opinion (he speaks of the Eucharist) is condemned in mine, he is not only completely wrong but also calumniously and without judgment - which he nevertheless demands from others - abuses my candid writings." So far Vadian. They spread this letter here and there, trying to take away all my reputation and faith with the authority of such a great man. What, I ask, is more unjust than to burden me, undeserving, with such a calumny before my church, and what is more unbecoming for such an eminent man than to have so suddenly forgotten the letters in which he so wonderfully commended my integrity? You see, therefore, my dear Bullinger, how impiously they act with me, who nevertheless wish to appear most pious themselves. But perhaps this is the highest piety among the Lutherans, to slander innocent brothers. I wanted, therefore, to pour these things into your bosom as to a most dear brother, so that you might understand in what great danger I labor among false brothers, but on the condition that you keep it to yourself. I wrote to Vadian, asking him to indicate the reasons by which he has been led to such suspicion of me, so that I may be allowed to defend my innocence before him.</p>
      <p>Moreover, what you wrote about your envoy, I showed to a certain excellent man; he revealed your commendation to the senate.</p>
      <p>Farewell, from Bern, February 22, 1541.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the man of exceptional piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, most dear brother in the Lord, to be greatly respected.</p>
