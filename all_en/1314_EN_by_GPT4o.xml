      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have admonished Myconius for his infrequent writing to you and showed him the letters you wrote; he will excuse himself, for his trembling hands scarcely allow him to write even three letters. I think it is either a stupor or something from paralysis that has spread into all his limbs. But regarding new matters, take this.</p>
      <p>The people of Magdeburg are still strongly resisting their adversaries; they recently captured some ships loaded with provisions, submerging the Mauritians who had a water station; from whom the provisions were sent, I do not know. Some seditious individuals have been beheaded by the imperial forces, some proscribed, and thus that faction of soldiers has been quelled, nor is it safe for them to leave and abandon the army. Some defect to the Parthenopolitans, but they are not accepted and are soon sent back; for they do not want to burden themselves with useless soldiers, lest supplies run out.</p>
      <p>It is certain that the Emperor has left Augsburg; some say he has gone to Munich for hunting and has stationed 4 banners there to prevent sedition by the citizens. We will see a strange metamorphosis in all things. Philip, the son, is setting out for Spain; Maximilian will inhabit the fortress in Milan; I certainly believe the Emperor to be dead.</p>
      <p>The Turk demands Transylvania from King Ferdinand or threatens to wage war, and they say a large force of soldiers is in Hungary awaiting the occasion for war. What is happening in Italy? We hear the Pope and the French have made peace and that Parma is now quietly possessed by the French. What will the Emperor say to this? What do you hear about the Bishop of Chur and the future council?</p>
      <p>The Diet of Koblenz was held because of the currency, although they also consulted about the miserable state of Germany and the traitors to the fatherland and about the lost freedom that can never be regained.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I wish to know what you are now writing and whether you will add other Decades to those you have published; believe me, you could not write anything more useful in our age afflicted with many evils, and now some preachers are beginning to become lazy in reading biblical books and almost ignore the principal articles of our religion and how they would defend them without scripture, which they have never well considered?</p>
      <p>Farewell. Basel, June 15, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>You have often asked about our Gilbert; so far I have had nothing to write, nor do I yet have anything about his life or doctrine. He is in Neuch√¢tel with relatives, burdened with ecclesiastical benefices; he is favored by the bishops; perhaps fear and the favor of men, by whom he is supported, have caused him not to write to you or other good friends, whom he has so far provoked with his letters. Once his letters were suppressed and read by people of the papist faction, through which he came into great danger; now he is silent, lest he fall into their hands. I wanted to tell you this, lest you say I have been provoked so many times and have not responded.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my gracious lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
