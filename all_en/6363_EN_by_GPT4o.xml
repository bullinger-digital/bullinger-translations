      <p>S. P. D.</p>
      <p>If you are well, most illustrious and reverend father, it is good; I am indeed well. I received your letters, in which you write to me to always devote myself to good literature and to pray for you constantly.</p>
      <p>I did not want to fail to send you letters written by my own hand. But I ask you not to take it badly that I have not written to you for so long; but you will excuse me because I could not find any messenger who could deliver the letters, nor do I dare to interrupt your studies with my trivialities too often. I give you great thanks for the gift you sent me.</p>
      <p>Everyone in our village and home is still in very good health except for the mother of our teacher and host Rodolphe Wonlichius, who is daily in danger of death due to illness.</p>
      <p>Always pray to the Lord for us, and I will do the same for you. Our lord and lady, along with the whole family, send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>I will end my writing here.</p>
      <p>Please, I beg you, give my regards in my name to Veritas, Dorothea, and your whole family.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, my father, who may always keep you safe in His protection for the salvation of His church.</p>
      <p>Given in Rickenbach on the eleventh day before the calends of February 1565. Your most beloved and ever obedient son Matthieu Coignet.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, father, lord, and most revered father.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
