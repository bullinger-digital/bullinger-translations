      <p>Greetings through Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear M. H[einrich] B[ullinger], I have heard from credible people that I have been reported to the new bailiff of Uri, as if I preached against the peace of the land on the Friday after Corpus Christi. He wants to report this to the Confederates. And I know well that I taught how a Christian should be armed with spiritual weapons, as Paul describes in Ephesians, chapter 6. I took that text and explained it in the most faithful and simple way, showing how one can drive away the devil with all his followers using the sword of God's word. I introduced the example of Christ, Matthew 4:1-11, etc.</p>
      <p>I did not want to withhold this from you, my lord and father, and I also ask you to speak the best for me to my lord, so that I may come to a defense; for I hope it will be found that I have preached the truth and have neither insulted nor defamed anyone.</p>
      <p>Given in Frauenfeld, on the day of Peter and Paul.</p>
      <p>P. R. yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned M. Heinrich Bullinger, true proclaimer of the divine word in Zurich, his dear lord.</p>
