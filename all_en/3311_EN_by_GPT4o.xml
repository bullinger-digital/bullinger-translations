      <p>Greetings. I received your letter (reverend father in Christ) and read it with the greatest pleasure.</p>
      <p>The reason I have not yet responded to it is that I have not yet received the books you mentioned in your letter; I believe my father-in-law still has them with him. I certainly cannot find a way to repay you for your many benefits to me; I wish that an opportunity would present itself so that I might be found to have expressed my gratitude to you in deeds, not just in words. But more on this when the books have been returned to me.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write to you about; however, I preferred to send you an empty letter rather than none at all; you encouraged me to do so in your letter. We should not expect the Duke of Guise any longer; it has been reported to us, through the post, that he has set sail from Ancona with a fleet and intends to reach Marseille by sea. He has also joined with noble Frenchmen and a select group of soldiers; he has already sent six banners to aid the struggling Ferrara. Therefore, a few who are not well will return home.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Guise undoubtedly relies on the support of the Turkish fleet, which, as the illustrious Friedrich von Salis wrote to me in recent days, has harassed Calabria and taken about four thousand people. It is truly lamentable that Christian princes are wearing each other down with mutual wars and, in the meantime, leaving such a multitude of people to be preyed upon. Whenever I allow myself to think about the peril in which the Christian republic finds itself today, I shudder and tremble; for I am touched by a certain image of things and the magnitude of the impending danger, and I am utterly exhausted.</p>
      <p>For I think to myself: How great is the slaughter of men, with what hostile spirits, with what cries do they rush and fight on both sides? What is the noise of arms, the crash of cannons, the sound of trumpets, or even the beating of drums, with which it is credible that everything around resounded far and wide? What is the appearance of those striking, the same of those falling, what faces, what color of those fleeing from the battlefield? What is the calamity of the defeated, what is the ferocity and cruelty of the victor? What hope or spirit do those have, in whose eyes and at whose doors the matter is conducted, from whom, with anxious minds, the uncertain outcome is awaited? Whom you can see surrounded by great distress, packing their belongings, burying some in pits, trembling, fleeing, leaving many things as prey, retreating with their wives and children into the remote parts of the forests or even hiding in the mountain caves, from where they can witness the fires, terrors, threats, and slaughters of their own with their eyes and ears. A town has been stormed, a castle captured by force, everything has been given to the soldiers as prey: what? Are these not reported in the daily conversations of the common people? How much blood is shed there, how are girls, how are matrons treated in unworthy ways, because pregnant women, nursing mothers, driven from their ancestral homes, are killed in exile by hunger or cold? The Turk is said to now harass these, now those, with his fleet.</p>
      <p>Immortal God! What lamentations, what weeping and wailing are there, when matrons are torn from the embraces of their children and husbands into perpetual slavery, when boys and girls are foully defiled and dishonored by unspeakable lusts! Who can speak of such things without tears; but how few are there, however, who place these things in their senses or hearts? These things, even though we are now placed outside the range of weapons, who does not foresee that they could someday be common to us with others, who has any mind or reason, since our iniquity, which has now reached the highest degree, leaves nothing more for divine mercy? When I think of these things, I am almost overwhelmed by the magnitude of the matter; again, when I bring to mind the salutary admonitions of Christ, our teacher, and the apostles, when I recall some things from ancient history, I begin to bear all human events moderately, and I await with a calm mind whatever outcome God will give.</p>
      <p>Some impulse, I know not what, has carried me further. Forgive me, father; you wish me to write something: I write even things known to children.</p>
      <p>But the same thing happens to me as sometimes happens to poets, who, astonished and driven by a certain frenzy, are often carried away outside themselves. What wonder, if the same impulse or some similar one has carried me away, so that, forgetting decorum, I do not blush to bring even the most common things to your ears. A fairly consistent rumor has spread among us about the death of Emperor Charles V.</p>
      <p>We wish to know the truth from you about the Duke of Württemberg. There are those who affirm that he has been expelled from his seat because of the soldiers he sent to the French: but this rumor has no certain author. What the illustrious Friedrich von Salis has obtained among the Venetians, I think you will understand from his own letters; therefore, I am brief. Farewell, venerable father in Christ, and continue to love me.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours from me.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>I have not written to Mr. Collin; if you meet him, say that we wish him well and desire him to be safe with his family. Chur, September 13, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>Before I sealed this letter, I learned that your books, which you sent to me, are on the way; therefore, do not be anxious. To the most illustrious man, distinguished in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful head of the church in Zurich, his patron and benefactor, to be greatly honored. Zürich.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
