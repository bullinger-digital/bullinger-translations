    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends a letter from Bucer [No. 939], to which the Basel [pastors] want to respond only after consulting with the Zurich and Bern clergy. The "Retraction" [defended by Bucer] has been read only superficially or not at all by Myconius, Karlstadt, Markus [Bertschi], and Wolf[gang Wissenburg]; to avoid new conflict, unnecessary harshness must be avoided in the response. Awaits Bullinger's position on the agenda of the Schmalkalden Bundestag.</p>

      <p>Greetings. What Bucer sent to us before leaving for Schmalkalden, we faithfully send to you in a copy. It will be clear what he wants. If he has anything against us, we are unaware. Therefore, although we have consulted on what should be answered, nothing has yet been decided until we have heard from you and the Bernese. I have seen the Retraction rather than read it; neither the inclination nor the leisure has been available to examine it more diligently. Likewise, Karlstadt has neither seen nor read it. The same goes for Markus. Wolfgang says he has read through it, but only paid attention to those things that specifically pertain to the Eucharist, and those seemed to him to be the same as what Bucer has already proposed to us several times. We now see the man is agitated; therefore, how to respond seems to require careful consideration, not so much for his sake as for God's and the church's, to prevent new disputes from arising to the scandal of the gospel. There will be no charity in us unless we act in such a way. Therefore, let it be our concern to respond in such a way that, if any sin has occurred, it is not attributed to our harshness. Let us set the light of faith before us, and we will easily resolve everything with him.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I am awaiting a response on the articles of the Schmalkalden assembly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Bullinger, and pray to God for me.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, February 3, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his esteemed lord and brother in Christ.</p>
