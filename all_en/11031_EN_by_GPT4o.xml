    <p xml:id="regest1">That his suspicion against Bucer was justified has been confirmed not only by the letters from Bullinger, Leo [Jud], Vadian [No. 981], and [Benedikt] Euander, but also by the oral report of the mayor of Kempten; nevertheless, the people of Bern continue to hope for an agreement [with Luther]. Megander wants to inquire further from a participant of the Schmalkaldic League from Ulm as soon as he returns from the Lyon fair. He has received everything through [Sulpitius Haller] and also received a report from [Johannes] Zwick; he appreciates the prompt notification and asks to greet Vadian and Zwick. Sebastian [Meyer] recently refuses to teach correctly about the sacraments and has defended himself with harsh words; [Peter] Kunz supports him. Megander would like to return [to Zurich] and asks to be provided with a new residence; [Hans Rudolf] Lavater will report on the exchange of the boys. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Not only from your letters, those of Leo, Vadian, and Euander sent to me, but also from the oral report of the mayor of Kempten, we have clearly understood Bucer's deceit, my dearest Bullinger. Among other things, he told us that Bucer has hindered the matter of concord more than he has promoted it, no matter how much he has run back and forth. We have always suspected what kind of man he is. The Lord willed that we too should not be swayed by his flattering promises made to us, as some very perceptive brothers have been. As for concord, we hope, as you do, for the most desired outcome, unless what we have heard from the aforementioned mayor is not true. He had with him a representative from Ulm, who acted as a delegate at the Schmalkaldic League, whom I could not speak to about this matter due to his business with the merchants and traders of our city; but I will meet him when he returns from the Lyon fair and will inquire about all matters, especially those concerning us, and will investigate the whole affair from him.</p>
      <p>We have received all your letters sent by the prefect of Lenzburg. Zwick, who by chance received the message, also made us certain of the whole matter. We owe much to you, Leo, and indeed to all the other dearest brothers, for your constant desire to inform and make us aware of all things. Through Christ, I pray and ask that you do not hesitate to continue doing the same in the future. We also wish Vadian and Zwick to be greeted in our name and kept safe through your next letter to them.</p>
      <p>We have a great and not at all ordinary dispute and controversy with Sebastian, given by the people of Strasbourg. He has openly declared that he will not preach to our church purely about the sacraments, which he has concealed from both us and our church until now. Today, however, when questioned about matters concerning this, he revealed the affair with such indignation, anger, and such a furious mind that words cannot describe it. Therefore, I see that it is over for our church. Kunz somewhat supports him. What would you do, my Bullinger? I intend to return home, but in the meantime, I will await your advice. Lavater will report in person about the exchange of the boys. Please ensure that another residence is prepared for me.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest Bullinger, with greetings to Theodor, Bellicanus, Beatus, Binder, and all the others.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 11, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your entirely devoted C. Megander.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man H. Bullinger, the most vigilant minister of the church of Zurich, his dearest friend and brother.</p>
