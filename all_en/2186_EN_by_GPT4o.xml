      <p>Greetings, most illustrious man. The governor of this city has diligently investigated about that Blessed one of yours and finally sent me this note, which you will see here; consider it kindly, if I could not do so earlier. I am sending these to Lindau, from where they will be sent to you. Everything here is fine, except that we are freezing too much. May God make His sun, that other one, rise over us, which will warm us from within.</p>
      <p>When I have obtained certain news, I will send to you some manuscripts, which I know you will gladly see, Heinrich Bullinger. The assemblies will not take place. The Queen of England has renounced the title, which she initially used as the first head after Christ of the kingdom of England, and by public authority has completely restored the sacraments of the antichrist. We believe the Emperor will soon return to his Spain and Albert has again emerged from hiding against the priests. Farewell and pray for me with the whole family, school, and church. Someone in the public school, during the promotion of 13 masters, said he was promoting them by the authority of the pope; I publicly protested that it was not proper; then that indignation and zeal forced from me these verses, which I sent to a fervent man along with many men of that ilk.</p>
      <p>When the Tiberine beast was unknown to us, It founded a false school in religion;</p>
      <p>After it beheld the light of Christ rising, It sent that monster completely into exile.</p>
      <p>But why do you recall it, why do you not allow the pestiferous beast to dwell in its lairs and dens in Rome?</p>
      <p>Tübingen, 11 February 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
