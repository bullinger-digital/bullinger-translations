      <p>Jesus Christ be with us, God.</p>
      <p>Many greetings in Christ Jesus with the utmost gratitude for your perpetual paternal kindness and benevolence towards me.</p>
      <p>And although you have often provided me with many very pleasing things, nothing could ever have happened to me more desirable or more pleasing than what I have finally found through your advice and your letters, where my fellow countrymen and dearest brothers in Christ, who have been exiled from their homeland for the free and sincere profession of Christ, are kindly and willingly received for the same profession. For Lord Haller, having seen your letters, advocated our cause first among many Bernese senators individually and separately, and finally before the entire assembly in the senate itself, so that today we have been granted the freedom to reside throughout the entire Bernese dominion. And Lord Haller orders, or rather advises, that after exploring many places, we return to Bern to indicate which place in their dominion pleases us the most, so that we may receive special letters of recommendation from the Bernese lords to the prefect and inhabitants of that place. Finally, regarding the free use of the word of God and the sacraments, and concerning the making of English cloths, since mention had been made of them, the Bernese seemed to frankly admit that these are the kind of things they would wish us to practice among them, let alone any difficulty in obtaining these from them. Therefore, I am expecting today letters from the lords of that city generally to all who are in their dominion, and having received them, I have decided to set out tomorrow to the English who are in Basel, so that they may still linger on the journey towards Basel and explore the Bernese regions, so that the most suitable place may be found and prepared. Therefore, I beseech and implore you in Christ, that, as you have done so far, you may always continue (whenever God gives the opportunity) to abundantly pour out paternal kindness upon me.</p>
      <p>I wished to have settled under your wings in the dominion of Zurich with my people, if it could have been done; but it will not be what I want, but what our heavenly Father wants; to Him all honor and glory, to us mercy and salvation in Christ Jesus!</p>
      <p>I beseech you, do not disdain if I ask you to greet your wife as my mother and all the rest of your family as most dear to me with domestic love in Christ. I do not so much ask as wish and hope that you will always want to admonish me of those things which you know pertain to the glory of God and to my and my people's consolation and edification in Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, 12th of May.</p>
      <p>Let us pray for each other.</p>
      <p>Your faithful son in Christ, Thomas Lever.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed father and most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant shepherd of Christ's church.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
