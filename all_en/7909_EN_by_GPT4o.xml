      <p>Greetings. Regarding our baths and other matters that concern us, I write nothing to you, my father, since our Heinrich is a living letter. However, my Johannes, who will also write to you, wanted me to write to you about matters concerning him. He was previously called by the people of Morbio with common votes to be the minister of their church; but at that time he excused himself, as I think you know. Now again he is called by the public synod to the same office and asks me to advise him on what should be done. I am completely at a loss and thought it best to write to you about what has been debated on both sides; whatever you judge, we will comply with.</p>
      <p>First of all, the public utility of the church, which we all ought to strive for, seems to almost drag him by the hand to accept the calling; for since he is a Rhaetian born of a good family and has the Salis, Cornio, and several other families connected to him by kinship and affinity, he will have more authority in this place than any other minister. Furthermore, since a printing press has been established in Morbio, it will be useful to have a minister there who is free from new and curious doctrines, who will diligently review Italian books to be printed, lest something unsound be published. Lastly, there is great hope that if this church has a minister of some authority who can advocate in the Rhaetian assemblies without an interpreter, the monks will be expelled and a Christian school will be established in that place; how much benefit this will bring not only to Rhaetia but also to neighboring Italy, you can easily see.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the following objections arise: first, the calling by which he is bound to the children entrusted to his faith, which, however, being private, will be said to be subordinate to the public.</p>
      <p>Secondly, many dangers are presented in this calling, the stipend is small; but dangers must be overcome with a brave spirit, and a Rhaetian will have more stipend there than any foreigner, and a minister should not look to the stipend, but to the utility of the church. Thirdly, he excuses himself by saying that he has not practiced the Italian language for a long time, and thus cannot preach in Italian. But conversely, this excuse seems to be attributed to modesty, and since he began to preach in Italian in their consistory in Geneva, with the exercise of one or two months, he will easily make the use of the Italian language familiar to himself again. These and many other things have been debated by us on both sides, which we submit to your judgment.</p>
      <p>I do not at all advise him to accept the position, even for my own sake; for I would rather have him as a teacher of the children than anyone else; again, I do not dare to strongly dissuade him, lest I inadvertently harm the interests of the church, which I would least want; therefore, I submit my opinion to yours. Farewell, my father. From Girenbad, June 22.</p>
      <p>Josias Simler.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant bishop of the ZÃ¼rich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable father.</p>
