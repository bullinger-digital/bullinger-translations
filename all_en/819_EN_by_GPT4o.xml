      <p>S. First of all, brother Bullinger, I give you the most ample thanks for the booklets sent to me, one of which is very cunning and not very suitable for teaching, while the other is so learned and pious that it could even persuade the Pope himself, provided his mind were somewhat prepared to return to himself. Clearly, Mr. Vergerio is worthy, whom we are convinced will publish even greater and more learned works. An Italian composed a pasquinade in vernacular verses, in which he listed the names of all the cardinals in Rome, enumerating the reasons in order why none could rightfully be elected Pope. He admits that Reginald Pole was elected by frequent votes, but says he was rejected for the sole reason that he is a Lutheran. One of our people, who returned from there in those days, said he had read that booklet, but could not obtain a copy. It is known that the French party, with Cardinal Ferrara's support, is very powerful, and I think someone from the Italians, perhaps the Florentines, will be elected, who will sincerely favor them; for the power of the Emperor is suspected not only by the college but also by some of the highest magistrates of Italy, and it has been deliberated by a few there to remove the Spaniards entirely from Italy.</p>
      <p>A German army will be assembled shortly, and there are more than a few scattered troops of cavalry and infantry in the region of WÃ¼rttemberg, and it is not clear where this war will be directed. Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria has advised all his mercenaries to be ready, so that they are prepared whenever they are called upon. Many whisper that a war is coming, the likes of which have not been experienced for many years. May the Lord grant that the unjust and impious attempts of the tyrants lack success and are afflicted with deserved punishments. - I am very glad that you have taken my silence with some displeasure until now; for I understand not only how much you love me, but also how welcome my letters are to you, however rough and uncultivated they may be. But I received with great sorrow that you continue to be pressed by the suspicion that, contrary to expectation, certain things happened in the recent litigation of our senate against Antronius, which should rightfully be attributed to either you or the most honorable consul Lavater. Why do these things come to your mind, my Bullinger? When I immediately sent letters full of faith and truth about the gratitude, indeed the joy, not only mine, which is still very great, but of the entire senate and our whole city, as soon as the dispute was settled, and I almost composed a panegyric about the singular faith and now immortal goodwill among our people? I solemnly swear to you by the immortal God, that I, the senate, the people, the whole city are grateful and content and have nothing to complain about regarding any of the envoys (for we have experienced their faithfulness). The only thing desired by some was that certain things were rendered a little more clearly by the scribe than they were written by his pen, and we no longer doubt that he rendered everything in the way it was concluded and decreed by the envoys.</p>
      <p>For it would have been most suspicious if it had been pronounced everywhere in our favor. We only doubted about the increase of the field and forest money (where necessary), that the land scribe should have omitted some words; but since the dear and wise, faithful man Lavater reminded and informed us of the same, we are satisfied with everything; for the increase of the levies would have affected our own citizens the most, who let the largest sums of linen be bleached and fulled, and the people of the hospital give little more than the tithing penny; therefore, in this case, we have little error and no displeasure, but are satisfied with everything. And I tell you that, in my opinion, I would not take twenty thousand guilders for the outcome of this legal matter on behalf of my lords, than that it has turned out as it has and, thank God, has proceeded with the maintenance of what is fair and right. Antronius's trifles, we have obtained the very grains and fat for the evidence of our right and will have eternal thanks to the city of Zurich and to you, for sending us that incomparable man, however burdened with the trouble of body and health, whose prudence and foresight have resolved everything most happily; which indeed, if, as I hope, I visit you this year, I will narrate much more abundantly in person than I can depict with the pen. Therefore, most beloved of all men, I beg and beseech you to cast far from your mind this opinion conceived about us and to send it back to the ravens, and not to be reluctant to listen to me, who tell you the truth before our judge God; but also to persuade yourself about me, that even if I remain silent for this whole year, I will be no less of a candid mind and with the integrity of holy friendship towards you and yours and immovable.</p>
      <p>I write very rarely even to my closest friends and only write when suitable topics are presented. For business and even old age delay me, so that I am less civil in frequent writing; but in the meantime, I am of the mind that nothing delights me more than the letters of learned men. I have now been elected to the mayor's office of our city for the tenth time at Christmas and do not remember ever being burdened with more tasks before, solely for the sake of our citizenship, that this (if God wills) will be the last time.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you to consider our silence kindly. Farewell. St. Gallen, January 27, 1550.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most ample city of Zurich, my uniquely esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
