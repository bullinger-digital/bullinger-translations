      <p> Greetings. It was not necessary, my father, to trouble you with this inconvenience of sending your letters to the English through me; but I recognize it as a sign of paternal love and therefore I was pleased to read them. I wrote almost the same to Parkhurst, Jewel, and Pilkington; I also wrote to Grindal on behalf of my relative Diethelm Blarer, who once lived with him. </p>
      <p> You will learn what happened in Montbéliard from Tossanus' letters, which I am sending. Jacob Andreae is worthy of the esteem in which the people of Basel hold him. Who would doubt that he traveled there on Sulcer's advice to strengthen the Lutherans with false promises or even to confront those inclined towards Zwinglianism with fictitious threats? It is surprising that we did not crush that giant with one foot when he passed through us. But he is preparing a new war, as Tossanus writes, in which he will make himself more ridiculous than ever before. But what else would those do who want to restore the papacy and have a conflict only with the Roman Antichrist? I am returning your letters, and I will ensure mine are delivered to Froschauer on Tuesday, if God wills it. </p>
      <p> I hope to return home by Friday, unless the condition of my wife and little daughter dictates otherwise. </p>
      <p> Greet the whole household. Farewell, my esteemed father. Urdorf, August 26, 1571. </p>
      <p> Your most observant Rudolf Gwalther. </p>
      <p> To the distinguished minister of the Church of Jesus Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed relative and father. </p>
      <p> Zürich. </p>
