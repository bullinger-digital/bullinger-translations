    <p xml:id="regest1">After it was noticed in Zurich and elsewhere that the use of monastic properties for the education of the youth is advantageous and well-received, the authorities of [Chur] have also been financing the education of the [Grisons] boys in this way for three years now. As they are satisfied with the results, the authorities hope to continue in this manner in the future.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Among the scholarship recipients was also the bearer of the present letter, Paulus Blasius, the son of Johannes, the pastor at the Regulakirche in Chur. When Paulus' scholarship expired, another [...] took his place. Since Paulus successfully passed the examination, and so that the costs incurred so far are not in vain, the [Chur schoolmasters] advised the father to send his son to Zurich to continue his education. Bullinger and his colleagues are to receive the talented boy kindly. The father will personally speak with the people in Zurich.</p>

      <p>Venerable, well-learned, pious and honorable, dear sirs, may our friendly and willing service, along with all that we honor, love, and possess, be prepared for you in advance.</p>

      <p>Kind, dear sirs, after our lords and superiors have also noticed a good reception from you and other honorable cities, and especially regarding the monastic properties, which are henceforth intended to be used for the education and instruction of the youth in the good arts of languages, and thus for three years now, several young boys from our lands have been appointed, tested, and maintained to learn with the designated stipend, which has been pleasing and agreeable to us so far, and we are inclined to continue this, God grant grace.</p>
      <p>Among these scholarship recipients was also one, Paulus Blasius, the bearer of this letter, the worthy and well-learned Johannes Blasius, pastor and leader in the word of the Lord of the church of Saint Regula in Chur, an honorable son, whom we have now and several times diligently examined according to his learning and found according to the state of his youth in learning, which pleases us and we have special good hope in him. Since, however, the years of his promised stipend have been completed and another has been accepted in his place, we have advised this boy's dear and honorable father, so that the costs incurred on his son so far are not in vain, that he, to please us, also for his and his son's own honor and benefit (as we have also considered his right), will allow his named son to continue in the good arts and languages, to learn, and to send him further, especially with our advice to your city and schools, to present himself to you, our kind lords, first of all. So we earnestly and diligently ask you to not only support this young man for our sake (as we have special good trust in you) or for his father's sake (who is then very agreeable to us, and who has made great efforts and progress in establishing and promoting these schools), but especially for this boy's aptitude, to support him, be helpful to him, have him recommended, and, as much as possible, receive him in a friendly, willing, and gracious manner and show yourselves to him, as his father will also speak with you himself. This stands for us, as your special good friend, entirely in a serviceable and gracious manner, in the same and more towards you and yours.</p>
      <p>Dated in Chur and conclusively sealed with the common seal of the God's house in Chur, on the 24th day of April of the year 1546.</p>
      <p>Your willing appointed administrators, commissioners, and special overseers of the schools in Chur, Lutzi Haym, mayor of Chur, Johannes Travers, bailiff of Zutz, Wilhelm Mugkli, bailiff of Trimmis, Johannes Comander, pastor at the church of Saint Martin, Johannes Br√ºning, former city scribe of Chur.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned, pious and honorable N., appointed overseers and schoolmasters of the schools in Zurich, our kind, especially dear lords and good friends.</p>
