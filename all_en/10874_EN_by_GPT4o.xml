    <p xml:id="regest1">[Konrad] Geßner recently left without a letter, as he can hardly write due to his concern about the outcome of the Concord negotiations; if one accepts what the Lutherans, especially [Johannes] Brenz or the [Württemberg] church order, teach about the significance of the [sacramental] elements, one ultimately sacrifices the Gospel. In the conflict between Solothurn and the expelled [Protestants], the opponents have prevailed due to the lukewarmness of the arbitrators. Contrary to the accusation of the Bernese, the people of Basel have not taken a position on the [Four Cities] Confession but want to await the results of the [Eisenach or Wittenberg] Convention. Fears that the support Schaffhausen and Bern are granting to the French King [Francis I] in the war against Emperor [Charles V] benefits the enemies of the Gospel. New defenders of Anabaptism want to re-establish their doctrine based on a Zurich writing, possibly Bullinger's ["On the Shameless Misdeeds of the Anabaptists"], and hope to find an audience, if not in the Confederation and Basel, then at least in Strasbourg; Myconius wants to suppress their still secret activities for the time being. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I have become so unfit for writing since this matter of concord began to be discussed that I recently let Geßner leave without a letter to you. I fear something may happen that would make it better never to have attempted the matter. For I see the Lutherans are in this, as if there is a power in the elements that contributes somewhat to salvation. They say Brenz never fails to emphasize this, and indeed more crudely. The Württembergers testify the same in their church order, where they require the number of persons approaching the Lord's table, so that the bread may be adapted accordingly, and they take care that nothing remains of the wine in the chalice. They teach in necessity how an infant should be baptized by a midwife. If we allow these things, who will henceforth resist the papists, indeed who will not refute everything we have held about such matters until now? Or will it then be possible for the truth of the Gospel to remain pure? Indeed, for the appearance of the Gospel to remain? Let them invoke, summon, urge a council and hope for something sound and whole for the glory of God. There is one thing that consoles me in my misery, that God knows His own. We are proud of the gifts of God, which have been so abundantly poured out in our time upon men, and indeed we abuse them, which is why it is no wonder if everything is full of dissensions and errors. But what end will there be? We will feel it with the greatest loss, not so much ours as that of all of us.</p>
      <p>Regarding the pact or reconciliation of the people of Solothurn with the exiles, I cannot speak, not indeed because of the reconciliation, but because of the lukewarmness of the arbitrators in the Lord and the truth of justice, by which matter the enemies have again been given an occasion for obstinacy. You will see, unless the Lord spares, we will be vomited out sometime. There has been nothing so far for the enemy by which he has conquered us, the cultivators and defenders of the truth, except obstinacy. We have lacked nothing of heavenly goods except constancy in the truth. What do you think, therefore, will happen in the future to men so lukewarm?</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Bernese accuse us of having agreed against the unanimous counsel of our assembly to the confession of the people of Strasbourg. But they accuse wrongly. For that is as far from the truth as the knowledge of that confession. For no one offered the book either to me or to the brothers or to Grynaeus. Finally, by error, it came into my hands. But even then nothing was done with us about that matter. Hence it happened that we neither wrote a single word to the people of Strasbourg nor to the assembly nor to Luther, nor did we agree nor disagree. We await what they have done, and what seems best, we will follow. So far, everything remains intact for us. I have no good hope from the assembly. Would that I am mistaken!</p>
      <p>Moreover, I am exceedingly distressed about the war, especially after I hear that we are also involved. For they say the people of Schaffhausen have granted soldiers and these have already flown out. They judge the same will happen among the Bernese. The cause put forward is the impious mind of the emperor and hostile to the Bernese. I hear. But what then? Fortune still hangs in the balance. It is not known where it will incline. But if, however, with our accession the Frenchman will be victorious, will not then those things return which the Gospel had cast out? In this confusion, such as I have not seen, unless I had God as a comforter, I would collapse.</p>
      <p>Besides all these things, new defenders of Anabaptism arise. They have found a booklet of the people of Zurich, in which they think the strongest arguments are fought, which nevertheless are judged by them to be so frivolous that they can be easily overcome, but new foundations are laid, which no one can move from their place except by lying. I have not yet been able to know which booklet is meant, except that someone thought it was the one you published long ago; for recently, there is none that has been published. I can divine nothing indeed. I know this, that they have been writing for two months now. They say they do not hope that they can satisfy their plan among the Swiss or in Basel, because we are more crude and fierce in fighting, but among the people of Strasbourg; for they are more gentle and listen to the speaking spirit in the servants of God. Here indeed there is no doubt that if they are heard, they will be victorious. They also say there is someone who preaches this new (as they call it) doctrine in Strasbourg, and already disciples are prepared from the common people. These things are still secret, although many things are known to us, even up to the very persons; yet I did not want you to be unaware. Indeed, I will see diligently that the matter is either suffocated in the ashes or, once made public, immediately extinguished.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with yours and Utinger, and do not cease to love me, I beg, and to visit me more often with letters.</p>
      <p>Basel, the second of June in the year 36.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned brother in the Lord, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
