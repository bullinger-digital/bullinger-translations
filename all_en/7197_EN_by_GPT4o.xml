      <p>Lord Jesus, our only savior, bless you, most illustrious prince, and keep you from all evil!</p>
      <p>Not so many months ago I wrote to you, most illustrious prince, and at the same time sent a printed and bound copy of the confession of faith and doctrine of the Swiss churches, and I hope your highness has received all of it. All the churches of France, England, Scotland, and other nations have subscribed to our confession. I hope that your piety will not disapprove of it, especially in those matters about which I now hear there are great disputes in Poland and especially in Lithuania, concerning the mystery, I say, of the Trinity and the true divinity of the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ. Our confession contains what is necessary to believe about these matters. For what purpose is it that many investigate more and higher things than sincere religion admits? Indeed, as God himself attested to Moses, no one will see God and live. When we finally depart from this life and our souls are deemed worthy to behold God, and our bodies are glorified, then we will see God, as the scripture testifies, as he is. While we live in this life, as through a cloud, as Paul suggests, we perceive those sacred mysteries according to our measure, and the prophets and apostles have handed them down with the simplicity and purity that it is necessary to believe, so that no one can complain of obscurity, and those who inquire more curiously deserve to be overwhelmed by glory and finally not know what they believe, which today happens to more curious investigators than is beneficial. What is simpler than what the prophetic and apostolic scripture hands down, that there is one God, not two or three or more gods? Yet this one true God is called Jehovah, not only the Father, but the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and yet, because we hear three, we do not therefore believe there are three gods; for the scripture, to which we must adhere with sincere faith, clearly says both three and one. For John says: "And these three are one," and the Son himself says: "I and the Father are one, and because we are," he says, "not I am." In that unity, the property of each person is also clearly asserted; for the Father sends the Son, but the Son is sent, and the Spirit proceeds from both. What is clearer than that the Father is not the Son nor is the Son the Father? For the Father was not incarnate and suffered for us, but the Son. Meanwhile, that divine essence and unique, indivisible, and impartible nature, the Son is not divided, torn away, or something different from the Father, since... in John 5 it is said that the Son is co-equal with the Father, and he also says to the disciples: "You believe in God, believe also in me. Philip, he who sees me sees the Father." And again: "That all may honor the Son as they honor the Father; he who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him." What is simpler than this Catholic truth? Namely, that there is one God in essence, three in persons; for thus the Latin church has spoken since the very times of the apostles, and these expressions have been taken from the faith itself and the rule of faith, the holy scripture, so that those who... these words should not be heard. Again, what is more tortuous and dangerous, and more curious than to want to investigate higher things and about these divine mysteries, about which scripture speaks no differently and no more, to introduce other expressions and new speculations, once used by heretics, but meanwhile condemned in the doctrine about these matters? Yet many such people wander today, who disturb the churches and subvert the sincere faith of many. From these, I pray, most merciful prince, guard yourself as from a deadly plague; do not, I pray, do not listen to such innovators; for they wound consciences when heard, inject various scruples into minds, and lead away from true simplicity and tranquility, whence arise wounds of the soul, fears, doubts, struggles... such corruption that one does not know where to turn or what to believe, and is perpetually vexed by the mockeries of Satan. Therefore, guard yourself, guard yourself, most excellent prince. I love your piety from the innermost depths of my heart and fear, knowing that those fanatical men roam all corners, lest they also aspire to harm your mind, which is still well aware and tranquil, although I am again consoled by that ingenuousness and singular candor of your highness, with which I have learned you are adorned by the grace of God, with not a few nor contemptible arguments at the time when you lived with us in Zürich. I therefore pray to the Lord to keep your piety in the true and simple confession of the orthodox faith, in which alone is certain salvation, and to preserve you from all evil and especially from the corruption and torture of conscience and the imposture of those men. I further ask your humanity, most merciful prince, to consider these my letters, written, as God knows, from sincere charity and my exceptional devotion towards your highness, and to hold me in commendation, who am otherwise most ready to serve your highness most willingly and faithfully.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, most excellent prince.</p>
      <p>Zürich, August 15, in the year of our Lord 1567.</p>
      <p>May all who were with your highness in Zürich be safe in the Lord. Dr. Josias Simler is struggling with very high fevers, Dr. Johannes Wolf is bathing in Baden; both send their most dutiful greetings to your humanity; others also greet you... (brothers in Christ?) and fellow ministers, Dr. Gwalther, Lavater, Haller, Wick, Zwingli, etc.</p>
