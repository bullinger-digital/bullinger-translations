      <p>To the glory and peace from Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>From the time we departed from Zürich, dearest father, we arrived in the homeland of Johannes Herter, where we were kindly received and stayed until Wednesday. From there, we set out together to Frauenfeld and spent the night there. Then, early in the morning, we proceeded further and arrived in a certain village located in the dominion of the Toggenburgers, as they call it. From there, on Friday, we reached Appenzell, which we were very eager to see, where indeed we were treated with great honors by many who are very favorable to our religion. Therefore, the following day, after having lunch, we made our way to St. Gallen, as we had planned, and there we were retained by many good friends and received with the greatest honors not only by the prudent magistrate of St. Gallen, who honored us with six horses designated for this purpose, but almost all the church leaders and schoolmasters dined with us in the public inn where we stayed, for our sake. After lunch, when we had bid farewell to everyone and thanked them for the honor shown, I then wrote this letter to you, and then we planned to proceed to Bischofszell, then to Constance and Lindau, and then, as soon as we can, to return home. Therefore, my father, I ask and beseech you not to be angry with me for staying so long among foreigners; for I am making an effort to conduct myself moderately and modestly among everyone. If I obtain this from you (as I do not doubt), I promise that I will make up for the time spent with exceptional diligence and study. The rest, as it happened, you will learn more certainly in my presence. Farewell. Please give my warmest regards to my dearest mother, brother, sisters, and the maid. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>Hans Rudolf Bullinger, your dearest son.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, beloved father.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
