    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas already had the horse ready to set off for Zurich early tomorrow morning when some old friends from Antwerp arrived. Now he must stay in Basel. How difficult it is for him to forgo the reunion with the people of Zurich at the [Pentecost] festival [May 29] and the long-awaited participation in the Zurich church service! But the friends, whom he has not seen for a long time, want to discuss something important with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Hopefully, a good opportunity will soon arise to make up for what he is now missing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In the meantime, he wishes the Zurich church a beautiful Pentecost festival and sends greetings to all the pastors. He will be with them in spirit.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] With the next messenger, he will also send a letter to Theodor Bibliander. He has not written to him for longer than he would like, in order not to interrupt his important work.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I had a horse ready to set off for Zurich at the break of dawn tomorrow. However, some old friends from Antwerp arrived today, and they compel me to stay here, even though I am reluctant. It is truly bitter for me to miss the pleasure I expected to have with you during this festival, and not to see, as I hoped, the ceremonies of your church, is indeed very distressing for me. But I had to give some time to friends I have not seen for a long time, who also wanted to discuss a matter of no small importance with me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Even though this opportunity, which I have always longed for, seems to have slipped from my hands, I hope that soon I will have another chance to visit you; at which time I will make up for what I am now reluctantly missing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In the meantime, I wish your church all happiness and success, and please convey my greetings to all the brothers by name and with due respect. During this Pentecost festival, I will be present with you in spirit, even if I cannot be there in body.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I will write to Master Theodor Bibliander with the next messenger, which I cannot do now due to lack of time. I have refrained from this duty of writing longer than I would have liked, so as not to inopportunely interrupt a man occupied with more serious studies with my trivial letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Greet Master John Hooper, his wife, and the other ministers of Christ. Farewell. May 26, 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours, F. Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Zurich church.</p>
