    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to a lack of messengers and news, he is only now responding to Bullinger's two letters; what Bullinger wrote about the war filled not so much him as other brothers with joy; for they are hosting a refugee [...] from Solothurn, a very wealthy man, who promoted such rumors [in favor] of his king [Francis I] and spread them among the [people of Biel]; Frey did not know this and read the letters [received from Bullinger] in the presence of Michael [Schlatter], Jakob [Würben], and others [...]; after the reading, he mocked a confidant [...] because of the rumor [he believed], whereupon the Solothurner, the originator of the rumor [in Biel], silently left; but the mocked one said that God's providence had caused this and that he would now stop spreading such trivialities; in this way, Frey, through Bullinger's letters, filled the hearts of some with joy and shamed others. Together with the second letter [from Bullinger] and shortly after the unexpected departure of Michael Schlatter to [the people of Zurich], he received the writing [“Hope of the Believers”] taken from [Bullinger's Matthew] commentary and [translated into German]; the others, to whom the copies [sent by Bullinger] were distributed, also express their thanks with this letter. [Frey] has nothing else new to report, unless Bullinger does not yet know what is happening with the neighbors [in Bern?].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have already received two letters from you, most esteemed father, and I have not yet responded to you, because either there was no messenger or I lacked the opportunity to write. First of all, what you wrote to me concerning the matters of war brought great joy not only to me but also to other brothers who are thoughtful and wish for our safety. There is a certain exile from Solothurn among us, a very wealthy man, who particularly favors such rumors; he had especially spread this rumor among our people. Unaware of this, I read the received letters aloud in the presence of Michael, Jakob, and others in the presence of this man. After reading them, I mocked a confidant of mine as much as I could because of the same rumor. Thereupon, the Solothurner, the author of the spread lie among us, with his head bowed, confused and silent, gradually withdrew from us. Then the one I had mocked said, "By God's providence, this happened; this man will cease to sow such nonsense to his king in the future," etc. Thus, knowingly and willingly, I filled the hearts of the benevolent with joy, and unknowingly and by chance, I brought sorrow and confusion to the malevolent with your letters. Thanks be to God.</p>
      <p>Together with the second letter, you sent me the booklet "On the Hope of Christians" translated from your Commentaries, for which I owe you the greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>I indeed received it after the unexpected departure of our Michael to you. The others, to whom I distributed the booklets sent by you, say they will always have the greatest gratitude for you, and indeed they all are well and wish to greet you with my letters.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new, unless it is new to you what our neighbors are doing. Therefore, you will greet all yours in my name and love me, as you do. Farewell. Biel, 5th day before the calends of November, in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Antistes of the Church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
