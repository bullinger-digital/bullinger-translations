    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the sent marmots [see No. 1462]. He has sent the latest news about the Worms Religious Discussion to [Johannes] Comander, who will inform Travers [see No. 1465]. If Travers has not yet seen the [First Helvetic] Confession and its explanation, drafted in Basel, Bullinger will send him a copy. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have received your gift, most illustrious and esteemed sir, the very plump and elegant marmots, for which I give you great thanks. You indeed think us unworthy of such a gift; however, I consider it an excellent gift that you have sent. I would like to show you my gratitude through some service and will do so whenever the opportunity presents itself. What I have received from the Worms Religious Discussion, I have written to D. Comander, with the condition that he immediately sends and shares the letters with you after reading them. However, you do not respond about the confession of the Swiss churches drafted in Basel and its declaration, whether you have seen it or not. If you have not seen it and Comander has not shared it with you, let me know, and I will ensure it is copied for you. Farewell, most illustrious sir, and keep religion and good studies in your highest regard. Zurich, 18th February 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. Johannes Travers, of Zernez, his most esteemed lord.</p>
