    <p xml:id="regest1"> Since Hans Vogler [the Elder] has been found to be such a suitable reporter, Frölich was in doubt whether he should write at all. For Vogler has seen with his own eyes the war preparations, of which Frölich only hears by hearsay. [In the camp] there are ten princes, including Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, his son [Johann Friedrich II the Middle] and the Elector's brother [Johann] Ernst [of Saxony-Coburg], Landgrave Philipp of Hesse, Duke Franz of Anhalt [correctly: Franz of Brunswick-Lüneburg or Wolfgang of Anhalt], Prince Ernst of Brunswick-[Grubenhagen], another prince of Grubenhagen, and a Count of Henneberg. Frölich has forgotten other names. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> - Duke Ulrich of Württemberg is lying in Dillingen suffering from gout. Soon, however, he will follow the [Schmalkaldic] army. The Landgrave has met with him in Dillingen. [The army] is huge. Of course, one must not trust in it, but in God alone! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> - The [Schmalkaldic allies] are crossing the Rubicon today, i.e., the Lech, and setting up their camp near the small town of Rain in Bavaria, which is held by Duke [Wilhelm] of Bavaria and Emperor [Charles V]. Today or tomorrow they will attack [Rain]. The Duke would prefer to remain neutral, but he will soon have to reveal his disposition. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> - The Emperor has received considerable reinforcement from the thieving and sodomitic Italians. So far, it is not clear whether he will attack or flee. From Regensburg, he has moved to Landshut. Bullinger should, like Moses once did for Israel, pray constantly! The [war] cannot be considered serious enough, for it will bring about a change in the German Empire. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> - The princes, especially [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony and [Philipp of] Hesse, are confident. In the [Schmalkaldic] army, preachers exhort the mostly decent soldiers to piety, which greatly pleases Frölich. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> - Greetings to the mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater], the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], [Rudolf] Gwalther, and the [Zurich scholars]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> - [P.S.:] Frölich is concerned about the dispute among the Confederates. The Emperor and Pope [Paul III] are to blame. The [Protestant Confederates] should not be provoked by their Catholic [allies], but wait for the outcome of the war. </p>

      <p>S. Since such a suitable interpreter has come to me, indeed a living letter, the most distinguished man, Lord Hans Vogler from Zurich, I hesitated whether I should write to you, my most devoted brother, or rather entrust the little I write to the messenger. For he has seen with his own eyes much of what I perceive either through writings or the reports of others, especially concerning war preparations, cavalry, infantry, and fortifications. There are ten princes present: Johann Friedrich, Elector of Saxony; Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse; the Elector's son and brother Ernst; Franz, Duke of Anhalt; Prince Ernst of Brunswick; a certain prince of Grubenhagen; and also a certain Count of Henneberg. The names of the others do not occur to me now.</p>

      <p>Duke Ulrich of Württemberg is lying in Dillingen suffering from gout, but he will soon follow the army. The Landgrave has met with him in Dillingen. Indeed, the number is huge, the force is huge. Yet in all these things we trust in nothing but in the sole triumphant and strong God. The rest are only instruments and means. Today, for the first time, the Rubicon is crossed, that is, our forces cross the Lech and set up camp in Bavaria near the town of Rain, which is guarded by a strong garrison, and will be attacked by our forces today or tomorrow. For it is occupied not only by the Duke of Bavaria's soldiers but also by the Emperor's troops. The Duke of Bavaria would prefer to be neutral rather than support either side, but he will soon be forced to reveal his intentions.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Emperor is surrounded by considerable forces of Italian thieves and sodomites. Whether he will engage in battle or seek safety in flight is still unknown.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>He has left Regensburg and moved to Landshut, a city in Bavaria. Our forces have decided to meet him and go against him as soon as the opportunity arises.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I beseech and implore you, now be our Moses and pray for the liberation of Israel. The enemy is conquered not only by the sword but also by prayer. Indeed, it is a difficult matter and greater than can be expressed. For this tragedy will be followed by a certain change in the German Empire. May the Lord protect those who walk simply in His law! Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Our princes, especially the Saxon and the Hessian, are magnanimous and joyful in the Lord. Furthermore, I hear that our army is diligently admonished to piety by preachers and that the soldiers are quite tractable and pious; this greatly delights me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell and convey my greetings to the mayors, the city clerk, Gwalther, and the entire circle of the Muses. August 11, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, G. Laetus, etc.</p>
      <p>I have reluctantly heard of the disputes among your people, especially since the cause of this matter arises from the worst sedition of the Emperor and the Pope. See to it that you do not engage in conflict, but rather endure the slanders of the papists until the victory of either side becomes apparent here. Farewell, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, incomparable friend and brother.</p>
