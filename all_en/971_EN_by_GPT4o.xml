      <p>Greetings. We received your last letter along with the letters sent to you from England yesterday, dearest compater, and indeed we read them, but have not yet re-read them due to our occupations, otherwise we would have sent them back to you with this messenger.</p>
      <p>We truly give you the greatest thanks for that faithful communication. If we also have anything that might be of interest to you, we will share it in return and would write more now, if we were not so occupied with Mr. Vergerio, who is delivering these to you, that we cannot write more. You will hear from him directly what news Mr. Leoncurt, the king of France's envoy, who was here yesterday, has reported to him, and also how our lords have granted him the ability to stay in Lausanne, in case he cannot stay in Rhaetia due to dangers, and if there are any other matters; for he himself will be like a living letter to you. From Augsburg we have nothing, except that they say the Emperor and Ferdinand have not come there with as large a force as the previous rumor had spread. We will have more soon: some of our people have gone there, whom we hope will return shortly.</p>
      <p>We gave Guntio the same response as you; for besides the fact that there is no available position, it does not seem to us to be in his best interest to leave Basel, unless he is compelled by the greatest necessity, which we have not yet discovered. The plague here neither rages nor ceases; today a certain diligent student in our vicinity has died. We are concerned for Mr. Blasio and Pontasella; please, if you have learned anything certain about their fates, let us know. May the Lord protect you and all yours and also make us capable of bearing all these things, which He has kindly imposed on us. Amen. My regards to you and yours, and also to all those in Musculus' house; he has recovered again; I will write without improvement. All those to whom you sent greetings return them to you. Bern, July 26, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his lord and venerable compater.</p>
