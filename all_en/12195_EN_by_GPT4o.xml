      <p>Greetings. I will forward the letters sent to Mr. Gilbert through my brother, who will come to us next week, and I wonder why you have not written back to him, as he eagerly awaits your letters.</p>
      <p>Here is the book by Cochläus. Whether it is worthy of a response, you will see. The arrogant man will never submit to the truth, as is apparent from his writings.</p>
      <p>The followers of Bucer are very displeased with your Apology against Luther. Farewell to you and all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 27, 1545.</p>
      <p>I pray for the well-being of Mr. Theodor, an excellent man.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>You will immediately receive a barrel with letters and books.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my ever-honored teacher. Zurich.</p>
