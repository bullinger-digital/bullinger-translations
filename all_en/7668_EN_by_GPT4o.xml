      <p>Greetings. The fact that the drivers from Regensburg known to me, Mr. von Stetten, gave me your books to be sent to Regensburg, which I did as I should, both gladly and diligently, so that you will understand from Mr. Haller's letters, which I am sending, in which he will, I believe, excuse himself to you for responding after such a long interval; for he was away on a journey on behalf of the emperor, sent to the electoral princes of the Rhine. If you wish to respond to him, you can do so most conveniently at this time, when there is such a great opportunity for sending or giving; for Mr. von Stetten's servant is coming to you, I suppose, for the purpose of recalling his son, and will return to us as soon as he has completed the task given to him by his master, which I would also like you to inform Mr. Tomann, in case he also wishes to write back either to me or to the son. Regarding the French war, you have more certain information, being closer, and about the Belgian matter, you will learn from the letters of others. As for me, I have nothing to write, unless I wish to write the most uncertain things in the manner of the common people; thus everyone imagines and narrates not what has happened, but what they wish had happened and thinks it would be advantageous for them if it were believed. Therefore, farewell, and love me, and bid Mr. Simler farewell in my words, whose booklet Mr. von Stetten gave to me, as two copies were sent to him, one from you, the other from Mr. Walther. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, November 12, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Matthias Schenck.</p>
      <p>I have attached the letters with yours, and I earnestly ask that you ensure they are delivered to those to whom they are addressed, namely to Mr. Tomann, Wolf, and Betto, about whom I have written nothing of my own business, but I trust you will not be reluctant to give this effort. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed lord and friend.</p>
