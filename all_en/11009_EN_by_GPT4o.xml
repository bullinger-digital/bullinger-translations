    <p xml:id="regest1">Expresses himself only briefly on Leo [Juds] letter of admonition concerning [the planned measures against writings by] Bucer, as he has already sent a statement [No. 965]; that Bucer's actions cannot be excused by his zeal will soon become evident, yet the people of Bern do not want to undertake anything without the people of Zurich. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord, my dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>We have received Leo's friendly admonition regarding Bucer's business, about which there is no need to say much to you. For not many days ago you received our thoughts, albeit hastily through the work of a scribe, as I could not write myself due to a head cold. Leo excuses Bucer, saying he acted not with deceit, but with zeal. I do not know whether it can be called zeal to want to lead someone from the very light into the most obscure darkness, as Bucer did. If it does not seem sufficient, I beseech you, let us wait a little while until it becomes sufficient, which will undoubtedly happen soon. But we will attempt nothing without you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, with all the brothers, Theodor, Bellicanus, and Beatus, safe.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 11, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your entirely, Megander.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, professing Christ in Zurich, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
