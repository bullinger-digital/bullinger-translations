      <p>Grace and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>Even if I now lack a subject to write to you about, most revered Lord and teacher, I do not lack the spirit that wishes you all the best. Not long ago, Herr Froschauer was with us, who saw the beginnings of our Belgian colony, and he promised to convey my many greetings to you. But our excellent Paul Knibbius, who stayed with us for two days, will be able to explain to you more fully and accurately the state of our affairs. Nevertheless, I wanted to burden him with this letter, so that you might be more certain that we never forget you, for whom we pray to God the Father, that He may keep you safe for His Church for a long time. As for the state of German affairs, I do not doubt that you have already learned from the letters of others. A certain Grunpach recently captured Herbsheim by cunning rather than by arms, which forced the Bishop to accept the conditions of peace as dictated by Grunpach. Otherwise, almost everything is quiet. Three princes, namely the Duke of Württemberg, the Count Palatine of Zweibrücken, and the Margrave, seem to be plotting something against our excellent Prince, having sent a foolish critique against his Catechism, to which I believe you and some others have responded and satisfied in such a way that I hope Brentius and his Schmedelin will be like the frogs of Seriphus. Our Prince also wanted to understand what I thought of the Censors' writing, and so while I offered my opinion to the Councilors, I was also ordered to read through the judgments of others, among which yours (I speak sincerely and from the heart) rightly holds the first place. Some superintendents have also not unsuccessfully refuted that Censure, and so six different refutations of the censure have been sent to each of the Princes, which if they read, they will surely discover how far off and everywhere mistaken the ubiquitous Brentius is. I think you saw at the last spring fair the bitter writing of the Frankfurt preachers against foreigners, whom they hatefully call Welsch (foreigners), to which I briefly responded in German at the request of friends, according to my ability, and I send you a copy of my response as a token of our friendship, which I earnestly pray may be pleasing to you. If anything has been said less skillfully or piously, I ask you to kindly and freely admonish me. You will learn the rest from our Paul. Farewell, most excellent man, and continue to love your Dathenus as you have begun. Hastily from Frankenthal, October 23, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly,</p>
      <p>Petrus Dathenus.</p>
      <p>Please forgive the scribbles, I barely had time to reread. I wish to respectfully and dutifully commend myself to Herren Walter, Lavater, Zwingli the Younger, and Zimmler, whom I revere and embrace in Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his Lord and Teacher, to be honored with perpetual faith and reverence. In Zurich.</p>
