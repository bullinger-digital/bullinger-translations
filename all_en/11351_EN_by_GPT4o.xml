    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter from July 30 on September 6; is happy that he was granted [a longer stay] and promises to comply with his request. Agrees with his advice regarding [the "Onomastikon" by] Pollux; intends to limit himself to a modest translation. Answers his question about [Béat] Comte, who is often absent as a doctor, which is why Gwalther is now studying as a student of Claude Chanisieu in Morges, where he is also improving his French skills. Martin Peyer shares news from Wittenberg about the English church, which are taken from a letter by [Alexander] Alesius to Philipp [Melanchthon]; he reports on the [Six] Articles, the reactions of Latimer, [Shaxton], Crome, Taylor, and Cranmer, as well as the escape of Alesius. Gwalther is concerned about Nicholas [Partridge] and [Nicholas] Eliott. There are rumors about a marriage between the Emperor and the English Princess Mary, troop gatherings in France, an English attack on Picardy, and a marriage between the Infanta [Maria] and [Charles of Orléans]; Gwalther feels disappointed in his hopes for [Henry VIII.], but is comforted by the constancy of God's word. In Morges, the priests had to publicly account for their faith on August 31; one of them was expelled, while the others received two weeks to reconsider; now the people are increasingly listening to the word of God. In France, King [Francis I.] has authorized subordinate judges to pass death sentences and has removed any possibility of appeal for the accused. Gwalther wishes to continue his French studies and reminds of his request for money for the winter. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, most kind father, written on July 30, on September 6; I can hardly describe the hope and fear with which I received it, but upon reading it, it brought incredible joy. Know that I have never been as fearful as I am now, yet relying on your kindness, I have achieved what I hoped for. I will ensure that what you request with paternal affection is also fulfilled by me with filial love, and I will see to it that I can compensate for this error.</p>
      <p>I am grateful for your advice regarding Pollux, and indeed, I have thought about it myself more than once. The author is not so much obscure in himself as he is corrupted by the injuries of time, and while many have labored in vain to restore him, my work of interpretation, however modest, will more easily earn pardon.</p>
      <p>Since it is nothing more than a dictionary, I strive to render word for word, so that even children with moderate knowledge of Greek can understand it.</p>
      <p>You are unaware of who the Count is, whom you should know is now a colleague of Viret in the ministry of the word, a learned man and, as far as can be judged from the outside, very devoted to the name of Zurich. However, since he is also frequently occupied with medical practice abroad rather than at home, it was hardly convenient to live with him, and (as I also wrote before) I am staying in Morges, a very short distance from Lausanne, with Claude Chanisieu, the schoolmaster of that place, whose learning is highly esteemed by Grynaeus and all the learned men of Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>We engage daily in disputations drawn from the places of scripture, and then also in frequent and fruitful reading. Another noble Frenchman lives with him, who once acted as an advocate in the royal court, and now, due to his knowledge of the gospel, lives as an exile among us. He is always present in the instruction of the French language (of which he is a most learned orator), which I am learning quite successfully and without great loss of time.</p>
      <p>The news, which seems partly lamentable and partly to be pursued with joy, is as follows:</p>
      <p>In recent days, I received letters from Martin Peyer from Wittenberg, who describes the state of the English church in these words, taken from a letter sent by Alesius the Englishman to Philipp [Melanchthon] (for he is a companion of Philipp): The King of England commands under penalty of death these five articles: 1. On the necessity of believing in transubstantiation. 2. On offering only one kind to the laity. 3. On the necessity of auricular confession and enumeration of sins. 4. On the marriage of priests, which they assert is against the law of God, and that all marriages contracted must be dissolved before July 12 under penalty of death. 5. On monastic vows, which bind even those made before the age of consent. Penalties for heresy and the crime of treason are added for those who contradict. Books found are burned, and those wishing to flee are brought back. Mr. Latimer, Bishop of Worcester, the Bishop of Salisbury, Mr. Crome, and Mr. Taylor did not subscribe; but the Archbishop of Canterbury did, and now he regrets his action. Hales escaped in military attire and is now in Hamburg.</p>
      <p>You see, most dear father, the miserable state of this church. I truly fear for all the good people, especially for the safety of our Nicholas and Eliot, whose condition is not such that they can hide, and their piety is too holy to assent to the impious decrees of the impious king. However, we will hear something certain from this fair.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is a constant rumor that the Emperor has married the English Princess Mary. In France, soldiers are gathering by the king's command and order, yet no one knows for what purpose. However, there are those who assert that the English are planning something against Picardy. The daughter of the Emperor will marry the son of the French king, and thus the chain of the impious and the cyclopaedia of impiety will be completed with the counsel and aid of the three-headed Roman beast, to which, in order to attempt this, its spirit, namely the devil, has long since supplied plans. However, that same spirit, which seduces those disobedient to the word of the Lord, will drag them into deserved punishments. I now see the truth, which many preached to the unbelieving, that the King of England has not exercised all this tragedy in England out of love for Christ but out of hatred for the pope.</p>
      <p>The true sentence of the Lord, which declares every man to be a liar. However, I am comforted by the word of our same Lord, who says that all flesh is grass and therefore fragile and close to corruption, but the word of the Lord will remain forever.</p>
      <p>On the day before the calends of September, by the order and command of the Bernese, all the priests of the papist religion, who have lived in Morges until now and have been supported by the usual stipend (as is also done among us), were forced to publicly give an account of their faith. For there were not lacking among them those who, with clandestine sermons, attempted to seduce many, indeed all the people, not so much from the dominion of the Bernese as from the religion of Christ. You would have seen a tragedy not less ridiculous than pleasant. The city's preacher, a most learned man, stood in the pulpit, who was inquiring into the account of faith. At his side stood the city's prefect, a Frenchman by nation, who threatened sudden exile to the disobedient. On the other side stood the city's scribe, noting down all the responses. The first of the priests doubted everything, as he had previously been nothing other than a suitor of Penelope. The second not only doubted but could not provide even the slightest account of his religion; as much ignorance as there was in him, there was also arrogance, impudence, and impiety. For he affirmed that he would never abandon the holy and Roman (as he himself said) church and would always seek its safety and propagation.</p>
      <p>He was therefore immediately ordered to pack his bags, leave the territory of the Bernese within eight days, or expect the death penalty. The rest, who also doubted and could not bring forth anything certain about their uncertain religion, were given a term of two weeks to deliberate with themselves on what they might respond with a clear conscience. The people, who were previously quite rebellious not so much to the Bernese as to Christ, now seeing the treacherous impiety of these scoundrels exposed, lower their crests somewhat and are more frequent in listening to the word of the Lord. The same will soon happen in all the churches of Savoy.</p>
      <p>In France, the persecution is so fervent that the past crimes against the Christian religion seem like a joke if compared to those that are now happening. For power has been given by the king to all cities, prefects, or nobles of the lowest rank, to imprison and condemn anyone on the slightest suspicion without appeal to another judge, so that even the lowest and most insignificant judges are allowed to sentence to death. The accused, once condemned, has no place for appeal.</p>
      <p>As for what more I might write, there is nothing now. As far as my affairs are concerned, I will not only commit them but also myself entirely to you; you decide what seems best. I only pray (if it would not be useless) that I may be allowed to obtain this, so that I may acquire a more perfect knowledge of the French language, which I have begun to learn quite successfully, through you. I will see to it, as much as is in me, that neither this nor any other study of mine appears to have been undertaken without benefit to my country.</p>
      <p>I would very much like you to send the money I recently wrote about; necessity presses, and the winter season is already approaching.</p>
      <p>The entire assembly of scholars who are with us wishes you well. You will also greet your entire family in my name, along with your wife and mother. Farewell, most kind father, and may God keep you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Morges, September 11, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed father. Zurich.</p>
