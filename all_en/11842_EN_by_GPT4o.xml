    <p xml:id="regest1">Niklaus [Wyttenbach] has outlined his opinion on the contract concerning the marriage [of Samuel Wyttenbach and Küngold von Schönau] in writing and has made some suggestions for changes [to the inheritance arrangement], so that he still has the opportunity to support friends or an institution; Wyttenbach is willing to pay 500 [Bernese] guilders - which corresponds to a little more than 400 guilders circulating in Zurich - as a marriage tax; Fuchs asks Bullinger to ensure that the bride's family does not oppose this; Wyttenbach had to consider his relatives, who would have preferred [Samuel] to marry in Bern rather than Zurich. Wyttenbach has also asked Fuchs to inquire with Bullinger about the household goods - in Biel it is customary for the bride to bring them - and to ask whether they need to arrange for transportation, for which they would take a carter. The church ceremony remains as already agreed, but the people accompanying them on the return journey should make arrangements for departure the next day; Wyttenbach particularly wishes for Bullinger to accompany them. If the bride's relatives agree to the wedding, they should not set a date before October 28, as October 29 is also unfavorable due to the Biel market; a date before the big market in Bern on November 11 would be good. Request for goodwill and greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with us all at all times. Amen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, beloved lord and brother, first of all, I thank you for all the honor and kindness you have shown me; may God be your reward, for I cannot repay it. Regarding our marriage contract, as you know, the articles have been arranged differently, but always to the satisfaction of my lord and godfather Niklaus. He has consulted with his friends about them and has responded in writing accordingly. I ask you to understand them in the best possible way; be assured, they will not displease you, for indeed their hearts and minds are upright towards them. And especially for the first article, which he has set with his reservation, he speaks thus: It might happen that more than one of his sons survives, and he would have to leave everything to him and would thus be legally bound, without having the power to give something to a good friend and benefactor or to a school or hospital, as might be named. Therefore, he requested not to be restricted in this; there is otherwise enough good, if God wills, it will be well.</p>
      <p>Regarding the marriage tax, it would be his wish to give them 500 guilders of our currency, which is not much more than 400 of your currency. It is my request that you speak with them about this, not to oppose it, for it is not done out of greed or profit, but solely for his and your sake, also for the sake of his friends' reputation; for I otherwise know well that not all of them are pleased, they would have preferred him to go to Bern than to Zurich. Therefore, understand it in the best way. Be assured, the changes to the other articles will not have much disagreement against them.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he has instructed me to write to you regarding the household goods, how it stands, whether they will be given a decent (appropriate, proper) household, for it is our custom and right to do so for rich and poor, and whether they will be given one, whether we must bring it up here or how it will stand; for if he must have it brought up here, he would bring a carter down with us to do so.</p>
      <p>Regarding the church ceremony, as we have agreed with each other, he leaves it as it is, but so far that everyone is prepared, on the next day thereafter to ride up with us, and he has particularly instructed me that you should prepare yourself, for we have need of you as a man; also whether they must announce it beforehand from the pulpit, so that it happens beforehand, so that we are not hindered; it would take a long time if it were customary with you as it is with us.</p>
      <p>However, if they accept the contract as I, God willing, intend, it is his wish to set a specific day, but not before Simon and Jude, for it is not possible before then; the day after is our market, we have much to do. But nevertheless, if it pleases them, before Martinmas, for Martinmas also falls on a big market in Bern, where we also come and besides other friends of his, for whom it would not be convenient if they were hindered by it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear lord and brother, I ask you to understand the matter well and better than I can write to you, and to speak and act in the best way, as we trust you well. May God send His grace for this. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife, Herr Gwalther, Master Jacob Sprüngli, his wife, and all other good friends a thousand times. May God grant us all to live according to His will.</p>
      <p>Given on the 5th day of October in the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Let me know what is new.</p>
      <p>Your ever willing servant Peter Fuchs.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of God in Zurich, my gracious lord and brother, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
