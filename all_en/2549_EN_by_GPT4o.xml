      <p>If the name "spirit" is common to the three persons in this proposition "God is spirit," since it signifies a spiritual essence, I would like to know whether it signifies something else when it designates the third person? What then shows it to be distinct from the Father and the Son? Please tell me whether it is the subject or the predicate? Is the name "spirit" then granted to God, just as the name of the Father and the Son is attributed? But also indicate what relation it has, whether that spirit is found in the essence of God distinct from Him who is God the Father and the Son? Furthermore, see whether the Son is entirely predicated of God just as the Father; for Jesus Christus is the Son of that God who is believed to be triune, yet he is not called the Son of the Trinity, although creation and the works of the Trinity are considered indivisible from the outside.</p>
