    <p xml:id="regest1">Arrived safely in his homeland on the day before Christmas, where, despite the unsettled situation throughout all of Hungary, he was able to observe promising progress in religious life, as the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] does not hinder this; nevertheless, this enemy, whom no one among the Christians can match, cannot be trusted, and it remains only to call upon God for help; request for mutual intercession. In his letters from Wittenberg, he promised to show gratitude, but can only send a small gift [Johannes Honter's "Rudimenta cosmographica"?]. Greetings; due to lack of time, he could not also write to [Konrad] Pellikan and [Theodor] Bibliander. Would be pleased to receive a letter.</p>

      <p>To the distinguished man in learning and piety, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the word of God among the people of Zurich, a well-deserving friend and lord. Greetings and peace in the Lord, etc. I returned safely, praise to the most high God, to my homeland on the day before Christmas, where indeed, upon arrival, I found the state of the entire kingdom of Hungary more than sufficiently disturbed. However, regarding the religion of Christian life, I noted that it had begun to make the most fortunate progress with no one opposing it, and I also hope that it will be much greater in the future. The Turk, namely, does not attempt to hinder our religion in the least; nevertheless, one should not trust too much in an enemy, especially one who has so far occupied almost the better part of Europe with the most deceitful schemes. Since there is no one among the Christian leaders who can resist him, God alone must be invoked, so that He may at some time, when it seems good to Him, come to the aid of His flock. But I also ask your Church to remember us in their prayers, as ours will do likewise. This is enough to say to one who understands.</p>
      <p>Many times in my letters which I sent to you while I was still in Wittenberg, I promised that my grateful mind would be towards you, once I had returned to my homeland. Therefore, most humane man, since I cannot offer more now, I beg you to consider this small gift kindly, until God, the best and greatest, makes me more fortunate. Farewell most happily, and diligently commend me to Lord Pellikan and Lord Bibliander. I would indeed have written to them as well, if I could have found the time. Farewell again. Given at Kronstadt, Transylvania, on the 3rd of January, in the year 1544. Martin Hentius, always most devoted to you. Most humane man, I ask, if it is possible, that I may sometime see your letters, for nothing would ever be more delightful in life than to see these.</p>
