      <p>S. I have received all your letters, in which you have more than satisfied me, my dearest and best brother. That man from Ghent, since he aroused your suspicion of deceit, was questioned by me with almost countless questions, to which he responded in such a way and remained so consistent in everything that he left no suspicion whatsoever in my mind. He found a companion here with whom he would travel directly to Basel. I wrote letters of recommendation for him to some noble friends. The young man is not ordinarily learned; he seemed to me to hold philosophy well, even with a not insignificant knowledge of the laws; he learned mathematics so that he can craft the instruments of that discipline with remarkable skill; he has advanced somewhat in Greek, and you heard him speak Latin in public, certainly with me much aptly and precisely, so that I do not doubt that his talent has diligently applied itself to studies. Here he wrote letters to Cornelius Basdorf, the physician of His Imperial Majesty, which I will ensure are delivered to Augsburg as soon as possible to find out later what the physician will reply.</p>
      <p>That Italian, who has now been disappointed in his hopes for the third time, in St. Gallen, there and in Basel, pains me greatly, as he seeks nothing but manual labor from which to live frugally; I am indeed ashamed in the name of the Germans for such inhumanity, and also in the name of the evangelicals for such extinguished charity towards the household of faith. Certainly, at the beginning of the re-emerging gospel, we were much differently inclined towards exiles, although those flowers should now rightly be followed by more solid fruits. How you are overwhelmed by such people, both pious and impious, I can easily conjecture from myself, who am daily demanded much more than my income can bear, and yet I must distribute cheerfully and kindly according to the measure of the resources given to us by the Lord, which will also return to our bosom more abundantly, the more generously they have been bestowed by us upon others.</p>
      <p>I am not surprised by the luxury of your people, which has poverty as its inseparable companion; for that foolish and untimely extravagance of fortunes everywhere brings this reward, which I wish the Council of Trent would soon restrain with its authority, which it believes it possesses, and would strongly hurl its thunderbolts at it; but anything else would happen sooner than that.</p>
      <p>If you have written anything to the Hungarian churches, send it without any trouble to that physician Geryon or to Bufler. You write and be present to those churches as a certain divine presence, be assured of the faith with which your letters will be delivered; I will diligently watch over this altar for you here.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received who those orders are that despise the council; this one thing, which I wrote, was written by a certain distinguished man, who cautiously and circumspectly wrote to me because of the dangers impending upon him. He also added this: "Be assured that neither you nor I will live to see the conclusion of this council; so much will be scattered."</p>
      <p>So I have just received a fresh letter yesterday, in which nothing is written about the conclusion of the council; rather, (Welser) writes that it is proceeding. The man has much knowledge, and writes that he knows for certain how the Turk is moving strongly by sea towards Africa; but this year there will be no powerful campaign against Hungary, only a strong raid. It also follows in previous and yesterday's writings that the emperor is very weak and sick, and the pope has his eye on the emperor's death or health; for if he does not see the execution, he will find a crooked way to prolong the council.</p>
      <p>For your singular and perpetual diligence in writing, I give you the greatest thanks and will diligently ensure that you never remain ignorant of any of those matters which I myself will have learned from trustworthy men. What Musculus received from Augsburg about the council, I fear may not be as it is. More plausible and indeed more certain are those things which your Dilgerus received from France, for which I give you greater thanks.</p>
      <p>May our Lord Jesus Christ so moderate all things that we may be allowed to be safe under His wings from those rapacious wolves and eagles, although it cannot be that we enjoy a longer peace unless we, with more mature repentance, render the heavenly emperor propitious to us. Therefore, urge this, you whom the Holy Spirit has appointed as bishops to govern the church of God, which He acquired with His own blood. If I must divine from the worst morals of this age what will happen, I will have divined nothing other than a bad wedge for a bad knot; let us pray to the heavenly Father with humble prayers that He may reshape all hearts to a better and worthy fruit for Christian men.</p>
      <p>Warned prudently by you about that Pole Florian, I will be cautious. I add nothing, as I know you are now distracted by six hundred cares because of your Zurich synod, which I wish would surpass that of Trent, as it excels in the simple pursuit of truth, so also, wherever the Christian world extends, it would surpass in its authority.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, with your household and assistants in the work of the Lord, to whom I commend myself most diligently. Winterthur, May 4, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Do not let the case of Sunnemann slip your mind.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and friend in every way supreme.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
