    <p xml:id="regest1">A response to [Bucer's] long letter [No. 1831] seemed unnecessary to him, as Luther has rejected any association with [the people of Zurich]; the judgment should be left to God; Bullinger cannot give [Joachim] Forrer any advice [on the question of communion with the people of Strasbourg]. He sends his response to Cochläus, which he wrote in the last three months [“Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio”], which he also sent to Cochläus himself along with an accompanying letter [No. 1870]. He sees his fears expressed [in No. 1797] confirmed: Emperor [Charles V] is driving the Germans into war against the Turks to weaken them; he wants to reinstate the Duke of Savoy [Charles III] and the bishops of Lausanne and Geneva [Sébastien de Montfalcon and Pierre de La Baume] after a victory over France, overthrow the Confederates and the Schmalkaldic League, and restore the papacy; may the Lord preserve his church! Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The reason I do not respond to your lengthy letter is not because I did not receive it, but because the matter itself does not seem to require a response.</p>
      <p>Regarding concord, what more could I say, when Luther explicitly states that no churches of Christ can have any dealings with us, that we are deceivers who drag the churches entrusted to our faith away to the devil, and that he wishes to teach and pray against us until the end of his life? May the Lord repay him or rather open his eyes, so that he may recognize himself and his arrogant and proud heart, and cease to afflict the undeserving servants of Christ with insults and injuries. If no change can be expected from a man already old, to lay aside the petulance of his tongue and act more gravely and modestly with the Jews, and likewise with the remaining enemies or adversaries of the faith, let us leave these matters to the judgment of the just God. Let us wait until He resolves this dispute.</p>
      <p>As for what I can and should advise Forrer, I do not see, since the apostle says: "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread" [1 Corinthians 11:28] etc.</p>
      <p>Perhaps he will be recalled by his own.</p>
      <p>In these last three months, I have responded to Cochläus; I send the response here, so that you may see how I have advocated for the common cause. I am waiting to see what he will oppose; for I sent him a copy along with the letter.</p>
      <p>Regarding what I wrote about the Emperor's plans in my last letter, I ask you not to forget. For you see now that certain things are being demanded and done by him, just as wise men predicted would happen. I fear that he is entirely focused on weakening the strongest nation of Germany by exposing it to the Turks or at least draining it of money, the sinews of war. Meanwhile, he will be entirely focused on subjugating the French, restoring the Duke of Savoy, and the bishops of Lausanne and Geneva, and after defeating the Swiss, either transferring the war to Germany or dissolving the Schmalkaldic League through fear. For he desires the papacy to remain intact, and the evangelical religion to be utterly destroyed.</p>
      <p>Yet He lives and reigns in heaven, who can suddenly crush those plotting iniquity, and He commands us to watch and pray. May the Lord preserve His church to the glory of His name! Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 18, 1544.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, etc.</p>
