      <p>Greetings, dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>A few years ago, you published a small work on tithes and annual revenues, which is indeed very useful (in my judgment) to the Christian church, if ever anything else was published before. I read this booklet in German in a hasty reading when I was still working as a printer in Basel. I reread it with great diligence last winter. But since this work does not exist anywhere in Latin and is desired by all good men (of whom I am one), and since it is no longer available for sale in German, I considered it a duty of my old love and service towards you to urge you, through Christian charity and the common love of the most sacred studies, indeed to implore you, to present these your labors in the Latin language, so that they might be of use to foreign nations who do not know our language. You would do a very pleasing thing for the church of Christ and for your Westheimer, who venerates and respects you with a sincere heart as a teacher. Know that all is still well with my condition. May the Lord grant peace to the churches of the Swiss and a reformation of life. My Tropes, which I saw in your library when I was with you in previous years, I took up again this past year, discarded and eliminated some, restored and corrected others to a better understanding, and added many to the previous ones, so that now the work is enriched with more than three hundred idioms. Indeed, we owe much to your most sacred labors, which have been a help to us. I have now had leisure; moreover, Westheimer has a library very well equipped with the best books. But hey, my Bullinger, how is it that Doctor Gesner has so forgotten his Westheimer that he never even mentions a word in the Library, while he has dedicated a preface to any even ordinary printer in Basel! Indeed, the books published to the public testify that my typographic labors have never failed the Christian and sacred republic, but have even sometimes helped at the expense of my own affairs. Furthermore, Doctor Gesner does not mention in the Library the work of Tropes or Conciliations of the Fathers, while Doctor Zwingli of most blessed memory and future resurrection, my greatest friend once and dearest brother in the Lord, commended the Tropes in a public theological lecture with Leonard Hospinian, a very good man, listening, although I acknowledge these patchworks or rhapsodies and a magpie adorned with another's sweat. But enough of jokes. It is not permitted for a Christian, let alone a minister of the church, to rejoice or boast in vain and perishable things, but to glory in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, so that he may be found in Him. Farewell with your whole family. Greet your wife most dutifully in my name. Have my niece from my sister, that is, my relative, most commended to you. Greet Doctor Pellican, Doctor Gesner, Gwalther, Bibliander, Phrisius, my most witty companion, and all brothers in the Lord in the name of Westheimer. Forgive, my brother, my loquacity and, if you have time, write back. Allow this to be obtained from you regarding the small work, which I mentioned in the first part of the letter. Farewell. From the house of Hervagius in Basel, on the 22nd day of May.</p>
      <p>Your Westheimer.</p>
