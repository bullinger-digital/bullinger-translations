    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer has received Bullinger's letter of July 22 [No. 2960] with thanks and hopes that his last [No. 2963] and his penultimate letter with the five Batzen [No. 2955] were successfully delivered.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger's caring warning [regarding the negotiations of the city of Konstanz with Emperor Charles V.] is welcome. It would be nice if [the city] could maintain its stance. But only God knows if it will remain so. Without His care, Konstanz will probably have to comply. Bullinger and the Zurich church should pray for the people of Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Emperor is not yet in Augsburg. On July 18, he was still in Nuremberg. Yes, the Imperial Diet was announced. Some think it will take place in Speyer, others in Regensburg, because in Ulm and Augsburg some people are said to have already died of the plague. What will be negotiated at the Imperial Diet will soon be known. But its outcome will not be better than those of previous Imperial Diets, as presumably everything is getting worse. May the Lord be gracious to us!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Emperor repeatedly dismisses soldiers, so it is believed that he knows well how things stand with France, the Turks, and everyone else. There are tensions between France and England, and [the Imperial forces] are pouring oil on the fire to make it worse. The Emperor is said to send many soldiers to quell the uprising in Naples.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] There is an unverified report that the Turks have taken Pressburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Last Thursday, around four in the morning, a terrible fire broke out in Konstanz, which, however, could be extinguished with God's help. The fire ignited in the house of a saddler [...] in a very dangerous place. At least one house, if not six, burned down. Other houses also caught fire, but they could be saved. If the wind had not subsided or if the fire had broken out at the beginning of the night instead of towards morning, it could have ended badly. The people fought very bravely and to the point of exhaustion against the fire. If the neighbors, namely the Thurgauers, the Radolfzellers, and the Meersburgers, as well as the commander of the Teutonic Knights on Mainau [Sigmund von Hornstein], had not come to help, the people of Konstanz would not have managed alone. The Thurgauers proved to be particularly helpful. Praise and thanks be to God! May He protect us from the fires of hell!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Sebastian Schertlin sends his regards. Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz is staying in Baden. Greetings to all family members and to all councilors and good friends. Thomas Blarer and Konrad Zwick send their regards. Bullinger should pray for Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [P.S.:] Blarer asked Joachim Rheticus yesterday to copy the Latin-German verses to send them back with this letter, but he does not know if the copy is already available. If not, he will send them soon with a reliable messenger.</p>

      <p>Friendly, dearly beloved lord and brother, I have received your brotherly letter with thanks. I hope my recent letter has also reached you well, as well as the one before that, along with the five Batzen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We gladly accept your faithful warning. We would wish for nothing more than to remain as we are. But whether it can or will be so, only the merciful true God knows. He must keep watch over us with special grace, or I fear we will have to comply with the demands, which would be burdensome for us, even if it might be justifiable before God. Oh, pray and plead for us along with your church, that the Lord may graciously preserve us!</p>

      <p>The Emperor has not yet come to Augsburg; on July 18, he was still in Nuremberg. The Imperial Diet is being announced, as you report, with some saying it will be in Speyer, others in Regensburg, because in Ulm and Augsburg there are reports of some deaths from the plague. What the proceedings of this Imperial Diet will be, we will soon find out. But it cannot be better than the previous ones; rather, we fear the last will always be the worst! May the Lord be gracious to us.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Emperor continually dismisses the soldiers, which makes one think he knows well how things stand with France, the Turks, and everywhere else. However, France and England are not getting along well, and oil is being poured on the fire to make it bigger and brighter. The Emperor is said to be sending many soldiers to quell the unrest in Naples.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It is being reported here, and the news is also coming from elsewhere, that the Turks have supposedly conquered and taken Pressburg. However, there is no solid evidence yet.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Last Thursday, at four in the morning, we had a terrible, frightening fire here, which God, with special grace, miraculously allowed to be extinguished. It started in a saddler's house, in a very dangerous place. One house or six burned down, but many, many houses caught fire, which were saved. There was a wind. If it had not subsided, it would have gone badly, or if the fire had started at night instead of in the morning. Our people proved themselves very brave and valiant, but so very exhausted. If the neighbors had not come, our people would not have been able to hold out. All the neighbors came: the Thurgauers, those from Radolfzell and Meersburg, and also the commander from Mainau. The good Thurgauers proved themselves very valiant. Praise be to the Lord forever! May He graciously protect us from the hellish and eternal fire.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Lord Schertlin sends you all good wishes. Marcell is in Baden. Greet your dear household along with all the lords and good friends. Ours send you many services, good wishes, and greetings, especially my dear brother and cousin. Pray to God faithfully and heartily for us! Dated July 26, 1547.</p>

      <p>I do not know if I can send the Latin-German verses now. Joachim Rheticus received them for copying yesterday. If it is not possible to send them now, I will send them soon with a reliable messenger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his greatest friend. Zurich.</p>
