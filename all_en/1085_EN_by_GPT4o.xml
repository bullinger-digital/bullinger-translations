      <p>S. D. Grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ! For a long time I hesitated with a suspended mind, most reverend lord and father, and my mind was almost distracted by various thoughts, namely deliberating whether such a task should be undertaken by me, to address your dignity with my unpolished letters; finally, when I saw our Johannes von Ulm and Johann Rudolf Stumpf frequently writing to you, and understood that their writings were kindly received by you, I was led to send this brief letter to you: and if indeed this had not been the case, and your utmost kindness had not encouraged me and your benevolence invited me, I would have refrained from putting pen to paper. Therefore, I am relying on good hope that you will receive my writings with an equal and fair mind.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I beg pardon for the fault of impudence, that I, so insignificant, have written to such a great hero. Since I had nothing so convenient to write about, I will briefly express my situation to you. As soon as I left Zürich, I went to Marburg to the Hessians, where I stayed for half a year, and all the more happily, when I saw Philipp Fallenberger coming down to me, who received not a little benefit from your recommendation.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, when that Burcker, who trades in Strasbourg, set out on a journey to England, I was sent with him: therefore, I am now staying in the academy of the Oxonians with our people, namely Johannes von Ulm and Johann Rudolf Stumpf, with whom I have partly joined lodging and studies. I think enough has been said about this matter; for I do not doubt that you have long since understood from my uncle. So that I may not detain you longer than necessary from your affairs, and you may not be burdened to lend an ear to the speaker; I will use Laconic brevity, and express what I wish in one word. Therefore, I beg and beseech you, that you thank Mr. Peter Martyr in my name among other things, if you write to him, for having received me so kindly, and for having promised me all his effort and help; and add a recommendation, so that his opinion of me may be firmer. I ask you again and again to deign to grant me this service, and not to let your patronage be lacking. If I have obtained this from you, I will be more closely bound and devoted to you, and most ready for all things. Meanwhile, since I have asked this of you rather impudently, I ask for pardon.</p>
      <p>What is happening with us, and what has been done, you can easily understand from others: for I had scarcely been a month in England when I wrote this; therefore, I was not allowed, nor could I, experience much. Whether these things will be approved by you or not, judge them to have been written by a very good and devoted mind to you.</p>
      <p>If you find anything in these my letters that offends your dignity, attribute and ascribe it to my youth; and forgive me for your kindness and wisdom.</p>
      <p>Hereafter, with God's favor, if I sense that these have been pleasing to you, you will have better and more corrected ones. If you are free from serious occupations, read through these.</p>
      <p>Greet your sons by name in my name. Farewell to you; and may Christ the best long protect your dignity unharmed for the restoration of new piety and the promotion of good letters.</p>
      <p>Given at Oxford, 19th November 1550."</p>
      <p>Your dignity's most observant and devoted, Christoph Froschauer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, supreme bishop of the church of Zürich, his most venerable lord and father.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
