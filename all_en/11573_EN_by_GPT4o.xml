      <p>Greetings. This brother, if he could obtain a suitable position somewhere, will bring with him a good testimony from us to you, both of piety and diligence, not only from me but from all the brothers here. I write this to you so that nothing may hinder you in this regard, if there is a place where he can be conveniently received. He himself will be able to tell you the reasons why he is considering changing his place, and we would not hesitate to write as well.</p>
      <p>I would write about the matters that have already been brought from the Imperial Diet, if I knew that this letter was going directly to you.</p>
      <p>We are well here. I wish you all to be well in the Lord Christ. Farewell, my most esteemed and dear brother. Greet all the brothers in the Lord for me. June 7, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest friend and brother. Zurich.</p>
