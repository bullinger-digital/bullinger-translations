      <p>Greetings. Although I am not known to you, most illustrious man, your kindness, as proclaimed by good men, is so well known to me that I do not doubt you will consider my request favorably. In Zürich, Switzerland, there is a nobleman and senator, Jakob Rordorff, who has a son of the same name, who has spent some time with you there in France. The father, having heard of your diligence and tireless effort in educating young people, has asked me to recommend his son to you and to obtain letters of recommendation from Mr. Molineo. He has written letters enclosed with mine; I earnestly request your kindness to take this boy under your care as a father would a son. The father wishes him to be trained in both languages, Latin and French, and indeed to be trained not only in speaking but also in writing, which he particularly desires.</p>
      <p>He also wishes him to be instructed in good morals and to be under discipline, so that he does not commit anything shameful or become accustomed to bad company and be corrupted. Above all, he wants him to be kept untainted in religion and not to be exposed to superstitions, which he believes he can achieve, especially since the royal majesty's clemency does not prohibit Germans and Swiss, as indivisible allies, from using their native freedom and religion, nor does it compel them to adopt a foreign religion, provided they conduct themselves moderately and do not persist in being preachers of their own religion. As for the cost or expenses, he promises to compensate you fairly. He does not wish the boy to be stuffed with royal feasts, but with what is necessary and suitable for a student; he does not require luxury, nor does he seek squalor. He asks that nothing necessary be lacking; meanwhile, you should also teach the boy moderation and frugality, for the father has other children and cannot lavish his moderate means on one. Furthermore, we promise not to be ungrateful for your trust and diligence. Live and farewell. The boy's father wishes you well. Zürich, March 10, 1554.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, Pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
