      <p>S. I wrote these days to my brother about the death of our Samuel Telamon, about whom all good people here truly grieve and ought to grieve, although he has been transferred to better things. He greatly feared the plague raging there and was therefore reluctantly torn away from here. On the first of November, still healthy, he cut the vein of his right arm; but it was not well touched, hence soon the whole arm swelled, and pestilential fevers invaded him, and on the tenth of this month, they finally completely overcame him.</p>
      <p>I had recently written about this matter somewhat differently, because I had not understood it otherwise at the time.</p>
      <p>We have lost a singular friend and supporter here. Otherwise, we have nothing except what is reported about the assembly of adversaries held in Lucerne, where they say there was a great gathering of papists, Spaniards, and Frenchmen, as well as other envoys. What they have been plotting there is easy to imagine, and time will reveal it.</p>
      <p>Common assemblies are being called for this matter, and our people hear that these three things will be proposed to us: 1. that we expel all those French and subjects of the king from our lands who have fled to us at this time; 2. that we declare to them what they should expect from us in these disturbances; 3. that our alliances be confirmed with a newly given oath. What lies hidden under these demands, wiser people can easily estimate. Here we will need much concord; may the Lord deign to grant it to all of us. My son-in-law Blasius Marcuard writes to me from Geneva that many French who had gone there are returning to France again, which is a sign of a bad matter; many also, seeing these dangers everywhere, are failing and returning to their old ways. From Germany, we have nothing except that the princes do not trust each other enough and that Alba is already beginning to threaten some; if you have anything, please share it with us. It is our duty to weary God with prayers, that He may have mercy on us and preserve and protect our stars, that is, our churches, with His hand. Both consuls and both treasurers, Diesbach, Hagenberg, etc., greet you.</p>
      <p>Diesbach has set out these days with some others to our Savoy to repair the fortified places that our people possess in those parts, namely Yverdon, Morges, Chillon, etc. They will also go to Geneva. I do not yet have the total of the collection, but I think it is about four or five thousand pounds; nothing has yet been sent to Geneva, because the greater part of these exiles almost always turns to our dominion, especially the poor; for those who have something, the Genevans mostly retain with them. I have nothing else now, except that I ask you to greet all the brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, 20th November 1572.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
