      <p>S. P. Most distinguished doctor, always revered by me as a father.</p>
      <p>On the 12th of March, visiting that notable defender of the gospel, Mr. Guillaume Farel in Neuchâtel (where Mr. Johannes Calvin was also present the following day), I saw your letters to the same Farel, in which you mentioned that in November you were freed from a severe illness, not without lingering pain. I gave thanks to God, praying for your full and vibrant health. Mr. Farel indeed, having been brought to the brink, recovered, but with difficulty, always more desiring to be with Christ. I believe my letters, written in this hand quite extensively on the 16th of January from Geneva, have now reached you, around which time the holy books, even the gospels, were publicly burned by the executioner in Metz (where Henri II is eager to establish a parliamentary court to make it more his own, as it is an imperial city) through the Duke of Guise, the lieutenant of Henri II. From there, persecution in France flares up, from where frequent letters have come to me, urging me to leave Geneva, unless I wish to subject my wife and children to the cruelty of tyrants. Nevertheless, I wanted to endure the Lord's punishment here, lest I seem to prefer private feelings to the church. Soon I must move to Neuchâtel, where I am called by the lords of the place (who are French and wish to use my counsel and industry). But because I am handing over a book on the abuses of the papacy to be printed in French and am planning harsher things against the papists, I will soon be odious to the lords of the said place; the citizens, however, are rude and unlearned and despise me. It comes to mind that the most Christian prince, Duke Christoph of Württemberg, Count of Montbéliard, is in that holy assembly of princes to propagate the gospel (with the Interim abolished). If you have familiarity with the said duke or another who can remind him, you would do a worthy thing and useful to the church if (as it is convenient for you) you advise that I be given lodging at my expense in Montbéliard; for here I could easily raise my family and thereafter more easily mature my children. Farewell, most beloved teacher. May the Lord keep you safe and all of your church, to whom (as in the last letters, I again wish to be commended). Geneva, on Easter day, ex tempore.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient, Charles du Moulin p.</p>
