    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not send a letter with the last messenger, as he was occupied with drafting the preface to the [„Biblia sacrosancta“ (BZD C 319f)], which will be published in a few weeks; his explanation of the canonical scriptures [HBBibl I 115] and a brief summary of both Testaments [„Compendium et scopus totius sacrae scripturae utriusque testamenti“, see HBBibl I, p. XVIIf] will be included in the preface. He actually hoped that Theodor [Bibliander] or [Konrad] Pellikan would undertake the drafting of this introduction, but since they stubbornly refused, he was forced to do it himself, as he did not want the work to be published without an introduction; will ensure that Vadian receives the remaining parts. [Johannes] Oporin has [the confiscated copies] of his Quran edition [on January 11] returned with the conditions that he does not sell them in Basel, that the city is not mentioned anywhere in the print, and that finally a preface is included, whose author takes responsibility for the edition; this preface has already been written by Theodor [Bibliander]. [Rudolf] Gwalther has translated a writing against Mohammed by the Byzantine Emperor John [VI] Kantakouzenos from Greek into Latin [VD 16 J 376], which Oporin will likely include in the Quran edition. Thanks for a pasquinade [Zürich ZB, Ms A 127, 226v.-227r.?], which Bullinger greatly enjoyed. [Oswald] Myconius shared the following on January 17 [No. 1711]: The Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] is striving for reforms; Bucer preaches and teaches [in Bonn] and plans to visit more cities; the people are rough, yet Christ has some disciples there as well. The Bishop of Münster [Franz von Waldeck] is also seeking [evangelical] scholars, and regarding Minden and Paderborn, [the original letter recipient] is already informed. Many soldiers returning from Hungary are dying on the way; of the Archbishop's 270 horsemen, only 15 have returned, one of whom, [Wirich?] von Oberstein, died on the last stretch. Duke [Wilhelm] of Jülich is supported by troops from Gelderland, Saxony, and Denmark and shelled Düren in December; the mediation attempts by the Archbishop and [Landgrave Philipp] of Hesse have so far been unsuccessful according to Bucer. These news are verbatim from Myconius, who took them from Bucer's letters. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I pray, my dear Vadian, do not be angry with me for not sending you any letters with the last messenger. For he was in a hurry, and I was entirely occupied with drafting the preface to the Bible work. It will be published in a few weeks. The Preface is placed first, followed by my Exposition on all the canonical books of Scripture; a very brief Compendium and summary of both Testaments will be appended to this; the work itself will be joined to these. I had hoped that either D. Theodor (Bibliander) or D. Pellican (Konrad Pellikan) would write a worthy Prologue for the work; but since both steadfastly refused, I was finally forced to do what I could myself - I hope not foolishly! - unless I wanted the work to be published without any inscription; I mention this so that you may excuse me among the learned, if indeed the occasion permits. Furthermore, there is no need for you to request so earnestly that I ensure Froschauer does not keep you in suspense regarding the remaining part to be submitted, until the whole is completed. For unless the messengers are hindered, you will receive it immediately once it is finished. Regarding Oporin, we have this: the Quran has been returned to him, but on the condition that he sells it elsewhere than in Basel and does not mention Basel anywhere in the work, and that he ensures a preliminary letter is prefixed, which clearly indicates the author who will take responsibility for any thunderbolts that may be hurled. The letter is already being written by Theodor (Bibliander), taking upon himself whatever misfortune may have to be borne because of this book. See how some are diligently and cautiously preposterous. Gwalther has translated several books written against Mohammed by John Kantakouzenos, the Emperor of Constantinople, from Greek into Latin, which Oporin will likely add to the Quran. The pasquinade from Rome greatly affected me and pleased me immensely. For this, I give you my greatest thanks, as well as for many other things with which you abundantly fill me with new joys daily. D. Myconius, in a letter written to me on January 17, indicated the following: "The Archbishop of Cologne (Hermann von Wied) wants a sound gospel, sound sacraments, and the fornication of his priests expelled. Therefore, Bucer preaches on Sundays and three times a week; on the remaining days, he lectures to the canons and those who understand Latin on the first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians. When this has been done for a time, he will leave vicars behind and go to other more populous cities. The people are very rough, although there is no doubt that Christ has some disciples there. The Bishop of Münster (Franz von Waldeck) is seeking pious and learned men from everywhere to teach himself and his people the gospel of Christ. It is said that he spares no expense. You already know about the people of Minden and Paderborn, subjects of Cologne. A miserable spectacle meets the eyes throughout Germany: soldiers returning from Hungary collapse on the way, wherever you go, with failing spirits. The Archbishop of Cologne sent 270 horsemen. Fifteen returned, among whom the son of the Count of Oberstein, the standard-bearer, accompanied by a prostitute from Neroberg, died between Frankfurt and his homeland, after he thought he had already escaped all evils. Thus, the total number comes to 14. The Duke of Jülich (Wilhelm) has an army collected from his Gelderland, Saxons, and Danes; in December, he bombarded Düren, so that the noise was heard in Bonn, where the gospel was first preached. The Archbishop and the Landgrave of Hesse (Philipp) are interceding for peace, but so far completely in vain. For the Archbishop said to Bucer in person that no hope appears anywhere." All these things verbatim from Myconius, evidently from Bucer's letters. Farewell, most esteemed Vadian. January 21, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. D. Joachim Vadian, most esteemed lord.</p>
