    <p xml:id="regest1">The fact that [the pastors of Schaffhausen] are only now making themselves heard is partly due to their shyness and partly because Vogt, together with [Heinrich] Linggi, wanted to come to Zurich in person; however, the issue of the Lord's Supper now prompts them to write. The behavior of certain people in this matter causes them concern. Recently, the council received letters from Luther and from Bucer, and the pastors now wish to coordinate their position with the people of Zurich; they know they are in agreement with them, although Schaffhausen, contrary to the pastors' wishes, did not sign the letter [from the reformed cities] to Luther. Linggi is not writing himself due to illness. Vogt requests information about the events in the Bernese church. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
      <p>Finally, it is time to write in response to your friendly and humane exhortation, dearest Heinrich, since you have so often not only offered your friendship and familiarity, but also encouraged us through letters to sharpen our friendship, which is firm enough, I hope, though not yet so well known, through mutual correspondence. The reason we have not written to you until now is partly due to a perhaps misplaced shyness (for you indeed show your kindness to everyone) and a consciousness of our own inadequacy, and partly because we have always intended that, whenever an opportunity arose, Linggi and I would visit you and the brothers in Zurich. We had already prepared ourselves for the journey once, but the unfavorable circumstances forced us to abandon our plan, even though we had already covered some distance. Now, however, an opportunity presents itself so opportune that we cannot, since our journey has been hindered thus far, refrain from writing to you. It concerns the matter of the Eucharist, which you first took the opportunity to express your familiarity and friendship towards us through letters.</p>
      <p>We see, most honorable man, and, alas, with great harm to the churches, we experience that some do not act so candidly in this matter. We also see that good people are being discredited, and those less firm (whom we had considered very firm) are wavering. Those who ought to offer the gospel of peace to the whole world are causing not insignificant dissensions in the church or at least providing fuel for dissensions to others. Recently, a letter of Lutheran sentiment regarding the Eucharist was presented to our council. We are not yet clear on what to make of it, especially regarding Bucer's exposition. For we would rather, so as not to appear rash or obstinate, hear your judgment, as well as that of Theodor, Pellican, and Leo, than show our own rashness. We are so far from opposing the exposition you previously offered to the Lutheran faction that we have long since wholeheartedly agreed with your position. It was not due to us that we did not also subscribe, but due to our council, which, as you know, we could not persuade by any effort to subscribe along with you. But enough of this. Now it remains for you, through your learning, judgment, and candor, to inform us by letter what you intend to do or respond to Luther's writings. For we believe that our council may perhaps demand our opinion on this matter. If we are found to be in agreement and of one mind with you, it will seem to bring not a little benefit to our church.</p>
      <p>Linggi is suffering from pleurisy, otherwise he would have taken on the task of writing himself. However, we hope he will recover day by day.</p>
      <p>If there is any certain and noteworthy information about the Bernese church that you have, I ask you to communicate it by letter.</p>
      <p>My fellow ministers greet you. Greet the brothers in my name, especially Theodor, Leo, and Pellican. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, February 7, 1538.</p>
      <p>Simprecht Vogt, minister of the church in Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in doctrine and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his singular friend. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
