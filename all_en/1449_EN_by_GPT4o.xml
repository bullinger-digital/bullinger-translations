      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Believe me, some people are deliberately spreading various rumors about the Emperor's departure to give us some joy; but I do not easily believe them. But it is most certain that the Emperor is still stuck in Augsburg and will not easily be removed for many reasons. They have acquired a preacher, Caspar Huber, who has so far held the Interim in high regard and will defend the Augsburg Interim. Consider here the false brother, whom they secretly called to themselves a year ago and made a pact with him, who solemnly promised not to say anything against the Interim. Banners have been drawn from the Augsburg soldiers to the fortress of Asperg, so that the prince does not lack support in the absence of the Spaniards. We hear nothing about the liberated prince-elector, and some think it difficult to achieve this from the princes of the empire, because the Emperor fears something unknown if the elector is liberated.</p>
      <p>I am sending you Corius and Polyaenus; you can request Corius from Lord Theodor. I also thank you for the book you sent as a gift; I will repay you by sending back books, whichever you wish.</p>
      <p>Hector will respond on his behalf to the letters I gave him in your name. It is certain that Mr. Müssar from Gießen has driven away many thousands of pigs from Lorraine; the Alsatians have suffered great damage. What is happening in Magdeburg, you can learn from this note, and what they are doing now is unknown, and some doubtful things are said, which I do not believe, and I think I will receive letters from Nuremberg, from which we will have more certain information. Letters have been sent to me from Leipzig with various booklets, but they have not been delivered, perhaps they are still hidden in Frankfurt. I pursue with utmost hatred such people who so negligently care for what is entrusted to them.</p>
      <p>The plague troubles us, and we fear worse, and we are oppressed by the cost of provisions. May the Lord pursue us with His favor.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever with all yours. If you receive any news from Augsburg or Italy, it would not be troublesome to share it. Myconius is suffering from his domestic illness, and I did not believe he would survive another day last week; the disease was so rampant in him.</p>
      <p>Believe me, we offered nothing different regarding the oath to be taken to our senate than you did, even though we discussed this matter with more words; do not doubt, ours will remain steadfast, and the Valentinians will waver little.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 28, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>The mandate of Ensisheim was published in the name of King Ferdinand, that no one should go to France for military service; the penalty of death and loss of all possessions was attached. Some soldiers are heading to Augsburg, who received a gold coin from the captain; I do not know where the Emperor will lead them. What their knights are doing on public roads, you can inquire from that courier.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, his dearest in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
