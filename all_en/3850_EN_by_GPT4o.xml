      <p>To my most esteemed Lord Bullinger, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I received your last letter, which you sent to me, dated January 13th. Enclosed were also letters to be sent to your son Christopher, which I will ensure are delivered to him diligently. I will also add my own, in which I will earnestly encourage him to make more frugal expenses and to diligently apply himself to his art and endure its labors, and finally to carry out all other things that befit a prudent person born to such parents, although I do not think the young man needs much spurring, as he is naturally inclined towards all that is best, and you will one day rejoice, my lord Bullinger, at his progress, and he will repay you for your excessive expenses with interest, and I would not hesitate to be a guarantor to you for your son. He is indeed a noble and high-spirited young man and of very elegant stature and therefore also of great promise. May the Lord God bless him and all your family! I have written to Venice again, recommending him to friends, with the addition that they should only provide him with necessities that he might lack, and I did this before I received your last letter, and I am now more content that I did so, as you also requested in your letter. Do not be anxious about your son; for friends will not let him lack anything necessary, etc. Regarding the loan you wish to know about, how many batzones make a Rhenish, that is, the money your son borrowed in Venice and which I repaid, you should know that a gold crown makes one and a half Rhenish, and I settled that debt accordingly. But since your son writes that he only received 7 Rhenish, he received them at one time; but when he was about to leave for Treviso, he still had one Rhenish, and to make this clear, I am sending you a note written by your son on this matter. Therefore, most esteemed lord Bullinger, you will calculate yourself what small amount you owe me, and you will keep it with you until I indicate what I wish to be done with it, unless perhaps my son sends to you that he is in need, which I do not think he will do so soon, as I gave him enough when he left me to support himself comfortably for some time. I wish my son to always be commended to you, so that, although he is absent from you, he is not deprived of your truly paternal care and concern, etc. I was very displeased that my son refused to stay under the supervision of one of those excellent men to whom you had recommended him.</p>
      <p>I believe this was done at the instigation of Peter Alexis, his companion; for they both reside in the same house. But I am also comforted that the same Peter Alexis is a young man of good character, and whom I hardly believe will do anything beyond his duty nor neglect my son, as far as it is in his power. However, we will be informed of how my son will conduct himself in the future, and if he does not meet our expectations (although I hope for better), he will be recalled to his homeland, although I am also of the mind that he will return around the beginning of July next and stay with me in the Clavenna office, if the Lord grants grace, with the option to decide otherwise in the future about my son's return, as it seems best. We have no certain news of new events to inform you about.</p>
      <p>Our merchants, who have come from Italy these days, have brought the news that it is certainly asserted there that peace has been made between King Philip and the King of France, which should be publicly proclaimed around the beginning of the next month. They report many conditions of peace, among which the main ones are: that the King of France has betrothed his daughter to Charles, the son of King Philip, and both kings have renounced to the same Charles the rights they have over the Duchy of Milan, along with the assignment of some other significant places, which the King of France gave as a dowry to his daughter. Moreover, the same French king has given his sister in marriage to the Duke of Savoy, to whom he also returned all the places he occupied in the Duchy of Savoy in past times as part of the dowry, except for the town of Turin and four other fortified places, which he reserved for himself, with the condition that they should be returned to the Duke of Savoy as soon as the said couple has legitimate offspring.</p>
      <p>The captives, who were detained on both sides, have been released, although a large sum of money was paid by the constable and the other French, all of which goes to the benefit of the Duke of Savoy as some compensation for the damages that the Duke or his father suffered, etc. The Venetians, however, are very anxious that such a union of the most powerful kings might fall upon them and therefore they are likely to become more restless. Therefore, it is reported that in Verona and some other places, the Venetians have increased their garrisons and are procuring and preparing with great diligence what is necessary for any event of war. It is also thought that the Emperor is displeased with the peace made and will not agree to it, especially because the Duchy of Milan belongs to the Empire and he does not want the Empire to be deprived of those rights.</p>
      <p>And this is what our people coming from Italy have reported, which I also wanted to inform you about as I received it. Therefore, whether it is true or false, you will take it in good part and excuse me.</p>
      <p>In the Duchy of Milan, by order of King Philip, two hundred and fifty thousand crowns are now being demanded as tribute, and the people groan everywhere because of such a difficult exaction. With us, however, everything is quite peaceful by the grace of God, and especially because matters of religion are succeeding quite happily; for the number of the pious and those who believe in Christ is increasing daily not only in our free Rhaetia but also in the places subject to us, so much so that it can truly be hoped that one day we will all be brought into one fold and under one shepherd, with all superstition and idolatry completely abolished, and may the best and greatest God make it so, etc. Finally, most esteemed lord Bullinger, it remains (since I have been quite lengthy in other matters) to thank you for again promising in your last letter to take care of my son and to write to him diligently, etc. And I confess that I am very much indebted and obliged to you and I thank you tirelessly for the countless benefits bestowed upon me and mine, and I will repay them as much as I can when the opportunity presents itself. I also commend to you Hector and Jonah, my brothers, and I was indeed pleased that you write that Hector has become more tractable; may he complete well what he has begun well! If this happens, all the credit will go to you, who have made the untamed more tractable and gentle. Indeed, those untamed natures, if tamed, usually produce abundant fruits.</p>
      <p>May the Lord turn everything to good! All those you order to be greeted in your letters greet you a thousand times and wish you and all yours to be very well. It now occurs to me to remind you of something concerning Mr. Lavater, your son-in-law and my very esteemed lord, and it is this: I believe that Dussius has contracted some debt there with his patron and perhaps others; I would like Mr. Lavater to write how much it is and inform me, so that I can press his brother to pay it, and as soon as I know how much is owed, I will ensure that the money is paid without delay and sent there. Dussius himself still resides at home, and I have no certain information whether he is to be sent anywhere; he clings to his mother's embrace, from which he can hardly be torn away. If I receive any letters from your son, I will send them to you quickly; you do the same if mine sends anything.</p>
      <p>So far, I have not received any letters from our Christopher since the ones I recently sent to you; but I expect them daily. I am going to Chur in six days for a minor assembly, uff einem bytag; if anything new and worth knowing arises there, you will know, etc. Farewell, most esteemed and forever to be respected lord Bullinger, and I earnestly ask you to love me perpetually, and do so more justly, since you are loved and esteemed by me above all others. I also pray to the best and greatest God to keep you and all yours safe for as long as possible! You will also greet on my behalf those most excellent and very friendly to me, Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Bernardino Ochino, Mr. Walther, all your sons-in-law, Mr. Frisius, and the whole assembly, who together with you tirelessly strive to promote piety and the glory of Christ Jesus, may the best and greatest God bless all their efforts, etc. I wish to know whether Mr. Bernardino Ochino has put the finishing touches on his catechism; when I was there, he had just begun, but seeing the beginning of that work raised great hope in me that it would be a most remarkable and worthy work to be handled by the pious. Believe me, most esteemed lord Bullinger, that if I were not so occupied with such great and unavoidable business, indeed troubles, that I cannot leave here or my homeland, I would certainly visit you all; for I am so affected by the desire for all of you, and may God grant that I may see you all with a joyful mind someday. Farewell again a thousand times.</p>
      <p>If I have written less thoughtfully, I ask you to forgive me; for indeed I have not even reread it due to lack of time, etc. Given in Samaden, January 25, 1559.</p>
      <p>For all others, my request is that you greet your dear wife and your whole household for me, to whom I wish a happy and prosperous new year. Also, please greet my brothers Hector and Joshua for me, and my request to them is that they conduct themselves well. With this, may the grace of God be with us all.</p>
      <p>When I write to you, it seems to me that I can never stop; but I ask you to forgive me for it. Yours in all things, most devotedly, the same as above, Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my ever to be esteemed and respected lord and patron. In Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned master Heinrich Bullinger, my especially gracious lord, in Zurich.</p>
