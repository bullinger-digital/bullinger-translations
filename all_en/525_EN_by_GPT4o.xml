      <p>Greetings. Since this pious man, to whom I have entrusted my letters to you, seemed to me to be very suitable, if anyone else, to testify to my love for you in Christ, and how much I revere you both for the gifts with which the Lord has adorned you and for the diligence you apply in promoting the common benefit of the church, I did not hesitate to write to you familiarly through him. For I believe that his presence and the serious matters he will discuss with you will serve as my excuse in this matter. For since he does not spare his health for their sake, it seemed fair to me to make some effort to at least urge you through letters to consider the necessity of these times attentively and diligently and to ensure, as much as it is in your power, that some fruit of this journey may be evident. Indeed, I can testify that it was not undertaken by him out of any personal interest and that he was long ago asked by true servants of God to undertake it, and although his departure from here is troublesome to me, when I understood how necessary this journey was, I encouraged him as much as I could. There is also another reason why it is pleasant for him to travel to you, since through mutual communication much more can be achieved than through letters, and the way is better opened altogether for settling any remaining controversies and confirming peace, than which nothing more desirable can happen to the universal church. Therefore, my brother, I beg you, as long as you live, to foster mutual concord between the churches; for perhaps never again will two minds such as yours meet, so suitable for hearing reasons on both sides and for those counsels which would otherwise disturb the pious minds of many.</p>
      <p>I can assure you of this, that I, a common friend and son in the Lord of both of you, and who wishes you the most prosperous state of all things, would not have allowed him to travel to you without me, if only my health could have borne it; for I would have joined him as a companion on the journey and would have gladly visited you and your church.</p>
      <p>Geneva, May 20, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Jacob of Burgundy.</p>
      <p>If you have any news from Mr. Hooper and his wife, please let me know. God willing, I will write to them shortly.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
