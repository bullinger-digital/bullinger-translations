      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have taken care of all the letters sent to me this year with the utmost diligence, so do not be anxious. We have received writings in which the following is stated: "Duke Maurice was defeated by Mr. von Heideck, shot in the jaw and through a thigh, barely escaped. Eric of Brunswick is captured, as well as the Count of Lippe and many nobles. There was a great slaughter. The Emperor offers them peace, which he never kept,... Caesar does everything to disperse that army. The Bishop of Bremen was killed in the battle itself. Prince George of Mecklenburg died on the fourth day after captivity from his wounds.</p>
      <p>Caesar is gathering an army from the old garrisons; perhaps he does not trust the people of Augsburg. We will see a very turbulent summer. Many Spaniards and Neapolitans are coming to us; I do not know what this means, is he not secretly gathering an army and foreign soldiers to instill terror in the Germans, so they do not defect.</p>
      <p>The army of Bremen considers the interimists and papists as enemies; they plunder merchants, devour bishoprics. If Caesar can sow discord among them, as he tries, it will be over for them; for he thinks of nothing else than to bring disaster upon us and to bring us back under obedience(?); but we do not want to be wise until we are struck.</p>
      <p>Five kings are meeting, the French, the English, the Danish, the Polish; I do not know the fifth. Similarly, the cities of Saxony will also consult about establishing peace in Germany and gathering an army to oppose Caesar's monarchy; for it is time that the kings of the earth finally awaken and consider more diligently than before what could happen if the cities are defeated.</p>
      <p>If you have anything from England, I beg you to share it, nor do I doubt that your letters are already in England.</p>
      <p>Myconius is afflicted with gout, a good man worthy of a better fate because of many inconveniences he otherwise has.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, God exercises miraculous judgments against the enemies of the gospel. Two have died of the plague, otherwise called Matthias Grotterus; he had begun singing psalms in the cathedral for 24 years, but has now been moved back to the mass. He utterly despaired of God's mercy because he said he had sinned against the Holy Spirit and against his conscience for profit and great promises. The other, called Claudius, a preacher of the Younger Peter; he was educated at public expense and instructed in evangelical truth and eventually also defected. When he was suffering from the plague, he said he could not attain salvation, but was damned.</p>
      <p>See what examples the Lord sets before our eyes, especially for the papists.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sebastian Schertlin is thinking of leaving and seeking another place, a good and brave man; but I do not want to speak about this; perhaps he will return shortly.</p>
      <p>Many depart suddenly, many from the plague and internal infection. May the Lord grant us the spirit of strength and patience with true faith, so that we do not fail him.</p>
      <p>Farewell, February 1, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Theodor in my name, with whom you can share this.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, priest in Zurich, my kind, dear lord. Zurich.</p>
