      <p>Greetings. I have informed through our Budeus that I have faithfully and promptly handled the matter entrusted to me with Mr. von Hallwyl.</p>
      <p>Now I will recount what he replied in his own words: "I would indeed wish, at the cost of my resources and even at the risk of my life, to support the common cause of religion and the brothers suffering throughout France: but you are not unaware of how shamefully I was recently deceived by those from whom I am now ordered to seek cavalry. Hence, it is burdensome for me to establish new plans with such people on the same matter.</p>
      <p>I prefer that others also experience how safe it is to trust such people. If the hopes of the magnates and pious men were not deceived, as they entice me with empty promises and deal with me inconsistently, I would bear this injustice with a more equitable mind.</p>
      <p>But why do I go on at length? In one word, I will signify what I think or hope in this matter. I see that the cunning of the Guises has occupied the mind of one or another prince, through whom others are then misled and hindered by various plans, so that I expect no help from anyone. And I want you to promptly inform those whose interest it is to know this, so that they may seek help elsewhere in time and not hope for aid from where none will follow." Thus he spoke.</p>
      <p>And I myself also experience that the idol of the Augsburg Confession has settled so deeply in the minds of some (as our Blaurer recently wrote) that unless the French churches adore it, they will have no help. And if they do adore it, nevertheless, they will be helped only with great expense and little benefit.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord, the only helper of His church, that He Himself may undertake the defense of His own, which I am sure He will do. As for the letters you ordered to be sent to Rhaetia to Mr. Hercules von Salice, I ensured they were delivered to Chur by a personal messenger. And everything was handled so quickly and faithfully that Hercules himself came here on the evening of June 28. He waited here for two days, hoping to find some nobleman from Condé. He called to himself the baron from Alto Saxo.</p>
      <p>I do not know what he discussed with him.</p>
      <p>He orders me to write to you that he is entirely ready and waiting for some nobleman from the most illustrious Prince of Condé, with whom he can discuss the matters you wrote to him about.</p>
      <p>And today he returns home again.</p>
      <p>I see that many are very willing, if only the prince sends those equipped with money, who will seriously handle his business. I wanted to signify this immediately so that I neither neglect nor hinder anything.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there is a rumor of some victory of Condé. May it be true.</p>
      <p>We are, however, waiting for your letters, through which we may understand everything clearly and certainly. We do not safely trust rumors.</p>
      <p>Make sure, my brother, to write diligently about everything that happens in France, so that you may make us participants in joy, as we also share in sorrows, or if anything adverse happens, that we may pray more fervently to the Lord. We know how great your affairs are.</p>
      <p>Budaeus or Ionvillaeus can write, whom you will greet in the name of all of us, as well as the other brothers. Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 1, 1562. The brothers greet you, etc. Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
