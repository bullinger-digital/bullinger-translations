      <p>Greetings. In such a silence of all things, most learned Mr. Bullinger, I had nothing to write, since there is nothing at home that is worthy of mention. Indeed, public peace pleases everyone; but the plans that are said to be taken by that Spanish monarch make it suspicious, as he is eager to return his people to their old ways by the coming year and, as far as he can, to disturb and terrify everything with wars. Letters recently brought from Antwerp reported that he, along with his son, was received with a very lavish ceremony in that city around the Ides of September, and from there they affirmed that he would return to Germany. Others think of Spain; yet it is believed for certain that the son will winter in the Low Countries, while the father will cross over to the land of Apulia in the spring and from there, after first bringing the city of Rome into order and with the Pope firmly underfoot, will enter the region of Cisalpine Gaul with great forces, in order to restore the dominion of the old Lombard kingdom, and then also to restore his cousin to his Savoy and, as some Swiss fear, to impose laws on them; others write that he will cross from Germany over the Alps into Italy even this autumn. But what faith shall we place in rumors spread without an author? It is strange and not a little suspicious to me that the freedom of preaching the gospel is flourishing throughout Swabia, and Frechtus himself has moved from Nuremberg to a nearby small town of the Ulm people, Leypphaim, with the certain hope of recovering the position from which he was recently expelled. A few days ago, at a certain late hour of the night, some people broke into the temple in Augsburg and, having suddenly knocked down and stripped the altars and statues, they escaped so cleverly that even now the name of any of them is not known. Indeed, they are fortunate, but very close to danger.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, on the 7th day of October in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most pious church of ZÃ¼rich, his master and friend to be especially respected.</p>
