      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Since Mr. Gwalther left us, my father, I have neither received any letters from you nor have I written anything to you, because I had nothing to write; now that an opportunity has presented itself, I did not want to neglect my duty. The one delivering this letter to you, named Lusarchius, is the brother of that noble young man whom I recommended to you in this month of the previous year. When he decided to spend the winter here and saw that he could not remain hidden with us safely enough (for his circumstances demand it, so that without great inconvenience to himself he cannot yet openly engage in the church of God, as he greatly desires), he has taken up a new plan to visit your church and from there to cross into Italy, if it can be done conveniently, so that he may stay there for a while until he has taken care of his affairs, and then return to us. You see the cause is worthy of your support; but I add this, that the man is also worthy of the friendship of all good people due to his many virtues.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I earnestly ask you, my father, that if the winter storm keeps him there, you provide him with some suitable lodging and embrace him with all your effort and favor, both for the sake of our mutual friendship and connection. I also earnestly ask the same from Mr. Gwalther and Mr. Gesner, to whom I would have written, had not our Lusarchius departed quite unexpectedly. But enough of this; for I do not think a longer recommendation is necessary with you.</p>
      <p>As for our affairs, everything is quite well. The Lord has given us a new prefect about whom we hope for the best. I assume you have heard from others about the unfortunate death of Servetus. These days, some Genevans have again caused a commotion to overthrow church discipline, and because Mr. Farel seriously rebuked them, they arranged for him to be summoned to Neuchâtel with a certain notable insult to this excellent old man and another of their parents until he could plead his case. He appeared immediately. What more can I say? The Lord scattered the plans of the factious, but not without great danger of sedition, as all good people openly opposed their efforts. Finally, the better side won, and those defeated gave their hands to the most severe speech of the excellent man. Thus, by God's grace, everything is very well settled, so much so that there is great hope that great benefit will come to that church from this tumult and that soon the other disputes will also be settled. And so much for this matter.</p>
      <p>Nothing certain is brought to us from England. Ochino has returned to Geneva, but I have not yet seen the man. There is a rumor that the English parliament has opposed the queen's efforts, a tumult has been stirred up in Canterbury, and Ireland has openly defected from the queen. But all these things are reported only by uncertain rumors. In France, the tyrant continues to act as a tyrant. This is all I had to write.</p>
      <p>It remains, my father, that I commend myself to your prayers. I pray for the perpetual blessing of our Lord God for you and all the most esteemed brothers and your entire family. Farewell, my father. Lausanne, November 23.</p>
      <p>Theodorus Beza, your most devoted son. Mr. Viret and all of ours greet you warmly with the whole church.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
