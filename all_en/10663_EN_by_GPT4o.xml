    <p xml:id="regest1">Thomas Blarer reported in Bern about the insults faced by the followers of Zwingli in Württemberg. In contrast to [Ambrosius] Blarer, [Erhard] Schnepf judges the pastors based on their agreement with the Lutheran doctrine of the Lord's Supper. While Schnepf accompanies Duke [Ulrich] to King Ferdinand, [Johannes] Brenz will represent him. There is a danger that, similar to Augsburg, a false confession could be introduced in Württemberg. Thomas Blarer advises the Swiss to approach Duke [Ulrich] independently of the [Upper German] imperial cities. The Bern council will address the matter. What do the Zurichers intend to do? Haller asks for Bullinger's judgment on the question of the right of revenge. Thanks to [Christoph] Froschauer.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Although I have nothing new to write to you, dearest Heinrich, nevertheless, that good and pious young man wanted, indeed demanded, that I write on any given occasion. The opportunity was provided by Thomas Blarer, who, while discussing many things with us these days, among other things, indicated how poorly the Württemberg ministers are getting along. Some of Schnepf's followers do almost nothing in their sermons except to denounce and criticize the Zwinglian enthusiasts (Schwärmer) and sacramentarians, so that nothing is considered more odious than our name. However, those who are on Ambrosius's side teach sincerely about the Eucharist, suppressing all insults and slanders, which the others are full of, and when some are tested by Schnepf to see if they are fit for ministry, the first question is always about the cause of the Eucharist. If he is Lutheran, no matter how unlearned otherwise, he is admitted; if not, he is rejected and received by Ambrosius. Furthermore, he added that Brenz will act on behalf of Schnepf as long as he is with the prince at Ferdinand's court. In the end, it is to be feared that, with all united, both papists and Lutherans, they may be armed and encouraged against us through a fictitious concord to our destruction.</p>
      <p>Ursimus privately discussed with the man how this evil might be countered. He added a worse evil: the Augsburgers have prescribed a rule of reformed religion so twisted and mixed with ceremonies that it is more likely to be judged as a new papism than evangelicalism, and he expects the same daily from the Württembergers, where his brother, due to the multitude of others, can do little with his vote. Having understood all this, it seemed not absurd that the neighboring imperial cities, along with the Swiss, should visit the prince in writing or with envoys, propose to him, and finally obtain this, that we should not be so maligned by his Schnepfian followers, but that the neighboring prince should act as a proven and not inconvenient ally to us. He said it should not be attempted with the cities of the empire, since they are persuaded that there must be some ceremonies among the people of God. Therefore, since they so eagerly desire concord with Luther, they will hardly agree with us on this plan, but it is better for the Swiss cities to agree on this with mature deliberation, to ensure that this plan is conveyed to the prince either by envoys or in writing and to admonish him not to allow his people to think so perversely of us. We have therefore referred this matter to the dictators. They will consult at an opportune time in a few days. Meanwhile, write to me what seems more advisable to you in this matter, since we do not doubt that these things are being referred to you and others by our people, so that we can be prepared with advice, and do this as soon as possible; for delay may be dangerous for us, not because of the duke, but because of us. I hear you are preparing an apology. We would gladly see a copy of it if possible, although I have no doubt about you in all things. In summary: Whatever seems good to you or whatever you know more about this matter, let us know.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it often comes into controversy among us that in public judgment over murderers, the body is awarded to friends, so that it is free for them to take revenge, but the property goes to the magistrate, whereas the opposite should be done, namely, friends should be persuaded to forgive the murderer, the magistrate should take revenge, and if any property remains, it should be distributed to the family and children of the deceased. They cite the place in Numbers 36: "The avenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meets him" [Num 35:21]. Then others object: "Love your enemies" [Mt 5:44], "do not resist an evil person" [Mt 5:39], etc. You be the judge.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord for me; for with the hernia increasing, I can hardly endure much longer, although I still administer the word in the sermon.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell and continue, as you have begun, to benefit the churches and love me. Froschauer has been exceedingly generous to me. Thank him again in my name.</p>
      <p>August 3rd.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his brother, by far the dearest of all.</p>
