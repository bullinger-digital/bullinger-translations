      <p>S. You understood from the letters of our Abraham, most esteemed lord and father, that I have been absent from our city for several days.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I sent back to you through him those things which you sent to me, and for these I thank you. I have now returned from the bath, in which I had not intended to bathe, unless it had seized me in such a way that I could not leave it without danger. How beneficial it will be to me, I still do not know; certainly, I am still somewhat weak, with continuous discharges from the brain troubling all my internal parts. However, I hope for better things in due course; may the will of the Lord be done. Yesterday, the best and most prudent man, Mr. Claude de Madiis, one of the foremost, who not only loved and defended the purity of doctrine but also never ceased to oppose the French arts with all his might, passed away among us.</p>
      <p>Thus, the Lord takes away from us the elders and the more prudent; Thrasones succeed them, who seek neither religion nor the republic, but only private gains. But these things I confide to your bosom; I do not wish to have much business with them, except as the duty of my office requires. We have had no news from Geneva for a long time. Last month, the alliance we have with them was confirmed anew by oath on both sides as usual; for this must be done every decade on the first Sunday of May.</p>
      <p>I do not hear whether the Duke wishes to accept the proposed articles. Otherwise, there would be no delay in them. Moreover, we have nothing from France either; some affirm that peace is proceeding, others deny it. The captains from Fribourg have returned and have lost not a few of their men; they do not greatly triumph. Various reports come from Lower Germany: that Prince of Orange has already taken Maastricht or Upper Traiectum and several other cities; but this is not certain. Recently, a certain Hermann Modet passed through here, sent by the Belgian church, which is now in England; he told us amazing things about how those poor exiles, without any regard for the common calamity, are in turmoil among themselves in England, and what is most significant, not in matters of doctrine, but only in external and indifferent matters, especially whether sponsors should be used in baptism or not. Some want this and adapt themselves to the constitutions of the English bishops, others do not want it and wish to have the freedom of the church, as if this church freedom were to obey no ordinances. He was here in Geneva; but since he did not bring letters, they did not want to respond to his proposals.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he also did not want to propose anything here nor to travel to Zurich, which he had otherwise planned; but he went straight from here to Heidelberg. I have nothing else now, except that I wish health and safety to you and all yours. All of ours greet you. I hear you were in Königsfelden; I wish I could have been with you! You should have continued until you came here.</p>
      <p>We had Sultzer here, although I was not at home then; this little fox does not cease to plot against us.</p>
      <p>Steiger is in Münsingen. Mülinen, Diesbach, Gravenried, and Manuel greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 2, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
