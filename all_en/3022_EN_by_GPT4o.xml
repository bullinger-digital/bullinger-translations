      <p>S. P. I would seem to act imprudently in my judgment if I were to recommend Johann Burcher to you, with whom you already have, I believe, not only an old but also a close friendship. However, because I confess that I have received many acts of kindness from him, I do not ask you to assist him, as you will do this of your own accord, but I will show how you can assist him. You know what skill Konrad Zwick has in saving wood in cooking and heating rooms. To promote this, he needs more people. Since our Burcher is a man experienced in many things, prudent and skillful, and not only understands the Latin language but speaks it well, I think he would be useful to our Zwick in this matter if he were recommended to him by you, and I do not believe Zwick will take your recommendation lightly. However, I would like you not to mention me to him, as he has already used my services in this matter for almost a year and will continue to do so, lest he suspect anything sinister about me, which would be more of a hindrance than a benefit to Burcher. This seems to me to be the way to help Burcher again, which I sincerely desire.</p>
      <p>Do not trust your confederates more than is appropriate; for in Rome, they have implored the pope's help against you, although a certain cardinal dissuaded them from it.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 24th September 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Toxites.</p>
      <p>To the outstanding man in virtue, piety, and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed friend. Zurich.</p>
