      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We thank you for the two booklets and the two books of paper you sent; if more are made, we would like to receive some of them. We are also sending you something herewith for some of your expenses; please accept it kindly from us.</p>
      <p>We hold nothing of the Council of Trent; for it is neither Christian, honorable, nor proper and right. Our friendly, dear cousin Duke Christoph of Württemberg etc. has sent his envoys again, and he is expecting them every day. His written and personally signed confession has also not been heard or accepted, etc.</p>
      <p>The Turk is leading a large army into Hungary against the Roman king; they are pleading all the way to Augsburg in the city. The king does not have much money left, and the merchants are unwilling to lend more money. The Roman king wants to give them nothing more for the old debt if they do not provide more, and the merchants are being hard-pressed. Rightly so for the usurers, etc. We did not want to withhold this from you out of gracious intention.</p>
      <p>Dated the 23rd of January in the year 1552. We know nothing more than of a German prince who arrived at the royal majesty a few weeks ago, who has also been there for very few days, and we do not believe that anyone else of note has been there or arrived. We also believe, if it were otherwise, that we would have knowledge of it. We did not want to hide this from you out of gracious and sincere intention; we assume you are still mindful of this, as we wrote to you on previous days, if the Almighty grants us life so long, etc., then you will hear more, but now there is nothing to write or to command the pen. With that, we leave it for now, assuming that if we can do it for business and health reasons, we will visit the Rhine Falls in Zurich shortly. If we knew that in your circle you were also good-hearted and not cowardly and deceitful for necessary matters, indeed for the good of all Germans; but that belongs in the school. With this, be entrusted to God. Acted etc.</p>
      <p>Württemberg etc. written by my own hand.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to hand.</p>
