      <p>S. D. What I recently lamented to you may seem trivial, my esteemed and dearest Bullinger, if you compare it with what we have heard and are still hearing these past days; so much so that in this accursed case, the latter events are always worse than the former, that I see the measure of our city soon to be filled and dragged down to hell, Capernaum once exalted to the heavens. But the Lord, who knows His own well, may He rescue them from this most severe temptation like Lot, so that even the wicked may clearly understand that the Lord has not at all abandoned their care. But if He has perhaps once decided to involve the good with the bad, He will still make this cross a cause of salvation for the pious, which is destruction for others. If only I could discuss with you in person the completely perverse or rather utterly overturned state of the most miserable republic of Constance, as my mind desires! But you, together with us, implore that life-giving savior of ours, that He may seek and save what is so lost; for He once affirmed that the Son of Man came for this purpose.</p>
      <p>That Baron Nicholas of Bolwyl, who occupied the city in the king's name, returned to Constance the day before yesterday, from where he had departed a few days earlier. Soon, some other counts and doctors in title only will follow him, intending to establish Plato's republic (if it pleases the gods). Oh, the harshest servitude, which my people will serve, but by the very just judgment of the Lord, so that they may clearly understand how much the dominion of the Lord, whom they refused to serve with the cheerfulness of heart in peaceful tranquility, differs from the dominion of the princes of this world, which seemed so convenient and pleasant to them.</p>
      <p>One or two priests have moved into the city, but none of the canons (as they are called) yet, nor the bishop, and there are those who say they are greatly divided in opinions, some wanting, others absolutely refusing to move into the city, others fearing different things, as the wicked are wont to fear even the sound of a falling leaf, when they refuse to fear the Lord of Hosts, whom alone they ought to fear. May God grant that they and all those who have so shamelessly become traitors may return to their senses, lest they be utterly destroyed, which I see is about to happen to them soon. But what, I ask, should we pray for or what kind of vows should we make for those who, though prudent and knowledgeable, are continually carried into worse and are given over to all abominable and execrable impiety? Should we not rather, with the prophet, imprecate upon them that God may not be propitious to them, who oppose themselves with determined malice, that they may be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the just, that their days may be few and their offices be taken by others, that their memory may be abolished from the earth, and other such things which the prophet wishes to happen to them with ominous words? I would not indeed believe it a sin if someone, inflamed with zeal for the Lord, should devote their heads to the Furies in this manner, since they utterly despise the blessing of the Lord, being plainly worthy to be clothed with a curse as with a garment. Therefore, let us pray to the Lord for those who, although they are sinners, have not yet sinned unto death.</p>
      <p>I greatly congratulated Curio on that successful journey, which did not malignly respond to his expectation, when hope was given to him of a not regrettable condition.</p>
      <p>As for the fact that he did not deliver any of your letters upon returning from there and that he explicitly affirmed that no one except Hopper the Englishman had entrusted him with letters to bring to me, I am not yet quite sure how to interpret it; it troubles me greatly. Therefore, I also gravely remonstrated with him, the next messenger, to hear by what counsel he suppressed them or by what negligence he allowed them to slip away, poorly caring for them, as Curio suffered; for now (as one suspicion arises from another) I fear that Haller's letters may also have perished along with yours, to whom I wrote in such a way that I was surprised that he did not respond (if Curio speaks the truth). Furthermore, since I wrote to the excellent man Bufler through this same Curio, he also gave me nothing through him upon returning, so I suspect either fraud or negligence was committed here as well. I will indeed take care to find out shortly whatever is underlying, and I will make you certain of this as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Regarding Bern, I wrote why I decline the ministry of such a distinguished church, as I am accustomed to measure myself by my own foot, although there are also many other reasons besides the inconveniences of advancing age, among which not the least is that they affirm Haller, a truly learned and most pious and kind young man, whom I have begun to love as if by a secret agreement of nature, will return to you, who nevertheless wrote in his letters to me some time ago that nothing more desirable could happen to him than to have me joined with him in ministry, and that he desires to serve the Lord with me until death, which I could only understand as wishing that we would be fellow ministers of one church, which would also be my sole wish if other things were agreeable; for thus I would consider myself relieved of the greatest part of my anxiety. But concerning these things, the Lord will grant (if He wills) that we may discuss as much as is appropriate soon. Meanwhile, we will diligently pray to Him for the churches of Christ and their ministers, that they may happily rise up as a temple consecrated to His name through the pious diligence and indefatigable labor of these ministers, and that He may render us more and more worthy of the function of this holy ministry by the anointing of His Spirit.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable and more than dearest Bullinger, with your household, whom all of mine bid farewell in the Lord and commend themselves together with me to your sacred prayers. Greet Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, and all your administrators, along with the most excellent and holy men Musculus and Gervasius, Schöner, and that treasurer of the Palatinate, to whom I wish to add Butler and Hopper, not so much Englishmen as angels, that is, men of the purest spirit. As you wish, I will write to Sabina as soon as there is a courier.</p>
      <p>We have no special news, waiting to see what the lords, counts, knights, and doctors, who have arrived in Constance in the king's name, will do. It is said they will declare and impose the sworn oath, how the king wants to handle religion, taxation, withdrawal, and all other matters, and also appoint a new authority and come to an agreement with the bishop and priests on their claims in the king's name. Those from Künseck and Landau are also supposed to be there or at least come. The abbot of Kreuzlingen has hosted them from the moment some of them arrived, and he is also their guest; they are lying together above and below.</p>
      <p>I express my diligent and highest thanks for your faithful care for me and mine. May the Lord care for you and yours here and eternally. A stranger servant, who is also in the city, said to someone well-known to him these days that he is not pleased with the situation; his captain spoke to some among them, saying they must soon do a swift deed; I can well imagine what he means; but nothing will come of it. Those who have left are very close to the city at Münsterlingen, Emishofen, my brother at Girsberg, the city scribe at Bottighofen, Rickenbach, though not always in one place, and the servants go out daily for walks with half-pikes, so that the good people are warned; for if something disgraceful were soon inflicted on them, the [bailiff] would turn a blind eye, saying afterward that he knew nothing about it and was sorry; yet nothing would have helped the others. Others think they are now making such a fuss to see if they can scare the good people out of Thurgau; for they are a great thorn in their eyes; perhaps fearing that there is nothing, they might be plotting something, etc. But no one knows how it is, and it is said: everyone should beware of everyone.</p>
      <p>My dear brother has been at his Girsberg and at Emishofen for a while, but now he has also come out to us, leaving his dear wife with part of the children at Girsberg, sending you very, very heartfelt greetings with all good things, until he can write to you himself, he is still very weak due to his stomach ailment. My dear cousin C[onrad] Z[wick] stays at Münsterlingen, Stein, here, etc., has sent his four youngest sons to St. Gallen to Jacob Funckele, and sent the two eldest further away.</p>
      <p>One cannot yet hope from any indications that the expelled will be pursued again. The colonel has indeed inquired most diligently what is owed to them and what they owe, as if it seems that they want to pay the debts from their goods and then first exploit or draw into the king's chamber what is before; others think differently about it; it will soon be found out. And now these days, one is generally expected to become knowledgeable about the council; I praise God that you are asked for advice in it. Oh, what a good opportunity one would have now to show the other confederates how the councils have been held for a long time, how they should be held, and what belongs to it, that a proper, free, Christian, impartial council may be held, etc.</p>
      <p>But you know how to do it right. It would not be for my small understanding to give a negative answer to everything; for it gives birth to a bad reputation and a bad appearance among the common people; therefore, one should rightly be enlightened in it, but in such a way that they do not take it in that manner and one still retains the reputation. They are truly entrusted to God. I send this letter to Weill for the market.</p>
      <p>Given on November 16, 1548.</p>
      <p>A[mbrosius] Bl[aurer].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his friend as to an incomparable brother. Zurich.</p>
