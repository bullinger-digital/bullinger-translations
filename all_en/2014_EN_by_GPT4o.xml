      <p>Greetings. I have read your book, most learned and esteemed Coelius, written on the greatness of the blessed kingdom of God, but, as I had predicted, not with the diligence it deserved, not because I was unwilling, but because my duties did not allow it. Therefore, I do not presume to critique it; meanwhile, I remind you of a few things for the sake of our mutual friendship.</p>
      <p>From the beginning, you state that many things in theology have not yet been sufficiently explained. How most will receive this and think about what still lies hidden and must someday be brought to light, I leave to your judgment. I am certainly convinced that all things necessary for true salvation have already been revealed by the grace of God and sufficiently explained by both ancient and modern interpreters of divine scripture; for I do not think we should have nothing certain or complete and expect something new almost every year. However, I do not wish prophecy to be shortened or extinguished; for every age has its own diseases and particular issues, which divine prophecy addresses and resolves.</p>
      <p>Your method of discussion and expression is indeed very elegant; but it seems affected that you carefully avoid using any expression that even slightly resembles a Hebraism, such as preferring to call God's messengers "genii" rather than "angels," and other things of this kind. I seem to see that the apostles of Christ, not without great reason, when they could have spoken Greek and purely, preferred to retain some Hebrew idioms in a foreign language, which I am not sure we can render with such felicity that they have the same energy and grace when translated as they do in their original form.</p>
      <p>But I restrain myself here, lest the cobbler go beyond his last.</p>
      <p>Your method of discussion and expression seems to be alien to almost all interpreters of scripture and our religion, not because I prefer scholastic and barbarous methods, but rather those closer to the ancient theologians, holy martyrs, and vigilant leaders of the church, and not at all breathing the spirit of that haughty philosophy which is little favorable to apostolic simplicity.</p>
      <p>As for the matter itself that you treat, I do not approve of the rashness of those who contract the boundaries of the kingdom of God as narrowly as possible and contend that very few will be saved, as if they hold the exact number of the blessed. Therefore, I do not disapprove of what is gathered from the nature of divine mercy, the power of God, many testimonies of scripture, and the majesty of God, that the number of those to be saved is abundant. For who would not hope well for those of whom the chosen vessel Paul, preaching, says: "There is no distinction, the same Lord is Lord of all, rich to all who call upon him; for whoever calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved." But when you designate a certain and indeed golden time when that most ample number will come into the church, you will seem to many to want to bring back into the church the chiliasts long ago expelled. And since the number of Jews who remain has been reduced to a very small number, it does not seem that such a large addition has been made to the kingdom of God, even if after our age all Jews believe in Christ. Nor do I know well where I have read in the word of the Lord that he came once so that the whole world might be brought to one religion. Since we do not yet see this done, another time must remain in which it will happen, so that with all other religions abolished, the Christian religion alone will have a place among all. I know what the Lord said in Isaiah chapter 2 and in John chapters 10 and 11; however, if one compares other places with these, he will find that until the end of the world, even the prince of this age will have his own kingdom among the children of disobedience, and there will never be a time until the judgment when unbelievers will not rebel against God.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it seems strange to me that you have not considered Paul's statement: "The gospel has been preached to every creature under heaven," and what he says again: "God was manifested in the flesh, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, received up in glory."</p>
      <p>You establish three comings of the Son of God into this world, the first indeed in the flesh, the latter that illustrious one against the Antichrist, which you make an intermediate coming between the first and the last, by which the Antichrist is to be abolished, namely, to be crushed by kings, after which the gospel is to be preached again, undoubtedly in that golden age, until the final judgment, when Christ will come at last to judge the living and the dead. But I, my dear Coelius, recognize only two comings of Christ into this world, the first and the last; I do not recognize a latter; for he always acts in his people by his Spirit and word and by his illustrious operation through these. "Behold, I am with you," says the Lord, "until the end of the age." Hence, I am entirely ignorant if anyone has ever asserted this intermediate coming of Christ in the church. I know that all have consistently and concordantly confessed and asserted two comings of Christ into this world, namely, the first humble one in the flesh, and the latter or last glorious one in judgment. For Paul also says: "And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment, so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many (ἐκ δευτέρου) a second time or on another occasion without sin (undoubtedly, not to offer himself again as a sacrificial victim) will be seen by those who eagerly await him for salvation." The same Paul, speaking of the destruction of the Antichrist and the last coming of Christ, says: "Whom he will abolish (having first been consumed by the spirit of his mouth) with the brightness of his coming." Scripture clearly calls the last coming of Christ a bright or glorious coming; for in the gospel it says: "For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will reward each according to his works," and again: "And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." Paul most copiously describes this glorious coming of Christ in 2 Thessalonians chapter 1: "But that final victory and the abolition of the Antichrist is reserved for no kings, but for Christ alone, the King of kings."</p>
      <p>Consider also, my dear Coelius, whether this doctrine of the intermediate coming of Christ in glory, by which he is to abolish the Antichrist through kings and restore his kingdom on earth among all nations, will not render many otherwise secure enough and indeed much more secure, when they hear that the final judgment is not yet at hand, but that golden ages are first to come, in which all nations are to be united in one religion and the highest peace is to be on earth. Certainly, since the matter itself speaks and all the more prudent cannot deny that the signs which precede the final judgment have already occurred, those who awaken our torpid age to watchfulness, lest it be overwhelmed by the suddenly approaching day of the Lord, seem to do more worthwhile work. You know what has been most diligently handed down to us in the evangelical and apostolic doctrine concerning these things.</p>
      <p>I do not now mention certain places of scripture that seem to me to have been more harshly interpreted; for I have not intended nor could I praise many other things said excellently and explained learnedly as they deserve. I only advise you, out of my love for you, to carefully consider these things with yourself, lest you publish anything under your name now that you might later regret, and finally, that not only does not edify much, but also offends many good people and makes you ungrateful to them.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it seems to me very dangerous to first bring forth such an opinion, which, as you openly confess, no one in the church, either faithful or teachers of the faithful, has ever acknowledged or taught for fifteen hundred years. When I consider the utility that is hoped for from it, I do not see, in my limited understanding, such great utility that you should expose yourself to such great danger for its sake. The greatness of the blessed kingdom and the treasures of its mercy seem to be able to be taught in another and more suitable way, so that you may not seem to have neglected or erred in anything, even if you do not now publish a view that no one has seen or heard before. Your most learned erudition and eloquence can provide something more useful and more necessary for our age. I pray you take these things, as coming from a singular friend and brother, in good part. Live and farewell with your pious family. Zürich, September 20, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
