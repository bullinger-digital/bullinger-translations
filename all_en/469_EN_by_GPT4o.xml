      <p>Johannes Blasius to his esteemed Heinrich Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>I would be the most ungrateful of all mortals, wherever they may be, most revered man and brother in the Lord, if I did not acknowledge your spirit towards me and the benefits you have bestowed upon me. Indeed, you have bound me entirely to you and poured out all your kindness upon me, as you have finally extricated me from a rather perplexing business and freed me from various concerns, since Schwizer has testified with a sent document that he has been satisfied - whether by Cellarius or his father, I do not know. Furthermore, I do not know what else to ask of you. However, I know it is my duty not only to express gratitude but also, when the opportunity arises, to return great thanks, and to take every precaution to ensure that you never regret having expended effort and benefits on an ungrateful and absurd person. Lastly, so that we may continually trouble you, we eagerly await your twenty sermons along with the forty theological loci; therefore, ensure that we receive both, with the added price, which we will certainly send to the bookseller at the next market. For Augustin finally conducts his book trade with us at Pentecost; we do not wish to be deprived of the sacred theological loci and your most holy sermons for so long. Farewell, most steadfast man of God, in Him who can preserve you for us and His wavering church, amen.</p>
      <p>Chur, 19th of March, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours to the altar. Comander, the consul, and all other good men send their regards to you.</p>
      <p>To the great and true theologian Heinrich Bullinger, most steadfast bishop of the most ample church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
