      <p>Greetings. This excellent young man delivered your letters to me, which were welcome. I give thanks for them, which you conveyed, and I ask you, my dear Bullinger, to write when you have the truth of those matters I inquired about in my last letters. For this year, there will be serious dealings between the Emperor and the King; for the King does not want peace, nor will it happen, whatever the Emperor's men attempt, unless the German princes are involved, which I do not expect; for they cannot better bid farewell to their liberty. All is well with us. The whole of Corsica is French; if the Emperor's men, along with the Genoese, attack this winter, as they say, they will be met by brave men.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, in France, it is quite peaceful except for the usual skirmishes, which occur on both sides at the borders. The Emperor's son is considering marrying the Queen of England; but now I hear that Milord Courtenay, whom the Queen has released from long imprisonment, will marry her. I am expecting the new secretary, who was with you, by the first post, and he will bring all the certain news from France, which I will immediately report. I greet the lords and you most affectionately. Farewell, excellent man. From Freiburg, November 3rd.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassefontaine.</p>
