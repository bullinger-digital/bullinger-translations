      <p>Most beloved godfather, the fourth Decade of your sermons was brought to me by Mangold, formerly of Constance, now your fellow citizen, for which I thank you, though not as much as it deserves, yet as much as I can; I wish that the diligence and convenience of a judge had been added to this work of yours; for there would have been a certain ease in pursuing and consulting each one, especially for those who eagerly seek some things, arranging their readings according to the circumstances of these times.</p>
      <p>My Psalter is still groaning under the press and will not be completed before the Martinmas fair; Hervagius sent part of it; I wish many things were printed more correctly; but it must be endured.</p>
      <p>Everything at my home is conducted quite peacefully, thanks be to the Lord, and I do not doubt that yours are also doing very well. We must pray to the Lord to preserve us in this peace and grant to His people that they confirm with the piety of life what they hear among foreigners because of His word; we are called evangelicals, though many correspond little to the gospel, so it is to be feared that the hour of temptation and the fire of trial will soon come. My daily prayers are: Spare, Lord, spare your people, lest our enemies boast over us and say: Well done, well done. Our eyes have seen.</p>
      <p>As I hear, horrible portents are seen in Saxony, about which if you know anything certain, I beg you to share. I cannot write more; for I have to read after the hour. Farewell very well, most beloved lord godfather and brother in the Lord. Greetings to all yours in my name and in the name of mine, likewise to all the lords and brothers. I wrote to you on the 18th of this month and do not doubt that you have received it. Bern, August 22, 1550.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musc[ulus], your godfather in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian M. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, lord and most beloved godfather in Christ.</p>
