      <p>Most Revered Father, I know you are wondering what has finally been decided by our leaders in that very serious matter. Therefore, I will write to you before my arrival and briefly inform you, as much as is possible at present, about what has happened in these days. The Rhaetian, after realizing that the people were very displeased with such bulls being sent to Rhaetia by our Roman enemy, quickly wanted to hold a sub-assembly, where he could excuse himself by talking and nicely bandage whatever wound had been inflicted. On the 2nd and 3rd of January, about 20 syndics gathered, among whom, in our presence, he began to mitigate everything with a long speech. For we, having entered the council of the Three Leagues, defended ourselves and washed away those seditious stains with which the Rhaetian had even publicly besmirched us in letters to our council. I freely told him to his face that there was no troublemaker unless he wanted to play and imitate the role of Ahab, the slanderer, against Elijah.</p>
      <p>Perhaps we could be such troublemakers, who indeed would be considered seditious by the impious, but truly that title fits Ahab and his whole house, because he has abandoned the truth and followed Baal. Ahas took this very badly and considered himself and his religion to be mocked. In other matters, he showed himself to be very friendly and flattering, except that he tried to make himself blameless and shape himself through his evasions. 'For what danger is there to us from these bulls? I never asked the pope to give these to me; I never undertook anything relying on them. Whom among foreign bishops or magistrates have I ever called for help? What, I ask, have I done wrong, for which I should be proclaimed by you as an innovator and troublemaker? Tell me,' he said to me, [what do you have to blame in these bulls?] I replied that we had not entered to tear anyone apart, but to candidly refute the insults that had been unjustly hurled at us, causing great scandal to the weak. As for his question, the bulls themselves, if asked, could speak both Latin and Italian and German; it is not for us to add or subtract anything; the matter is clear in itself. And while he thus made himself free from all blame, the Praegallian syndic Andreas rose, saying: 'Why do you, sir, excuse yourself, as if you have never attempted anything relying on these bulls?</p>
      <p>Did you not seize the provostship, when you took both the bulls and your son the dean with you and wanted your son alone to be saluted as the holder of this dignity by the authority of this bull? [Response:] This is not true.'</p>
      <p>R. [The Praegallian envoy confirms this.] And while they argued and quarreled for a long time, finally that [You lie] followed. But who doubts this, as if it is not clear what the Rhaetian did in that place? What he could not accomplish, he now tries to soften with the sweetest interpretations, so that he suffers no harm, etc. It was decreed to refer this matter, but sparingly, to the communities that are to be established; no further danger threatens us; therefore, it should be considered whether they want to rest in this way, since all the bulls have been handed over, etc. The matter of the provostship is in a worse state than before.</p>
      <p>For previously, in a full council, it was decreed that each party should refer their matter to the communities. Now, in these smaller and sub-assemblies, it has been simply decreed by the lords to write to the communities, to which party they want to transfer that provostship, to the Guiccardis or the Rhaetian. Thus, the opportunity for the Guiccardis to prove to the communities that they have rightly used the goods of this provostship so far and have converted them to the uses of the gospel has been cut off. And because gold follows the law, there is great danger that this provostship will be decreed to the Rhaetian, which will henceforth yield to drones and lazy monks and superstition.</p>
      <p>Only three were there who wanted the whole matter, as it has been conducted so far and what poison the bulls contain, to be narrated to the people. All the rest thought it sufficient that the bulls had been extorted and that no further danger threatened the communities from them. We, lest any error be committed by our negligence or silence, are now anxiously working to depict the whole matter, not half, but the whole, as it was conducted, to the symmists throughout Rhaetia, by whose gradual work the people may be instructed and that scandal or abomination may be removed from the midst. Not only the bulls make us restless, but also the number of those knights of the bull, which increases more and more every day to our great detriment and that of the whole country. We are strongly urging that both the people and the magistrates understand what danger threatens our freedom and religion from these sworn vassals of the pope; therefore, they should urge that these be stripped of their collars and letters, which, along with the bulls, should be consecrated to Vulcan.</p>
      <p>It should also be guarded against by public law, lest anyone allow themselves to be adorned or rather defiled by such stipends, or be declared a public enemy of the country. Would that we might reap this fruit from this most shameless Rhaetian business! But I know what the situation is and what reputation we gain from this our zeal. Immediately they will say: 'See the troublemakers and seditious priests. They cannot be satisfied with our proclamation and announcement; they themselves fully publish the whole matter, so that the peasants may be moved and stirred up against us.' But they deal unjustly with us, who in all and each of our letters to the brothers cannot sufficiently inculcate that they should not be eager for new things, nor lovers of disturbances; but they should exhort the people to oppose this evil in the manner of their ancestors and in decent order.</p>
      <p>The Praegallians wrote vehement letters to us, urging us to be cautious and not to conceal anything that might be detrimental to the communities in the future. Other serious men also warned us not to create danger for ourselves by sparing others. We, however, simply propose the matter to the brothers without adding or exacerbating anything, and we strongly advise them not to say that we have written. Now let the Lord's will be done. I write this so that less favorable rumors from others may not, by anticipating the truth and the matter as it will be conducted, arouse any sinister suspicion about us and bring it to you.</p>
      <p>Unless it is most strictly guarded against, lest any such commerce be exercised with the Roman pontiff, I do not see how this evil can be rightly put to rest, even if we have the bulls in our hands, which the pope can easily repair with other lead and another skin, if he wishes. But: accursed hunger for gold, what do you not compel mortal hearts to do?</p>
      <p>I fear that some great change is looming over the necks of the leaders, unless they prove themselves stronger in such cases, of which we have had several very sad ones within a decade, some of which I also recounted when we were purging ourselves, starting with the Spanish and papal demands to the Rhaetians a decade ago, and I also recounted the plunder or robbery of our Cellarius, likewise the loss of the Bellizarii, the Perons, etc., the expulsions of Mr. Beccaria and Truntani from the Misaucia Valley by the bishop's letters, etc. I also warned them to finally open their eyes.</p>
      <p>But many, especially from the Upper League, took this our admonition badly, shaking their heads as if they, being sharper than others, needed no admonition, etc.</p>
      <p>I fear, I say, some great danger; for thus on the 2nd and 3rd of January, at the same hours, when they had sat down to consult, God warned from above with a miraculous variation of the sun. For at the eighth hour in the morning, the sun appeared strange and varied, only in the shape of a semicircle, the rest as if dead, on which seemed to stand the form of forests and flexible trees and of those jumping among themselves or driven here and there by the wind. I did not notice or see this; but many both from the council and from the dregs of the populace observed it, etc.; we will inquire more diligently. - It is written that the Turk is arming himself again, but with a very numerous infantry. That Venetian cardinal is said to have achieved nothing in the name of the pope with the emperor, as there are still truces for five years with the Turk. Therefore, he turned his course to the Pole for the sake of the same alliance.</p>
      <p>From our court, January 7, 1572.</p>
