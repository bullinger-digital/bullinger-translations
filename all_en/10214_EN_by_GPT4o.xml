    <p xml:id="regest1">Outraged by the leniency shown by the envoys of the arbitration sites, especially Bern, in settling the mandate dispute with the Five Places. The reformed places would have enough support in the event of war from the Landgrave of Hesse and the imperial cities, but they do not dare to accept their offer. The people of Basel are striving for harmony between Bern and Zurich. Rumors of an imminent threat from the Five Places, which are said to be supported by Emperor Charles V. Haller promises to keep Bullinger's letters safe, but fears that his own letters might fall into foreign hands in Bullinger's house. He requests Bullinger's interpretation of the Epistle to the Romans and Pellican's commentaries on the Old Testament.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Upon reading your letter, dearest Heinrich, I could not sufficiently marvel at the audacity and stupidity of the envoys, who not only attempt to tarnish your reputation but also ours, a stain that could hardly be cleansed even by the Rhine, especially by our own people, who have long been given the power to make peace, provided it does not detract even a bit from the glory and word of God. What else do these prayers aim for but the very denial of truth and the confession of impiety? The wise are astonished and continue to marvel, waiting to see how they will eventually wish to wash away this audacity. In short: the Lord offers us every opportunity by which His glory could be promoted, yet we disregard them all. How conveniently many things could now be negotiated with the envoys of the Landgrave of Hesse and the imperial cities for mutual defense. But no one dares to speak to them. We fear those Antronians so much. The people of Basel are working among our more sensible ones for a path to concord. Our people will deny nothing, provided they are approached by others. You can excuse us to your people, and I will write to you shortly, unless you learn beforehand by what means these prayers were concocted.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor among us, which I did not want to believe in writing, that threatens us with calamity from the Antronians with the connivance of Emperor Charles. Moreover, I observe your letters so that if you demand even to the smallest detail, they will be ready. I know your house is open to all, and I feared what once happened to me, that friends might read what I would rather have buried.</p>
      <p>If you send the Romans, you will gratify me greatly. Continue successfully. All the parish priests are waiting. If anything is added to Pellican's commentaries in the meantime, let it be sent, although I have already received up to the 16th chapter of 3 Kings through Balthasar. Write continually, it is very beneficial.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>The last day of January.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a man of exceptional piety and learning, pastor in Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
