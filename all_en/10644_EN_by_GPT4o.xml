    <p xml:id="regest1">Is very grateful that Melchior Volmar treated him so kindly based on Bullinger's recommendation; he will do everything possible to ensure that the merits of the people of Zurich [in Isny] are recognized and appreciated, especially by [Peter] Buffler, to whom Bullinger - as he learned from [Georg] Binder - will still write.</p>

      <p>Doctor Melchior Volmar is still with us, and based on your most friendly recommendation, he treats and supports me so kindly that I certainly do not know how to express my gratitude to both you and him; however, I see very clearly how much your authority holds with him, as he strives in every way to satisfy your commands by doing good to me; furthermore, I understand very clearly what I can hope for from you; for if you entrust me to others so diligently, what would you not offer me yourself if the opportunity arises. But go on, most humane and learned man, in promoting my affairs, and you will make this mutual; for I too (if at least something can be added to your praises and authority) am very busy in increasing them, and I will not desist until I have proven that you think and act most rightly in all matters, which I have now obtained with many, especially with Buffler, to whom I learned from Binder's letters that you will write shortly, not without great pleasure.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From our school, 6th of the Nones of July (July 2nd).</p>
      <p>Benedikt Euander.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most Christian preacher of Zurich, his most esteemed teacher and lord.</p>
