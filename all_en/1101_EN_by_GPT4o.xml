      <p>Greetings. Some students coming from Bologna and going down to Saxony believed that these should be sent to you, dear brother, promptly. I received them gladly for the sake of our love, and because I have now found a reliable courier, I am sending them to Bern to our people. We live here, as always, in the grace of Christ. I could not write more. The courier hurried. All the brothers love you, all greet you. Farewell forever and commend me to Burgundy. ZÃ¼rich, December 6, 1550. Greet all the brothers, especially Gallasius and the excellent Farellus.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his esteemed lord and brother, most dear and incomparable.</p>
