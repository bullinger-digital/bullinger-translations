      <p>Greetings. I cannot be lengthy, both because there is a lack of material and because business matters impede me. The day before yesterday, the most distinguished man, Mr. Christoph Montius, came here; I assisted him as much as I could. Today, his case was discussed before the senate and postponed to the next Monday, so I cannot write anything certain about it yet. However, as far as I can sense, he will receive a response not unlike the one he received in Zürich.</p>
      <p>The treasurer has taken up the Wedischvylense case with utmost fidelity; he bids you to hope for the best; he will take care of everything properly. He also wants me to inform you that he has received certain things through Musculus, which he wishes to address; furthermore, he sends you many greetings. Today, I received another letter from you, which relieves me of great anxiety, as I hear that mine have been delivered to you; they contain nothing to which I need to respond, except for what the senate secretly sent us regarding your consistorial constitutions. I am exceedingly glad that the same law is also held among you; now it will be easy to maintain it. I do not know what troubles Negelinus, whether it is something private or public; a more austere man has rarely come my way; his harshness often deeply pricks my mind. But what can I do? As the man is, so must you deal with him. He is harsh; the other consul does not care for me at all; although I often offer myself to him with the utmost display of goodwill. I see that this discord can be removed in no other way than through dangers. We will pray to the Lord that He may be with us perpetually. Farewell. Mr. Montius, Musculus, and my family send you greetings. We wish all yours to be well. I sent letters to Mr. "...? today to Biel; I also wrote to the same for Mr. Gervasius; I hope we will obtain something.</p>
      <p>In Bern, December 14, 1549. It is reported here that Rome is surrounded by two armies; on one side, the governor of Milan is besieging it, on the other, the viceroy of Naples is pressing the cardinals to elect Ferdinand; the French envoys have fallen into the hands of the Imperialists and have been despoiled; they were dealing with the election of the cardinal of Metz.</p>
      <p>I am sending you at the same time letters from Mr. Calvin and Farel, which I received yesterday. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Yours, if (as?) he is his own, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zürich, his venerable lord and compatriot.</p>
