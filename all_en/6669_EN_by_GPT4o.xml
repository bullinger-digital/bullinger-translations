      <p>[...] We must pray to the Lord, that... tranquility may come... A week or two ago, I sent you the history of our councils regarding the publication of the confession of faith for the favor of the Palatinate and so that our churches may be less condemned at the imperial diet by the Emperor, who is said to be now acting in Augsburg and plotting something against the true religion. May the Lord defend His churches. Now I submit to you what has been done since the last things you read and sent back; send them back at the first opportunity you get.</p>
      <p>Now I am entirely focused on publishing the Latin Exposition and translating it into German; thus, I am never granted leisure. But I most gladly labor in the Lord's vineyard. However, I hope that soon I will be called by Him to the blessed seats, which I earnestly desire, being more than weary of this life, etc. Tomorrow I will send a special messenger to Heidelberg; therefore, I have many letters to write now; you will forgive me if I am brief. If you have any certain news from Italy, share it with us and greet Mr. Consul, Balthasar the interpreter from Gryssach, Pontasella, etc. Beza writes (I am just now receiving letters) that in France the Castilian family is being reconciled with the Guise family. I have nothing else to share from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and all good people.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 1, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest compatriot and brother. Chur.</p>
