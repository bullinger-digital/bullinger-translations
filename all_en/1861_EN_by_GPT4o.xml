      <p>Strasbourg, May 1, 1553.</p>
      <p>Greetings. The son of the late Erasmus Fabricius gave me your most welcome letters, most esteemed Bullinger: if I could be of service to him or anyone else, I will never fail; for he is highly recommended to me in the name of the people of Zurich, who travel here from you. In Frankfurt, I arranged for letters and books to be sent to England for the English. We received your sermons on Jonah, which my wife greatly enjoys. We also received the small sum of money some time ago, as I recently wrote. The package for Mr. Wolfgang of Worms was not brought by the young men, but they included it with their other belongings, and it will not be delivered before our market days. When I receive it, I will send it safely. Mr. Christoph Montius is alive and well: he was away for some time, which was the reason for the silence. I greeted and reminded the man in your name: he promised to write.</p>
      <p>We have certain news, which I gladly write, so that you might rejoice with us. In place of the late Mr. Heduonis, we have acquired a man both learned and a supporter of true religion, who teaches and lectures publicly on divine matters. He opposes the Lutherans and all who attribute the properties of Christ's human nature solely to divinity.</p>
      <p>The Lutherans confuse, if not in words, then in reality, the natures of Christ. He publicly opposes this and dares to accuse them of error. If only their eyes could be opened, so that they do not remain blind while seeing! Regarding German affairs and the war, I hear this. On May 16, the princes and commissioners of the Emperor and Ferdinand will meet in Frankfurt to settle the discord. If only it would happen!</p>
      <p>Margrave Albrecht of Brandenburg killed several soldiers of the priests; some say four hundred, others five hundred. He plundered others, taking an oath that they would not move arms against him or the Emperor for three months. In England, everything is quiet by the great benefit of God. Our king has already sent envoys twice to the Emperor and the French to settle the war.</p>
      <p>If only it would happen! I will write what has been done when I find out. Greet your wife and dear children in the name of my wife and myself. Greet all the learned and pious. Farewell. Greet our Butler many times with his dear wife.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, John Burcher, Englishman. To the bishop of true religion, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed friend and lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
