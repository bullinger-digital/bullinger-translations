      <p>Greetings. I received your earlier letters, dear brother, along with the letter from our Lentulus to you. Yesterday, I also saw your later letters written to Mr. Johann Baptist Müller and Lentulus, which were again included in yours. What is reported there by Lentulus is also confirmed by Mr. Laurentius Lumaga, coming directly from the city of the Venetians. What I have at present, I have hastily inserted here, and therefore it is almost written poorly.</p>
      <p>Various matters excuse me. Another, as I certainly know, would not have devoted himself to you so much, being so occupied and distracted, miserable and sick, as I am.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord for me. Greet the honorable consuls, Mr. Campell, the younger Pontisella, Francis Bonet, Mr. Gregor, and Mr. Victor, and our other friends whom you know, especially your wife with children and Mr. Lentulus, etc.</p>
      <p>June 4, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in virtue and learning, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
      <p>It is said that some disobedient people have fled from my lords with the 15 banners to the Netherlands; however, that it is such a significant number as is claimed, it is not. I believe that not more than 3 have left the city, who otherwise could not stay. Those who have left, the bailiffs have left all their abandoned goods, whatever they have, to my lords' hands. All bailiffs have also been written to, since a French uprising is also supposed to be present now, that they should keep an eye on the deserters, and wherever they can catch them, they should bring my lords' people back in captivity; for their body and life, they will be judged, and the disobedient should also be captured and sent back in chains. Letters have been sent to the places and they have been warned to tell their leaders that they should not accept my lords' people and lead them away. If they do it despite the warning, if they then encounter the leaders' goods, they will take them as punishment into their hands, and if they encounter them themselves, they will be judged.</p>
      <p>It is said, however, that when the leaders' meeting was in Solothurn on Urban's day, the ambassador showed that the king needed soldiers; but since there is no money, it cannot come out safely; however, one should lend to the king for the uprising; it must then be repaid with thanks and honor. And Balthasar is supposed to ride to the court in haste. If this is so, it will be heard soon.</p>
      <p>I think, for the sake of lending, no one is at home. From France, strange things are written and said, and it is certain that it has never been more restless and dangerous in France. The best nobility, even the Catholic, flee to the countryside; for no one is safe from the king's rage. He is said to have captured many of the nobility, some have been judged. Montmorency, the marshal, and his brother Meruni along with Marshal Cossei and Bishop Valentinus, who is in Poland, are all said to be beheaded, some lords quartered. Alençon and Navarre are said to be condemned to perpetual imprisonment; some say the mother too. The evangelicals are said to be strongly assembled in some places. The French say Montgomerie has been defeated by the king's forces, and yet they say they fear Montgomerie might snatch the money that belongs to the Confederation. If he were defeated, why would they need to fear? etc. Not a word is said about the 15 banners, where they have come to in the Netherlands. It is said, however, that Duke Christoph is supposed to have ridden in with 12 horses and not returned; likewise, Count Hannibal is said to be badly shot, but not yet dead; the others are said to have died in battle. What truth there is, time will reveal.</p>
      <p>Those coming from Vienna say the Turks are very restless, making many raids from the borders, so that one almost doubts the peace; yet Maximilian has his embassy at the Turkish court to negotiate peace.</p>
      <p>From Dresden in Saxony, it is written that the preacher Mr. Christianus preached before the prince about all things, how we hold the sacrament. The elector sent to him, asking if he would persist in it. Answer: "Yes, with God, and I will also die for it." The Duke of Saxony had him imprisoned and after more than 14 days asked him again if they would remain in it. Answer as above.</p>
      <p>Then he called his council to discuss what to do about the matter.</p>
      <p>Among others, Doctor Crocus, the chancellor, stood up and said he was also of the faith and asked that the prisoners be heard. But the prince dismissed the chancellor and took another. The prisoners were released; they, along with the chancellor, had to swear in their houses and not leave under penalty of life. Meanwhile, the prince is supposed to be willing to hold a disputation with all his learned men in Saxony, etc. It is well to pray to God for grace, that he may reveal the truth and bring the hostile tension to an end, though I fear it is not yet time. But God, who can do all things and is merciful, may help bring forth his truth, etc.</p>
