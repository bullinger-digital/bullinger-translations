    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for two letters delivered by [the Capuchin monk] Hieronymus from Naples and Celio Secondo [Curione]; as the age, so are the people: The present time is characterized by changes, and likewise, people have a desire for new things. Thanks for Bullinger's courteous attention. The messenger [Nikolaus Pfister?] reports better orally about the turbulent conditions [in Graub√ºnden]. Greetings to Bullinger and his colleagues, also from Johannes Blasius.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocent life from the Lord. I have received two letters from your kindness, most learned Bullinger, one through Brother Hieronymus from Naples, the other through Celio Secondo, in which you informed me of many things. As the age, so are the people; the present age is filled with sudden changes and is astonishing, and likewise, people are very eager for new things. I am very grateful to you for your diligent attention towards me, who is undeserving. I would write to you about our affairs, which are as afflicted as they are scattered and disturbed, if the messenger himself had not been so suitable for this task, who could report everything much better in person. From him, you will hear everything accurately and most certainly. May you continue to hold me in your commendation as you have until now, and convey my greetings to the brothers. Farewell. From the court of Rhaetia, on the sixth day before the Kalends of October 1542. Our brother Johannes Blasius greets you and all the brothers in Zurich. Yours most devotedly, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the city of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
