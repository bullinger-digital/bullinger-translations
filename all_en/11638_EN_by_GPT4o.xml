    <p xml:id="regest1">He is also unhappy about the appearance of the [„Dialogus Neobuli“] and the debauchery [of Philip of Hesse] behind it; the author [Johannes Lening] is not identical with the pious Strasbourg theologian [Johannes] Lenglin; given the explosive situation, which could even end in a war, it is better to remain silent about the matter; Bullinger is right to focus on his [Matthew] commentary instead of reading such disgraceful works. Greetings, also from the sick [Johannes] Zwick.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>I am also exceedingly grieved, not only because this book has been published, and that in German, but because the licentious intemperance of certain princes has dragged good men into the discussion of this monstrous subject, whether they wanted to or not. May the Lord grant them a better mind, so that they may contemplate things worthy of Christian heroes in this most dangerous time, where the affairs of Germany are in a worse state than ever. It is easy to make a judgment about the author of the book.</p>
      <p>He is not Johannes Lening in Strasbourg, as you write, but a certain Lenglin, a learned and pious minister of the Gospel; but he is far from being the one who published this dialogue. I know well that not only this author, but also some other men of the first rank, hold the same opinion on polygamy, and hence I greatly fear that a fierce and bloody war will ensue if this matter, whatever its evil or very untimely foolishness, is imprudently stirred up; so I think it wiser to prudently overlook it with dissimulation than to provoke the hornets to the greater harm of the church, especially since there are very few copies available. I will anxiously pray to the Lord that the highest leaders of His church may once and for all direct all their efforts to extend the boundaries of His kingdom and wholeheartedly pursue what is edifying. You, my venerable and dearest brother, are doing the right thing by being so careful that the reading of these infamous materials does not harm the publication of your excellent commentaries; for it is better to proceed steadily in all things than to resist these odious hindrances, which can be leapt over. May the Lord preserve you for us and for His church, strong and whole for a long time; whom you faithfully intercede for us.</p>
      <p>Greet my most chaste wife in my words, along with your entire household. Our dearest brother Zwick, who is held by a very slow illness, although, as we hope, out of danger of life, commends himself to the prayers of all of you. We would like him to be restored by the Lord to his ministry, to which he is very useful, as soon as possible. To this end, diligently ensure it with your prayers as well. Greet all our friends and brothers. All of ours send you their greetings most dutifully. Farewell, my most esteemed Bullinger. January 9, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
