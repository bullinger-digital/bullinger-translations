    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends the bearer of the letter, the Augsburg mayor Wolfgang Rehlinger, who is on his way to Bad Pfäfers with two companions and wishes to make Bullinger's acquaintance; perhaps they should be recommended to the Abbot [Johann Jakob Russinger]. Even though the danger is averted for the moment due to the postponement of the council [to Mantua] by a year, forces are still at work to destroy the evangelical doctrine; has also written to Lavater, who will discuss this with Bullinger. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of God, increase of faith, and my friendly greetings beforehand, well-learned, honorable, dear sir and brother.</p>
      <p>Mr. Wolfgang Rehlinger, mayor of Augsburg, bearer of this letter, a pious, learned gentleman and good Christian, who holds true to the gospel, desires to come into your acquaintance (as with a pious, learned man). I am confident you will hear from him (if it is considered with heart and reason) nothing harmful, but very beneficial for maintaining common Christian peace, for the edification and governance of the Church of Christ. May he be commended to you. Additionally, he has a doctor, who is on behalf of his lords from Augsburg to Schmalkalden, and another one. All three are related to each other. You may speak confidentially with them. They wish to go to the baths in Pfäfers. If it is necessary, to recommend them to the abbot or otherwise provide them with other helpful support, to assist them and have them recommended.</p>
      <p>The council has been postponed for a year, but truly for no other reason than to our detriment; for this time the Lord has taken the sword from their hand, so they cannot use it against us, but they expect to regain it in a year. Dear sir, the matters are important; we will not remain unchallenged. All counsel and practices are directed towards the eradication of the gospel; it will become apparent at the opportune time (even from those who should be our best friends). Yet God will preserve His honor and word (even in our ruin). It is truly necessary for us to be more earnest and fervent in this matter than we have been so far. I have also written to Mr. Lavater. He will discuss these matters with you. I hereby commend you to the Lord from the heart.</p>
      <p>Greet Master Leo, Pellican, the brothers in general, and all those who love the Lord from the heart.</p>
      <p>From Basel, the 24th of May, in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Jacob Meyer.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and well-learned in divine scripture, Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word and bishop of the church in Zurich, my dear sir and brother.</p>
