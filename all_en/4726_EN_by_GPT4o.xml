      <p>Greetings. I have received everything you sent and I am very grateful to you.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord to keep you safe with us for a long time, so that you may greatly benefit the church with your labors. I think there is someone among the scholars there who can translate your latest treatise on the words of the Lord from John 14 into the German language. This would be useful for the Germans, who are mainly held by the opposite error.</p>
      <p>If there is no one, let me know; perhaps I will lend a hand, especially for our people in Augsburg. I showed our Musculus what you wrote, and perhaps he himself will respond.</p>
      <p>The Polish letters pleased him greatly; I do not doubt that this treatise will also please him. As for me, you know how much I like all your works.</p>
      <p>You wish to know what our friend replied. What did he reply? He evades and blames certain people who preach more excitedly in the countryside and seem to call for arms. Meanwhile, even someone not very astute can smell what the matter is; yet I hope in the Lord's power, who will assist his churches all the more, the less they are cared for by men.</p>
      <p>I forgot to write to you recently about the remarkable skirmish and almost battle that occurred after the Neuchâtel assembly between some peasants and the ministers of the Duke of Savoy's envoys; it seems to have some prelude to what follows. When the day came to leave Neuchâtel, the two gentlemen, the Duke's envoys, boarded a ship and sailed across the lake to Yverdon; however, they sent their servants with the horses overland.</p>
      <p>On the way, they came to a village called Bevaix, belonging to the late Schultheiss of Wattenwyl, located in the lordship of Colombier between Neuchâtel and Grandson. There, the same riders, as they had ridden through the previous day, behaved somewhat arrogantly and shouted: "Here Sapfoy" etc. When they came back again, they behaved even more arrogantly, which the peasants had anticipated and therefore waited for them. When they began to harass a poor woodcutter and do who knows what else, the peasants rushed in, attacked them, and put them to flight, and, as some say, wounded over 12 of them. When they came to Yverdon to their lords, they were poorly received and dismissed from service as soon as they arrived on the Duke's land. What will follow, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>Our people are surprised that the Duke's envoy does not come, who was supposed to travel with ours to each district to obtain arbitrators; they wish no one would come, and may it be so! I send you this small cheese as a token of my gratitude to you; please accept it kindly and eat it soon; for this kind does not tolerate aging. All of ours greet you; may your whole house be safe along with all brothers and friends. Bern, March 23, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I just heard today that on Saturday, March 15, some Burgundian riders allegedly captured the Württemberg bailiff at Elgg, belonging to the County of Montbéliard, and took Elgg. It is thought that unrest will follow.</p>
      <p>It is also thought that something is coming from Salamanca, who years ago did something Spanish with the old Duke of Württemberg and lost the case. But I think you already have more certain information from Basel.</p>
      <p>Regarding Zwingli, good people think that if he himself had come, something would have happened; for it is known that he was always favorable and often showed that he wanted to be involved. I think that the Steiners from Wildenhus in the Thurtal will soon come back; for they have accepted the verdict made between them and the heirs here only on the condition of the approval of the remaining relatives at home, who might also have claims. There, Master Ulrich might inquire about them when they want to come, and if he then comes with them, I hope something might happen with the help of the Decurions and others. I wanted to inform you of this with the best intentions.</p>
      <p>Whatever good I could do and help, I would not spare you. I sent the Saffoijer point back to you earlier via Herlin to my brother. After I finished these, Löffelsperger stayed here for three more days for certain reasons. Today, March 26, I hear the Duke of Württemberg is writing to our people not to allow the enemy passage; for he will avenge the injury inflicted. I await what you will write about this matter.</p>
      <p>There is unrest. The people of Biel first wrote this to our people.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
