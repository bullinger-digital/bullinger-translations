    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger does not understand why the news of Constance's capitulation disturbs Myconius so much! Is Helvetia already lost just because it could be attacked by the occupying troops of Emperor Charles V from the neighboring strong cities of Waldshut and Laufenburg, just as well as from Constance? Constance cannot redeem the Confederates, nor can it cause their ruin. God is the redeemer! Constance would only become a disaster for the Confederates if they, out of some laziness or fear, spurned the help offered by God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Myconius should know that the Zurich authorities have tried everything. But success was not achieved, not because they were negligent, but for reasons unrelated to them. Myconius asks why the Zurichers did not offer protection to Constance (whether alone or together with the other [Protestant] places). And what if they tried many other things with the people of Constance instead? Johannes Haab was once sent to them; Georg Müller from the triumvirate three times. The Zurichers sought suitable means. They offered to speak on behalf of the people of Constance with the four [Protestant] cities or with all the Helvetians. But they did not want it. It was considered that Zurich or Bern, together with Basel and Schaffhausen, could provide them with 20,000 guilders if they committed not to take in any foreign garrison for two years. They did not refuse the money, but they did not want to commit to a number of years. They also thought it was futile to discuss [the admission of the people of Constance into the Swiss] Confederation. [Sébastien de l’Aubespine], the envoy of the French King Henry II, came to Winterthur. He negotiated there with delegates from Constance and made them great promises if they only committed not to take in troops that are dangerous for Helvetia. They then wrote to the king. But what, please? They confessed to still being subjects of the emperor and not wanting to leave the empire, although no one would have wanted to know that from them! Bullinger has a copy of this letter. Meanwhile, they assured the Zurichers that they would not sign any agreement that could endanger the neighboring Helvetians. They repeated their promise in a letter that arrived yesterday. Clearly, they do not intend to do so! But what good is that, since they are only supplicants and not commanders with the emperor! The Zurichers have really tried everything and are therefore not to blame for the people of Constance surrendering. Anyone who blames the Zurichers for this does them an injustice!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Myconius claims that they are afraid of the Inner Swiss without reason. Those who have whispered such things to him are nothing but villains! What evidence do they have for this? The Zurichers, writes Myconius, have written a letter to the people of Basel from which this should emerge. But this statement is pure slander! Bullinger can rather testify before God that the Zurichers are not afraid. They unanimously confess that they would deserve to be chastised, even exterminated, because of their sins; that they should not be surprised if the emperor or another enemy would defeat them. But they continue to plead for God's grace. And if they had to be destroyed, may God grant them steadfastness and courage so that the enemy does not achieve victory without loss. And if they found grace in his eyes, he can even protect the women as well as the children, the freedoms as well as the fatherland! All Zurichers are therefore ready for war and also willing to follow God wherever!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] But what does Myconius tell about the Inner Swiss? Of course, there are people in Zurich who are inclined towards them. But that is only a minority, no different than in Basel, Bern, or elsewhere. If this is true for some, it should not be applied to all! Bullinger, for his part, trusts many Inner Swiss more than some residents of the Swiss cities! They lead a decent life; they believe in Christ, even if they live under the tyranny [of the Antichrist]; and should the emperor or another enemy attack, Bullinger is convinced that they will fulfill their duty, even if he, of course, does not place his hope in them, but in God alone! Should they rush to help, their 30 would be more welcome than any 3000 assembled men!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In recent days, envoys of the emperor, the French king, and Pope Paul III have been in Lucerne. Both the emperor and the Frenchman are seeking an alliance with the Confederates. Because of these solicitations, the Zurichers fear the convening of a diet; and Myconius knows what happens then. But if such a diet had to be convened, Bullinger hopes that the Zurichers will place themselves under the protection of the Almighty and will not join an alliance with either the emperor or the Frenchman. Among the Swiss cities and among the other places, there are both supporters of an alliance with France and supporters of one with the empire. But Bullinger believes that an alliance with both is dangerous. If you join the Frenchman, you offend the emperor, and vice versa. It is therefore unwise to form an alliance with either of the two. In matters of alliance (and this also applies to the agreements made with the [foreign] princes), the Confederates, who were freed by the Lord from the tyranny of the mighty, have sinned greatly! In short: The envoys of the potentates are among the Confederates and are trying to divide them by offering them gold. May the Lord preserve his church and strengthen the elect!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The foregoing is intended only for Myconius. In the name of their friendship, he should not tell anyone about it! Should he nevertheless report it to the people of Strasbourg, Bullinger will write no more! In Zurich, they know very well what kind of friends [the Confederates] have in Strasbourg. Bullinger is particularly thinking of Martin B[ucer], to whom Myconius, as Bullinger knows, often writes. As much as Bullinger tolerates this, he does not want [Bucer] to learn anything about the Swiss affairs! There are good reasons for this, which are not due to any antipathy, but to experience.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Myconius rightly writes that with the Diet of Augsburg, religion is being destroyed. Yesterday, Bullinger received letters from important men who have no more hope regarding religion and the freedom [of the Germans]. They see how the [imperial] cities will soon have to accept tax collectors and bailiffs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Captain Hans Schnabel from Bregenz is said to have been sent by the emperor as a colonel over 6000 men together with Gian Giacomo de' Medici, Castellan of Musso, as commander over several thousand cavalrymen over the [Alps, to Italy]. Some say to Parma, against Ottavio Farnese, others to Piedmont. This is reported by Joachim Vadian.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] It is nice that God supports the English so much. But since then, Bullinger has heard that the French have captured a ship of the English crown, which will give rise to a new war if it is not returned.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] It is regrettable that Henry II of France indulges in such debauchery, which, according to Paul [Eph 5:3], should not even be spoken of. Bullinger already sees (if only he were wrong!) that there will eventually be an alliance between France and Helvetia, and that both will rightly be punished by God. There are [many] Confederates who believe that they can only protect their country against the emperor with the help of France.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Bullinger has given the letter for John Butler to the messenger from Constance [...]. He will have already received it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] God meant well with the excellent Hans Heinrich Winkeli.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Myconius should notice how talkative Bullinger was, so as not to hear that he is taciturn. Greetings!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] [P.S.:] Today, November 2, the diet was convened for the 20th of this month (if Bullinger is not mistaken) in Baden, because the people of Schwyz want to inform all the Confederates about something concerning Bellinzona.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] They have reinforced their garrison in Bellinzona by 21 men because they do not trust the emperor, and they want [the Confederates] to send their garrisons from the [bailiwicks of Lugano and Locarno] that are not in the mountains to them, in the mountains. But Bullinger thinks that if the people of Schwyz were attacked, the [other Confederates] would be able to defend themselves alone in their bailiwicks outside [the mountains].</p>

      <p>S. D. I could not sufficiently marvel at how you, my most esteemed brother, are affected by the capitulation of the people of Constance. Has Helvetia perished because Waldshut and Laufenburg, neighboring cities (and they are strong!), from which the emperor's garrisons can invade Helvetia just as easily as from Constance? Constance is not our salvation, nor is it our betrayal! God is our salvation. And Constance could be our ruin if, out of laziness and some unknown fear, we rejected the fair and God-given means of protecting ourselves.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Indeed, nothing has been neglected by our people! Everything was attempted, but nothing was achieved, not due to our fault but that of others. "What if you," you say, "had taken them under your protection along with the others or alone?" What, my Myconius, if we approached their spirits not by this way, but by many others? Once, Consul Haab was sent, and Müller from the triumvirate was sent three times on a mission. We tried suitable means. We asked if they wanted their case to be handled by us or by the four cities with all the Helvetians; they refused. An offer of 20,000 guilders was made, to be paid either by the Zurichers or the Bernese, along with the people of Basel and Schaffhausen, on the condition that they would not receive any foreign soldier into the city for two years. They said they would not refuse the money, but they did not want to be bound by the number of years. They said it was futile to discuss the alliance. A royal envoy came to Winterthur. He negotiated with selected people of Constance in the name of the French, almost promising them a crown, provided they did not receive soldiers to the detriment of Helvetia. They wrote to the king. I am not unaware of what was written, as I have a copy: they loudly proclaim that they acknowledge the emperor as their lord; they do not want to be separated from the empire, etc. (which no one had demanded!). Meanwhile, they promise not to accept anything in the agreement that is against the neighboring Helvetians. They testified the same in a letter written to us yesterday. I would not doubt that they would do this, provided they were not in the position of supplicants, but of masters, to whom they nevertheless become supplicants. Therefore, we tried everything. Hence, it is not our fault that they surrender, and if anyone blames us, they do us a great injustice!</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>"You fear," you say, "where there was no need to fear, so devoted are you to the Five Cantons!" Those who suggest this to you are indeed malicious and nothing else! What, I ask, are the arguments of this fear that our people have shown? "You recently wrote letters to our people," you say, "from which this fear is sufficiently evident." But remove the slanderer, and you will have no argument! As far as I can see and judge (I speak before the Lord, what I say), I cannot detect any fear in our people. They all speak unanimously: Our sins deserve punishment, indeed even destruction. Therefore, if the emperor or another enemy overthrows us, there is no need to seek causes. We have deserved destruction. However, we will plead for His mercy. (God's) And if we must perish, may He grant patience, may He grant courage, and we will fall bravely, nor will we leave the enemy a bloodless victory. But if we please Him, it will not be difficult for Him to save our wives, children, freedom, and homeland even through a few. Thus, we are all (believe me) prepared and stand ready to follow wherever the Lord calls us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>What do you say about the Five Cantons? There are indeed people more than sufficiently devoted to them, but they are a minority. Just as in Basel, Bern, and other places, such people are found. Should what a few do be imputed to all? There are not a few in the Five Cantons whom I trust more than not a few in the cities. They live honorably, believe in Christ, live under tyranny. But when the emperor or another enemy attacks us, there is hope that they will do their duty, although I place no hope in them, but only in God. If such people come, 30 will be more welcome than 3000 of the common crowd.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>For several days now, the emperor's, the French king's, and the pope's envoys have been in Lucerne. The emperor and the Frenchman seek alliances with us, etc. Our people therefore dread these demands from the diet! You know what happens in them. However, when they must be called and convened out of necessity, I hope our people will entrust themselves to the defense of the Most High and will not join any alliance with either the emperor or the Frenchman. There will be those from the Cantons and Cities who will want to join the Frenchman, and there will be those who will want to join the emperor. I consider either or both dangerous. For if we join the Frenchman, we have spurned the emperor; if we are allied with the emperor, we have spurned the Frenchman. Nor is it possible to strike a deal with both! We have sinned greatly in alliances; we have sinned in the society formed with the princes - whom the Lord had freed from the tyranny of the princes. Therefore, the princes' envoys are present, tempting with gold, to see if we can be separated and divided. May the Lord preserve His church and comfort the elect!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I would not have poured this out to just anyone. I have said this into your bosom. I implore you by our friendship not to tell anyone about this! If I sense that you write even a little about these matters to Strasbourg, I will not write even a letter to you in the future! We know here what kind of friends we have there, especially B[ucer], to whom I know you frequently write - which I allow freely, but I do not want anything about our matters to be known! There is a certain reason: Not out of hatred (for I do not hate anyone, thanks to God), but out of experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>You rightly write that religion has perished in the Diet of Augsburg. For I received letters yesterday from distinguished men who have not only despaired of religion but also of freedom. They fear that cities and tax collectors and governors will be accepted, even against their will.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Captain Schnabel from Bregenz is said to have been appointed by the emperor as a colonel over 6000 men, along with Marquis de Muss (is over several thousand cavalry): Some think, to Italy against Octavian in Parma, some, to Piedmont, etc. Thus Vadianus.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I rejoice that the Lord is with the English; but in the meantime, I hear that the royal ship has been seized by the French, which, unless restored, will provide ample material for a new war.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I regret that the Frenchman stains himself with such a kind of lust, which Paul also called unmentionable among the nations. But it will be necessary at some point for France and Helvetia to unite (I wish I were a false prophet!) and receive the deserved reward. For there are those in Helvetia who are convinced that Helvetia cannot be defended against the emperor except by the arms of the French.</p>

      <p>Today, finally, the diet is being convened in Baden for the 20th of this month, if I remember correctly, for the people of Schwyz have something they wish to propose to all the Helvetians concerning Bellinzona, etc. November 2.</p>

      <p>They have strengthened the garrison by 21 men. They intend to trust the emperor little: Thus, according to their writing, etc. We should move to Bellinzona and leave ourselves exposed here. If it happened that they had to deal with their need (for it is in the mountains), and we had to defend ourselves here with God alone, I would have the best hope that things would go well, etc.</p>
