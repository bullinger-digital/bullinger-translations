    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not written for a long time because he always hoped to use Hans Schmid as a reliable messenger. Sends his supplication and the copy with the request to promote his cause. As already discussed with Bullinger and also with Pellikan, he wanted to take on an evangelist [for the sermon] and has now decided on Luke; will hold [the sermons] - if Bullinger agrees with the choice - during Advent or Lent. Sends the requested sermons, which he delivered at the church consecration festival in Schwyz, and asks to correct deficiencies and instruct him. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. P. D. Dear, kind lord and brother.</p>
      <p>The reason I have delayed writing to you for so long is none other than that I always hoped Hans Schmid would come over, so that I could deliver my letters to you through a reliable messenger; but nothing happened, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I am sending you my supplication to my lords along with the copy of how you last discussed with me. I earnestly ask you to handle the matter in the best way possible, as I trust you very much. In this way, you should find me entirely willing to serve you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, dear lord and brother, you should know well, as I have discussed with you, that I intend to take an evangelist for myself. I have also discussed it with Pellikan. When I compare them, none is more appealing to me than Luke, but I am open to your correction, and I am thus determined and intend, with God's help and grace, to proceed with this. If it does not happen by the next Advent, it should happen by the upcoming Lent. I ask for your advice and help in this matter, so that things may be carried out and accomplished more properly; for I am entirely determined and let God prevail. However, if you think otherwise, let me know, and I will abandon my intention and accept your good judgment.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am sending you herewith the sermon, which I, as an unskilled person, delivered at the church consecration in Schwyz, as you requested. I ask you to receive it in the best way and not only look at the letter but also the heart and the good will. And if there is something inappropriate (Unpassendes, Falsches) in it that does not serve the form, my request is that you correct it, so that I may learn to set a better form in the future. For all things are considered in the utmost simplicity on my part. However, I have meant it very well in my heart. So understand it as such.</p>
      <p>Always be my father, and whatever is appealing to you about me, let me know in writing, and I will always adhere to you. With this, I commend you to God. Greet my kind lords and brothers, Pellikan, Leo, and especially Master Werner Steiner.</p>
      <p>Given in Zug, 10th of September 1537.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich, his kind and beloved.</p>
