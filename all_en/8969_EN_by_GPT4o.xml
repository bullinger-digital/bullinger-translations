      <p>God be with you. Herewith I send you some eels, which you like to eat, a meal that I have hardly managed to obtain, so that you may eat them with Susanna. Greet her and the children for me. I send them to you on account of your hare, for which I thank you sincerely. Verena has brought me your letter and praised the good things that have happened to her from Susanna and you; for that, I thank you both. That my Johel is bathed in peasant sweat, I can do nothing about, I must have him as he is, and do not let it trouble you. The news and the letter about Rudolf's blessed death have reached me well; I have willingly offered Rudolf to God. The news is indeed very dangerous; I fear, unless God grants His special grace, that they will make the matter even worse.</p>
      <p>But if the Spaniards' measure is full, then the matter will turn out well; may God grant it. Otherwise, I have heard nothing further nor received anything more. There is a rumor that the admiral is captured and Navarre is stabbed; on the other hand, it is written that it is a lie, as many lies are being spread around. If anything further comes, I will let you know. I do not like at all that you have preached; venae rursus poterant aperiri hac commotione et vocis contentione, and if you ask me, you should not preach until you are better recovered.</p>
      <p>Recidivum mors. You have waited so long, so wait another 14 days or more. My lords are inquiring so diligently that they are in council on how to stop the unbearable begging. God be with you; all my people greet you, etc.</p>
      <p>Given on St. James' Day 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
