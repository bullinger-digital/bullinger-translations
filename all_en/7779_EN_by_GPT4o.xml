      <p>Greetings. I have absolutely nothing to write, not even now, dear brother, except to inform you that I indeed received your letter eight days ago, but did not respond at that time because I had nothing worth mentioning. Various rumors are indeed being spread; but I am ashamed and reluctant to write uncertain things. In fact, what is sometimes reported as most certain and verified is soon discovered to be utterly false.</p>
      <p>Now again stories are being woven about a great conflict and various matters. As soon as I receive more certain information, I will inform you. We are doing quite well here, thanks to God, and we are awaiting the outcome of the Baden assembly, which is currently being held. Some of the Five Cantons, who are inclined towards the Spanish, are plotting something unknown. May the Lord overturn wicked plans and keep us all safe, especially you.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, February 11, 1569.</p>
      <p>Greet the honorable consuls, brothers, and friends.</p>
      <p>Yours, as always.</p>
      <p>I wonder if it is true what is said in Italy about an army being recruited from Spaniards and Italians.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, minister of the Chur church, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
