      <p>How much I owe you, dearest Bullinger, who not only deign to greet me with the most friendly written letters, but also to educate me with your most learned booklets, while I, in the meantime, have nothing to repay except a loving spirit towards you, which, believe me, I will offer to you as long as I am allowed to breathe. But if ever anything else should be available, I will not forget how much I am indebted to you. You, indeed, continue to promote the Christian religion with those learned writings.</p>
      <p>You have all of us entirely favoring and applauding you. If you wish to know the state of our affairs, religion indeed remains safe, but the vices of those who profess the Gospel are astonishingly increasing. The common people have not stirred anything this year so far: however, it is to be feared that, partly due to their restless nature, partly incited by the avarice of the nobles, they may cause some disturbances, unless the Lord himself deigns to avert it, for the sake of our king alone, who is wonderfully advancing in good letters, piety, and prudence. This prince of the greatest hope, and even now a defender of the Christian religion to the point of wonder, you will deign to commend to God with your prayers. For unless God, offended by our vices, takes him from us before his mature age, we have no doubt that England will produce another Constantine, or even one more excellent. I therefore ask through Christ, that you pray for all happiness for him. For you too, although you are far away, will reap some benefit from this. For he both loves you and recognizes the Christian religion well established among you, and always wishes it to remain safe and unharmed. Farewell, most esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>Guildford, June 13. Yours, Bartholomew Traheron.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>B. Traheron.</p>
