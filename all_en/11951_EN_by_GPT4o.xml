The people of Bregenz are equipping their ships, the people of Zurich should inquire about this; besides [Diethelm] Röist, no one should know that this news comes from Blarer. Would like to know more details about the news from Piedmont and the response of the Confederates to the Imperial Estates. Awaits Bullinger's response regarding the secret matter [of the annexation of Konstanz to the Confederation?] and hopes for a personal meeting. Prays for the steadfastness of [Konrad Zwick], as a great lord offers him much for the revelation [of his military art]. Details from the response of the Estates to the Emperor [Charles V].</p>

      <p>Dearly beloved lord and brother, I hereby send you news, firstly from Austria, which you will learn from the enclosed letters.</p>
      <p>Also, an extract (summary list) of the captains and their troops. Also, the response of the cities regarding aid against France; in which one senses how reason has left them and all people, especially in that they desire assistance, so that no disadvantage may befall them in their goods and wares, scilicet etc.</p>
      <p>Also, the Pope's response etc. Also, I cannot withhold from you that this morning my lord received news that the people of Bregenz are equipping their ships and no one knows why; it would undoubtedly be good if your lords wrote to the Rintal and made inquiries. But they are earnestly requested that, apart from Lord Röist, no one learns that these things are written by me.</p>
      <p>Whether the news from Piedmont, which was announced on the current day, is true or not, I would very much like to know.</p>
      <p>Also, what response the Confederates give to the Imperial Estates, and other matters about which I have previously written to you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the other secret matter, I will await your response. But would to God that we could be together in person for half a day in an unsuspected (unquestionable) place. May God grant it once.</p>
      <p>Pray to God heartily and earnestly that He may grant N. a steadfast mind, so that he may not be swayed; for great things are promised and offered to him by a great lord, that he may reveal them.</p>
      <p>In the response of the Estates, which they give to the Emperor, it states among other things, that they are willing to maintain the 24,000 foot soldiers and 4,000 horsemen for 6 months at their own expense, the money to be paid in three installments, 1st of June, 1st of August, 1st of October, and this money may be used by His Imperial Majesty as he pleases against the Turks, France, adherents, and allies.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and most beloved Bullinger.</p>
