      <p>S. D. I wish you and all your family a very happy new year, my dearest compater in the Lord, free from all calamities. At the same time, I give my greatest thanks for the gift sent to my son, Johann Heinrich, your son in Christ. I pray to the Lord that you may continue to do what you do happily for many years, and that the saying of Christ may find a place in you: It is more blessed to give than to receive.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, on the seventh of this month, I received letters from my Augusta sent by Mr. Mekardus, in which there are things I thought should be communicated to you. Namely, these: Some highly commend the concord established in the matter of the Eucharist between you and Mr. Calvin, and they judge it to be a kind of middle ground by which the contending parties may be reconciled. And to this, the learned and pious Baron Johannes a Lasco, who now resides in Denmark after leaving miserable England, urges the most illustrious Elector Palatine and also other churches he can reach, to finally unite all evangelicals against the Antichrist. This is what he says. If you have received anything about this matter, I beg you to share it.</p>
      <p>He added about the margrave in this manner: "The Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg and the Bavarian, together with the two margraves, the Elector and Johann, have intervened to establish concord between the margrave and the Nuremberg League. The matter is being seriously pursued; the margrave demands a huge sum of gold; the Duke of Brunswick has returned to his duchy." This is what he says. However the margrave's cause may stand, I certainly know that his intimate secretary, well known to me, passed through us last week on his way to France to the king. Finally, in the Bishopric of Bremen, 6000 horsemen are now being gathered. Some suspect that they are being enlisted by the Emperor, so that he may lead his son through Germany to England with great force and later use them against the French. The French have not been vigilant enough regarding England. These marriages seem to threaten him with great harm unless he acts in time. Meanwhile, I hope the Lord will not abandon the cause of His faithful, indeed, more His own cause. Farewell very well, my dearest compater. My wife Margret and children wish you all much good and a very prosperous year. Please give my regards to all the brothers and friends there, Mr. Pellicanus, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gwalther, Mr. Zwingli, and all the others. Bern, 10th of January, 1554. Wolfgang Musculus, your compater in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest compater in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
