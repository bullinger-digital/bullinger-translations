      <p>Grace and innocent life from God. Having finally finished with Jeremiah, I took care to send it back to you. I entrusted it to a certain merchant along with the Greek Lucian, so that he may add it to his goods and present it to you; for I thought that in this way it would return to you most safely. I am sending Lucian to Pontisella, so that he may use it and keep it safe. We are also going to send some money for his use; but the noise of the fairs and certain business matters have prevented me from gathering it now; however, I will send it soon. I also give and have great thanks, first because you have taken the poor little one into your care, so that he may not be kept away from the study of letters by lack of sustenance, and also because you have lent me that book, most dear to you and most useful to me. Since I had nothing worthy of you to give in return, I made an effort to send a small gift of a few chestnuts to your children. But these are hardly worth mentioning. The bag should be handed over to Johannes Pontisella. Nothing is being done or said here that is worthy of your ears; I only ask this, that you count me among your friends. Farewell, most learned man. From Chur, on the fourteenth day before the Kalends of December, 1537. I send many greetings to our Leo and Konrad Pellikan.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and primary friend.</p>
