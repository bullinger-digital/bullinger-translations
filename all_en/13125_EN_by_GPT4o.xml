    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] When Vadian wanted to answer Bullinger's last letter [No. 3062 from October 31 and November 4], he could no longer find it. Presumably, he accidentally returned it [with No. 3072] along with the enclosures Bullinger had sent him in his haste. However, this is not a problem, as he still remembers its content very well and otherwise tends to consign Bullinger's letters with less confidential messages than the last one to the fire to prevent any misuse.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The victory of the English [over the Scots] pleases him greatly, as the English King Edward VI loves the truth and refutes and abolishes the errors of the Roman Pope (the mortal enemy of Christ), to which his ancestors were still devoted. May the lovers of the Gospel triumph everywhere!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] From Augsburg, it is learned that the two main culprits of all the current unrest, namely the Augsburg Cardinal Otto Truchsess von Waldburg and the Bishop of Trent Cristoforo Madruzzo, have been sent to Trent by Emperor Charles V with the consent of the three imperial estates (namely the dazzling or shortsighted electors and princes as well as the prelates, whose unfavorable disposition towards Christ is well known) to ensure the continuation of the council that has begun. Meanwhile, the Emperor has commissioned a monk [...] from his court, the auxiliary bishop of Mainz [Michael Helding], and a doctor from Cologne (perhaps Johannes Gropper) to consult on the preservation of religion even before the conclusion of the Council of Trent. What they intend can already be guessed. No one from the other estates or the [Protestant] camp was involved. The wiser cities have indeed opposed it, but the contempt shown to them and their pastors indicates how little weight that will have.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] In short, everything is allowed to the former, but not even what is proper is granted to the [Protestants]. Many believe that this extremely unfavorable situation will persist for a few more years, for atrocities and godlessness rage so much! One cannot even expect that piety will assert itself even partially. Nevertheless, Vadian remains confident, as the Church of Christ has already recovered from many a difficult situation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Vadian sends here the gallows tree selected for the hanging of Johannes Hoffmeister, which Martin Frecht enclosed in his last letter at Vadian's request (which Vadian had expressed with regard to Bullinger). Vadian also adds some Psalms to the document, which Frecht also sent him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] In Ulm, the plague is subsiding, but in Augsburg, it is so rampant that last week more than 50 people died from it daily.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Allegedly, Charles V is preparing a huge campaign, while it is reported that King Ferdinand is behaving incredibly imperiously. The Emperor is said to have pardoned the Hanseatic cities, which are said to have dismissed their garrisons along with the Bremen troop leader [Christoph von Oldenburg]. It is said that the Emperor suffers greatly from gout. It is not yet known where he will turn with his forces next spring: Perhaps to Helvetia, as all lovers of freedom fear. Vadian does not doubt that machinations are underway to entice many to hope for a subjugation of the Helvetians, especially since not only the Emperor strives for it, but also all those who are full of envy for the freedoms of the Confederates that have lasted for two centuries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] It is therefore very important that the Confederates continue to stand together firmly. Only such cohesion can save them. This does not mean that faith is being abandoned, nor does it mean that one must adopt the customs of the [Inner Swiss]. A rift with them must not be accepted if the Confederates do not want to lose their freedoms. Rather, it is to be expected that the disposition of the [Inner Swiss] will improve and that they will eventually cooperate more closely with the [Four Protestant Cantons] in civil matters. In the Gospel, the Lord has not forbidden the use of the sword for the benefit of the state, but has even approved and confirmed it. And since alliances particularly ensure civil stability (as already evidenced by the alliances entered into by the Inner Swiss ancestors), no agreement should be rejected that offers honorable conditions in view of emergencies. The circumstances of the formation and the agreed clauses of the Schmalkaldic League were also honorable. However, the main allies did not stick together! In the case of the Confederation, however, both the common salvation of the fatherland to be guaranteed and the blood relations already existing in the various places of the Confederation give good reason to hope that the Confederates will remain loyal to each other and will not betray each other, even if they are currently tempted by the gifts offered to them. Therefore, Bullinger should urge his authorities not to go separate ways if, in the current situation, the other places are of the opinion that an alliance with the French King Henry II should be entered into, especially since it would be very indecent not to follow the opinion of the majority in such important state matters, and one would thus give cause for resentment and suspicion. Bullinger will still experience how Emperor Charles V will make demands on the Confederate places to have a pretext for a war against them and to make them compliant again (as the Germans say). He will ensure, especially on the border of the Rhine and Lake Constance as well as beyond the Alps, in the adjacent area to Milan, that no food is supplied to the Confederates and attack them. If France is then not open to the Confederates, the Emperor will subdue and conquer them through famine. Therefore, it is so important that a treaty with France, which already exists anyway, is concluded.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The Ravensburgers were forced to accept twelve half-banners: A total of 1800 garrison soldiers, including 600 cavalrymen. It is said to be certain that the Lindauers have bought their freedom from these godless, thieving servants.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] What Bullinger writes about the people of Constance is true. It would not be possible to grant them military aid without at the same time provoking war on the Confederation. It would therefore be less dangerous if the people of Constance, who are oppressed by the Emperor, were to hire troops, even if these would be a burden to the Helvetians. However, Vadian advocates mediation in favor of the people of Constance with the Emperor, whether through an embassy or by letter. The Helvetians would indeed have enough reason to demand from the Emperor to ensure the inviolability of the [Four Protestant] cities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] If Pope Paul III urges the Confederates with deceptive maneuvers to send representatives to the council, the matter should be discussed at a public meeting of scholars (by the church leaders of the Four Cities and a selection of their country pastors) to reach a unanimous decision.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Greetings. As soon as Bullinger receives news of the planned diet, he should communicate it.</p>

      <p>Greetings. When I was about to respond to your letter, I could not find the copy and your handwriting, and I suspect that in my haste, as often happens, I accidentally sent it back to you with other papers a little earlier. But for this reason, no loss has occurred, because I remember well what you wrote, and I usually consecrate your letters and those of others, which contain somewhat secret matters, to Vulcan (the fire), so that neither fraud nor treachery can cause harm from anywhere.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The victory of the English is most pleasing to me for two reasons: For the prince of those people loves the truth and clearly refutes and abolishes the errors committed by his ancestors in embracing the Roman pontiff, and he does not consider the pontiff himself, the mortal enemy of Christ, worthy of any place or honor. May those who love the Gospel triumph everywhere!</p>

      <p>From Augsburg, we have learned that the two notable leaders of all the disturbances, the Augsburg Cardinal and the Bishop of Trent, have been sent to Trent by the order of the Emperor, with the council that has been well begun evidently being restored, in which the three orders of the empire have agreed to continue: namely, the electors and the shortsighted princes, and furthermore the prelates, whose disposition towards Christ is known to the world. Meanwhile, the Emperor has appointed one of his courtiers, who is a confessor, covered with a cowl, as well as the auxiliary bishop of Mainz and a certain doctor from Cologne (I do not know if it is Gropper), to oversee the matter, to discuss and deliberate on the manner and order of preserving religion until the Council of Trent can be concluded. What they are planning is easy to guess. No one from the other orders, especially of our faith, has been included. The wiser cities have indeed opposed their protest. However, the contempt they face, along with their ministers, indicates their position.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In summary: They are allowed whatever they please; our people are not even permitted to do what would be most proper! And there are those who think that this impetuous and insane torrent must be yielded to for many years, until the Lord offers a better opportunity. For such is the rage of abomination, such is the fury and madness of impiety, that many despair of asserting even a good part of piety. To me, considering how the Church of Christ has flourished again from great calamities not once, great hope arises that it will soon recover, which is now oppressed by so many evils.</p>

      <p>I am sending you the tree sought for the hanging of Hofmeister, which Frecht sent to me in his last letter for your sake, as I had indicated to him that you desired it. He also added some Psalms enclosed in numbers, which I am sending along.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The plague in Ulm has subsided, but in Augsburg, it is so severe that more than fifty people have died in one day in the past week.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>It is said that the Emperor is preparing a huge expedition and that Ferdinand is exercising a remarkable tyranny. It is rumored that the maritime cities, having dismissed their soldiers, have reconciled with the Bishop of Bremen. The Emperor is said to suffer greatly from gout, and it is unknown where he will turn the strength of his army in the spring: Helvetia is feared by all those who wish for freedom to be preserved. I do not doubt that there are plans in place to entice many to promise themselves the subjugation of the Helvetians, and perhaps Charles is not alone in this, but many others, to whom our freedom has been most hateful for the past century.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>We must work, my Bullinger, to unite in the old zeal for preserving the fatherland. By this means (which alone will preserve us), religion will not be betrayed, nor is it necessary to adopt the customs of those with whom we cannot disagree without the destruction of freedom. Indeed, this gives us greater hope of converting their minds to better and healthier things, the more we unite with them in the society of civil matters! The Lord in his gospel has condemned no function of the sword that is aimed at public safety, but rather has approved and established it, and since the agreements of alliances are the main support for preserving civil matters, as the ancestral alliances of the cantons testify, certainly no alliance should be rejected that is offered with honorable conditions in urgent necessity. The Schmalkaldic League was united with honorable causes and conditions, but the minds did not unite, whose faith and integrity are required above all. However, the salvation of the fatherland, the spouses, and the children more loving to their spouses will ensure that the faith of our people, however tempted by gifts or largesse, will not collapse or betray any perfidy, I am certain. Therefore, do not impose any delay on your magistrate, but if, given the current state of affairs, the other cantons consider it advisable to enter into any honorable alliance with the French, let your people not exempt themselves, but willingly join others, for as I omit, in such a large and widespread society, the singularity of a few is odious (it is well known that there is suspicion of dissension and alienation of mind if a few do not approve what has been accepted by many for the sake of public goods). You will learn that Emperor Charles will not let some cities and places of the Confederation go without demands, and if he undertakes to throw a Confederation into war and make it obedient (as they say outside), he would first of all cut off our supplies on both sides of the Rhine and all around Lake Constance, as well as beyond the mountains, where it borders on Milan, and take a persistent war upon himself. If France were not open to us, he would subdue and conquer us with hunger alone. Therefore, a Confederation can have no better support than France, with which one is in a state of peace and agreement.</p>

      <p>In Ravensburg, twelve banners have been imposed, but they are half-full: For there are counted eighteen hundred garrison soldiers, among whom are six hundred cavalrymen. It is said for certain that Lindau has redeemed itself with money, so as not to have to endure impious robbers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>What you write about Constance is true. They could not have been helped by force from us, unless it pleased them to transfer the war to us as well. However, the danger is less if they, oppressed by the Emperor, admit soldiers who would harass Helvetia. But I have always approved of the plan by which intercession could be established, either by sending an embassy to the Emperor or by letters. For there are many most just causes that demand the Helvetians not to neglect the safety and dignity of that city.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>If it should happen that the Pope were to unleash his tricks to send your people and others to the council, it would be necessary to deliberate publicly in some assembly of scholars about everything. For it will be convenient that in the matter of religion, the bishops of the cities, the selected chorepiscopi, act with the greatest concord about what seems best to do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Farewell, and if you have anything from the assemblies, communicate it. St. Gallen, the day after the Ides of November, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious city of Zurich, lord and most esteemed friend.</p>
