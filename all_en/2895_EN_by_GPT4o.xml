      <p>Greetings. I received the letters; they were a great comfort to me, and indeed nothing could have been more pleasing to me than to find almost your entire family here, your most dutiful wife, your most honorable daughters, and your excellent and learned sons-in-law, people of the most delightful company. We are all staying with the same host, with only a courtyard between us. The price is quite reasonable. Upon receiving your letters, your most honorable wife and your two sons-in-law, along with your daughters, were most attentive to me and recommended everything to the host, promising all acts of kindness. This brought much consolation and comfort to both me and especially my wife. For such great kindness and humanity from you and yours towards us, we give and express the greatest thanks we can. In return, if there is any way I can be of service to them and show gratitude to you and yours, here is your ever-ready Hieronymus. I wish you to believe that I am most devoted to you and most eager to serve you. Farewell, then, dearest Father Bullinger, and pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>From the Baths of Baden, April 15, 1556. Yours sincerely, Hieronymus Zanchi.</p>
