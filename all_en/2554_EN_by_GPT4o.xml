      <p>S. D. Our people have not yet followed your advice, not to stir anything in this ulceration of all things.</p>
      <p>A petition or plea from the English Parliament to Cardinal Pole has been sent to me, in which they request, in the name of the entire kingdom, absolution, relaxation, and liberation from all censures and sentences into which they have fallen due to the disobedience committed in the Kingdom of England against the Apostolic See, etc. Unless I assumed that you had already received it from friends elsewhere, I would have sent it through my Funck. Ah, good Christ, if this is not to deny you, then the devil is not the devil. Woe to miserable England, which, having seen, recognized, tasted, and even publicly professed not only at home by reforming but also abroad in public writings, now denies it all, partly driven mad by the wickedness of one woman, partly forced by tyranny, to the eternal disgrace of the English name, and most shamefully receives back the very Antichrist, the head of unclean spirits, once cast out. O the dreadful judgments of the Lord. Ah, my Bullinger, into what times have we fallen!</p>
      <p>We will expect nothing better from Germany, if ever the minds of the princes and magistrates, having changed, return to the Antichrist, having denied Christ, as if by a right of return, which many things make me believe will happen soon. O how happy are those who, before the year 46, happily exchanged life for death and departed from this most lost world in peace to Christ, since we see that everything is being done to the detriment of the former, etc.</p>
      <p>That you have diligently informed me of the matter of the people of Lucerne, for that I also give great thanks. May the Lord God enlighten the blinded, soften the hardened and obstinate hearts, and further illuminate those who are enlightened with the light of the knowledge of Jesus Christ and keep them therein until eternal life.</p>
      <p>I received a letter from Augsburg yesterday; it writes nothing special, except that on December 31, Ferdinand came there with a young son, Charles, and is still there; it is not known whether the Reichstag will proceed or not; there are still few princes there, namely Brunswick, Bavaria, and some bishops. It is entirely said that the king from England should also come; he is with his father in Bruchsal; there they are consulting, so that this year they have the advantage against the king. May the Lord God grant his peace! It is also entirely said that none of the electors want to attend the day unless the Passau Treaty is put into effect, etc.</p>
      <p>At Nuremberg, etc. for printing.</p>
