      <p>Greetings. Receive now my own effort against our common enemies.</p>
      <p>I join you in the fight, even if not with equal strength, yet with the most eager will. However, I still fight in such a way that I continually offer peace. If they persist in pressing us, which I entirely expect, we will oppose them with cheerfulness and vigor, invoking God's help. Perhaps others will join us. [You know that our Bernhard has also written: for I think a copy was sent to you by him.] I am sending a copy of my Apology at present. If anything in it displeases you, I ask you to indicate it freely. You will read in my exposition what I think of your defense.</p>
      <p>However, I understand from your latest letters that Erhard Schnepf has written against you. I was unaware of this, nor have I seen his book so far.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you have not seen the rather extensive book by Timan, the pastor of Bremen, published against us. Many more will come out against us this summer. For I see that these men have shed all modesty, are devoid of all charity, and therefore make nothing of the offenses of the simple and the joys of our common enemies. I fear that some grave calamity will sometime oppress them. [I have almost abandoned all hope concerning these matters.] They hate us more severely than any papists or Anabaptists. May the Lord have mercy on them and look upon us with the eyes of His grace.</p>
      <p>The envoys have indeed returned, but they did not bring back what we all expected. Yet we do not abandon hope. Let us therefore pray to the Lord, that He may govern this matter. There will be no delay on our part. Whatever they can contribute to reconciliation, they will contribute most willingly. Continue to do what you are doing, so that they do not act out of indignation, which they might later regret too late with ruin. May the Lord our God be with us. Amen. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 9, 1556.</p>
      <p>In Germany, everything is in turmoil. I fear the Lord will bring us back into order with severe chastisement. Let us therefore watch and pray. The brothers greet you. Greet all the fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
