    <p xml:id="regest1">Wants to send a copy of a letter from Bullinger to the exiled [Solothurners] through Crispinus Fischer. Reports on the victory of the Neuchâtel-Bernese free troops, who wanted to come to the aid of the Genevans and fell into an ambush by the Savoyards, but have since been recalled. Bern has issued an ultimatum to the Duke of Savoy, but more dangerous than the external threat from Savoy and its allies, Haller considers the internal discord within Bern. Three Bernese envoys have set out for peace negotiations. Requests vigilance.</p>

      <p>S. The one who will handle this matter most faithfully, a faithful man and well known to you from the number of patricians, Crispinus Fischer, since he has a brother-in-law among the exiles, I will ensure that a copy of your letters is either delivered or sent to them through him, and I will keep yours with me until you recall them.</p>
      <p>Regarding the campaign: Our lords have always wanted to avoid war; nevertheless, 110 soldiers have set out, almost all from the region of Neuchâtel, Neuenstadt, few from the Bern area. They marched for 10 days through Burgundy and went three days without food (without provisions), near a castle called Coppet, not far from the city of Nyon, near Geneva, led by treachery into a thicket and hedge on the mountain. There, the Savoyards, 2000 strong, fired upon them with some handguns, where our soldiers fell down in droves, letting the shots pass over them. And although a terrible barrage of stones followed upon them, our men pushed to the hedge, fighting hand to hand, so that the Savoyards soon took flight. About 300 of them were killed, some say even more. I write the lower number so that I lie less. Our men wanted to march to Geneva, but this event intervened. As a result, my lords called their men home, and so they all returned home. Yet there is still a rush (a commotion), as the young people are eager for war.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, my lords, as before, have requested the Duke, along with the castle of Bineet, the exiles, and the Bishop of Geneva, to leave the Genevans in peace and allow them to receive provisions, or to release all the bonds, which were established with a city of Bern, and for this, a response in 14 days. Now the deadline is today. In the meantime, my lords have been warned that several thousand Spaniards, Italians through Valais, along with the Valaisans, are marching to the Duke, and he has already prepared 4 companies to besiege the city. There is talk of the Antronians, who will also do their part, as well as the neighboring two cities of Fribourg and Solothurn. But I would not care about all this, if it were not for the first of all evils, the faction and internal discord, the discontent of the country folk, the lack of money, the whole world as an enemy, nowhere a friend, will be so burdensome to us that we, forgetting God, His word, all honor, will take shame and disgrace along with unspeakable damage upon ourselves, for I know new men. Therefore, make sure that your church prays for us. Our senate has three envoys to negotiate peace with the Savoyards. They demand allies, since the Duke wants everything settled without arbitrators. Some of our people do not want peace negotiations, but demand letters of alliance, others desire peace. Thus the matter is conducted among us. I wish that you would also ensure vigilance through your people, if they receive anything either from the Antronians or through others, they should be warned. It is not necessary for the senate to act, but the more prudent ones. I fear a rod is already prepared for us. We do not want to accept peace when it is offered, when it is not offered, we desire it. I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>27th October in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ber[chtold] H[aller].</p>
      <p>I have kept your letters, intending to send a copy to the exiles. I will return yours. You are safe in all things.</p>
