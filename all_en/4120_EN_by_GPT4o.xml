      <p>Greetings. I have often resolved, as far as I am able (since I am not yet fully my own master), to support a student with a stipend, who might one day serve the church; however, various obstacles have so far prevented me from accomplishing what I wanted as I wished. Since I cannot at this time provide this service to my homeland, to which I especially ought and wish to be of assistance in this matter, I have decided to extend it to others. Therefore, I ask, if perhaps there is known to your reverence a pious and studious young man of any nation, who has decided to devote himself to theological study and of whom there is hope that he will one day be of use to the church, or if there is already someone older working for the church whose poverty should be alleviated, that you inform me of him. I would contribute annually to him, who would devote himself to letters, 35 florins, from which perhaps two others could be supported, namely those who are already older and serve the church with a smaller salary than they need. I leave it to your judgment which would be more advisable, and whoever you deem this gift to be most usefully bestowed upon, he will also be judged worthy by me. I prescribe no laws for this stipend, only that he occasionally inform me about himself and the state of his affairs, and how his matters and studies are progressing, and then, as much as the duty of a candid mind requires, he should perform. Although I promise an annual stipend, as I said, I do not define a certain number of years, but it will be continued freely as it seems fit, with divine clemency permitting.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you to forgive me for burdening you with this matter, as you are otherwise very busy; I have no one through whom I could more conveniently accomplish this my intention. I can report nothing more about the state of our affairs than what I wrote to you on the 23rd of October. I have not yet seen any published acts of the diet.</p>
      <p>I would rather believe that the King of Spain has died than that I hear some princes will soon convene in Stuttgart; the reason for the meeting is unknown to me. Victorinus Strigel, because he did not assent to the confession of his princes as they demanded, was thrown into prison along with a certain clergyman, first treated more leniently, then more harshly, and was released a few weeks ago, after first taking an oath concerning some religious controversy, and shortly after he lost his mind. While I hear that church reforms are being instituted here and there at will, I was pleased to make some comparison between those who call themselves Lutherans and the papists, and having drawn a conclusion, they seem to me to differ little from each other, except that the former cling to the first traces and beginnings of superstitions, while the latter have grown to the utmost, so that now they must collapse and therefore demand a hand to be extended to them as if from them. In vain, however, as I hope, the execution of the sentence of their destruction long ago decreed by divine will is now imminent. I confess, I have spoken more freely to a friend about these things, not without rashness, which, however, their calumnies, and also blasphemies, extort from me. Our Emperor redeemed the Margraviate of Burgau, which had been pledged to the Bishop of Augsburg, last month, and although the nobles and other inhabitants of it have been granted privileges by the emperors, they now prefer the emperor and seize foreign possessions unlawfully, subjecting those who were previously exempt in many respects to exactions and various machinations, and this has been the case from the beginning, what will happen next? They dream of a certain Duchy of Swabia, which, if they are allowed to gather whatever they please, will easily be formed, contiguous to the Margraviate of Burgau, the towns of Algäu, to these the Bishopric of Constance, to this the County of Nellenburg with its neighbors, etc. Whether the calculations of this invention have been properly made, time will tell.</p>
      <p>What the Lord will decide about such plans, they care little; but unless my mind deceives me, we will soon experience it, I know, with great harm. Farewell, most venerable and esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Given at Augsburg on the 4th of November in the year 1559. Your reverence's most devoted Georg von Stetten the Younger.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
