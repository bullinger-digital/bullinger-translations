      <p>Greetings. In my recent letters, in which I enclosed our Agreement, I intended to write, but due to haste, I forgot to mention that I had given both the letters and a copy of my fourth Decade to a French boy to deliver to you, and that was in October. From your recent letters, I understood that you claim not to have received them and ask me to explain what it is. It is nothing other than what I now see: you have received neither the letters nor the copy. Such is the treachery of couriers, and indeed they often deter me from writing. However, I am glad that my last letters have been faithfully delivered to you, along with the fifth Decade. I have not yet seen your writings: but I hope to have them either from Basel or Frankfurt. I do not doubt that you have done something worthwhile. I read the preface to the Catholics written in your hand, and it pleased me greatly. Continue to serve Christ and the church in this way. May the Lord grant strength and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>For some time, I was gravely troubled by the imprisonment of our Hopper, but I hope for better things. In February [almost at the beginning of the month], I wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Mr. Cox, the king's tutor, the most illustrious Marquis of Dorset, the Earl of Warwick, and others, as I thought they might be either friends or enemies to him. And later, at the end of February, there was an excellent Englishman here with us in ZÃ¼rich, who said that he was not thrown into prison, but detained in the custody of nobles and that there was hope of his release soon. If I receive any certain news of this matter, I will gladly share it. I am expecting letters at any moment. If your friends have written to you, make sure I am not unaware.</p>
      <p>I am saddened that there are troublemakers in such a renowned church who disturb you so. However, you are not unaware of what kind of people have always been in the church, indeed what kind lived in the prophetic and apostolic church, even while the prophets and apostles themselves were teaching. Therefore, be strong and perform the duty of a good shepherd. May the Lord grant the spirit of strength and wisdom.</p>
      <p>The council is proceeding. A legate has been appointed in Rome to preside over the council, Cardinal Crescentius of Bologna as legate. Two bishops will be added to him. The Pope and the Emperor are colluding. If only the French would be wise and not send their bishops to the council. Thus, they would be less exposed. But they have been sufficiently warned.</p>
      <p>In Padua, the horrible heresy of Hebion is resurfacing, claiming that Jesus Christ was born from the corruptible seed of Joseph. To support this, they deny a good part of the Gospels. For this reason, I am deeply grieved. May the Lord remove scandals from our midst.</p>
      <p>It is said that the Turk is on a major expedition against Charles and Ferdinand. Meanwhile, it is certain that they are relying on immense resources to buy a truce for up to two years. Perhaps freed from the Turkish threat, they hope to gain control of France and the remaining unconquered part of Germany within these two years. The Emperor has fallen ill again, but he has recovered. A blessed man.</p>
      <p>Here, indeed, confirmed by our sins, he subjugates the most powerful nations by weakening them. But hey, brother, gird yourself!</p>
      <p>You will be called to the council to answer your accusers. [What if I join you as a companion? I am inclined to joke in a matter almost serious]. Let us diligently pray to the Lord to preserve His churches and us, the ministers of the churches. Farewell forever, most esteemed lord and dearest brother of all. May the dearest Mr. Jacob of Burgundy and Gallasius be safe along with all the pious. March 25, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
