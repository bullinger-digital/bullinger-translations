      <p>Greetings. My dearest and most esteemed father and godfather, my brother wrote to me about that adverse health condition which the gracious Lord has sent upon you. This news has not only struck and deeply afflicted me beyond measure, but also all the pious ones with me, as many as have understood it, who all diligently pray to the Lord that, having mercy on us, He may grant you to us as pastor, chariot, and charioteer of Israel for a longer time; for I would not have grieved so much for your sake if you had been taken from us, since it would have been well with you if the Lord had snatched you from this perishable short world, as for the common cause of the whole church, of which you are no small pillar in our age. However, I give thanks to the Lord from the heart, because I hear (though still through uncertain reports) that you are now better.</p>
      <p>May the Lord restore you to health and keep you safe with us for as long as possible: for with you taken away, I greatly fear for our people, churches, and republics.</p>
      <p>I am finally sending those letters of yours that were sent to me long ago, because until now there was no one by whom I could send them back, and as for Charles de Moulin, he was here himself along with Viret and Beza and managed his affairs with the senate, so that there is no need for you to intercede for him. He is a very learned man, but of perplexing language and mind, language such that he can hardly be understood by his own people and the French, and of a mind that he does not heed the good advice of friends, but is carried away by his own judgment and discretion and does everything rashly. The people of Lausanne complain about the same thing regarding him, which I do not write to wish him ill or to rashly disparage him to you, but so that you may know him and be able to advise him better according to his situation; for I love him for his learning and constancy and will not fail him anywhere, as far as I am able. But men must be known, so that you may act according to what they are like.</p>
      <p>As for the letters of the people of Chur, we indeed have no one to give to others, unless perhaps we wish to give some light and unworthy of ministry, of whom we have a great abundance and who almost reign among us. The number of those who excel in learning, authority, and the splendor of life is small. Would that we had the ability to attract such men from elsewhere! But it would be easier to obtain some buffoon than a serious, learned, and honest man; so deplorable is everything, and we burn with such hatred of good men, especially foreigners. You have a greater abundance of learned men, you have Clauser now and others whom you can give to them.</p>
      <p>I wrote a few things about the state of our church to my brother, which he will share with you. We have nothing new, except that the siege of Metz has been lifted by the Emperor. I am sending you the form of peace made with the Emperor by the Margrave. Many among us affirm that everything was done by the Margrave through treachery and that the King of France wisely guarded himself against him. Musculus may perhaps write more about this matter; I will spare you for now and not burden your weak health with a longer letter. Trempius, Treasurer Haller, now my neighbor across the street, Musculus, Schlatter, etc., especially my wife and all my family, greet you. May the Lord lift you up and keep you strong as a defender of the truth. Bern, January 18, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his lord and venerable godfather.</p>
