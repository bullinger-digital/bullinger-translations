    <p xml:id="regest1">Zwingli and Oekolampadius have approved the [Confessio Tetrapolitana]; although it was overshadowed by the [Augsburg Confession], which became the confession of the [Schmalkaldic] League, the [Strasbourgers] know how to interpret the latter in their own sense, as their doctrine, as Oekolampadius has pointed out, is also based on Scripture and the Fathers. The Strasbourg council wishes to prevent a publication [of the First Helvetic Confession] to avoid new discord; the mutual recognition [of the First Helvetic or the Tetrapolitan Confession] could become the basis for an agreement, which is urgently needed in view of the threat to the free imperial cities. The multitude of confessions gives the appearance of divisions and harms the church; for example, Jakob Sturm reported of a prince [well-disposed towards the Swiss], who still suspects them of divergent doctrine. [The Strasbourgers] want to build up the church through mutual admonition and support, as Zwingli also practiced towards them; they will point out their - long-standing - unity with [the Swiss] at the next diet. They have informed Luther [about the Basel meeting from early February], but he has not yet convened the agreed meeting; perhaps it is to be postponed until the diet. In any case, they are now prepared for it. Bucer has returned to Augsburg, where mass and images have not yet been abolished. Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg is proceeding resolutely and is said to have ordered the removal of images from the churches. The Zurich city clerk [Werner Beyel] has approached Capito regarding a scholarship for his son [Ulpian]; a favorable response would strengthen him in his affection for Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Our confession was seen by Zwingli before it was presented by us to the emperor, and he approved it, except that it seemed to him a bit lacking in strength, but he advised us to present it. For we did not want to propose anything that could in any way separate us from your churches. It pleased Oekolampadius, to whom it was similarly presented for reading, so that we might attest to our faith in this way, and there was nothing in it that would conflict with him or his churches. Meanwhile, our confession has completely settled. For in Augsburg, when at the end of the assembly the emperor was gravely angry with the Saxons, his advisors saw that our confession did not conflict with theirs. Therefore, we did not boast of any confession thereafter, nor would it have been published, had it not been for the wickedness of Eck's slanders against us presented to the emperor. However, not many of our evangelical league had a single confession, that is, the Saxon one, which uses, especially in this article, the words of Scripture and the Fathers, which we interpret in our favor. For we did not want to allow them to seem to have Scripture and the Fathers and the old use of the sacraments on their side; indeed, we had those as our foundation, as Oekolampadius's booklet on the words of the Lord's Supper attests, in which he explained the sayings of the Fathers in our favor, as well as the last Dialogue of that pious man.</p>
      <p>Now, because we see the syncretism of the enemies and the different confessions give the appearance of dissensions, it did not seem advantageous to our republic that after so many confessions a new one should be built by you, our most closely united brothers, at this time - yet they have approved and still approve your articles, not because we fear that Luther and Philipp will approve them too little, but because some insane heads will seek a pretext for new dissension from this, and then, because it is necessary to deal with the coarse princes and nobles, whom our people will try to bring over to your favor. And it would be very easy both to come to an agreement and to restrain the attack of the enemies if our confession could also be approved by you, just as your articles are by our republic. For I do not see what we have not confessed in demolishing statues and abolishing the mass and other papal trifles; we do not differ by a hair's breadth. In the sacraments, we have taught and confessed the same, and finally, we have seen that Luther does not feel differently, but less explicitly, as far as the sacraments are concerned. I ask you to consider the matter, invoking the Lord. Our people know what plans are being made daily against the free cities. I beg you, let us not be separated even in appearance.</p>
      <p>The multitude of confessions has vexed them greatly: The elector, princes, and republics have confessed, we have confessed, Zwingli wrote his own confession to the emperor, which we then took care to publish in Augsburg, the people of Basel have confessed, and who, I ask, has not confessed almost for themselves. Now, because the matter is coming together for unity and Satan is especially attacking your churches because they are purer and first, we must take care that our negligence does not provide an opportunity for harm. It does not matter how truly, but how similarly. However, what seems likely is only sought in appearance, since in reality, no opinion of discord remains. A commonly plausible argument. It does not agree because everyone has their own confession for themselves, or, as Eck is accustomed to say: As many people, so many churches. Although this has long since vanished; for we have been divided into these groups: Lutherans, Zwinglians, and us in the middle, who have avoided the name of sect in every way. And yet, by the grace of God, our people now shun every name of dissension everywhere. Recently, Jakob Sturm spoke of a certain prince, how lovingly he spoke of you and your churches, although the opinion of dissension still clung to him. There our man insisted on increasing your good reputation and diminishing the appearance of dissension.</p>
      <p>We will now make an effort to build up the church with mutual strength and to admonish and help each other, which can be done in various ways and is done daily. How often has Zwingli benefited us by advising some of our people in writing about those matters which they heard from us daily in vain! The studies that have collapsed must be restored, the remnants of ecclesiastical goods must be preserved, the vileness and hatred from common ministers must be removed, and such things, all of which Zwingli discussed with us, to whom it seemed almost necessary for ministers to have new privileges and immunities. God is clearly looking upon us, who removes the fatal dissension, so that we may truly be made one in the Lord. To whom be thanks. Remember that it is still the will of all good people for the fullest peace, which some will restore in this way. For first, they will lightly commend your churches at the next assembly of our league and will subtly insinuate the agreement, which is not as if it were obtained by negotiation, but by the power of truth and mutual commerce, which has been continued among us up to these times. From which a path to concord will be provided.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we have written very carefully to Luther, but we do not know what has intervened, so that he has not called the meeting, as agreed. Some people's opinion is that it is postponed to the next assembly of our league, so that it may then be decided in person with the magistrates and princes. But it does not matter whether we meet or not, as long as we are prepared for the occasion, as we are now.</p>
      <p>Bucer has again gone to the people of Augsburg to establish the church; for neither the mass nor the statues have been removed from the temples.</p>
      <p>Duke Ulrich of Württemberg has acted quite resolutely in some matters. However, others desire much, and yet nothing notable. It is said that he has completely cleansed the temples of idols.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, most esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>In Basel, on the third day after Laetare Sunday.</p>
      <p>Your scribe feels affectionately about you. He must be kept in office and bound by small favors. He has children; if he is suitable for pious studies and could be supported by your work with a public stipend, he would become more yours, as he says he is entirely yours. He seemed to be seeking something of this from me. If it seems good, you could let him know that I have remembered him to you.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich.</p>
