      <p>Greetings. Your incredible affairs are not unknown to me, most learned Lord Bullinger and likewise dearest brother, and because you did not respond to some of my letters (which I believe were delivered to you), this was the reason that I did not want to trouble you with my trifles for some time.</p>
      <p>What I would have liked to discuss with you, since I understood that you often converse with Dr. Wyssenburg through letters, I do not doubt that you have already received from him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I do not wish now to impose on your more serious occupations with my idle chatter.</p>
      <p>I thank you and will repay, if by the Lord's help it is granted, for the gift you sent me, your latest response against Brentius, who is attempting to once again impose sophistic theology on the church and the fierce and insolent enemies of the truth who are almost failing, which I have skimmed through as much as my occupations have allowed, and I hope soon to have the leisure to read it more diligently and attentively. Meanwhile, I grieve from the heart that such dissensions and contentions continue to grow for so long and are not finally settled in the church.</p>
      <p>But what can you do? This is the most just punishment for our ingratitude and the extreme corruption of morals, which prevails among us, who nevertheless wish to appear reborn through the gospel, just as among others. Hence the name of God (as it is written) is blasphemed among the nations because of us; for our light does not so shine before men that they see the works of charity and extol our heavenly Father with praise and glory. For the present time seems to be that of which the Lord forewarned his own, when he said: "Do you think that when the Son of Man comes, he will find faith on earth?"</p>
      <p>Likewise: "Because iniquity abounds, the love of many will grow cold." Let us therefore hope that God will soon put an end to these things; for he commands us, when these things begin to happen, to lift up our heads, because our redemption is near. Let us therefore also say with the evangelist: "Come, Lord Jesus." Amen. May the grace and spirit of the Lord be with you always.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers, that is, the preachers and professors. In Basel, on Trinity Sunday in the year of human salvation 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Hospinian.</p>
      <p>To the most high bishop of sacred theology among the Zurichers, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most esteemed brother, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
