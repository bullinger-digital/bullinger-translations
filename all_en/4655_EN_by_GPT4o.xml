      <p>S. D. My friendly, dear brother-in-law Peter Schär from Schwarzenberg wrote to me these days with the request to convey to you his friendly, willing services and many greetings. He mentioned, among other things, how Duke Christoph of Württemberg, on the 7th of January, with his eldest son, who is also well grown, rode to the meeting in Neuenburg in Saxony, where discussions were to be held concerning the tyrannical, inhuman Muscovites and the severely oppressed poor Livonians, as well as regarding the indiscreet writings and outpourings of the preachers here and there. May God grant grace and spirit, so that something good, lasting peace in religion and otherwise beneficial actions and resolutions may be achieved! Also, how the burning sky was seen in Württemberg at Aurach, Stuttgart, and Tübingen, and many other places in the principality, and how alarms were sounded and people ran from one place to another to extinguish it, etc. Also, on the 27th of December, between Tübingen and Jesingen, a village a quarter mile away from Tübingen, suddenly a hole appeared in a field, 36 feet deep, also 20 feet wide at the bottom but no wider at the top than a common gallows well, a fine, round hole, and there is 9 feet of water in it; a large crowd of people gathered there, so the hole had to be fenced off to prevent anyone from falling in. Also, Duke Christoph told him and others at the table how he received certain news from Vienna that on the 12th of December a very large snow fell in Vienna, and on the next day, the 13th of December, a very strong wind arose, which piled up all the snow, and immediately thereafter such a great angry storm came, as if it were in the middle of the greatest summer heat, with such terrible thunder and lightning, hail, rays, and finally such a dreadful thunderclap like an earthquake, that some who heard it properly died from fright alone. The Muscovite captured the brother of the Duke of Mecklenburg, who was the Grand Master in Prussia; he would like to free him; the empire promised him a hundred thousand florins as a subsidy if he would wage war against the Muscovite; thereafter they would see further what to do for him; but there is concern that it will be delayed until it is too late. The Muscovite is strong in people, has three armies, each holding 80,000 men, much stronger and more powerful than the Turk; he has besieged a city in Livonia called Revalia, on an arm of the sea, first seriously summoned it, promised highly and dearly to let them remain with all their possessions and goods, also all their heritage and freedoms in every way, not to harm them in the least, etc., to which they replied: when his hat tans and a parchment and his whole body is an inkpot and his blood ink and the letter is written with it in the best form, they would still not trust or believe him; they would rather defend themselves as long as their body and life could endure than trust him and then be miserably dishonored and murdered by him along with their wives and children. My dear cousin Jacob Zwick heard the letter read, etc.</p>
      <p>It is hoped he has not yet conquered the city. May the dear God come to the aid and comfort of the good people.</p>
      <p>All Christians should rightly stand against him with power and this misery; yet we prefer to plague each other. But I know some distinguished honorable people to whom this matter goes deeply to heart; they have a distinguished person among them; may the dear God grant them success, as I hope. They have also gone to the Duke of Mecklenburg, hoping to give him good advice. Among them, I know one, an old gentleman, and they think he is well worth two hundred thousand florins.</p>
      <p>He ventures in his great age, hoping to give the duke such guidance that he will have luck against this enemy; for he knows good means and ways and ventures mostly because he hopes the aforementioned duke will, after conquering victory against this enemy, also undertake something in our Germany that will be beneficial and highly significant for good, lasting peace. Oh God, if only we would also prepare ourselves for the Lord, that we would be worthy of such glorious means and ways! But I beg for God's sake, let it remain with you; I hope to write to you more about it soon. We are still waiting for further messages from those who have gone there; then several more will go there.</p>
      <p>May the dear God arrange everything with grace.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more, I wanted to write to you more yesterday; but people came to me with whom I had to deal for important reasons, so I could not obtain anything from our people and carters, nor from those from Constance. I was concerned about your letter, that I could not send it to you, and now I am also very rushed; if this is delayed, I will immediately send it, so that I can send you the letters. I will write tomorrow or the day after, as soon as I have a message again, more.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given on the 7th of February 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
