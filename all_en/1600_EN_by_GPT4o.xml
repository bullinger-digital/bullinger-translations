      <p>Greetings. Finally, those Tridentine sessions have also reached me on the condition that I return them. So, I am returning them; for they happened to come across the son of those from Zürich. Here I immediately thought: "What Gastius entrusted must be returned, whatever his behavior towards you may have been." I did not read them, but I had them copied, intending to read them when the opportunity arises. However, I saw the canons on the Eucharist and was so indignant that I discarded the rest. There, the proverb: "From the claw, the lion," I recognized more clearly. They are diabolical beasts; for they are governed by the devil, no matter how much they are praised in the dialogues of Nausea, especially the one about the Crescents. But he has his reward; for he died and was immediately taken home. So wrote a good man from Trento.</p>
      <p>The Emperor wishes to have Easter eggs with the people of Strasbourg; I do not know if they will allow it. He is a man set in evil; therefore, the further he is from me, the more pleasing it would be.</p>
      <p>Mainz is closed except for two gates. They have taken in 4 banners of rustic soldiers from Frankfurt, but they are chosen ones. The people of Strasbourg have their city filled with foreign soldiers. Everyone boasts of the Emperor: but I say: "What if the auxiliaries sent by the Emperor are to be future help for the Emperor, so that he may more easily achieve his desire in serving cakes and Easter eggs?" Let them beware.</p>
      <p>Our city is filled with German soldiers running about; our region is even more filled; for they are gathered here until they depart.</p>
      <p>The people of Rheinfelden had a selection of soldiers in recent days. Through the Sundgau, they called the peasants to arms with bells; they shouted that Schertlin was approaching with an army. They fear him as much as anyone and yet they slander him so much that it would not be surprising if he were overwhelmed by curses. The good man suffers many and very serious injuries.</p>
      <p>The following is for your ear: the son of the Landgrave is hiding here, as well as the young Duke of Mecklenburg, and the day before yesterday, one who had been captured by the people of Magdeburg arrived; I think the young men are to be taken to France as hostages; what the elder will do is uncertain.</p>
      <p>From letters from Trento, I have been informed that the letters of safe conduct have not yet been given to the Mauritian theologians. Some have been given, but they are different from those that Maurice requested.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he consults with others on what more should be done. But perhaps more on this matter another time. Farewell in the Lord with Dr. Theodor, Gwalther, Otto, etc. Basel, March 18, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
