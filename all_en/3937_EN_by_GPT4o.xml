      <p>Greetings. Although, most illustrious man, I have nothing at this time to write to you, and I certainly do not doubt your kindness towards me and ours, with which you have treated us thus far, nevertheless, when that good young man, a member of our church, was recalled from Strasbourg to be sent to you, I did not want to send him without a brief letter (so as not to impose more burden on you, who are pressed with other numerous affairs), and although there is no need for a recommendation (for I do not doubt that you will consider him most commendable), unless it would be an occasion for him to meet you, so that someone whom your kindness has never seen before might be more easily recognized later. Then, because he is clearly intent on living with some learned man, especially a preacher of the divine word, I thought you might be able to provide your assistance and advice here; you will see whether you would take on such a trouble (forgive me, reverend man, for writing so imperiously) and ensure (for I do not doubt your ability), that he might have a place either with Mr. Lavater or Simler or Zwingli.</p>
      <p>The young man is good, pious, and modest, and he arrives well-equipped with testimonials from the learned men of Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Or if it is not convenient for any of these to receive him, I hope you can persuade either Mr. Haller or Mr. Burckhardt, and if none of these are available, some other learned and pious man. I do not know whether Mr. Gwalther and Wolfius have such boarders. Therefore, I ask you, most kind Mr. Bullinger, to assist this young man in this matter as a kind father; if it is not possible to repay, we will never be ungrateful, so that he may be allowed to live with you according to his heart's desire.</p>
      <p>Additionally, our countrymen pay much attention to where and with whom our stipendiaries (scholarship holders) associate. We have nothing from the diets (assemblies), except what we understand and almost guess in passing. The Papists are plotting something against our churches and hope that the sworn followers of the Augsburg Confession will not fail them; but the Lord knows His own and will defend them, etc. We have sent all letters to Vergerius to Tübingen, but less quickly, because we lacked those who would go there; for such people are rarer. Farewell, most learned man, and interpret my foolishness in the best light and, in my name and on behalf of all of ours, bid all learned men much health. Schaffhausen, April 28, 1559.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Jakob Rüeger. To the most illustrious man endowed with singular learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, a most venerable lord and brother.</p>
