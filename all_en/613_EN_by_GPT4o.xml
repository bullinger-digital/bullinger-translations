      <p>To the most distinguished men and faithful servants of Christ, the pastors and teachers of the church in Zürich, dearest colleagues and esteemed brothers, Johannes Calvin sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Although I address you on the same matter repeatedly, I do not think I need to fear being seen as importunate. Since both parties share the same zeal, it is inevitable that what I do is approved by you.</p>
      <p>However, the reason I press the matter a bit more urgently is that the constant demands of good men urge me on. I have already mentioned several times that many are offended, albeit for a slight reason and not without pretext, because I seem to teach something different from you regarding the sacraments. They rightly revere your church, which is adorned with so many splendid gifts, and perhaps they also show some deference to our church and to me personally; thus, they wish to be aided by our writings in learning the doctrine of piety, so that no appearance of dissension may hinder their progress. Since I thought there could be no more suitable remedy for removing this offense than if we were to jointly enter into a familiar conversation to testify to our agreement, I undertook the journey to you, as you know, and our venerable colleague Wilhelm Farel, being the tireless soldier of Christ that he is, who was otherwise my guide and author, did not refuse to join me as a companion, so that we might agree and testify to what we can truly and faithfully on both sides. But because I cannot persuade everyone of the matter as it is, it pains me greatly that those whose tranquility I would prefer to see better provided for remain anxious or at least in suspense. Therefore, as I stated at the beginning, I do not think I am doing anything untimely if I urge that there be some public testimony of the agreement that exists between us.</p>
      <p>I have indeed thought it worthwhile to briefly collect and arrange in order the main points we discussed among ourselves, so that, if my advice is approved by us, anyone may see, as if on a tablet, what has been done and transacted between us.</p>
      <p>I am confident that you will be witnesses to me that I have faithfully reported from our conversations whatever I shall submit. We, that is, Farel and I, have sought with equal zeal as you a sincere transparency free from all deceit and cunning, as I hope pious readers will notice, although I would like them to be reminded at the same time that nothing is contained here that our colleagues, as many as serve Christ either under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Geneva or in the County of Neuchâtel, have not also approved with their subscription.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent men and brothers truly to be esteemed by me from the heart. May the Lord continue to guide you with His Spirit for the edification of His church and bless your labors!</p>
      <p>Geneva, on the calends of August, in the year of our Lord 1549.</p>
      <p>The main points of agreement, etc.</p>
