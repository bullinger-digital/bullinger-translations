      <p>My most illustrious Bullinger, the assemblies, which I wrote that I ought to attend, are not yet finished, and yet for very just reasons I am not attending; but as soon as they are concluded, I will immediately hasten to you. In the meantime, if the two small vessels have not yet left Zurich, order them to stay and not to proceed further; indeed, if they have left, I beg you, Bullinger, by your faith, to send a foot messenger and order them to stay, even if two crowns had to be spent for me; this I ask you again and again, not, I say, that they return to Zurich, but that they be held with some pastor. I will arrive shortly, full of the evils that are happening in Italy by the Antichrist, and there are few who remain steadfast. Aurelius barely escaped, but by divine help he escaped from his clutches; for I had sent him there. In short: that beast rages, especially against me, however insignificant I may be. Farewell and greetings to you with the whole family, school, and church.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, 29th October 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>In Zurich. To Zurich.</p>
