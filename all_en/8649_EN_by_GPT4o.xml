      <p>Grace and peace and many greetings from God, the best and greatest, I sincerely pray for your excellence and diligently commend friendly services.</p>
      <p>Your remarkable piety, Bullinger, most illustrious man, has greatly delighted me for many years, which I have come to know from your most learned and orthodox writings. Because of this greatness and glory of your name, which you have achieved through singular virtue and effort, I have always been devoted to you and have endeavored to embrace you in any way possible and to declare how much I am your friend. While I was contemplating these things, your letters, full of sweetness and duty, were conveniently and opportunely brought to me by Mr. Christoph Thretius, along with your book on the origin of error, when he last returned from you. These letters offered me what I was eagerly longing for and abundantly showed the study of your most friendly will towards me, stemming from the goodness of your nature. For this reason, I give you the greatest thanks, as I have been able to enjoy the sweetness of your intellect and the use of a most pleasant friendship, fulfilling my wish. However, as I have delayed somewhat in responding and giving thanks, I earnestly ask you not to attribute it to the vice of ingratitude or illiberality but rather to external circumstances. For not only have private concerns hindered my counsel and will, but also public causes have interrupted the plan of my thoughts, by which I had decided to prove to you the signification of my grateful mind. Among the chief causes is that I had intended to send my dearest children to your German regions with our Mr. Thretius as their guide, and in this way, to converse with you more conveniently through Mr. Thretius and to carry out what I wished. But because the magnitude and variety of this most perilous time moved me to change the plan to which I was entirely intent, this matter brought me not a little mental distress, especially since you have deigned to send not only a second but also a third letter, as if awakening me from torpor with the frequency of your most delightful letters, in which you also mention the business of Jodocus Schadcowien and rouse me from lethargy. Therefore, I think I should no longer remain silent, but, as for the first matter, know that your book "On the Origin of Error," recently augmented, has gained a celebrated reputation among us, which celebration I prefer to leave in the opinion of others rather than place in magnificent adornment. For if I measure its reading by utility and pleasure, I find nothing by which I can sufficiently express its dignity and commendation, of which I myself am a witness to my silent joy. However, to give at least a small token of my grateful mind, I earnestly ask that you accept this small gift, which I send enclosed with these letters, in the same friendly and kind spirit with which I received your book. If any opportunity arises for you to reciprocate or to reveal my goodwill towards you, you will certainly find no lack of duty in me, but you will always recognize the readiness of a most dutiful and friendly man.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding Jodocus Schadcowien, I see that our Mr. Thretius is easily affected by uncommon sorrow, because you are somewhat displeased with him for the delay in the business of Jodocus, which was completed later than you desired. To be honest, he is certainly blameless, as this business was not placed in his hand and power. As I mentioned before, if Mr. Thretius had set out for Germany with my children, he would have diligently taken care of and expedited everything related to Jodocus with you; for this was how the plan was distributed over time. Therefore, I consider it fair, most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, that Mr. Thretius, a good man and our singular friend, be exempted from all blame. For it also happened that he was absent for several months to complete certain matters concerning the state of our church, for which the entire church had sent him to the royal court, and for which he certainly deserves pardon by the best right, especially since he is most observant of you and all the people of Zürich. However, Mr. Thretius reported to us that Jodocus lived with you as with parents and enjoyed remarkable generosity, which we also learned from Jodocus himself, how many benefits you, most illustrious man, have bestowed upon him, for which I would like you to be persuaded that you have placed benefits with the most grateful people. Meanwhile, this small gift, a slight sign of gratitude, which we offer to your humanity in the name of Jodocus (which we added to the debt contracted by Jodocus with you, which Mr. Thretius arranged separately through merchants), although it is unequal to your merits, we earnestly ask that you consider it favorably. If, furthermore, our services can respond to your great beneficence on any occasion, we will do everything to prove our faith and gratitude to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>Given in Kraków on the eighth day before the calends of September 1571.</p>
      <p>Your sincere friend Hieronymus Buzynski of Buzenin, treasurer of the Kingdom of Poland, captain of Kraków, Brzeżyn, and Krzeczów, wrote with his own hand. [...] to the honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, senior, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, etc., dearest friend and [...]</p>
