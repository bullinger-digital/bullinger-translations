    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the letter and praises Bullinger's preface [to Münster's "Biblia sacra", Zurich (Christoph Froschauer) 1539]; some theologians criticize his translation of the Old Testament from Hebrew and believe that it would have been better if it had not been done. He will now work on the Geography of Ptolemy ["Geographia universalis", Basel (Heinrich Petri) 1540] and on the Christian-Jewish dialogue ["Messias Christianorum et Iudaeorum", Basel (Heinrich Petri) 1539]; two sheets of it have already been printed in Hebrew.</p>

      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a truly Christian man, a vigorous herald of the divine word among the people of Zurich and a faithful minister of Christ.</p>
      <p>Greetings and peace in the Lord. I have received and read what you wrote, most illustrious man, and there is no need for you to thank me on behalf of the students for my labors, since rather I and all the students owe you much, who have so adorned my work with your writings. Your diligence and that theological preface of yours please me exceedingly, which I could never have forged with such industry from the workshop of my mind. Here I acknowledge, whether I like it or not, the slowness, indeed the dullness, of my mind, and again I admire the gifts granted to you and many other truly Christian men by the giver of all good things, so far is it from being the case that these small things, which I have received from above, lead to the exaltation of my mind. I fear that you have been more inclined to praise me with a certain ingenuous favor than you should have been, since the more learned ones found here, who are regarded as great in theology, would prefer my work, which I applied to translating the Old Testament according to Hebraism, to have been left undone. For the simplicity of my speech and style irritates them and my unlearned presumption offends them, but the die is cast. I have done what I could; let those who have better and greater things bring forth what they have received. We cannot all do everything. One indeed acts thus, another however thus, as each one has received from the Lord, he acts as a steward of the entrusted mysteries.</p>
      <p>Besides Ptolemy's Geography, I am now also working on the debate between the Jewish and Christian man in faith, and indeed two sheets have already been printed in Hebrew and the booklet has been begun; may the Lord grant that it be successfully brought to completion for the glory of His name. Farewell, faithful minister and administrator of Christ.</p>
      <p>Basel, the third day after Easter. Sebastian Münster</p>
