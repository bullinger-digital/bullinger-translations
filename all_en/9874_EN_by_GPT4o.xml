      <p>Greetings in Christ. I confess that I owe you very much, dearest brother, for kindly visiting me with your letters, albeit brief. It is not surprising that you are occasionally ill, since old age itself is a kind of illness. If you refrain from writing, we will be content in the meantime with what you have written so far by God's grace for His glory and the edification of His church.</p>
      <p>May God supply you with the strength to accomplish what you intend with a pious mind! I am very glad that concord has been reached among you. Among us, the faction of our people is somewhat restrained by the fear of punishment; for our magistrates perceive that dangers arise from trivial and useless innovations. And with the same fear, they restrain the fury of the papists. We hear that those in France, who fight for the pope, are attempting the utmost. May the Lord Jesus deign to be present with His own! Would that the Lord would rend the heavens and come down, and bridle the mouths of the papists, Turks, and schismatics! But our sins do not allow it. May God grant that we all strive for that unity to which you beautifully exhort all churchmen with many solid and sound reasons.</p>
      <p>As the occasion permits, I greet my brothers in your name. I send a small token of my mind to be shared with you and Julius, and I commend myself to your prayers. May God, the best and greatest, preserve you with your most holy city!</p>
      <p>From the Isle of Ely in England, January 25, 1575, according to our reckoning.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and dearest brother in Christ, Richard, Bishop of Ely.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest brother, and the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church.</p>
