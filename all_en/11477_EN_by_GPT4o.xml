    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to lack of opportunity, he has not written for a longer time; a messenger he was expecting to return has died. He is glad that Bullinger is doing better again. That the English King [Henry VIII] persecutes the church does not surprise him in view of the fate of his wives; also Emperor [Charles V] rages [in Flanders], while some expect good from him. As soon as Joachim [Maler] reports on the course of the meeting [in Worms], Zwick will also inform Bullinger. He has written to Pellikan about [the secondary marriage of Philip of] Hesse and to Leo [Jud] about Michael [Back]; Bullinger should take up the matter of the latter. Konstanz asks Zurich for an opinion on a marital law issue; the people of Zurich should not judge too harshly. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I am not silent because you write less frequently, but because there are now fewer opportunities to write, and you do not err by being silent, as long as you are not silent out of some indignation. The reason I have not responded to your letters for a longer time is due to the expectation of the messenger; for when he delivered your letters, he promised to return shortly, but now I hear from another and later messenger that he has passed away.</p>
      <p>I understood from your letters that you have not been in good health for some time, but now you are somewhat better. The latter is most pleasing to me - not for your own sake, for it would be better for us to be dissolved quickly and be with Christ - but whenever it comes to mind, what the state of the church will be with the holy apostles taken away, I shudder completely and see that if not in one rush, at least gradually, all impiety will break in. Although I do not ignore that it is up to the Lord to create children of Abraham from stones, yet it is questioned whether He wills what He can, and then, whether our ingratitude deserves it.</p>
      <p>What you write about England is not new to me; for I never promised myself anything good from that king, after he so cruelly and deceitfully repudiated his first wife and killed the second, not to mention the others. He extinguished his wives, and he also extinguishes the bride of Christ (the church). The same is done by the emperor, who recently began to rage fiercely against his own. Meanwhile, there are those who expect something good from him, which we will beautifully feel with the Lord's connivance.</p>
      <p>What the assembly will produce is still unknown, we have not yet heard anything from our Joachim, but we hope that our innocence and the truth itself will fare better if we are exposed to give an account of our faith to all. But may Christ turn everything for the good. Amen. As soon as our envoy writes back, I will make sure that you are not left in ignorance.</p>
      <p>I write to Pellikan about the matter of Hesse. But I write something to Leo about my Michael, who is mine as long as he is with me. Here I ask you again and again, do not neglect anything; but there is no time to delay.</p>
      <p>Then our people seek advice from you, as I hear, in the case of divorce or adultery. Here we would like you to respond more mildly, not towards the guilty, but the innocent. But this too from the German letters to Leo.</p>
      <p>Now farewell, and urge the Lord with many prayers, that He may not forsake us. All good people greet you again, especially Ambrosius with his brother. From Konstanz, November 16, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
