      <p>Greetings. Yesterday evening, reverend father in Christ, I received your letter while I was at dinner with Bäldio and the lords consuls, whom I greeted in your name, and they respectfully send their greetings to you. You know why Bäldio is here. We are discussing certain matters in secret. If God blesses our endeavor, the foundations of peace can be laid. But since nothing has been decided or concluded yet, I cannot write anything certain to you. Today, G[regorius] C[arlinus] is expected, and when he arrives, he will also consult with Bäldio and c[onsul] Tsch[arnero] (we three alone are handling these matters so far); he defends the interests of the Beatenberg region, etc. Keep all this to yourself for now, etc. - Furthermore, what you write about the title pleases me entirely. They do not use this term 'minister'; therefore, nothing should be changed in the subscription either. If one already writes of the evangelical church, then they should also be evangelical. Therefore, it pleases me that nothing at all is changed. But if it has already happened, it does not matter much, etc. - I had written to Mr. Heinrich, your son, and informed him that I had taken care of all those matters of Rosenboumii and sent them; I added letters. Why does he not write back, whether he received them? It was sent to Zurich in Baschli Harnaster's sack. - Recently, I also sent you a document of 10 Jurisdictions; I hope you have received it by now. You write nothing about my letters written to the senate, whether I have the senate's favor or not, etc. - What you write about the pope's death, I had known for a long time; but my distress made me forget the news. I believe it to be true because it is being reported from everywhere, and Storrerus secretly told the same to Baltassar from Grysach a few weeks ago. I have nothing from Italy. The soldiers passing through here are mostly poor fellows; I have not seen a proper servant among them; add to that, each one has exactly 12 batzen as running money, which is the common soldiers' pay, and all those I have seen are begging. If they are supposed to defend against the Turks, I would like to see it. - The entourage of the Cardinal of Constance passed through here; he himself was on the way and, I think, because of the snow or other reasons, did not want to cross the Alps and retreated to Trento, etc." as if I acted against the Christian church order. The reasons are countless, some of which I will keep to myself and take with me to the grave for the sake of my and the land's honor; I also know well that even if I said much, few would believe it." Since the lords from 7 places were here as envoys, I named, mocked, and slandered them from the pulpit. Now the abbot of Pfäfers has driven things just as badly, as he dined with the landammann Bäldi at night in Ufferfaren. And what bothers me even more, since everything here in the land has been quiet for a while: if a good man does something with good intentions, it cannot be built upon; because the fellows, since they are partisan and do nothing in vain, make their calculations or are equal to them. Thus, I have great costs in this episcopal matter; because whenever I call upon the brothers or forbid something to someone, it happens at my expense. Still, the fellows advise each other that the bishop has promised me a part of his bishopric. I have gone up twice, had to; once because my lords of the court and council would not leave me alone, once because the bishop's brother, who is of our religion, requested me at his deathbed, where Pontisella went with me. But now Lord Landammann Bäldi has been informed that I am day and night in the castle and enjoy the priests' food well.</p>
      <p>Until the matter is settled and a means is established so that Lord Batt cannot harm this church, which the evangelicals themselves want, much more in the future, I will work with all diligence. But if my Christian undertaking should not succeed (which I hope it will), then I must let some, who want to be unfortunate by force, be unfortunate. What is to be done? Whatever comes unexpectedly, it concerns me, my wife and child, and the city of Chur; it costs me my life. I do not know if I should put myself in such danger for the sake of the unholy priests, since there is no loyalty to one another; they call each other their whole lives. All the blame is on the people of Chur; they did not want to follow. [...] since I am now half a theologian and have no time here to study and read [...] because I am tired. I trust you as my father in all good things.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 25, 1566.</p>
      <p>Today there is a meeting here from the God's House; I still do not know what has been handled; the answer is expected, which the Upper League will give, and its proclamation.</p>
