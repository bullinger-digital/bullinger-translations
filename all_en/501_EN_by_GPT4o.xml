      <p>To the man endowed with true piety and singular learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Z端rich church, my most esteemed patron and lord, Johannes Rudolf Stumpf sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Your utmost benevolence not only towards me but also towards my dearest parents, and your proven loyalty, have been demonstrated in every way, especially through the countless benefits you have bestowed upon us, and most notably through our last conversation, full of humanity, friendship, duty, and diligence, during which you bid me farewell. Strengthened and relying on these, I did not hesitate to address you with this letter; and first, to recount the state of my condition, and then to briefly mention what I wish. After leaving my homeland and completing a long journey full of labors, expenses, dangers, and troubles, I finally reached the desired destination of London on May 16th; leaving Mr. Hooper with his dear family in London, I went to Oxford on the 25th of the same month. There, I was received most kindly by all and the most learned men: all immediately began to inquire about you and speak of you at our first meeting, and promised me all their support and services in your favor; especially Mr. Peter Martyr, your sincere friend, and Mr. Sydall, a man of great authority, much learning, excellent faith, truly a civil and humane man, my patron, partly due to the recommendation of Mr. Treherne, and partly out of love for you. To all this was added a certain and great generosity of Mr. Cox towards me and my studies: for through the assistance of this distinguished man, I was admitted to the college called King's, under the conditions that, by paying a modest fee annually, I could live most comfortably among the best, and easily the leaders in learning and authority of the entire university, the king's scholars.</p>
      <p>Therefore, considering the beneficence of such great men, I thought it of great importance to show myself grateful and mindful in every way and on every occasion offered. I see that this can be done in no way more conveniently or better than if I could obtain from you that you would sometimes assist me with your letters. For in this matter, whatever has been done, there is no one who doubts that regard has been had for your dignity. For great is the opinion of those men about you, great is the reverence for your learning, great is the memory of your writings, and great indeed is the commendation and hope of your friendship. But you see how much more distinct and illustrious these will be if some daily praise is added from your benefactions. Since this is so, I earnestly ask, beg, and beseech you to protect and assist me with your service; to ensure that my studies are commended by you to these excellent men, and thus to desire that my interests be defended and increased through you. I have no doubt that you can do this as much as you are willing: and that it will be most easy for you to do, most pleasing to them, and most useful to me; for I know that by diligently giving thanks here, I will obtain more than by asking improperly. Therefore, if you deign to do this, I promise and pledge to you that I will confirm and attach every excellent person in love for you: no less indeed Mr. Sydall, civil, serious, yet humane, a vigorous preacher of Christ, most desirous of you, no less I say than Mr. Cox, I wish you to treat with your letters, so that he may understand that the commendation of the benefits conferred upon me was not ordinary: for I can also testify to his utmost zeal and duty towards you. Indeed, very often with me, not only provoked by me but also of his own accord, good God, how magnificently he is accustomed to communicate his thoughts about you!</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask that you consider my situation in this matter of my absence: if you do this, I will consider that you have provided everything for me.</p>
      <p>With Mr. Hooper, I have always had and still have such great familiarity and companionship that none could be greater; for with his excellent assistance and advice, I cannot sufficiently express how much he has helped me. He is a true friend of the Z端rich church, the republic, and liberty, and a protector against all calumny. I am very familiar with our Johannes Uldmio: for there is an old acquaintance between us; and also your letters to Mr. Cox, in which you commended the man, have secured for me even greater companionship than before.</p>
      <p>All friends in England are safe.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given at Oxford, in the year 1549 after the birth of Christ. Your most observant of dignity, Jo. Rodolphus Stumphius.</p>
      <p>To the man of utmost learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Z端rich church, my most esteemed patron and lord. In Z端rich.</p>
