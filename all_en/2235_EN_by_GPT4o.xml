      <p>S. D. I give you, esteemed and dearest brother, my greatest thanks, both for your most friendly letters and for the copy of your book given to me as a gift. Haller, to whom you sent it, only sent it to me after eight days; hence I have not yet been able to read it thoroughly.</p>
      <p>For this entire week, I have been wholly occupied with sacred sermons. Nevertheless, I glanced through it and found that you included our letter, not without an honorable mention of our church; for which we thank you. I have no doubt that you handle everything with the utmost and most complete faith. I only fear that the book may be less pleasing to many simpler people, yet very eager for you and the truth, due to its brevity, and therefore also because of the obscurity and gravity of the subject matter.</p>
      <p>Indeed, your style, especially in this work, seems to be more serious. Nevertheless, we all confess that we owe you great thanks, and the more learned owe you the greatest thanks. I am sure you will kindly consider this boldness of mine; for I love you sincerely. What we have replied to that Scot recommended to us by you, I have enclosed here.</p>
      <p>You will send it back when the opportunity allows. I commend to your piety and humanity these two Englishmen; one of whom, Mr. Thomas Lever, preached before the king, while the other is a private nobleman. The former is a learned and remarkably pious man: they stayed with me for about 14 days. I was greatly delighted by their piety. They have decided to live with you for some time. I therefore pray that you may be willing to point out to them, if you can, holy and comfortable hosts. Whatever you bestow upon them, I will consider as bestowed upon me: indeed, you will bestow it upon Christ. I hope you have long since received my books "On the Grace of God Justifying Us for Christ's Sake through Faith Alone, etc."; for I sent them to Mr. Haller. Live and farewell eternally, always mindful of us in your prayers. May all the fellow ministers be safe.</p>
      <p>A serious war is being prepared by the Emperor against the French: and the Germans, divided into many parts, are paying the penalty for their ingratitude.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 26, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my lord and esteemed and dear brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
      <p>Response given to a certain Scot, to some questions about the kingdom of Scotland and England. 1. Whether the king's son, upon the death of the king his father, by right of birth, although unable to administer the kingdom due to his youth, should be considered a legitimate magistrate, to whom it is necessary to obey by divine right?</p>
      <p>He seems to me to be considered a legitimate king, who is ordained according to the not unjust national laws. Thus it is established that the blessed memory of Edward VI was ordained. For his dying father designated him as king, and thus the right of the kingdom, which they say is hereditary, demanded it: the estates of the kingdom received him: which they testified by the coronation. They provided him with counselors, otherwise endowed with great gifts of God.</p>
      <p>Nor was anything lacking in that kingdom, which is usually required in a most happy kingdom: therefore he was a legitimate king, and his laws and constitutions must be obeyed. He established the kingdom more sacredly than the three most prudent and happiest kings of this kingdom who reigned before him. 2. Whether a woman can preside over a kingdom and govern it by divine right, and thus transfer the right of the kingdom to her husband?</p>
      <p>The law of God commands that a woman should be subject and not rule: which is clear in the books of both Testaments. But if, by the laws and customs of the kingdom permitting or commanding, a woman is received as queen, the hereditary right of the kingdom thus requiring, who marries a husband, meanwhile governs the reins of power through counselors; it will be dangerous for the pious to oppose political laws, especially since the gospel does not seem to overthrow or abrogate the hereditary right and political laws of kingdoms: nor do we read that Philip, by the right of the gospel, overthrew Candace from the kingdom of Ethiopia. If she is not Deborah, but rather an impious one who presides, and has obtained power by tyranny, the pious have an example and consolation in Athalia. The Lord overthrows unjust dominations through his own, whom he equips with abilities for this purpose, as he did with Jerubbaal, the Maccabees, and Jehoiada, in his own time.</p>
      <p>Whether she can conveniently transfer the right of the kingdom to her husband, those who know the laws and customs of the kingdom will answer. 3. Whether it is necessary to obey a magistrate commanding idolatry and condemning true religion; and whether the nobles, still holding towns and fortresses with armed force, can repel this impious force from themselves and their own?</p>
      <p>It is not necessary to obey a king or magistrate commanding impious things against God and his legitimate worship, but rather both body and life and fortunes must be exposed to danger, as the history of Daniel teaches, and the explicit command of God, Matthew 10, and the example of the apostles, Acts 4 and 5, and many martyrs in ecclesiastical history.</p>
      <p>This power is the power of darkness, as the Lord says in the gospel. And Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, book 9, chapter 8, recounts that the Armenians took up arms against their legitimate magistrate, against the Roman emperors who wanted to force them into idolatry. Nor is their deed disapproved. The Armenians themselves, many years later, defected to Emperor Justin because of the impiety of the Persian kings, having slain the impious garrisons: which Evagrius recounts, Ecclesiastical History, book 5, chapter 8. For the holy scripture not only grants but also commands just and necessary defense to the magistrate.</p>
      <p>However, since under the pretext of just and necessary assertion or defense, other things are often sought, and the worst mix with the good, and the times are most dangerous, it is difficult to pronounce on individual causes. For well-known circumstances contribute greatly here, which, since they are not clear to us, it would be foolish to order or define anything certain here. For Paul is read to have used the arms of the Romans against conspirators, and indeed rightly used them, who, however, is read elsewhere in almost the same or similar cause, fighting only with patience, to have used no arms.</p>
      <p>Therefore, much prayer and much wisdom are needed here, lest we attempt anything rashly and with depraved affections, which may result in the detriment of many good people. Meanwhile, it is better to die than to accept idolatry. 4. To which party should the pious adhere if religious nobles resist an idolatrous king in war?</p>
      <p>We leave this to the judgment of the pious to assess, who have a clear view of the whole matter, and in all things regard the word of God, attempt nothing contrary to the laws of God, obey the suggestions of the Holy Spirit, and take counsel from the place, time, occasion, persons, and things, and attempt nothing rashly, and therefore seek more certain judgment from their own consciences than from others. We advise above all, however, that the causes for which hypocrites reign, crimes, be removed; that, I say, through true repentance we may return to grace with God, and implore his help and counsel. He is the only true liberator; who in the books of Judges and Kings, and in ecclesiastical histories, never failed his church. To him let us lift our eyes, expecting his redemption. Meanwhile, let us abstain from all superstition and idolatry, doing what he reveals to us in his word.</p>
