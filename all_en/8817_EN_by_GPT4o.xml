      <p>God be with us, dearly beloved son, I am surprised that you have not sent or written to me for so long, nor have you responded to the letter concerning the debt in Nuremberg and Balthasar. Whatever more certain news I have from France, the Palatinate, the Netherlands, and from Chur, I have given to Heinrich to copy; I hope he has done so; for these days I have become so tired with writing letters to Frankfurt that I barely write this letter to you, and I need your service, that you prepare this small package for me to Schaffhausen to the young J. Ber. Stocker and also include my greetings and a small note, offering him that you have kept it in your house for well 3 weeks and forgot to send it to him; now send it to him with the offering of your services and mine. For the good young man has written to me these days and thanked me very much for my little books; I sent them to his sister, Mrs. Ursula von Cham, to give to him, and I am not aware that I gave them to her; consider it a polite gesture. Since I would not like him to think that I honored others from Schaffhausen and forgot him. Therefore, help me with a polite note, which harms no one, and let me know how it went.</p>
      <p>As for us, things are reasonably well; only I always have great trouble with my bladder and then continuously much and bad times; may God grant grace. Greet Susana and the children for us; the better Annli Wirt has given birth to a little girl and is doing well. Felix has returned to Strasbourg, traveling with Froschauer.</p>
      <p>Dated Friday, March 14th, with good weather. Praise be to God, in the year 1572. All the people greet you.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
