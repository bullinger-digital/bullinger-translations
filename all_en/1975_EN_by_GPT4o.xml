      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ the Savior, I pray for you from the heart, most esteemed Bullinger, meanwhile giving thanks for the literary gift which you recently gave me.</p>
      <p>Would that an occasion might present itself either to repay you in kind or at least to declare my most ready goodwill towards you. However, since I have observed your diligence and concern towards everyone, especially towards the churches of Christ, I have not hesitated to impose this burden on you, even though you are almost overwhelmed with countless affairs. Therefore, dearest brother, I do not doubt that you have been informed of the tricks by which that bishop of Constance has deceived the one whom our church in Buchberg had declared as preacher. When he was not admitted by our most honorable senate for some just reasons, and another was presented in his place by the steward in Öhningen through Ludwig Bovillus, he struck out three, agreeing with the rest, and when he informed us of this, we were indignant that the ministers of the churches of Christ were being dictated to by the satellites of the Antichrist, not without serious harm to the churches. Therefore, approaching the consul, we admonish the senate of the impending danger. The senate had already agreed to what Bovillus had proposed; however, the decree had not yet been made known to the steward.</p>
      <p>They change the decree; it is decided that at the first assembly of the people of Baden, the envoys of your republic and that of Bern should be asked how they conduct themselves in such matters, so that they too may act more cautiously and freely towards such papists in the future.</p>
      <p>I would like to ask you, if you have the leisure, to inform us in German letters of the practice you have among you. There remains one more thing I ask of you, to declare to me how you use the laying on of hands and by whom, and then what you chiefly discuss in the sermon. For this burden has been imposed on me, truly a yoke for an ox. Therefore, I prefer to use your example in this matter than to declare my own imprudence. For I know with what gifts you are endowed by the Spirit of the Lord above others, which I do not doubt you will willingly share with us out of your kindness towards us. The news I have, recently written to me by Mr. Sultzer, is as follows: Schweinfurt is besieged by the bishops of Würzburg and Bamberg, Blasemberg, the fortress of Albert, by the Nurembergers.</p>
      <p>Henry of Brunswick has declared war on the people of Brunswick and Hanover, an old man almost insane and furious, because they had joined Albert. But Albert's forces are also increasing and being replenished. Augustus, the brother of Maurice, is said to have died returning from Denmark; however, I will only believe it when I receive more certain information, although this is the constant rumor, as is also said of Maximilian, the king of Bohemia, whom some affirm for certain has made room for the gospel in that kingdom and has sent at least 70 ministers from Saxony to administer the doctrine of Christ; but I fear that this too may be less true.</p>
      <p>He also wrote some things about England, which I do not doubt have been communicated to you much more certainly. The impudence of Johannes Winzürn, the monk, has finally erupted with great scandal to the church and the ministers. May the Lord grant him true repentance, of which he has given no sign yet. Give my many greetings to Mr. Theodor, Mr. Pellican, and Mr. Gwalther. Grübelius and Rügerus send their greetings to you. Farewell in Christ.</p>
      <p>In haste. Schaffhausen, 3 days before the Kalends of September, in the year 1553. Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>For our matter, I would consider it beneficial that those who are appointed as pastors to our churches be bound by the same formula of oath that you use, and I do not doubt that if it is suitably proposed to our senate, they will gladly embrace it. I hear it is demanded there before the whole synod. Therefore, I would like to ask you to send the heads of that oath, so that we may propose it to our magistrate both certainly and suitably. Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed master.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
