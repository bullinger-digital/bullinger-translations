      <p>S. D. P. I received your letter, given on October 21st, but not at the right time. The messenger was slow; he did not deliver the letter. Therefore, I ask that you do not be angry with me and continue to inform us of the situation; for there are many rumors among us; everyone speaks according to their own preference.</p>
      <p>We have many papists and many imperialists; each speaks according to his own liking. There is nothing special with us, except that the French are constantly moving in and out. The imperialists are confident; they believe that fortune has allied itself with them. May God bring it to a good end. Our sins demand such punishment and even worse. May the Lord God be gracious to us. Farewell in the Lord. Chur, November 1st, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>Philippus, Pontasella, Haimius, and Tscharnerus greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
