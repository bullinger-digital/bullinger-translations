      <p>S. D. I send to your kindness two copies of my response given to Mr. Johannes Brenz; one for you, the other for your son; please greet him most kindly. I sent letters to him in the previous months, which I asked him to forward to Poland; I hope he has done this service for me. You have undoubtedly read the book published by Brenz against me; indeed, I am, if anyone else, most eager for peace, but I could not ignore this writing of the man, so full of offenses. I believe I am defending the old and simple doctrine of the Church of Christ in this controversy, which never mixed heaven with earth nor spread Christ's humanity everywhere, not to mention the doctrine of the Lord's Supper. I pray to the Lord with humble prayers that He may bless my labor and use it for the glory of His name. From Brenz, I expect nothing but loads of insults and utmost immodesty, for in this book published against me, he could hardly have written more contemptuously. May the Lord forgive him his sin and turn him to Himself or prevent him from harming the simple.</p>
      <p>It is a miserable and deplorable thing that we, who preach one Christ, cannot agree amicably among ourselves, but prefer to present a pleasant spectacle of our internal struggle to our enemies. But such are our times, and our sins deserve such things; yet high-minded, contentious, and obstinate spirits produce no other fruits. May the Lord have mercy on His otherwise most afflicted Church; this miserable one is tormented not so much by enemies as by those who wish to appear as friends. You are not unaware that Brenz himself descended to a colloquy in Zabern with Cardinal Lorraine, who is steeped in the blood of the saints, etc. May the Lord scatter wicked plans.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 13, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Johannes Kessler, schoolmaster at St. Gallen, esteemed lord and dearest brother. St. Gallen, to the schoolmaster Mr. Kessler.</p>
