      <p>Honorable and gracious lord, my willing service is always at your disposal. I would be very pleased to hear about your and your family's well-being and health.</p>
      <p>Know that I (praise and thanks be to God) arrived here on the 2nd of July; I would have liked to visit you again, but I was unable to do so due to my company, as I wrote to you in a letter from Baden. Since I arrived here, I received a letter from you through Mr. Hans Lienart of St. Gallen on the 11th of this month, dated June 7th. Mr. Hans Lijner also writes to me that he received a letter from you, in which you mention that you received my letter from Baden. I also received the books from St. Gallen two days ago and learned from the enclosed note that they cost 4 guilders less 2 batzen, which I send to you herewith with special thanks; if there are any additional costs incurred to St. Gallen, please inform me. However, with these books, I did not receive the "Fundamentum," but instead your "Confessio," which I already have. I suspect it is the bookseller's fault, having taken one for the other.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my very friendly request once again is to send me 2 copies, and also indicate what they cost, as I do not wish to have them for free, since you have previously done more kindness and good for me than I can deserve.</p>
      <p>I have replied to the letter to Mr. Laurentius, who sends you very friendly greetings and will write back to you soon. Our church is still in discord, the Flacians have no rest, they do not want to stop their raging and fury, doing nothing but disturbing the church. Recently, a booklet was published, printed in Basel: "De communicatione idiomatum," by Wigandus.</p>
      <p>This is considered a godless book by Mr. Mauritio and Laurentius, but defended by the opposing side, so it would be necessary for this booklet to be refuted, which would undoubtedly bring great benefit to the local church. And as you mentioned regarding the benefactor, your letters have been sent to Krakow through them. And a few days ago, Christophorus Tretius was here with me, and herewith a letter to you from him. He left for Heidelberg on the 15th of this month, intending to be with you soon. I provided him with a copy of the booklet "De excommunicatione idiomatum," he will explain everything to you orally, please handle it as you see fit.</p>
      <p>Regarding recent news, a great war is brewing in Friesland. The Duke of Alba has moved from Brussels to Antwerp and from there to 's-Hertogenbosch, where he is staying; it is said to be a mighty fortress. From there, he sends a troop to Friesland; Scipio Vitelli, a Florentine, is supposed to be the commander; he does not want to risk himself personally. On the other hand, the Prince of Orange is also said to be strengthening himself greatly; he receives great help from several princes of the Empire, so that he is already on the move. Recently, news came from Münster that Count Ludwig of Nassau is said to have captured a skirmish near Groningen, where about 300 Albanians were killed, and as some say, but not certainly, they are said to have captured Groningen. It is said that a great number of people are flocking to the Prince of Orange, and there is no lack of money there.</p>
      <p>In the hope that the Father of all mercy will have compassion on his poor little flock and overthrow the pride of the godless tyrant Alba, I hereby send you the judgment of Count Egmond; I do not know if you have it with you.</p>
      <p>From France, we have not yet received any writing as to whether this peace is being truly observed, with a request that if you have any substantial information about it, please share it with me along with other news. And I hereby commend myself entirely to your love, with a request to kindly greet your dear daughters along with the entire household, and I commend you to the protection and care of the Most High.</p>
      <p>Dated Nuremberg, July 18, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Gabriel Schlüsselberger.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my especially gracious lord, to his hands.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
