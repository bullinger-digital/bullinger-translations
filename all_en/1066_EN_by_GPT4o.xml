      <p>It is not unknown to you that all corners are filled with critics, mockers, and fault-finders; therefore, we encompass everything in a few words and send a living letter instead of a silent one. A maiden, who for five years had something in her womb in Esslingen, was on the 30th day of October thrown into captivity by the senate along with her parents, sister, and guardians. Almost all of Germany, just as Laminitus once deceived the people of Augsburg (if what is said is true). Farewell.</p>
      <p>From our study in GÃ¶ppingen, on the 3rd day of November in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Joachim Aberlin.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian Heinrich Bullinger, greetings.</p>
