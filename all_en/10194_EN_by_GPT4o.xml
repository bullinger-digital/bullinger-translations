      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, most learned man and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Although in your recent letters sent to me, you complained somewhat about my delay in writing, and I do not ignore that this was done with the best right, my letters must have been intercepted, so that you have a just complaint against me for not being aware of my affairs. Furthermore, I do not have a just response to give you now, since you inquire through our servant Myconius what the reason is that I do not write often. I could certainly blame business matters. But what is the use of this hypocrisy? Rather, to you, a friend dearer than any in the world, I bring the rope and frankly confess my delay - what shall I say? my sloth. Forgive me, therefore, brother, for my fault, I mean Gervasius, to whom you have not ceased to forgive even greater things until now.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I cannot but highly praise what you have written on the Pauline Epistle to the Hebrews. For when I had undertaken to explain the knot of the tenth chapter for a sermon, especially the one for which that great Erasmus denies it to be the work of Paul, unexpectedly your elegant and indeed pious commentary on that epistle came into my hands, which I read so eagerly that I almost spent the whole night on it without weariness. Having read it a little, I made it mine with money, although little money remains with which I might acquire some books, especially those inspired by your genius.</p>
      <p>As for the rest: I am constantly before God in this, certainly, that He may more and more support these your renowned efforts, so that His glory may be more happily made known to the world through you and the smallness of the brethren may be helped.</p>
      <p>Finally, do not be unaware that I am now in good health together with my wife and children. Although I was ill for a long time, having been restored to my former health, I do not cease to delight in good literature more than in gold and whatever delights of the world.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Greet your wife along with your pious father and brother very much from me and my wife.</p>
      <p>Add that our senate has recently provided me with an excellent house, spacious and most suitable for the muses, which, along with a copious library of books, delights me beyond measure in the house of St. Leonard. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given on the twenty-fifth day of December in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Gervasius, your brother from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest brother in Christ.</p>
