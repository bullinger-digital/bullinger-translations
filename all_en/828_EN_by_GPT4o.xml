      <p>I received your letter written on January 6th long ago, most honorable Bullinger, and the reason I have not responded until now is more due to a lack of subject matter than negligence. I wish the occasion for this writing had failed rather than being provided as it is now. Today, the most impure superstition has invaded this city; for in the three main churches of this city, the mass along with all idolatry has been reinstated, and what kind of evils we are to expect from these most inauspicious beginnings, my mind shudders to recall. I see no hope left for us, except to console ourselves with the likeness of the Son of God, to whom we must conform by bravely enduring afflictions and persecutions. For these sacred things do not stand otherwise. Four churches have been precariously allowed for our religion and the use of the sacraments; our preachers openly and freely bear witness to the truth and refute superstitious ceremonies with steadfast contradiction, nor do I note any slackness in our senate's zeal for piety; but they judge that they must yield to the times. For this cause is such that not everyone is ready to risk fortune and reputation for its preservation; for it seems difficult for people to buy hope at a price. The apostasy of the people of Konstanz provides a formidable example to the magistrates. We still retain the school, which we consider a triumph, intact; for in that church, from whose revenues the lecturers' stipends are paid, nothing has yet been changed. But we fear that the serpent, once having insinuated its head, will not rest until it has brought in the whole body. This is our inclination and defection.</p>
      <p>From England, we hear that the entire cause of religion stands firm and grows with daily increase. The illustrious Duke of Somerset, along with all his fellow captives, has been restored to liberty and will retain his former dukedom; the administration of the kingdom will be in the hands of the greater part of the guardians jointly.</p>
      <p>The Marquis of Dorset has recently been admitted to the king's most secret council; would that many such men were employed. Now I come to the last subject of your letters and first of all, I wish your people would rid themselves of that mindset, which is the ruin of all action; for they fear that they are less worthy than those who dare to intercede among such great kings. Themistocles alone approached the kings of Persia, moved by the fairness and honesty of the action he was undertaking, and from this, he gained not ordinary praise and carried out the cause of all Greece both in opinion and for the public good. We all know that almost all your people are united with the French in an alliance of arms; but what could be more honorable for allies than to cultivate friendship and alliance in such a way that the pursuit of fairness and peace shines forth most? For these alliances are rightly made and stand firm, which honesty and fairness contain and bind together. These two kings are contending with each other in a deadly war; no king or prince intercedes as a mediator; indeed, what is to be feared is that the seeds of war are secretly being sown. The effort to avert public evil and calamity could justly move the illustrious republics of the Swiss with rightful indignation, so that, as befits friends in the middle, they would interpose their efforts in initiating peace. These would be pursuits worthy of the evangelical profession, worthy of the ancestral wisdom of the Swiss. Once, as if to an altar of mercy, all those oppressed by injustice fled to the Swiss, who, by defending such causes, grew to this greatness and majesty by the grace of God. It would certainly be worthwhile for this illustrious nation to attempt this reconciliation, which, even if it did not succeed, would still earn just praise among all for its pursuit of goodwill and peace. Nor would the confederation of the other party admit a suspicious inclination, provided that fairness and a lack of bias in either direction were plainly visible from the action itself. Nor is it of little interest to you to end this war; for if at one time you must fight against the King of France on behalf of the English, and against the Emperor on your own behalf, he from whom you expect aid will be more hindered, indeed unable to provide what he has promised you. What if the entire empire is cunningly involved in this war under the pretext of restoring the Duke of Savoy to his paternal dominion, who was recognized as a prince in the previous imperial diet, what if some of your allied cantons claim to be vindicated from the empire as if by the law of recovery? Would that these my concerns were superfluous and vain. Then if you consider your domestic dissensions, you will see how much it is in your own interest that this war, which is ruinous to the entire Christian world, be settled. If the Frenchman wishes to be your friend, he will certainly comply with friends asking for fair, honest, and useful things, nor do I suspect you to be such unjust arbiters that you would wish to enrich yourselves with the loss and dishonor of others. I discuss these things with your lordship solely out of a desire to restore peace; for I foresee into what grave ruin and destruction of religion and liberty this war is being fostered. Among the parents of these kings, as the most powerful, so the most prudent and wise through long experience of affairs, a single Venetian negotiator, a man of private condition and life, restored and renewed peace and was afterward always most dear to both kings, yet he could not make any profit from this because the laws of the Venetians forbade gifts to the citizens of that republic. Certainly, this intercession will bring the greatest praise to your most illustrious republics, as you preserve your confederate exempt from this war by more serious deeds and events, and so that the religion growing in the other may flourish and be confirmed in peace and quiet. If Satan takes England and Switzerland from us, what corner of the earth will then receive us as guests? I ask you to let me know your opinion on this deliberation.</p>
      <p>Basel not only agrees with me, but the burgomasters of its republic have also voluntarily offered their efforts for this attempt and risk. As Zurich has the first place in casting votes and authority in calling assemblies, so it could also provide the most effective effort in recommending this cause to the other cantons.</p>
      <p>I beg you to pursue this commendable cause with your singular prudence among your people. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, February 1, 1550. Commend me to Mr. Hales, the Englishman, to whom I would have described the present state of England myself, had I not known that Bucer had diligently informed him of everything two days ago. Convey all my services with the greatest respect to your consul. Give my regards to Mr. Gwalter from me.</p>
      <p>Christopher Mont.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Bullinger, distinguished in piety and learning, most observant friend.</p>
