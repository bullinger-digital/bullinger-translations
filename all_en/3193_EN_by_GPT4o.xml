      <p>Greetings. I have reminded Peter Mechlin to send you some booklets, who claimed that he had already written to Michael about them, namely that they are no longer found, but are now being reprinted.</p>
      <p>He replied regarding the defect you asked about, that he would see whether it can now be repaired; I think he himself will write to you. The spirit of the Antichrist seems to be plotting something against our efforts, about which I will write to you soon; for now, it is not permitted. Farewell. I recently sent through the caster Jacob Munzinger of Basel some sheets up to the last page. May it be permitted to continue with the rest. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 23, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus, from the heart.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
