      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>By God, the bearer of this letter presented himself to me. Although hindered by many occupations, I still wanted to send you my letters, by which you would be informed of my affairs. First of all, I am very sorry that you have been deprived of my letters until now, which you have demanded, and you have written to me twice. Therefore, I return, whom you had thought to be completely dormant, and so that you may have a just cause for my procrastination, I want you to know: While in Memmingen on the tenth of January, I was prevented for about four weeks by such various business and the scarcity of messengers that I could not even write to our Ambrosius, who is closer in terms of travel. Afterwards, indeed, overwhelmed by adverse health of the body by God, I was bedridden for 4 weeks, seriously ill, not without great sorrow of the brothers. After I had recovered, although with difficulty, I had to work so anxiously to repair those things that had been neglected during my illness, that again I could hardly breathe more fully. Oh, how many times, while I was ill, did I wish for your presence with indescribable desires, not without tears. Nor would I dare to claim true recovery of the body, unless I had seen you, my dear, as if present in letters, so that I plainly think that nothing was lacking for me to restore my former health except your letters. Therefore, incomparable friend, ensure that with these my letters, the suspected ruin of our common friendship is removed from the midst, unless you want your Gervasius, I say your own, to fall ill again both in mind and body. Accept these as a preparation for others, which will soon follow without delay.</p>
      <p>Schwenckfeld, the ill-fated bird, sent me a handwritten booklet from Augsburg against infant baptism, part of which I copied - for it must be sent back to me in Augsburg once it has been read -, but not fully due to various occupations. Soon, however, once it has been copied, I will send it to you along with some other blasphemies, etc.</p>
      <p>Ask Froschauer in my name to be patient regarding the debt and not to think he is being defrauded. I am not yet acting as my own steward. My wife and children are in excellent health. Greet your wife, truly blessed in Christ, who has deserved so well of me, along with the children a thousand times from us, especially our incomparable friend Leo, Conrad Pellican, Erasmus, Theodor Bibliander along with their wives and children. Sympertus, my fellow worker in the Lord, greets you with the remaining companions, as well as the noble old man Wilhelm von Zell. May God preserve you unharmed for a long time for the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my delight, in the Lord.</p>
      <p>April 4, 1534.</p>
      <p>Bucer wrote to me these days, but I am not yet certain of Schwenckfeld's presence with us.</p>
      <p>I would very much like to be with you and Ambrosius Blarer for a day regarding Schwenckfeld, if God would arrange it somewhere.</p>
      <p>To the truly venerable bishop of the church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, lord and brother in Christ, to be especially honored. In Zurich.</p>
