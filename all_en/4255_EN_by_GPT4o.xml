      <p> Greetings. I wrote to you three days ago, certain that you have received my letters; what I write here is concerning the matter of my dearest son Funck, whose entire way of life requires a housewife, without whom he can endure only with the greatest difficulty. Therefore, I commend him to you as my own hand, so that you may assist this most pious man with advice and help. There are Frisius and Mangold there, who have opened some hope to him; but I fear that this is too much... while it is rash, as some people's minds are very eager to arrange marriages. </p>
      <p> Therefore, I wanted to commend him to you more diligently from me, so that you may moderate with your wisdom, if perhaps these two have decided to act too rashly; for it can hardly be that you are not also aware of what they thought would be advantageous for the excellent Funck. Believe me, he is a man truly worthy of an excellent wife, as he treated his deceased wife so gently and indulgently that it could not have been softer or more indulgent, of which it would not be difficult to gather testimonies from the entire church of Biel. He requested this recommendation from me, convinced that you would try everything for my sake, so that he does not stumble, but rather that he may be well provided for, etc. I could not fail the man, to whom I have always been like a father from his youth and for whom I wish the best as much as for myself. It is very important to the good man that he is well provided for; otherwise, his household cannot stand at all. A woman would be very well provided for with him; for he is an exceedingly good, faithful, pious man and also gifted by God. </p>
      <p> Therefore, be careful if one wants to lead him to a stock; people are sometimes thoughtless, often taking things lightly, from which much and great trouble grows later. I write in the greatest haste, the urgency is; I have no doubt that you will know how to help or advise him, so that he may enjoy it. Farewell well, my dearest and best Bullinger. April 3rd. </p>
      <p> Yours, Ambrosius Blarer. </p>
