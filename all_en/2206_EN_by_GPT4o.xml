      <p>S. P. I had resolved with myself to suspend the duty of writing, which is mute and deaf, until I could enjoy the most delightful fruit of conversing with you in person. But nothing in human affairs is so certain that, when it seems firmly fixed to us, it does not fall otherwise by the disposition of the Most High. Thus, my obstinate silence is also overcome by necessity, so that I am compelled to discuss with you matters about which I would least wish. For our Maximilian, a young man certainly faithful and diligent in instructing his little brother, is recalled home by his father with a letter full of emotions and finally with tears, to take up an ecclesiastical position. We certainly bear his departure with difficulty, as we have nothing at all to complain about him, since he has already become accustomed, obedient, and compliant, and there is no doubt that we could and would have easily raised him to the same state of life within one or two years with the same abundance. In the meantime, he could have made considerable progress in private studies, so that he would have approached such a great office more prepared. But lest we seem to oppose the call of his pious parent, we allowed him the freedom to choose whether he preferred to stay with us or return to his homeland. The good young man leaves us reluctantly, but the father's letter and a special messenger urge with such vehemence that, if not immediately, at least by the Easter holidays, he should appear. In the meantime, he will perform his former duty with his brother. He also reported to me about a certain Tobias Egle, who is supported by your stipend and is suitable for this office, not harsh, but gentle, peaceful, calm, and very learned. However, although I do not wish you to think that I am asking for anyone against your will, whom I would rather leave a thousand times than offend you alone, yet if you wish to spare those expenses or if you can obtain another for me by your favor, you will bind me to you with the greatest benefit, as I am already entirely devoted to you.</p>
      <p>I truly promise you that I will obey your command, whatever annual salary, pension, and other things you have ordered concerning him, will be given to him liberally and most willingly.</p>
      <p>The position is not very laborious, as he has to teach only one boy of the best disposition and most fertile intellect; clothes, rewards, and honors will be granted by us generously at your discretion. Many have long sought this from us, coming from Saxony; however, we suspect them to be wandering vagabonds, and because their life is not known to us, they also come into suspicion with us, because we have often been deceived by them. Moreover, their obstinacy concerning the body of Christ is so great, and their assertion so ignorant and crude, that they cannot be led away from their opinion by any arguments, as is often the case with other stubborn people. Therefore, I again approach you imploringly, I beg and beseech you, whenever it is possible, to send someone here before Maximilian reluctantly returns from here. Relying on your benevolence, I request this from you as much as I can.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I will depart, God willing. If Maximilian also leaves, the boy will be left completely naked, as my dear parent is engaged in more serious matters than to be involved in trifles. I also beg you to explain the same to Mr. Gesner, so that he may assist you in the search, which I do not at all doubt he will do diligently. We will fully adhere to the decision made by you if you send someone to us here.</p>
      <p>It has been proclaimed for a whole year now that a diet will be held here; now the same rumor sounds that it will be in April. When I come to you, I will enumerate to you what is worthy of belief. Farewell, most illustrious man, and make sure you love me in return and be well. Augsburg, February 28, 1554.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Raphael Seiler. To the most illustrious and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most learned elucidator of sacred theology, most esteemed lord and teacher.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
