      <p>Greetings. I had indeed resolved, most esteemed lord and brother Bullinger, to write back to you as soon as I had returned home (by the grace of the most good and great deity) and to thank you for the honor shown to me. For not only did you admit me to your most holy conversation while I was there, but you also honored me with a gift of wine. I value these two things as much as I ought, and I know I was not worthy of them; but because you wished to declare your humility and benevolence towards me in this way, I pray to the Lord Jesus that He may bestow upon you eternal honors and rewards.</p>
      <p>Moreover, from the conversation we had, both about other matters and about the book of our Caelius, which he published on the greatness of the blessed kingdom of God, I developed a desire to know that book. I also came to dinner with Mr. Ludwig Lavater, your son-in-law, and Mr. Johannes Wolf, most learned men (who deigned to honor me with their presence) in a most pleasant discussion for me about the dialectic of Petrus Ramus, which I had not previously studied, and I was inflamed with the same desire to read it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when I returned to Basel to my studies, I could not bring myself to write until I had perused these books. This is the reason for my delayed response.</p>
      <p>However, I am first grieved that our Caelius, a man endowed and gifted by God with such great learning and eloquence, has been seized by this spirit of error and confusion, so that he has not only undertaken to defend a doctrine so contrary to the holy scriptures, and so harmful to both civil and ecclesiastical morals and discipline, but has also published its defense.</p>
      <p>If he had held this wrong opinion himself, but had not infected others who still thought rightly, it might still somehow be bearable, although he would nonetheless seem to need healing. Furthermore, the fact that he has now spread and disseminated it throughout the world, I do not believe can be sufficiently lamented. For many will be corrupted by the same error.</p>
      <p>For this cause is plausible in itself; there are added the allurements and enticements of words, which often do not lead men, but drag them. Moreover, this man is eloquent, perceptive, sharp, a marvelous architect of arguments.</p>
      <p>I am compelled to confess this about myself: if the reading of the sacred books and the Lord Jesus Christ, the master of us all, had not forbidden separating the mercy and justice of God, the appearance of certain arguments he uses would have deceived me. But I know (praise and thanks be to the Lord) God to be so merciful that He does not forget justice, and so just that He does not forget mercy. Would that he too might understand this at some point, and realize how ridiculously he argues when he writes: "The clemency of God is not seen in saving a few and condemning many, but in that, when He could condemn all, He chooses to condemn few and save many. For if the justice of God had come to his mind, would he not have noticed that the opposite could be inferred from it? For what prevents one from reasoning thus: the justice of God is not seen in condemning a few and saving many, but when He could condemn all, He chooses to condemn many and save a few? For just as it is the part of clemency to forgive sinners, so it is the part of justice to impose punishment on the same.</p>
      <p>However, neither way concludes well, since it is true that they are faulty when reversed. Then it grieves me most of all that many of our people (as I hear) were not unaware that he had written and intended to publish such a book, but did not prevent the publication, or at least condemn it, so that we are now affected by this shame, that our enemies say we should have been warned by outsiders. For we seem to be accused by some of a certain negligence or excessive indulgence and leniency, because we could have connived at such a deed.</p>
      <p>Do you not think that those Saxon enemies of ours could seize the opportunity from this to accuse us also of this error? For he who is silent seems to consent, say the jurists, and Paul also speaks to the Romans almost in this sense. But having been struck by this sting now, we will be wiser in the future, I hope, and with great and strong spirit, if such a thing should happen again, we will resist; nor is it indeed, as I think, the least part of our duty, who preside over divine oracles, to refute perverse doctrines.</p>
      <p>Here, before many other writings, the serious sermon of the divine Paul, which he gave at Miletus to the bishops of the church of Ephesus, comes before my eyes, in which he seems to exhort them with the most ardent zeal to keep those speaking perverse things away from the Lord's flock as ravenous wolves. I think we must do the same, putting aside all fear.</p>
      <p>For if any age ever required it, this present one of ours does, in which the ancient serpent, feeling judgment imminent upon him, twists himself in wondrous ways in his members.</p>
      <p>But enough about Caelius's book.</p>
      <p>I beg you, my most esteemed lord and brother Bullinger, if I have perhaps said anything too boldly or inconsiderately, that you may, in your candor, take it in good part; for I have been accustomed to freely profess my opinion. In the meantime, however, wherever I err, I bear a monitor with an even mind.</p>
      <p>What remains is that I commend to you my nephews, Rhellicanus from my sister and Hospinianus from my brother. Indeed, my brother and I found this one in his duty, but the other, who was erring, we admonished in such a way that I hope he has returned to the path.</p>
      <p>It seemed to us that he had become more insolent due to excessive freedom; therefore, we advised his guardian to add something from his patrimony to his stipend and to entrust him to some learned man who would oversee his studies and conduct. In this matter, he listened to us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he approached my very old friend and brother Mr. Frisius, your most learned schoolmaster, who honored us and received the young man into his discipline. I was therefore glad and considered my arrival in the city to have been fortunate for this reason.</p>
      <p>I beseech you, be a father and patron in person. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, the day after Bartholomew's, in the year of our Savior, our Lord Jesus, 1557. Johannes Hospinianus, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man in divine and human letters, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the churches of Zurich, his lord and brother in Christ, always most esteemed. Zurich.</p>
