      <p>Most illustrious and learned Mr. Bullinger, I am sending you, in the name of Oporinus, several books, which I earnestly request you to receive with a good spirit. Among them are: Nicephorus Gregoras, a very eloquent Greek writer of Roman history, the sixth century of ecclesiastical history, the complete theological works of Johannes Rivius, and some small works by Fricius. Furthermore, do not be surprised, most learned man, that I, a stranger, write to you, nor should you attribute this to me, but to the master who instructed me to do so. Our printer will offer this to you, and if you would like to write back, you would do me a very great favor.</p>
      <p>The master sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 6.</p>
      <p>Your [servant] Jeremias Mylius of Leipzig, assistant to Oporinus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the word among the people of Zurich. Zurich.</p>
