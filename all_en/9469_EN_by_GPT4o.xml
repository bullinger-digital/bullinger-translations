      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, after the departure of Mr. Achilles Gasser, most reverend lord, and towards nightfall, I received your recently written letters as well as the previous ones from earlier days, in which the main points of peace and other new matters were contained. I mention this because I understand that you absolutely wish it so. Yesterday, for the sake of a certain matter, I wrote through Gasser to Mr. Rudolf Gwalther and sent my Latin poem on the Sculian prodigy, which I have altered and corrected in many places, and I absolutely desire it to be replaced as a more corrected version in place of the previous example or archetype, if either Mr. Froschauer or another would deem it worthy to publish in print. I do not want the previous example to be given out.</p>
      <p>I also wish for "Götz" to be deleted and "Egli" to be substituted. And if it would be less convenient for the printer to express the Romance language with Campell's German rhymes, it would be more pleasing to me if only my works were placed on that prodigy, since I have dedicated them solely in my name to Mr. Erni. But neither of us has thought about printing, and since almost the same things are contained in Campell's poems and he wrote these at my request after considering mine, they can easily be omitted with his permission, unless it seems otherwise to you. If I receive anything from Italy, I will, in turn, ensure that we do not cease to gratify you. On the 7th of this month, which is tomorrow, 6 delegates from the Rhaetian legates will convene here, who, appearing before each Rhaetian community, will demand and receive an oath on the decrees of the assemblies. May God shine His grace upon us, so that peace and alliances may be renewed and strengthened with triple brass and unclouded eyes, as it is said. The rainy weather here brings much inconvenience to the crops.</p>
      <p>I will write to Mr. Haller about everything soon, whom you will greet most kindly.</p>
      <p>All who have been greeted send their greetings to your excellence. Most swiftly, October 6, 1573, Chur.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most illustrious and foremost Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his singularly esteemed lord. Zürich.</p>
