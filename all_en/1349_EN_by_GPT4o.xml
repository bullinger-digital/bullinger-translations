      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I cannot guess by what counsel the assembly convened by your senate was abolished. Either there will be no council this year due to the warlike tumults, or the fears of the papists are instilled, preventing you from meeting to consult on the matters of Christ. Indeed, this procrastination in the Lord's business provides serious thoughts.</p>
      <p>I do not disapprove of your counsel; but if the imperial cities are going to send some, as it is written to me from Leipzig, Wittenberg, and Strasbourg, that they will send learned and pious men to confer on the scriptures about which there is controversy, and if no place is given for the conference, they will leave with their faith intact. What if the Swiss cities also sent one or two? Certainly, they would not be wrong. I say, however, if the emperor, not the pope, were to call the council. For who would give security when the pope calls, who has always been impious and of no faith towards the true ministers of Christ? The impious men will harass us under this pretext and, if the Lord does not avert it, will institute a new war.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, we have nothing new from the people of Magdeburg. The war still rages in Saxony. Osiander is raving most vehemently and is disturbing all of Prussia with his dreams. Many incendiaries have been sent out; they have two priests who lead them and hold the first rank among them, whom the Lord will undoubtedly destroy. These are papal weapons with which they try to destroy Germany.</p>
      <p>A letter from the pope was given to our university, especially to the rector; he gave it to our two theologians, Borrhaus and Wolff. They called the pastors, but have not yet consulted.</p>
      <p>It is strange that our bishop writes nothing to us about this matter; are we not members of that church? Does he not care for us and thinks we are cast out from the Catholic Church? These are tricks and schemes by which they undoubtedly try to kill us. Farewell. July 21, 1551. Greet Theodor in my name, from whom I expect letters. Be steadfast.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my kind and dear lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
