      <p> Greetings. Today we received letters from Augsburg, among which a certain Mecardus by name, who still preaches vigorously there about the council, writes such things that, since they might not be unpleasant for you to know, I will transcribe here: "Regarding the council, there is nothing for me to write. Doctor Marpachius (he is a minister of the church in Strasbourg) was at Nidda with Pistorius in Hesse, was in Frankfurt, Leipzig, Wittenberg, with Johann the Margrave, and in Nuremberg; he writes to Ascanio, the envoy of the King of England, Mr. Montius, and among other things: We have no news here except that Melanchthon is now drafting a confession of faith for those churches that profess the gospel throughout Germany. Similarly, Brentius and Frechtus, our theologians, are working on the same subject, so that from these writings, once compared and reviewed, a single complete confession may finally be presented with the consent and judgment of all our theologians at the council (if there will be one) and the reason for our faith may be given before the whole world. And if, furthermore, the pope wishes to oppress our people with unjust abuses, rash prejudices, and usurped superstitions tyrannically, then they should oppose and protest with declinations, accusations, exceptions, and all kinds of defenses both against a suspect, indeed hostile and inimical judge, and against the entire judgment, which arrogantly claims for itself the knowledge, accusation, and condemnation in its own cause against right and laws. This he wrote." Mecardus also wrote other letters to Musculus after those earlier ones, in which he includes: "On the 1st of August, I was sent a copy of the convention held in Wittenberg on the 5th of July, where all the learned men of both universities, Leipzig and Wittenberg, along with all the superintendents of both princes, Moritz and August, and a confession was drafted by Philipp, examined, approved, and subscribed by all, which will be offered at the future council, to which the ministers of Johann, Margrave of Brandenburg, have subscribed, as well as those of the Duke of Pomerania and the Duke of Mecklenburg. They also mention at the end the cities of Nuremberg and Strasbourg, that they too will subscribe to this. This is what I have concerning the council. What is happening in Augsburg, I do not think you are unaware; Blaurer wrote certain things to Jungius which he undoubtedly communicated to you first. The master of ceremonies is back, perhaps he is already with you; from whom you will learn amazing things. Schertli is in the borders of Burgundy and France; I do not know what is present there. </p>
      <p> I wrote these things at a rather inconvenient time, so that I would not write nothing at all through this most learned and excellent man, our brother Mr. Theodor Beza, who greatly desires to see your faces; I commend him to you and to all the other brothers, whom you will greet from me. Our people also greet you, especially Musculus, whose stomach has not yet ceased to flow. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Bern, August 15th at evening twilight. Yours, whom you know. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the church in Zürich, his dearest lord and compatriot. </p>
      <p> Zürich. </p>
