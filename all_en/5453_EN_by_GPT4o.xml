      <p>S. P. Most illustrious Lord Bullinger, I received your last letters of your kindness dated the fifth of March, along with the booklet where Dr. Brenz is answered, with great joy.</p>
      <p>However, I am truly sorry that Brenz, for such trivial reasons, has taken up the pen against your kindness, and when I had read through it, it made my spirit more cheerful, because your kindness responded so Christianly and prudently to him, and this without any insults. For this is truly doing good to those who wish us ill.</p>
      <p>I would wish that if they want anything of this kind from your kindness, they would present themselves in person and refrain from the pen, so that we would not be a stumbling block to the public, showing that we cannot agree among ourselves, how then could we instruct others. But these things are easily managed among the learned.</p>
      <p>I would desire that Brenz and his followers would cast away self-love, then this wound could easily be healed. Meanwhile, I pray to the Son of God from the depths of my heart, that He may cast the light of the Holy Spirit into the eyes of Brenz and the others, so that if they do not want to outwardly, they may at least be compelled inwardly to confess what is true.</p>
      <p>O Lord Bullinger, how well you have done and refreshed and edified the spirits of many, by responding so modestly to Brenz; for it is not plainly human, but certainly divine. If they want anything more from you, use the zeal of God. I send you a dagger; it is highly esteemed here for the goodness of its blades.</p>
      <p>I ask you, my Bullinger, to advise as a friend; it is not so much beautiful as it is good. I would wish there were something in our dominions with which I could gratify you, and at the same time I pray that your kindness would be willing to invoke the heavenly Father for me, as well as your church, so that for the sake of His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, He may finally once have mercy on me and deliver me from all evils, so that I may obtain a pious and God-fearing wife; for you do not know how anxious and concerned I am for a good bride.</p>
      <p>For I have a parent who now plays the role of Scipio, of whom I am the only staff of old age; he urges me daily and rightly so. I ask that your kindness be my helper in your prayers, and may the Lord bless me.</p>
      <p>For our entire lineage depends on me alone; for if I am taken away, the name and the entire lineage will be extinguished without offspring. I do not write this to exalt myself, as I desire to be the least of all, but so that I may refresh and restore my dearest parent, who is half-dead from too much labor and the burden imposed on him by the prince.</p>
      <p>I pray to Christ that He may grant us salvation and deign to preserve your kindness for a very long time with the blessing of His name. Farewell and love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, Wesel, September 4, 1562.</p>
      <p>Most ready for anything for your kindness, Adolphus von Baars.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of God among the people of Zürich, my much esteemed friend and lord. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>To Zürich.</p>
