    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has just received with thanks the valuable gift from Vadian, namely the writing [„De providentia sermones X“] by his beloved Theodoret of Cyrrhus, from whom he had previously read the treatise „De curandis Graecorum affectionibus“ with great pleasure. He will ensure that even readers who only know Latin will soon have access to [the writing gifted by Vadian]. - He also thanks Vadian for his regular [letter] writing. He received three or four [letters], but they did not require a response. [Here] he would like to deeply regret the harsh fate of the poor [Antwerp] printer [Jacob van Liesvelt]. Yet he is glad that God strengthens His church through such martyrs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater] as well as Bullinger and his wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] wish Vadian health and a good new year.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The mayors have learned that in Spain a large sum of money, which was originally supposed to serve [the administration] of church properties, was allocated for the defense of the Roman Church: In Italy, 10,000 men and 700 horsemen were designated for this purpose. The opening of the Council [of Trent] is said to have been rescheduled for December [1545]. The Lutherans will also be invited there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger has received letters from Hesse, specifically from Marburg [HBBW XV, No. 2305, dated December 6, 1545] and from Wetter [partially received: HBBW XV 682f and note 17]. These were written on December 10 [1545]. The situation [in Hesse] is said to have calmed down [after the Brunswick affair]. At the time of writing the letters, they were waiting for the [Schmalkaldic League] meeting in Frankfurt. In the camp of Duke Henry of Brunswick, two types of shields are said to have been found: Some with the coat of arms of Brunswick, others with images of torches and brooms. The plan was to mark the localities that were to be pardoned with the first shield; with the second, the places that were destined for destruction. The letters also reveal that the young Duke [Charles Victor of Brunswick], who is [held captive] in Kassel, often engages in ball games.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Vadian's [last] letter [HBBW XV, No. 2317] was not delivered by [the St. Gallen messenger Alexius] Knoblauch, but by [Konrad] Gessner.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [P.S.:] Bullinger will forward the letter for [Johannes] Oporin [from Lorenzo Torrentino].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. At this very hour, I receive your gift, esteemed man, far more precious than the purest gold and the most excellent gems in the world, the beloved Theodoret of Cyrrhus, whose books "On the Healing of the Greek Afflictions" I once read with as much pleasure as no other author in my life. For he writes as elegantly and purely as he does delightfully and learnedly. Therefore, I give immortal thanks to your kindness and will ensure that after a few days have passed, many good brothers can hear it in Latin. Furthermore, I give great thanks for your diligent writing; for I received three or four from you, to which there is nothing to respond, except that the cruel fate of the excellent printer has caused me great sorrow. Yet I rejoice that Christ strengthens His martyrs so that we find examples of the ancient church in our own.</p>

      <p>My lords have learned that in Spain a large sum originally intended for church properties has been allocated for the defense of the Holy Roman Church. In Italy, 10,000 foot soldiers and 700 horsemen are designated for the defense of the mentioned church.</p>

      <p>From Hesse, from Marburg and Wetter, I have letters dated December 10, stating that the situation has completely calmed down there and everyone is waiting for the day in Frankfurt, of which nothing has yet been heard. Also, in Duke Henry's camp, two types of signs have been found: one was the Brunswick coat of arms, - where this was placed on towns and villages, it meant pardon up to plundering -; the other was a torch with brooms, - where this stood, it meant that they would burn it, so that it could be swept away with brooms -, and these letters are printed, etc. The young duke often plays ball in Kassel, etc. I will share more when I receive it.</p>
