They have written to Johann Jakob Ammann. They request money, which would help them advance in their studies. Assurance that they are frugal and diligent.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It has been almost a year, which seems like an eternity to us, since we have received any letters from you. Others often fall into misconceptions due to prolonged silence. However, your goodwill and dedication towards us will always be evident to us, even without letters or, so to speak, without a token. In the meantime, we eagerly and silently long for letters from you, like children with open arms, so that we may be informed about everyone at home, especially about you and our homeland: ὡς οὐδὲν γλύκιον ἧς πατρίδος - you know the Homeric saying.</p>
      <p>As for us, we have written to Johann Jakob Ammann, and if the letters have been delivered, I believe he has informed you of everything. We hope that you, with your humanity, will not neglect your clients, and we are certain of your loyalty. Hope is often uncertain, ό δὲ ἀνέλπιστος βίος ἄριστος. We, who have long been indebted to you for many and great reasons, have more confidence in your kindness and loyalty than in hope. They say that Amalthea, who nursed Zeus, was placed among the stars. How much praise will you deserve for nurturing the muses, born of Zeus, so generously and candidly! You will not give the muses any other nourishment than what you bestow upon their devotees. But enough of this. We would like the money to be sent as soon as possible. You know the saying ἡ πενία χωλὸς πρὸς τὸ φιλοσοφεῖν, although Diogenes called poverty a self-taught philosophy. We continue our studies as best as we can, and would continue further if even the muses here did not need to be swayed by money like Hippodamia with the golden apple. Indeed, here and in all things, you might call Paris a Charybdis of silver. In the meantime, we live frugally and sparingly, as much as possible, and not without the muses.</p>
      <p>Farewell, our protection and sweet honor.</p>
      <p>Paris, 7 days before the calends of September 1534.</p>
      <p>Conrad Geßner, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, preacher of sacred sermons, the best patron of studies. Zürich.</p>
