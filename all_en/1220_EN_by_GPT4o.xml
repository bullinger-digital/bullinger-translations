      <p>Greetings. I am waiting, my dear Gast, to hear what you will say about my Fifth Decade; for I trust that you have read at least some of it. Secondly, I urgently and greatly request something else from you. Louis Vergerius, the nephew of Mr. Vergerius, is staying with you in Basel. Mr. Vergerius writes to me about him in these words in a letter dated March 12 from Vicosoprano: "I do not currently have a reliable messenger to bring money to my nephew, whom I know is in need in the meantime.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I would like to ask you earnestly to write to some special friend of yours in Basel, so that he may give him 10 florins, which I will repay to you immediately. Trust a Christian man and test his faith." Such are the words of this great man. Therefore, I write to you, my special friend, and request through our friendship that you give this money to his nephew. As soon as he comes to us (he will come two or three weeks after Easter), I will ensure that it is repaid immediately; indeed, he himself will repay you with gratitude, as he is also going to visit you. But if it is not convenient for you or your friends to provide this small amount of money, let me know; for I would rather send it from ZÃ¼rich than let such a great friend be in need. Therefore, make sure that he experiences your kindness (if possible).</p>
      <p>From Italy, we have certain news that the Turk is on a great expedition against the Emperor and his brother. Cardinal de Crescentiis, the legate of Bologna, has been appointed by the Pope as a legate to the Council of Trent, to preside with two bishops. Persecution is raging in Italy. I am expecting a catalog of books.</p>
      <p>They say that the affairs of the people of Magdeburg are in better condition than we had thought, if only. Let us pray to the Lord to have mercy on us and on the whole church. Farewell together with the most esteemed Myconius, with whom you will share this. March 24, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Johannes Gast, his special friend.</p>
      <p>In Basel.</p>
