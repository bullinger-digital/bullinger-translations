      <p>God be with us all, along with the offering of our willing services.</p>
      <p>Honorable, especially gracious dear sir and beloved brother, we hope our last response reached you well through your messenger, Rosenstil, in which you understood, among other things, how our lords thought it good to wait for the response from the Palatinate. Since it has now reached us yesterday and was delayed on the road, we send it to you herewith with this own messenger. As you will understand from the Palatinate's response, the matter cannot suffer long delay, we do not linger and further the matter to the best of our ability.</p>
      <p>You will also understand that they liked the exposition or confession I sent them so much that they want to translate it into German and have it printed, but with my prior knowledge and consent. Since we do not want to do or consent to anything here without your prior knowledge and good consent, we kindly ask you whether you are also satisfied with the mentioned exposition, or if you want anything new added or removed. When we have your good will or advice, we will present it to our lords again, also taking care of their approval in this matter, as we are writing to you with their prior knowledge. If you like this confession, which in all things sounds like the Bernese disputation and contains nothing else than what has been unanimously taught in our churches for 40 years and even longer, then it would not need further publicizing or further writing or costs, without you trying to bring the ministers of the church in Biel to us and we those from Schaffhausen and Chur along with St. Gallen to us, which we fully hope.</p>
      <p>If we had your advice and consent, we could give an immediate response to Heidelberg with the prior knowledge and consent of our lords, which we are waiting for upon this messenger's return.</p>
      <p>And if it pleases our lords, let it be printed, with a preface set, briefly, not to the emperor, but to all Christians, with some content: Since most churches open their summary of doctrine and faith through writings, we also, who preach the gospel in the Confederation, are suspected of serious errors, we are moved to let this exposition go out, so that everyone may see that our doctrine and faith are Christian, and that resentment against us may be laid aside, as we then wish to be at peace with all Christians, and help advise and do what serves unity, etc. And it seems good to us if this writing does not go out under the name of Zurich, Bern, or other places, nor under the name of the authorities, but only under the name of those who preach the gospel in the Confederation in the churches that have accepted the evangelical doctrine. Whatever seems good to you in this matter, let us know through this messenger (if possible).</p>
      <p>So that you also do not lack, I send you a copy or exposition as it was sent to the Palatinate, in case you have not had a copy made, so that you have it. However, once you have copied it, send it back. For we might send it further. As far as our dear lords and brothers in Geneva and in France are concerned, we ask you to send Mr. Beza a copy of the Palatinate response, briefly report our advice and inform them that they may proceed well with their confession and writing for themselves, Geneva, France, Savoy, etc., especially as we understand that it is more agreeable to the prince when similar confessions come from many places. We are of good hope, since Beza has our exposition, that theirs will not be contrary to ours, as we have been and still are in one consensus. They may well endure that they do not wait for us, but proceed with their writing. Greet them sincerely for us; however, Beza also writes in our name Gwalther. All this is to be completed for them promptly. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated on Vincent's Day, January 22, 1566. Sincerely greeting all your and our brothers and fellow servants with you and discussing all this with them. Heinrich Bullinger also in the name of the ministers.</p>
