    <p xml:id="regest1">Vogler writes in haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- At the request of his [old weak] brother-in-law Hieronymus Sailer, he appeared before the 13 war councilors of the city of Augsburg for him. He forwarded their decision to Sailer in Lindau. Yesterday he received his response. He will now present this to the council. Vadian is well aware of this. Vogler must therefore wait a little longer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Today, the two mayors [Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser] rode to the field camp [Donauwörth], about six hours away from Augsburg, to receive Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] and the other princes. Vogler also wants to ride there (as this is possible in two days and the city clerk [Georg Frölich] and the [field] preacher [Johann Meckart] encourage him to do so) to see his [Hans Wilpert] Zoller again. Bullinger should inform the [Zurich] banner lord [Andreas Schmid] and [Zoller's] mother [Agnes, née Schmid] about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Mayor Welser sends his regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Herbrot invited Vogler, [Johannes] Haller, and [Wolfgang] Musculus to dinner last night. Many things were discussed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Vogler could feel Augsburg's affection for Zurich from the reception he received in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- He was even allowed to witness the muster of the Landsknechte alongside [Herbrot] and the [Augsburg] muster lords!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Vogler feels very comfortable in Augsburg and is happy to wait [for the outcome of Sailer's legal dispute with the city].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Over the last three days, the merchants' guild (whose captain is Herbrot and whose ensign is Herbrot's son [Jakob the Younger]) mustered 65 cavalrymen with their horses. They rode through the city today.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Somewhere [on the Danube - meaning Marxheim], the imperial forces destroyed a bridge. The [Schmalkaldic] Landsknechte immediately built a new one, which they then crossed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- When [Colonel Sebastian] Schertlin, Vogler, and the [field] preacher were visiting Mayor Welser, Schertlin invited Vogler to the field camp.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Around the time Vogler arrived in Augsburg, Haller had a son. He received the same first name as Vogler, who is his godfather. Vogler wishes the [relatives in Zurich] a good feast for this occasion!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- The city clerk is exceedingly friendly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Many welcome the planned meeting of the Four [Protestant city cantons] in Zurich. The latter should dispatch the promised delegation to the Schmalkaldic League. There are great expectations of the [Confederates].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Upon his return, he will report astonishing things.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- 25,000 [Italians and Spaniards] are said to be moving to Innsbruck.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Emperor [Charles V] is still in Regensburg. Although many believe that he will not wait [to attack], Vogler thinks that the unification of all troops is important to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- Duke [Henry of Brunswick] has been sent to Denmark.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">- Musculus reported that the Danish King [Christian III] mingles with the people during psalm singing, takes care of the sick, and is still said to be a brave warrior.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">- The [field] preacher had informed the Augsburg preachers by letter how, when he was sitting at the table one day with Schertlin and two monks, an Augsburg [...] recognized one of the monks and knew that he had fathered a child in Augsburg years ago and then disappeared. The perpetrator has not yet been hanged.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">- Bullinger should explain to [Hans Rudolf] Lavater and the Zurich councilors why Vogler is currently in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">- Vogler's wife [Appolonia, née Baumgartner] should know that he is well. He would love to bring her to Augsburg too!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest23">- Bullinger should convey Vogler's news to Jakob Rordorf. He should take care of the household until Vogler's return.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest24">- Vogler's letter should also be communicated to his wife.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest25">- The enclosed [pamphlet...] Bullinger probably already has.</p>

      <p>My service. What I could do, you will hear from me as soon as possible until further notice (Report).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Firstly, as you know, my dear sick brother-in-law, Hieronymus Sailer (at the earnest request of the city of Augsburg to either draw up a contract or settle with him elsewhere), earnestly requested me to come here. I appeared before the 13 war councilors in Augsburg, received an answer, which is significant and weighty; this answer was sent to him, Hieronymus, and now his command is awaited here. This was received yesterday from Lindau. Therefore, I will act again and turn to the gentlemen on his behalf, as Mr. Vadianus knows well. How long this will delay, I must wait.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Meanwhile, it happened that today, two mayors with many horses rode to the camp about 6 hours away (in my opinion, it was), to personally meet the Landgrave and others there (all the princes are coming there), I am eager (also the city clerk and preacher encourage me), since it is about a two-day journey, to ride with the gentlemen here to the camp, to visit, and also to see where my Swiss ensign, the Zoller, is. Tell this to the banner lord and his mother. What happens there, time will tell.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Also, Mayor Welser sends you friendly greetings.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Also, Mayor Herbrot invited Hallery and me to dinner in his garden last night; much was discussed, and Mr. Musculus was also present, as I will inform you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Also, I feel a complete inclination towards the city of Zurich, as they treated me, a poor man, so kindly, and also gifted me 3 servants with 6 jugs.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>They also took me with them, set the muster lords to see the Landsknechte muster.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Here I would like to stay from the heart, as I find everyone happy and waiting with a good conscience.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Today, on the 3rd day, they have mustered 65 beautiful cavalry horses here in the city for their security, all from the merchants' guild or room, in which Mayor Herbrot is captain, and his son is ensign, all in black clothing, riding through the city.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Also, the enemy has destroyed a bridge at one place not far away, but the soldiers with great effort built another bridge, and the whole troop has already crossed. I forget the name.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Also, here Mr. Schärtly verbally (with the preacher, also with me, in Mr. Mayor Walser's house - so very friendly with us, alone among all people) said to me: "Mr. Governor, dear, come once to us in the camp."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Also, when I arrived here, the faithful Haller had a son. He is named after me. I have become his godfather, which makes me very happy. We wish you, and everyone there, a good feast now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Also, do not believe, the city clerk is so friendly!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Also, I hear much that the 4 cities of Zurich will have a day. Many brave ones are considered for good bravery. And since the Protestants are so seriously suffering (are oppressed), that they are also sent from the 4, spoken to, much depends on you, it is said; of which I do not want to write (the time) I have.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>You will still hear wonders when I come. Also, finally say that the forest people 25,000 are supposed to move to Innsbruck, where the water is then low.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Also, the emperor is still in Regensburg. Much concern, he does not wait and does not play things on a long bench. But it seems to me, he will wait and still bring together a large force.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Also, the Brunswicker has been sent to Denmark, so he is taken care of.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>Also, I hear truly from Mr. Preacher Musculus at the table, that the king from Denmark, when psalms are sung, stands among the people, sings, also visits many sick, and is not ashamed, but is said to be a brave warrior.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>Also, the preacher, who was then sent here to the camp with Mr. Schärtlin, writes to the preachers here, Haller tells me, that they found 2 monks at the place, whom Schärtli set at the table. In that, a citizen from Augsburg came, who recognized one of the monks, that he had fathered a child years ago. When he saw him, the citizen said: "Damn martyr, monk! I find you here! Where is your child? Quickly, a rope here!", as they thought otherwise, they must hang. But not yet happened.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>Also, please, you should inform this, where necessary, to my godfather Lavater, to say to my gracious lords from me, and what reason I am here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21">
      <p>Also, tell my wife that she should be happy (unconcerned). I have a good life; I want to bring her too! Oh, how it would be a joy for me to be here! So well is it in the church and community!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>Also, tell my dear godfather Jakob Rordorff this news from me, and that he should keep my house until I come.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div23" corresp="regest23">
      <p>Also, this letter goes to my wife.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div24" corresp="regest24">
      <p>Also, note, you have the print beforehand. Acted quickly from Augsburg, the 3rd of August, anno 1546.</p>
