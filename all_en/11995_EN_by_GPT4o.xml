      <p>Greetings. There is nothing for me to respond to your letters, except that I take in good part whatever delays have been thrown into this plan you know of, my venerable and dearest brother, nor do I doubt that it has been done by the singular counsel of the heavenly Father, that there could not be any success in the efforts of so many years in this matter. However, I think that in time we will see on both sides the clear reason for this counsel. It greatly comforts me in these doubtful times, that He, who alone possesses all things, whether the world wills it or not, has not only determined certain things for us, but also the best things; let us entrust ourselves to Him as happily as we can, as much as we are worth.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Bullinger, and love us with the most holy perseverance perpetually, diligently commending us and ours to Christ with pious prayers. I am sending Musculus's letter; if you wish to reply to him, send it. Greet all the brothers and friends with your whole household. Commend us to the excellent consul RÃ¶st. I will write to Gwalther as soon as I have time; greet the man most lovingly on my behalf. Farewell again. July 29.</p>
      <p>I have received the money. Yours, Ambrosius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a friend in all ways supreme. Zurich.</p>
