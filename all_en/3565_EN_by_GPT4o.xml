      <p>Franciscus Hotomanus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I received from you a gift, venerable father, that is excellent and very suitable for these times. If this matter were handled so calmly by our people, I would have great hope that soon the unity of the churches would be restored, which is indeed greatly to be desired in this time of turmoil. King Maximilian has sent two envoys to Augsburg, TÃ¼bingen, and Heidelberg to discuss with the theologians the establishment of the church in Vienna. For you know that by a recent decree of the empire, this has been permitted to the most excellent prince.</p>
      <p>In France, however, new fires are breaking out everywhere, and a cardinal triumvirate has been established with supreme power and jurisdiction to conduct inquiries not only into the clergy, as it is called, but also into the laity. A certain horrible savagery is raging through the French churches like a storm, and it does not allow any pious person to breathe freely. I pray to God to extinguish those plagues and to have mercy on His church.</p>
      <p>I wish health to Lord Martyr, my most esteemed father and compatriot. Our Theages does the same with his mother; the Lord recently gave him a sister, whom we call Maria; thus, the Hotman family is flourishing again in Germany, from where it originates, and I hope the Lord will take up its protection and care. I pray that He may keep you safe for a long time for His church, most illustrious man and most esteemed father. Farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>15th/12th of April 1555/1558.</p>
