      <p>S. D. I also received your letter, dearest friend, with great pleasure; for it relieved me of considerable anxiety; it was reported here that you were dangerously ill again.</p>
      <p>But since I perceive that your hand can still perform its duty without trembling, I firmly hope that the heavenly physician will soon restore you, just as my Jonas has moderately recovered by the grace of God. Therefore, with God as my guide, I will strive to visit my Bullinger in Zurich on Monday. I have already drawn much fruitful comfort from your sermon on the Christian sacrifice; I will pray to the Lord that He may repay you for what is lacking in me.</p>
      <p>Anyone who knows the state of Germany well will fear for it. Duke Maurice, along with some orders of the empire, as far as I understand, is intent on restoring his name, which has been tarnished in past years, to some degree of honor, if possible.</p>
      <p>He claims that he will restore the lost liberty of Germany and seek stable concord among the princes, and thus bring to fruition what he began with his followers last year. Charles himself is no longer in power; indeed, I rather believe that he trusts the Emperor little because of the incursion into the County of Tyrol, from which the Emperor was forced to take counsel for himself with little commendable flight, then to release captive princes and enter into agreements disgraceful to such a great Emperor. The Margrave is waging a singular war with the bishops; I hardly think Maurice will bring him aid.</p>
      <p>Even less would I believe that the German soldier will follow an expedition into Italy. The rest, God willing, I will discuss in person. May the Lord care for and heal you. It is almost impossible to safely entrust in writing the things I have. Farewell to me and to the whole church. May 6, 1553.</p>
      <p>I am now living with my family in Lauingen, in the city of Otto Henry, Prince Palatine, with the advice and help of Gabriel, the former treasurer who was exiled among you. But how long I will stay here, I do not know. With wars breaking out again, it will be very dangerous for me and mine to remain here. Therefore, I am still considering seeking another place to live; it would indeed be unwise to incur intolerable expenses in a nation almost devoid of provisions, as I am now without all functions and stipends and have no intention of engaging much in secular affairs hereafter. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Georg Laetus.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable lord and uniquely esteemed friend, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
