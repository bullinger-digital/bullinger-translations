      <p>All of which our Laelius, with his humanity and affability, will elaborate more fully and abundantly in his own words. - To Emperor Ferdinand for the Turkish expedition, the princes of the empire have decreed five hundred thousand gold coins, and additionally, if the enemy wages war, twenty thousand infantry and six thousand cavalry for six months. The same Ferdinand is said to have sent a very large delegation to the Queen of England to seek her as a wife for his son.</p>
      <p>He also sent the brother of the Cardinal of Augsburg to France to congratulate the new king and to confirm the friendship established with his father Henry. The same was done by the Dukes of Württemberg, the Palatinate, and Zweibrücken. - The King of France has not yet held the funeral for his father Henry; he wants it to be celebrated with a large assembly of the princes of France. - The Duke of Savoy went to Flanders to greet King Philip and will soon return through France and come to his possessions with his new bride. - The Muscovite renewed the war against Riga and cut down large forces of the enemy, which consisted of cavalry.</p>
      <p>The King of Denmark occupied Dithmarschen with many losses on both sides. - The Pope is said to have recovered or at least begun to recover from a very serious illness; upon his death, someone had played thus: Here lies Carafa, hated by the gods above and below; Styx has the soul, the earth the decaying corpse.</p>
      <p>He envied peace to the lands, prayers and vows to the gods, The impious one destroyed both the clergy and the people, Supplicant to hostile enemies, unfaithful to friends. You wish to know in a few words: the rest was the pope.</p>
      <p>Laelius carries the Pope's bull with him. What the French hope for from their Francis, this poem written on his birthday to his father Henry testifies: It is said that Jupiter once came to the embraces of Alcmena To multiply the nights' turns, Indeed, because in the great divine birth of Hercules A winter night, though not one, was enough. Thus, Prince Henry, when the fates wished to give the French their own Alcides with your blood, They ordered ten months to pass for the conception of one offspring with great reason; Certainly, no less than over many years This great boy had to be formed. And if it is right for a man to reveal future things Nor should the wish be believed an empty divinity: As ten are more than three nights in years, So this infant of yours will be greater than Hercules.</p>
      <p>Chur, 14th of August, in the year 1559.</p>
      <p>Return the letters, excellent Colline, and indeed as soon as possible.</p>
