      <p> Greetings. Exhausted by many and lengthy ecclesiastical sermons, I nonetheless send you these few words. The royalists assert with great constancy that Prince Cond√© was killed in battle along with many distinguished men and numerous soldiers on March 13th. What I have received from Geneva from Mr. Beza, translated from Latin into German, I share with you. Believe me, as much as you are dear to me, and although I worry that it has gone badly enough for both sides, I still want to wait for a better and more thorough explanation. Let us pray to the Lord, that He may have mercy on us. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Greet the councilors, Mr. Karl, Pontisella, Ganthner, and all friends. </p>
      <p> Most swiftly, April 8, 1569. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful pastor of the Chur church, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur. </p>
