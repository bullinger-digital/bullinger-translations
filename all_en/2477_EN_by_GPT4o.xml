      <p>While passing through here, the messenger of the Christians from Locarno conferred with me about the matter; among other things, he said that he had orders for the Christians to immediately send another to the lords of Zürich, [who] would report back to Locarno whatever was decided at the assembly.</p>
      <p>But because the journey is long and very difficult, we decided among ourselves that he should go to Locarno as quickly as possible, and I would write to you in this manner, namely, if you see that their situation is going to be lost, you should send a messenger here to Philippus Gallizius at our own expense, with whom I have arranged that he would also send his own messenger to me at Chiavenna with your letters. I say this, however, if you perceive that the people of Locarno are in danger of life or the total ruin of their property, otherwise, send your letters to Gallizius in the usual way, who will ensure they are delivered to me. Whatever you have explained, if necessary, you will request this in my name from Lord Sebastian. Please ensure that the enclosed is delivered to Lord Lelio. Farewell, my most distinguished man and most esteemed lord. Chur, the day before the calends of December 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Antonio Mario Besozzo.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety, learning, and morals, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
