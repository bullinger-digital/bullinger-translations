      <p>S. I received quickly and well enough what I had requested, along with the booklet, and I give immortal thanks, which I will gladly repay if the opportunity arises. I will translate it into the French language and strive for the king to read and approve it, and I will send it in Latin and French, leaving nothing out. I have treated the same subject, but in another way, and I have touched upon those things which only concern a better state and in which I have found errors and which I could observe, which I will communicate to you sometime, and what success everything has had. The Duke of Savoy has left the king's court and sought Flanders, soon to return, to seek Savoy.</p>
      <p>He sends three envoys to the Bernese, Fribourgers, and Valaisans. If they do not agree and are discordant, I think they will refer the matter to all the cantons; I will be able to understand everything more certainly soon. Yesterday I received letters from that duke, in which he only gives thanks for the benefits that I have conferred upon the Savoyards, and for the kindness and assistance candidly provided, at the time when I was sent by the king as a general among the Allobroges, and he says he will be mindful of it. The Diet of Augsburg will soon come to an end, and the emperor is about to set out directly for Vienna.</p>
      <p>They promised him five thousand florins over five years for contribution, and if the Turk wages war, they will provide 20,000 foot soldiers and 4,000 horsemen for half a year. He sends an envoy to the king, the brother of Cardinal August, to make him the heir of paternal friendship. The same is done by the Dukes of Württemberg and Zweibrücken and the Count Palatine.</p>
      <p>The death of the king has disturbed the plans of many, and everything is hoped to be more fortunate and peaceful. The King of Navarre, who has been ill for a long time, is expected at court.</p>
      <p>I do not know how the affairs of Scotland will be settled; for the Protestants have prevailed and occupy almost everything. Everything is settled in England, nor do I think that the queen is seeking the emperor's son; although the common people do not entirely say so rashly. I have not yet received certain news of the pope's death.</p>
      <p>The Muscovite has renewed the war and slaughtered seven hundred horsemen near Riga. Greet all friends and love us and my son.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, August 7.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Matthieu Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
