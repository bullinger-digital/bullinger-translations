      <p>Greetings. Vogler left one book and another here; I am sending them with this. The container in which all his belongings are remains unclaimed; I wonder why this is so.</p>
      <p>There are some very small debts, which I recently wrote to his father about, and I am very eager for them to be settled.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all your family. May 14th.</p>
      <p>Your S. Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>If you have any news from the Imperial Diet, please share it.</p>
      <p>To his friend, Herr Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
