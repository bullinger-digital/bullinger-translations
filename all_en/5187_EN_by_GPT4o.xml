      <p>It is royal, he says, to hear evil when you have done good.</p>
      <p>The same happens to me from many as it does to you. The classes had prepared themselves for the synod; but you would have seen wonders if it had proceeded.</p>
      <p>We are now awaiting your and the Schaffhausen people's judgment. I do not send back the autograph of your letters, in case (since they were read before the senate and the deacons) I might be asked more about them; however, I send a copy of them, so that you may know what you have written and be able to confront the slanderers. Many brothers, to whom peace is dear, rejoice that the synod has been abolished; others are as if struck by lightning, after it was indicated to them that it was suspended. Meanwhile, many were in Geneva and prepared themselves excellently.</p>
      <p>We must pray to the Lord to remove that bitterness. As for us, by the grace of the Lord, we are all in agreement; we would like to address the diseases and offenses of the church. However, I wish this to be done candidly, prudently, and with good counsel, so that fruit can be hoped for. Many do not care about this, who would like everything to be turned upside down, as long as their desires are satisfied and they seem to have won.</p>
      <p>There are few who consider that saying of the apostle: "Seek what is of peace, and what is of edification, one towards another." Among us, there are no factions; but while we strive to reconcile those who argue and interpose ourselves, we are somehow swept away as if by violent whirlpools into the very sea of controversies. I can write nothing about France now; you will hear much from this Hungarian, who carries these letters, whom I commend to you. He is traveling there to see you, then descending to Frankfurt for the fair.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, Haller, Hagius, Diesbach, Steiger, Pfister, Zehender, and also my father-in-law and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers, your wife, and the whole family in my name, and also my brother, to whom I write nothing now due to my occupations. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 25, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your entirely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I beg you to ensure these letters are safely transmitted to Glarus; my brother can accomplish this. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
