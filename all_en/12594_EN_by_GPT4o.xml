    <p xml:id="regest1">Because Bullinger is so heavily occupied, Frey has not written for a long time. Even now, he writes only briefly. [In Biel] everyone is doing well. Public prayers are held twice a week. Yesterday, some people from Biel left to support the Protestants in the war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- In [Biel], the Latin letter of the antichristian [Pope Paul III] and the German one of the apostate envoy [Girolamo Franco] are known; as well as the bloodthirsty plan of Emperor [Charles V] and the [“Response of the Preachers in Zurich”], in which they explain why they are staying away from the council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- It is said that the [Schmalkaldic] commander [Sebastian] Schertlin, under whom the Swiss are fighting, has retreated before the Spaniards. However, it is said that Rain has been captured. Bullinger would like to share any news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings to the wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler], to the family, and to [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>

      <p>Grace and secure peace from God through our Lord. Indeed, for a long time, I have desired to write to you, most esteemed father, but the thought of your many duties has always restrained my writing impulse. For this reason alone, I will also be brief now. We are all doing well. Public prayers are held twice a week. Yesterday, a few of our people left to serve under the Protestants in the war.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We have seen the Latin letters of the antichrist [Pope Paul III] and the German ones of the apostate envoy [Girolamo Franco]. We have read the cruel plans of the Emperor [Charles V]. We also received your apology for not attending the simulated council.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We have heard that the commander [Sebastian] Schertlin, under whom our Swiss are fighting, has retreated before the Spaniards. However, it is said that our forces have captured the city of Rain through surrender. What has happened since, we have not yet learned. I ask you, however, to write to us about what you know for certain, so that if the news is good, we may give thanks to God, and if (God forbid) it is adverse, we may pray for forgiveness more fervently.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Our people send their greetings to you. Greet your wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler], your family, and Mr. Rudolf Gwalther in my name. Farewell and love me. Biel, on the day of Bartholomew 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. Zürich.</p>
