    <p xml:id="regest1">Is still weakened by the fever and would prefer to die. The results of the meeting in Schmalkalden, reported by Ambrosius [Blarer], are pleasing, but it remains to be seen what the assembly convened in Speyer will bring; Pellikan should also read the report. Requests to treat the people of Strasbourg amicably. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>The fevers have ceased, but a great weakness of the whole body remains, which some think can only be cured by a bath or other rest. However, what will happen, I do not know. It would be better to depart and be with Christ; but that too will happen at the appointed hour.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius writes to you about the Schmalkalden meeting and sends what the princes and ministers of the word have given, certainly clear and pleasing; only pray to God that they are not just words. But now a day has been set for Speyer on the sixth of June, where King Ferdinand, in the name of his brother Charles, will once again attempt what pertains to peace. There we might perhaps be given the farewell; but may the will of the Lord be done. What we send, also give to Pellikan to read. But I ask, adopt a friendly attitude towards the people of Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my brother, and commend us to the Lord. Greet your wife, mother, and children most diligently.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, 17th of May, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger of Zurich, his esteemed brother.</p>
