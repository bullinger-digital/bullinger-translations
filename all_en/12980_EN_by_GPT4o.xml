    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The Schultheiß and the Council of Bern have decided to send the two young men Samuel Schnewli and Ismael Buchser to Zurich for their further theological education, as there will continue to be a need for new recruits in the pastoral profession. Bullinger should take the two under his wing and keep an eye on them, especially since they must, of course, be punished in the event of improper behavior.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The latter also applies particularly to the three young men sent to Zurich some time ago, who are evidently behaving in a work-shy manner and leading an unsettled lifestyle.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Schultheiß and the Council of Bern will know how to duly reward Bullinger's efforts.</p>

      <p>Our friendly greetings, along with all the love and goodness we can offer, to you, honorable, well-learned, especially dear and good friend. As we continue to have the intention of supporting the servants of God's word, we have decided to send these two young men, Samuel Schneuwly and Ismael Buchser, to you to study there and devote themselves to the Holy Scriptures. We kindly ask you to keep them under your favorable care, to watch over them, and if they do not conduct themselves properly in learning, living, manners, behavior, and other areas, to reprimand them for it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As it has also come to our attention that the three young men we previously sent to you are somewhat negligent and unsettled, we would like to ask you to discipline them in the same manner.</p>

      <p>We will be grateful to you for this. Dated June 27, 1547. The Schultheiß and the Council of Bern.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the Church of Zurich, our especially dear and good friend.</p>
