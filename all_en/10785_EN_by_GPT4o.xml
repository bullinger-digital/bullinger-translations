Peter [Weber?] was questioned by Captain [Auf der Maur] about possible troop levies in Zurich. The castle of Count [Ludwig XV.] of Oettingen is said to have burned down. In Ulm, Basel envoys, who likely attended a meeting, have been seen. It is said that Hans Thomas von Rosenberg has declared a feud against Augsburg, Nuremberg, and others. Emperor [Charles V.] is said to have arrived in Rome, accompanied by the Duke of Bavaria, the Bishop of Brixen, and the Abbot of Weingarten, to be crowned by the Pope; it is said he is calling a council of his own. Bullinger is to write. Leo [Jud] sent teeth, which might be of some use to a toothless woman. Sends knives. Greetings</p>

      <p>My service etc. In haste.</p>
      <p>Vadiano has been sent a report by a citizen of St. Gallen, concerning the Tunis campaign, with the summary written down. I requested to have it copied for myself, my lord Röist, and others, to send it to you to read. He agreed. I copied it yesterday from 9 o'clock in the morning until 4 o'clock in the afternoon; noting it all the better etc.</p>
      <p>Further, in confidence I showed you, Peter etc. told me, he recently brought a letter to Zurich from the abbot's captain at Einsiedeln; he gave him another one. When Peter gave it to the captain, he asked him what news there was, whether my gracious lords had also sent out troops. Peter replied: "I hear no." The captain said: "He writes to me likewise. Ecce homo habet virtutem, vere." I feel partly obliged to show this in secret.</p>
      <p>Further, it is said that the castle of Count Ludwig XV. of Oettingen has recently burned down with its contents. Estimated to be worth 20,000 guilders.</p>
      <p>Also, Basel envoys were seen on Candlemas Day by a citizen of St. Gallen in Ulm, attending a sermon with several lords. It is thought they knew the day in Ulm, which was to begin in three days due to many things.</p>
      <p>It is also said about Hans Thomas von Rosenberg, that he has certainly declared a feud against Augsburg and Nuremberg, possibly against all bishops and certain nobility, to harm them; to see if they would do anything wrong. Therefore, he is said to have been hindered in his previous point. It is thought they have hindered him. But if they think what has passed in the old point, they should help him to come back.</p>
      <p>Also, finally it is said, the imperial majesty has arrived in Rome on the 10th day of this month, to be crowned by the Pope. Then it is said, he is now only a crowned colonial emperor and not a Roman one. Many people rode with him; it is said, the Duke of Bavaria, the Bishop of Brixen, and the Abbot of Weingarten (is not captured), he is said to be in Vienna, from there to Rome. Some think he is calling a council of his own.</p>
      <p>If you are not my mortal enemy, then write me a word now.</p>
      <p>I have sent Master Leo teeth. Someone gave me a gift among you. If you have a woman without teeth, she might need them.</p>
      <p>Also, my fladerine knives you have kept well. My wife says she is not so happy. Send them to me and greet both of us, your godchildren, the mother and people, Master Kaspar, the faithful, and others.</p>
      <p>Done in St. Gallen, on the 15th day of February in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my beloved Master Heinrich Bullinger, to his hands.</p>
