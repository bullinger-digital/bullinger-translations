      <p>S. D. Although you left without saying goodbye to me and I do not know the just reasons for this, moreover, during the whole time you have been in Chur, you have not written even a little letter to me, I will nevertheless continue in the duty of writing, which your predecessor, a man most faithful and excellent in all respects, greatly delighted in, until I see myself completely overlooked by you. Otherwise, Mr. Fabricius of blessed memory was very dutiful and always wrote abundantly about all matters, nor did I fail him. However, what now moves me to write to you is mainly that I hear there is a dispute between Mr. Zanchi and his church and with his colleague. And although I have no doubt about your faith and diligence, I nevertheless urge you to diligently and persistently strive in the upcoming synod to bring the discordant to concord. When he was with us, I promised to write to you about this matter. Otherwise, he was seeking our judgment on that controversy; but since we understood that the whole matter was referred to your future synod, we did not want to prejudge anything. Contentions often arise among the Italians especially; but you and others must strive that fire is not added to fire, but rather much is taken away and friendly compositions are made. There is already too much contention in the church. The Lord must also be incessantly prayed to, that He may grant peace and calm and soothe troubled spirits. The one who brings you this letter, Anthonius Gaza, is a good man, as I think and could gather from conversation. He asked that I commend him to you; I therefore pray that you help him, receive him as a friend, and send him off. In the Netherlands, all the churches are disturbed and the faithful are most cruelly afflicted. Gotha has surrendered, and punishment has been inflicted on the proscribed. I would rather hear from you what the Spanish army is doing in Lombardy, as you have more certain information.</p>
      <p>I pray, diligently greet the three consuls and your colleague Gantner, whose silence I also wonder at. Also greet the most honorable man, the royal legate, and tell him that I especially ask him, if he has any certain information about the Turk and his expedition from the Republic of Venice, to communicate it to me either through you or by letter. If I receive anything worth knowing, I will in turn communicate it to him. Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>Zurich, on the evening of Pentecost 1567. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
