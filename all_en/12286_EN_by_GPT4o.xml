For this purpose, the noble [Jakob Held von Tiefenau] is to persuade Myconius to write to the [Zurichers and to Vadian]. Bullinger and Theodor [Bibliander] should be cautious! [In Landau], the deceased Schwenckfelder [Johannes] Bader has been succeeded by an even worse [Johannes Liebmann], whom the summoned Bucer is supposed to cure of his errors. - The Protestants of Metz, who were given a 14-day ultimatum, seek refuge in Strasbourg. - Today, Gast read a letter from [Basel] merchants from Strasbourg. [Charles V.] is recruiting [lands]knechts and trying to expel the [Arch]bishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied]. He, summoned by the Emperor to Cologne, was asked to return to the old faith. Only with difficulty did he receive two days to consider and was able to secure himself. Pope [Paul III.] has summoned him to Rome within 40 days under threat of loss of grace. - Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] is arming; likewise, Elector Palatine [Frederick II.], who intercepts the [lands]knechts moving down the [Rhine], hangs many of them or forces them to swear not to undertake anything against the princes and the imperial cities. Many turn back. Some believe that Duke Henry of Brunswick is conducting the recruitments. Soon it will be known what the Emperor has in mind! - Allegedly, [Paul III.] has promised the bishopric of Cologne to the son [Arnold] of the Cologne mayor [Arnold von Brauweiler]. - Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander].</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I recognize your spirit towards me from many gifts and see that you do not omit anything that seems to cultivate true friendship. If only I could reciprocate! I am now sending a small token, Gerbel's writing on the Greek cities. For I know that you will value the spirit of the sender more than the gift itself. You will see that I am not ungrateful for your love and inclination towards me.</p>
      <p>Schwenckfeld wishes to have a conversation with you and with Vadian. He has instigated a certain nobleman to persuade Myconius to write to you about this matter. He is nowhere safe and, outlawed by the Duke of Württemberg, is now seeking a safe refuge in Switzerland. With these few words, I wanted to warn you and our Theodor, so that you are advised and meanwhile consult on what you should do, lest you nurture a serpent in your bosom. For I know the ways of those people. Bader, a disciple of Schwenckfeld, has died, succeeded by a worse one, whom Bucer wants to free from errors, and for this reason, he was called, I don't know by whom. The people of Metz flee to Strasbourg; I mean those who adhere to the word of Christ.</p>
      <p>They have been given a deadline of 14 days to swear to the order or to leave.</p>
      <p>Today I read letters written by our merchants from Strasbourg. The Emperor is recruiting soldiers; he undertakes to expel the Bishop of Cologne, for the bishop was summoned by the Emperor to Cologne. There he appeared. The Emperor ordered him to abolish the Lutheran religion and to maintain the old religion as before. He requested a two-day delay, which he could barely obtain. He thus acted according to his conscience. Following this, the Pope's citation to Rome ensued, that he should appear in Rome within 40 days under all the ungraciousness of papal holiness, to justify himself and give an answer regarding his conduct in the religion. What will come of this?</p>
      <p>The Landgrave is arming; also the Elector Palatine. The soldiers who want to go down are intercepted by the Elector Palatine, many of them are hanged, forced to swear not to do anything against the princes and cities of the empire. Many return home.</p>
      <p>Some believe that Duke Henry of Brunswick is taking on the soldiers. We will soon find out where the Emperor intends to turn.</p>
      <p>It is said that the Pope has promised the bishopric of Cologne to the son of the mayor of Cologne. O blind and insane Germany, which does not smell the plans of the impious and lives so securely without any repentance!</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet Theodor most dutifully in my name. Basel, 1545, September 9.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and humane man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his teacher, to be honored in many respects.</p>
