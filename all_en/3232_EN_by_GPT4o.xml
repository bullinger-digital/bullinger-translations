      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger. The letter I recently received from you contained three main points. Firstly, it recommended to me Francesco from Cremona, then it excused your son, and thirdly, it dealt with the Coelian matter. Regarding the last point, I have this to say in response: For several years now, Lavater, your son-in-law, whom I greatly admire, has told me that the Coelian book was sent to you, which you found quite displeasing, and therefore you advised the man to refrain from publishing it. When I came to you about a month ago and we were discussing with R. Gualter and Lavater the mandates of my most illustrious duke to the people of Basel, I heard you yourself express disapproval of the same book. For these reasons, I have boldly stated in Basel and elsewhere that you do not approve of it, just as many other very serious men do not approve of it. But now you write to me that you do not know what to respond to Coelius, who is demanding an explanation from you on the same matter through letters. I am not one to give advice to you, such a great man, nor would I give it at this time (as I believe); for I think you have written to him already. But I will say this: do not doubt that the book should be condemned by the authority of the foremost men of all of Germany; public condemnations, I say, will be forthcoming, for this is being arranged now. Furthermore, do not doubt that the genius of Leon (as Calvin calls the man) wishes to defend and publish the letters and testimonies of those who have thought more leniently of him; indeed, he already boasts that you wrote most leniently about him from the beginning.</p>
      <p>The consequence is what you see; I do not express it further. I do not regret having openly accused a bad book published against the judgments of many churches, and then devastating the churches. I am saddened that some do not dare to bark at the wolf with me and prefer to be spectators while I am torn apart. Let them see how they will answer to good men and to God. I will easily obtain from my prince that he will complain to the people of Basel about the man's importunity. And enough about Leon. I wish you would share these few things with R. Gualter, to whom I send many greetings.</p>
      <p>Regarding the man you recommended, I will say one word: it is the same as when someone recommends to me those who do not know German and come to me, as if to say: I beg you, give this man a few florins, who will later be of little friendship to you. Do you ask? It is so. For I cannot find a position for such people, I support them for a few weeks, and then, when they wish to leave, I provide them with travel money.</p>
      <p>Since it did not succeed in finding a position, they think it was my fault, and they almost become enemies. But nevertheless, I will not cease to accept those recommended by you, whatever they may do afterwards.</p>
      <p>I do not value two little florins so much that I would want your son to clear himself with me. Let this slight loss go with the many greater ones, which I often suffer.</p>
      <p>I will be ready to prepare myself for the Polish journey, once my heir returns from Frankfurt, which is within 10 (I believe) days. Help me with your prayers. Farewell, H. Bullinger, and remember that Vergerius loves you and holds you in high esteem.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, July 3, 1557.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zürich, honorable brother. In Zürich.</p>
