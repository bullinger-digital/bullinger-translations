    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's report on the situation in Zurich. In Strasbourg, it is reported that Zurich has disregarded the advice of its allies not to agree to a legal proceeding. There are concerns about difficulties for Zurich and the preservation of the reformed faith with an unconditional agreement to arbitration. If it is known that Zurich does not accept the advice of its close allies, outsiders will not be willing to help. The unity between the reformed places must be restored. A request for help from Zurich to Strasbourg must be formally submitted in writing and with a detailed justification from the council to the Thirteen. If Zurich is attacked for its faith without its fault, it can count on Strasbourg's help. However, caution has been exercised since Zurich rejected the voluntarily offered help of Strasbourg and Philip of Hesse during the Kappel War and has now disregarded the advice of the reformed places. A request for help should be kept secret to avoid endangering the truce in the empire. Firmness against the enemy and gratitude for the help of friends are necessary. Bucer wants to prepare the people of Strasbourg and the Landgrave. Zurich should also reach out to Konrad Zwick and Thomas Blarer. The people of Strasbourg will not respond until they are fully informed.</p>

      <p>Grace, peace, and salvation from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, we thank you especially for writing to us so confidentially about all your affairs. The matter is God's, therefore also ours, who seek God. Without a doubt, He will let us see His help gloriously if we only trust Him bravely. We have faithfully considered what you wrote to us and find that we are still of good hope, should you suffer for the Lord's sake, you will not be abandoned. However, it is not our custom to offer something ourselves, as we do not like to promise what we cannot fully deliver. It is now required that the matter comes before the entire government and from people to whom it pertains, and for reasons that carry weight. Currently, it is reported to us that some, who are inclined towards you, have offered you a faithful counsel and a copy of it for the next appointed day, but it is said that you should not submit to the law, which should not be highly regarded. Now they desire it, as it is too late and the law has already been approved, and that without any condition, which should be burdensome, as the points allow, that in such cases each party chooses its own arbitrators, and the complaining party takes the umpire. Also, your adversaries always have it in mind that they have agreed not to dispute or scorn their undoubted faith. From which, if they wanted to demand what the confession is, that your faith is the true faith, in it, everyone can see where it would lead. Therefore, it is necessary to offer them all rights, but with the reservation that you remain by your faith, which is set according to the previous confession and they therefore moderate, and also do not scorn the same in any way, which they do in an inhumane manner, also punishing their own most severely. Therefore, if the clause, which is in your writing, is not expressed in the decision at Baden, it will be burdensome. But be it as it may, you might think (we want to write freely as you desire): If one hears that the advice of the majority is not highly regarded, and also against it the law is approved, that also others do not easily (as it is also a strange law, where the complaining party has to make the majority), that strangers do not like to advise without special cause. Furthermore, it brings great concern that one does not see a way that all discord between you, Bern, and others, who are in the same matter and danger, would be laid aside, and it is thought that the common cause would also be handled with common counsel. For if you cannot be advised without these, they also cannot stand without you, it brings much thought how it could always go further, that not above all this unity is sought, which should truly be the first and foremost in this danger, after calling and trusting in God. With the neighbors, says the old saying, one repairs the fences. Therefore, we urge you in the Lord for the honor of Christ and our common welfare, that you would think and strive most diligently how you could now henceforth handle this your matter, which is common to all who want to live by the word of God, with common counsel and come to a truly heartfelt unity with the aforementioned places, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen. If we could do something for this, as our dear brother Capito in Bern and Basel (we hope) could do something, we want to offer all our ability. For truly, as long as you do not handle your own matter more in common, which is actually common, some think, the need is not so great, some think, it is not only dangerous but impossible to help you, since you do not agree better among yourselves, where one worries, the power must not be with those who understand the matter, or mean well. Therefore, dear brothers, let this be seriously important to you. It brings a great scruple and hinders more than we can write.</p>
      <p>Secondly, since your request is quite different from what we usually bring forward, and if it were to be brought forward, it would have to be shown at least to the Thirteen in writing that it should be advisable and serve the matter, and also where it came from. For this, your writing for reasons would not have been appropriate, and consider, if you knew it, that an honorable council at your place wrote to our lords, the Thirteen, in a friendly manner, in what dangers they were, yet not thinking that they would be abandoned by anyone (for one cannot understand how it could ever be thought that Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen should not recognize this danger as their own), and showed how they intended to stand by the truth and suffer for it, while they were in such matters, which stood in such a way, also driven by those people, that everyone could well see that it was about the holy gospel, they should rightly expect Christian love and faithfulness from all who loved the gospel, and seek their counsel and help as their highest bond of faith relatives and members in Christ, so would their request and Christian intention, as to those they especially trusted in faithfulness, while they, as the understanding ones, could interpret your past misfortune with brotherly compassion and have always held themselves as friendly faithful neighbors, they would want to take this your danger and your enemies' intentions to heart, of which also the Christian princes, our gracious lords, the Landgrave, and our Christian union allies, those from Ulm, in secret understanding and thereupon, what they found with these and themselves, that they would also advise and help you with Christian faith and love and above all zeal for the kingdom of Christ and His holy gospel, would want to let you know the same beneficially (soon). And if your intention and mind were to do and suffer everything that you could with God, so that you would not cause anyone to wage war, then a brief explanation would serve, wherein now the difficulty lies, what you have offered in fairness and wherein the same was rejected by the opposite party, with clear demonstration, how they hold you and you them in all matters. If God ever so arranged that the opposite party thought to start the matter against you, if they then hoped to obtain from them the pieces according to order, as you have written to us - which are all such that we are entirely hopeful, as long as the report were only that you would be waged war against for the sake of faith without your instigation, and you would also want to do your part faithfully -, you should have no need at all. This has indeed made the people here faint-hearted, that what you now desire was offered to you unsolicited in the previous misfortune and yet not accepted by you. But one can also well consider how and by whom the matters stood at that time, although it has weakened the trust in you even more, that our gracious lord Landgrave's so gracious intention was so poorly received after all dealings, and then further, as mentioned before, your own allies were so little regarded, which sounds bad to them. For whoever holds himself as if he does not care much about people, one thinks, also does not highly desire their help.</p>
      <p>In the mentioned writing, one would also have to offer to keep everything quiet, and if one wanted to use the help initially, that one would do the same in your name and in such a way that, as long as the common necessity does not require it, on your behalf, ours should have no one to blame (accuse), as if they wanted to disturb the established peace or truce of the German nation and start a war, also, where they are not already inclined, to approve or promise all or some of the points, that they would still give you their faithful counsel and, what is feasible for them, promise (guarantee), which you would desire to keep in such a way that no one would wage war against you, then only for the sake of the holy gospel, as you intended with God's help to behave in such a way that one should see that you willingly bind yourselves to it, that all who love the Christian truth could remain in peace and quiet by the same, whatever God has previously hung over you for your and our sins. One should also experience that if anyone else who has accepted the holy gospel should be attacked for this matter and all rights, you would want to let happen to each of you what you now desire from them. My dear brothers, we write freely as you desire. Almost everything depends on it, that one sees that you are serious about it and you hold yourselves in danger. For this, it will now belong that one does not hide the necessities from those by whom one seeks help. It should indeed not be necessary to offer, if not so much had happened and still happens, from which some cause can be seen, as if you yourselves did not yet take it seriously. We have mentioned the main reasons. In summary: Turn earnestly to God and trust Him; secondly, seek complete unity with the neighbors in every way and above all, forget all that is past, and do not be ashamed of any humiliation; then also freely confess and report all matters to the outsiders, who should be friends and helpers in need, and freely seek counsel and help; for this, in our opinion, it should now be easier to obtain from you, that one gives power to those who are suitable for it, to undertake such things that do not have to be handled by many. Your adversaries seek and take help and support from many; if one then gives power to some lords, also to seek counsel and help, where it is useful and good, so much less expressed, where or how, so much more it would be terrifying to the enemies. It should also be undertaken with the utmost seriousness to counter-complain everything that serves for it and is unfortunately very true. Also, the disunity among yourselves and the constant retreat and yielding make people bold. Be steadfast, trust Him who has previously delivered you so mightily. And if you want to act cautiously for the sake of the weak and use the means given by God, dear lords and friends, then first take up the means most diligently, which are above all necessary, and without which the others are difficult to obtain and of little use, as there are: that you who are in the same danger, of the same mind, counsel, and whole faithful heart undertake the matter, in which one must always be aware that people remain people, which God also wants to have so, so that the whole heart remains with Him, and therefore accept with thanks what one can obtain from them, for it is pure gain, quia per se vana salus hominum, and do not let yourselves be misled that one cannot obtain everything that we rightly demand; also do not take to heart what burdens us, for one always brings people further, if one shows oneself well content and grateful towards them. As soon as one complains, people already think they have served in vain, also always value their service more than it is, want to have it unminimized. Dear brothers, see how Paul alone in the second to the Corinthians, although one feels it with him everywhere, holds himself so masterfully in this matter. How subtly and cleverly he rebukes what was to be rebuked, how he drives them with praise! You are good pious people, who still practice the old simplicity that was once with you, to deal freely with one another. But you see how also your people become too courteous in this, that they sometimes want more than others, that one gives them preference and leads them early, although they are much coarser and rougher than the old simplicity ever was. Think of what it was for Paul to serve the time. We must only look to God and expect everything from Him and deal with all people, even the wisest, most pious, broken (for they are still human) as with weak and timid, and consider it pure gain, what we obtain from them, that they let themselves be used for the honor of Christ. And above all, dear brothers, one must truly be very quiet in these matters, deal with no one about it, then those who are necessary for the matter, and as much as you need them. Therefore, tell no one, deal in secret. You know that in all dangerous matters the matter must come to a few: Quare dictatorem creabant Romani? Therefore, what you want to write to our lord, direct it so that a common command is given to some to seek counsel with good friends; the same write then to our secret council, the Thirteen. You know, when the enemies know our plans, how easily they can break them. One stands in common truce in the empire; therefore, it will also be necessary to handle everything quietly and cautiously. One knows where the pope's counsel is heading, what the whole matter is about; yet one must and should experience everything gently and show in everything that as we in truth seek nothing but peace in God, that no one has cause to suspect us otherwise. Be, dear brothers, simple as doves. Look with a simple heart only to God's honor and His holy word, forget all loss, disgrace, and what touches you, be also wise as serpents, that you overlook or leave nothing untried, so that you are found faithful to God and His saints. Always call upon the Lord, that He may use you for His honor and give that we may lead a quiet, peaceful life in all godliness and honesty. Our heavenly Father may guide and lead you through our Lord Christ, counsel and help you to His praise. Amen.</p>
      <p>This is what we have found to write to you at this time from us and other good Christians. In the meantime, we do not want to close and faithfully prepare the way to everything you desire, not only with us, but also with the Christian prince and gracious lord Landgrave and others. We would also like you to write to your agents, as to us, Junker Konrad Zwick and Thomas Blarer. May God grant grace. And do not doubt, we act faithfully; as much as we have understanding (knowledge), we are still of the hope, as before and now indicated. That one does not write, makes that one does not perceive the cause from there, where one has recently still inquired about your situation, also that one is somewhat confused from the mentioned cause and does not know to whom and for what one should write, what it may bring. Which should not make you faint-hearted, for a good report of all dealings will set everything right. Think yourselves, dear brothers, how it may appear to people who are not exactly informed of all your matters, that one does not even want to read the advice of the best and closest friends, as happened in Baden. Yes, say: "We have no command." You might think what one thinks, perhaps it was painful to the people that they knew a good counsel. My soul, my soul, it must be better looked around in these matters, better words given, everything heard and accepted with thanks, also that nothing helps, or that one does not intend to follow. Be comforted, God will make everything good. Trust Him well and watch in all humility and composure.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, January 14.</p>
      <p>I have written everything freely, therefore you, according to your prudence and diligent observation, should present it to be read, considering what each can bear.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned and Christian preacher in [Zurich], Master H[einrich] Bulling[er] [his] beloved, to [his] hands.</p>
