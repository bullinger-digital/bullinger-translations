      <p>S. Just as you recently received letters from Schöpf and the treasurer of Montbéliard, now you have Liner from St. Gallen, my dearest godfather. He will be able to recount to you all our affairs and foreign matters, as he stayed with us for more than eight days. Meanwhile, I received the letter you had written to me through my brother, namely the letter from the Nîmes synod to you and some news. I kept them because I was not advised to return them. Various rumors are being spread about the affairs in the Netherlands, but I do not put any faith in them.</p>
      <p>The people of Geneva wrote about the death of Philip; but that rumor has faded away. Others were proclaiming that the admiral was stabbed in Paris by the work of the Duke of Anjou and that the Duke himself, the king's brother, was arrested for it; but I do not believe this to be true either.</p>
      <p>Now they say that many Frenchmen in the Netherlands, who were less cautious, were surrounded and slaughtered by the son of Alba. What is true, time will reveal.</p>
      <p>It seems indeed that those on our side are handling this matter with less care, which is of such great importance; therefore, the Lord must be asked to handle it Himself and bring it to a good end.</p>
      <p>Schöpf cannot praise enough how much you have done for him there; he is therefore ready to return thanks wherever he can, and he greets you. Mr. Steiger will soon travel to Baden at the end of the dog days together with his wife, to bathe there. I strongly urged him not to pass you by, but to visit his old friends. He would indeed do this gladly, but he knows that no moderation is observed there in bestowing honors; this deters him greatly.</p>
      <p>Our Samuel Telamon has been appointed these days to a new and no less splendid prefecture than before, namely to the Roman monastery; that monastery was the richest and most powerful in the borders of Burgundy; he is already preparing for it. He also greets you; the same do all friends and brothers, especially Diesbach, both treasurers, Hagenberg, the father-in-law, and both Zerkindes, father and son, who have been joined to us these days by a new addition of kinship or affinity, as my brother will be able to explain, to whom I also wrote, who else has been created new prefects this year. Liner will report all other things.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Give my greetings to all yours. I expect to see how you have shaped my Sentences collected from the decrees, for which I will owe you much as for many other things; if only I could return worthy thanks! I pray to the Lord to keep you safe and sound with us for a very long time.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 7, 1572.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, ever yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
