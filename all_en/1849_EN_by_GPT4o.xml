      <p>Our friendly, willing service, and whatever we can do for your honor, love, and good, especially to the highly and well-learned, pious, steadfast, and wise, particularly gracious, dear lords and good friends. The highly worthy prince and lord bishop of Constance, etc., our gracious lord, is the patron of the parish of Buchberg, where we have the lower court, and has appointed a preacher, a young person, Herr Jacob Keller from RÃ¼mlingen, there. However, it has come to our attention that the aforementioned Herr Jacob Keller was in the scholarship of our faithful dear confederates in Zurich and did not apply himself to their satisfaction, for which reason they granted him leave, then reinstated him and allowed him to return to the mentioned scholarship, but he conducted himself in such a manner that they were compelled to deny him the scholarship. Therefore, and regarding how he conducted himself, we wish to inform you in writing in confidence, so that we may know how to proceed. We are concerned that he is not suitable for our poor people; we kindly ask you to advise us, so that we may commend you and ourselves to the protection of Almighty God. Dated Wednesday after Misericordia Domini, in the year 53, etc.</p>
      <p>The mayor and council of the city of Schaffhausen. To the highly and well-learned, pious, steadfast, and wise Herr Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the divine word in Zurich, and N., his fellow schoolmaster there, our particularly gracious, dear lords and good friends, together and individually.</p>
