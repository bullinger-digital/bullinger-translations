    <p xml:id="regest1">He has received Bullinger's comforting letter. Suppression and harassment of the Reformed in Solothurn. The Five Cantons want to provoke the Reformed Cantons to start the war. The Christian, in contrast to the people of the Old Testament, only triumphs by suffering injustice in this world and bearing his cross. The history of the martyrs also teaches us that Christianity cannot be defended with weapons: on this issue, Haller urgently desires information from Bullinger. Greetings. Inquires about the progress of Bullinger's commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have received your letter full of consolation, dearest brother, and from it, I have learned what should be done in these perilous times for the congregation. The preachers in Solothurn, as I hear, are being driven out one by one, and the people are being forced to accept the city's decisions. Meanwhile, many are voluntarily leaving the town for other places. Those who remain in the city are so reviled with insults that they can scarcely hide safely in their corners. Knocking and shouting in front of their houses: "Traitor, heretic." The situation is so bad that they themselves, however much they rage and rave, say it cannot last. The entire tragedy is now being blamed on the people of Bern, both because they are said to have incited this sedition, as the papists claim, and by our own people, because we have not only deserted them but have betrayed the faith and the word by our desertion. Behold, this is our reward: What we wanted to avoid with all our efforts is now being attributed to us. During the sedition itself, the rumor was spread throughout much of the Bernese countryside that we were moving heaven and earth to start a new war. Although no one can truthfully say this about us, they still attribute this evil to us. Add to this that both the Pope and the French, the Milanese, the people of Eschenthal, the Savoyards, and the Valaisans are openly threatening and promising to take up arms against us, yet they do not start the war in Antrona. But they provoke us in such a way that we are either forced to do and endure everything according to their wishes or to defend ourselves first in war, which they will later whisper into the ears of the countryside to make them more reluctant, who are otherwise unwilling to go to war. Our neighbors in Fribourg - it is astonishing how much they thirst for our blood. Meanwhile, our senate is vigilant and does everything to resist those unwilling to make peace, as it is most desirous of peace. If there were dictators among you as in the past, you would have known everything long ago. But since it is not safe for you or us, as everything is done openly among you, the animosity remains all the stronger.</p>
      <p>I beseech you to write to me very often. I certainly know the defection of the children of Israel under the judges. I see that they were oppressed for many years by the tyranny of the nations as a punishment for their defection, from which, when they repented, they again had God as their protector. I know what the prophets once threatened. But is it permissible to apply all this to our times? Indeed, everything is written for our doctrine, and it is not inconvenient to be reminded of the example of past events. But how much our promises before this calamitous war have stirred up the people, you yourself know, certainly not without the loss of the divine word, since things turned out far differently than many had promised in words for the congregation. What reward awaits us here? Certainly what is written in Deuteronomy 18 [20]. These things certainly come from ignorance, I confess my own, because we do not know how to use both histories and the threats and promises of the prophets. For us, the cross of Christ is promised, persecution and the triumph of the wicked over us, while for the Israelites, victory, all the good things of the earth, blessings, and even the land of Canaan, if they observe God's commandments. We, who wish to live piously in Christ, are promised perpetual persecution. In the world, we will have tribulation. The Israelites were strengthened against their enemies by the selection of soldiers, by the present and admirable victory of God, although they were meanwhile reminded of their trust in God. For us, to be conquered by the whole world is promised to be the greatest victory. Nor is there any example, as far as I have read, that Christianity has ever been successfully defended with arms and war. If the legend of the 10,000 martyrs is true, if what Eusebius recounts in ecclesiastical history is true, certainly no victory remains for us other than a similar one, namely of the cross. We read of ten persecutions of the early church. What if I were to predict these for us, who, as far as doctrine and external religion are concerned, approach the early church, so that our faith may be tested and the thoughts of many hearts revealed? Now, dearest brother, you see what should be taught in this matter, since we are provoked for no other reason than religion, so that we are either forced to abandon the faith or to defend ourselves with military tumult, whether it is permissible to use arms or to surrender to the enemy, since not everyone is given to leave wife, father, mother, children, fields, and even life itself. Many of the brothers and the people are urged on both sides according to their simplicity, for whom it is very difficult either to encourage or discourage taking up arms for religion. We have discussed these things in our conversations, but I and many others are not yet satisfied. Therefore, I will hear the Lord speaking to me through Bullinger in this matter, so that I may be better instructed in carrying out my function and not teach the people something in which I myself have less faith or which I have not yet learned. I therefore beseech you by the mercy of God, as soon as it is possible, to instruct me in this. A month or two ago, I poured out my feelings into your bosom, to which you have not yet responded, and by your silence, I see that they are not worthy of your response. There are still other things I would like you to know, but it is better to remain silent than to commit them to any papers.</p>
      <p>Farewell and do not cease to love me, commending me to you. May Pellicanus, Leo, and the other brothers fare well. But are you making progress in your commentary on the Corinthians? Farewell again.</p>
      <p>3rd of December.</p>
      <p>Your devoted B. H.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his especially beloved lord and friend.</p>
