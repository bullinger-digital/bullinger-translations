      <p>From God the Lord through Jesus Christ, I wish you and yours a blessed New Year. May He grant us His Holy Spirit so that we may complete it in all godliness, peace, and improvement of our lives. Amen. Reverend, dearly beloved, and especially gracious lord, your comforting letter to me, dated November 15, was delivered to me somewhat late, namely on the 13th of this month, by Johann Baptista Müller. The letters that belong in Poland, I immediately handed over to my good friend, the Gutetter, and as he promised me, he will send them to Krakow at the first opportunity. I have not written to you until now because I have been somewhat burdened with business, as you can undoubtedly imagine, given the dangerous times. And as I have informed you more closely, in what great danger we stood with our goods in France, we have not yet suffered any great damage; for they have not yet attacked us Germans. But it is to be feared that if a troop of cavalry were to come to the aid of the poor oppressed Christians, they would not spare us; for the common people are very hostile to us and desire nothing more than to have a reason and occasion to take everything from us and plunder. Therefore, I have sought all means so far and have tried to get out of the country as best as I can, as I have already managed to get some things out. But since we have many debts and also many goods that can be sold nowhere else but in the same place, we must therefore have patience and wait for the time as God sends it. Although other fellow citizens of ours, who also trade there, do not fear any special danger and have all sorts of considerations. But for my part, I think, since there is no trust, faith, or justice to be found in the whole country with the murderous king, it will all go over and over at some point. For to those people who have forgotten God and honor, nothing is too much; for the whole country looks more like a murder pit than anything else, and since it is a labyrinth of evil, I fear God will punish it terribly. Therefore, my friendly request is that you would share with me your faithful advice and good opinion on how I should conduct myself in these matters. And it is no less that I have reason to praise and thank God that He has so graciously preserved me until now, while others have lost their lives and goods, and I do not want to stop. For, as they write from Paris, the king is said to have decided in his secret council that he wants to exterminate the Huguenots, as he calls them, throughout his entire country and let none live. But He who is above in heaven can easily bring such plans to nothing; to Him be praise, honor, and glory forever.</p>
      <p>Those from La Rochelle are said to be holding out very bravely, have sallied out, defeated Strozzi's troops, captured him, and captured much artillery, likewise those from Nîmes, Montauban, and thus this malicious king will still have enough to do. It is also said that he desires many Swiss; but since you report that the four places have forbidden their people under penalty of life to go, I hope he will not get so many from the other places. Yet one always finds unscrupulous people who take money, as unfortunately also happens with us, and even though this king has done such evil deeds, when he has money, he finds enough people, as it is said here, he is in great recruitment to get cavalry. Also, the cavalry who served the admiral in the last war have sent a message to the king because he promised to pay them the same, and as they write, he promised them to make the full payment, as he then wants to pay them a part at the next Frankfurt fair. But many say he promises everything and keeps little; if it happens, he blinds the Germans with it. As for France, you are better informed about everything than we are. And since you mentioned that a meeting was held with you in Baden on December 7, we have long since heard about it, but have not been able to find out what was accomplished there. However, as it is said here, it has been postponed to another day, which is to be held on Epiphany, and many are of the opinion that the hellish father, the pope, along with his followers, will act in such a way that you might be divided so that they can carry out their murder and bloodbath all the better in the whole world. With a friendly request, you would share with us something about such days, as much as can be written.</p>
      <p>From the Netherlands, we have nothing else than that the Prince of Orange is still holding out in Holland with some troops, and since the sea is more or less blocked, the Netherlands suffer great damage and shortage of all kinds of provisions, so that the famine in the whole country is great. And this good country is being miserably ruined by this war; for all trade is going to ruin, many powerful people have to flee, as unfortunately many bankruptcies happen and thus one drags the other with him and a general ruin results from it. As here with us, a prominent merchant, whose parents and he have been in excellent standing for many years, has failed for up to 300,000 guilders and thus has involved many people here in the citizenship and other places, which is a great damage to this community. They are called by name Melchior, Caspar, and Balthasar Neumair, and it is to be expected that this will happen in many places in these dangerous times. Thank God, I am not involved in the mentioned, but many of my friends; may God grant them patience.</p>
      <p>It is reported in the next letters from Antwerp how the Duke of Alba's troops have besieged a city called Haarlem in Holland and have made two assaults on it, but have not been able to achieve anything and have lost about 1500 men along with many Spanish captains. However, Alba has taken many troops from the garrison from Antwerp and other nearby places and will not give up until he conquers this city. God grant that he achieves nothing.</p>
      <p>Here with us, it is very quiet; only that Margrave George Frederick has had all his troops mustered. Otherwise, one hears nothing of any cavalry; only it is said that Count Ludwig has some horses in commission; they are supposed to arrive daily.</p>
      <p>Our emperor has been very weak for a long time, and as some say, has been in danger of his life, but is said to have recovered a little.</p>
      <p>However, as his personal physician claims, he will not reach old age.</p>
      <p>From Poland, we have no other news than that the matters with the election of the king have been postponed to Epiphany; what is accomplished there, time will tell. The king of France has sent a powerful embassy to Poland, intending to promote his brother Anjou, the bloodthirsty tyrant, there; he makes exceedingly great promises and is said to have excellent recommendations from the Turks that he should be elected king. But since his evil deeds are evident, the Poles have little desire for him, and not unjustly.</p>
      <p>There is also a rumor that the Voivode in Transylvania is quite agreeable to the Poles; on the other hand, the emperor is also very interested. We will therefore wait for the time to see what is accomplished on the day.</p>
      <p>It is written from Vienna that an embassy from the king of France has arrived there to the emperor, called Monsieur de Mirabeau, who vehemently excuses himself, saying that it was never his will and intention that his brother Anjou should have pressed so hard to become king in Poland; but he could not prevent his brother's undertaking. In short: The wicked French are not ashamed of any lies. Otherwise, I know nothing to write at this time; if you have anything with you, I kindly ask you to share it with me.</p>
      <p>Please convey my willing service and friendly greetings to your entire household along with all my gracious lords and good friends, and I commend you to the protection and care of the Most High.</p>
      <p>Given in Nuremberg on January 27, 1573. Your reverend's willing servant Gabriel Schlüsselberger.</p>
      <p>Herewith a letter to you from Mr. Durnhofer; he delivered it to me a few days ago, but due to lack of opportunity, I could not send it earlier.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my especially gracious lord, to be delivered in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Letters of Mr. Gabriel Schlüsselberger, concerning news and other matters.</p>
