      <p>Quite unexpectedly, just before lunch, your letter arrived, bringing me great joy, and even more so the gift, which was given by you, a most learned and gracious friend, and minted by the best emperor (of whom there are and have been very few). I, truly unworthy of such a small gift and friend, do not know how to repay you for these. At present, I have nothing except to offer you my eternal thanks, most kind and learned man, for not only counting me among your closest friends, but also for not disdaining to declare your love for me with this small gift, more precious than much gold. I pray to the best and greatest God, our heavenly Father, that He may perfect this love, which He has begun in us, to the praise of the glory of His grace, and if anything cannot be completed in this life, may He add it in the future life, which is to be called the true life, where imperfection will be abolished and all things will become most perfect. Finally, I promise you that I will preserve this coin in your name as a perpetual sign of friendship as long as I can, indeed as long as I live (if God wills), and I will always strive to satisfy our friendship, if not with benefits, at least with simple and fervent love.</p>
      <p>There is nothing greater that I can promise you, most excellent man, and I know you desire nothing more.</p>
      <p>With these few words, farewell, and I wish you to know that I am still healthy and unharmed. As everything proceeds, my excellent father Konrad Pellikan will be able to tell, so that I do not need to trouble you with a lengthy letter. You should at least pray to the Lord that I may return to you with renewed strength of body and mind, as you pray for me. But I desire this not only for my own sake, but also for others, to whom I could be of use both here and elsewhere; for I feel that we, who wish to win some for Christ from this wicked and perverse world, need the efficacy and strength of the spirit. For I see that the kingdom of Christ is most strongly resisted by the devil and his followers, in whom he still has some power. Therefore, the Lord must be asked that, if He does not wish to declare His majesty to the world through His power, He may show it through our weakness (we who are His work, created by Him for good works, and to bring forth abundant fruit). Amen.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you and your whole family safe for the glory of His name and restore your most honorable wife Anna, née Adlischwyler, to her former health, so that she may raise her children in the fear of the Lord. Please greet her in my name, as well as Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and my other always to be respected teachers.</p>
      <p>From Baden, from the baths of the Swiss, May 7, 1545. Your Gerard zum Camph, as much as he is.</p>
      <p>Forgive any errors, due to the baths and haste.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich and his greatest friend and brother in the Lord, always to be cherished and respected.</p>
