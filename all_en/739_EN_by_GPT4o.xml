      <p>S. This is the third time I write to you since I returned home from the baths; if both letters have not reached you, perhaps you will receive this one. You have undoubtedly heard of the miserable fate of England before me. O Almighty Father, I pray to you, through Christ Jesus, your only son and our avenger, to finally relieve the afflictions of your people and take vengeance on the men of blood, so that your flock does not waver in faith and trust. What lacked a bad outcome last year is now taking root, and unless God prevents it with His kindness, it is certain to sprout soon.</p>
      <p>The people of Strasbourg, as they say, will have guests in early spring, hopefully very welcome ones.</p>
      <p>However, the bishops urge us and want the preachers of the word to receive the laying on of hands and orders from them, to use oil, chrism, vestments, ceremonies, candles, torches, shaving, and all Roman rites in the church, to cast out bigamists and those who have married widows, and to become entirely like the papacy. Although the magistrates have not yet consented, they will also command, upon receiving an order from the Emperor, that the bishops' will be done. Such madness has hardly ever been seen by the eyes of man or heard by the ears.</p>
      <p>I wrote to our Christoph Froschauer and inquired of him whether he would like to print the sermons of Johannes Stobaeus translated into German and somehow respond to the efforts made in translating. It is indeed an immense labor. I ask you to impart your advice to me on what should be done in this matter.</p>
      <p>Recently, I wrote to Marcellus Theodoricus, sending him a booklet, and I specifically asked you in a letter to give the transmitted booklet to him. Please write back to me whether our letters have returned to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, our honor. November 14, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Fr√∂lich (Laetus).</p>
      <p>To the pious and wise Christoph Froschauer, citizen and book printer of Zurich, my dear friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>It is celebrated, belongs to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc., to answer.</p>
