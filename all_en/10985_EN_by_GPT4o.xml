    <p xml:id="regest1">Johannes Zwick asks in a letter to [Johannes] Jung about the willingness to conditionally accept the Confessio Augustana and the Tetrapolitana, in case Luther should not approve of the Swiss confession; a response has not yet been received, but in Basel, in view of the council, they would likely be ready for such a step and hope for the agreement of Zurich. Bullinger should, if possible, receive a copy of the statement from the Strasbourg [theologians] regarding the [agenda of the Schmalkaldic League].</p>

      <p>S. He does not write to me, but to a certain Jung, who is engaged in theological studies here, Doctor Johannes Zwick, asking what we would think should be done if Luther would not approve of our confession. He also gives advice, which he thinks should be accepted, namely: Both confessions given at Augsburg, that of the princes and that of the four cities, should not be rejected, but accepted under the conditions by which the people of Constance have accepted them, namely those of the princes. These conditions are: The doctrine is agreeable, the rites are not agreeable at all. Although among the articles there are some that at first glance do not appeal, upon careful examination of the apology, all offense is removed. Through Jung, he has imposed on Grynaeus or me to write back what we think. We will not be able to respond on your behalf. As for us, the situation is as follows: If something like this were to happen, the convened council would urge us to perhaps acquiesce, since there is nothing in the confession of the cities that conflicts with us, and the Saxon or princely confession, along with the apology, can be tolerable except for the rites. This briefly. We have not yet responded to him. And if we respond with the reasoning you have heard, we will add that without you we will not easily take any action, also hoping that you will not refuse anything here, since the truth will remain intact. I wanted you to know this, in case Zwick has not also sent the same to you.</p>
      <p>There is among us a very commendable consultation of the people of Strasbourg on the articles I recently sent. If only there were scribes, so I could send it to you! The document has thirteen sections. I am thinking about how to ensure you have it.</p>
      <p>Farewell to you and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, February 9, 1537.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
