      <p>Greetings. When our mutual friend and brother Lyner was setting out for Lyon, he requested that as soon as I understood what the most honorable senate of this republic had decided to send as aid to the French exiles gathering in Geneva, I should immediately inform you, my lord and brother.</p>
      <p>For I had indicated to him that we had an open path to the senate to request a contribution for the exiles. Indeed, the day before yesterday, we presented this cause in a full senate, and the gracious Lord blessed our endeavor; for yesterday our lords sent a thousand francs from the ecclesiastical treasury to Geneva for the French exiles gathering there. They did not want a public collection to be made in the church; for they spared the people, who are otherwise burdened enough with an excessively large number of poor. I did not want you to be unaware of this; you can now use this information for the benefit and advantage of the miserable exiles according to your piety. For I understood from our Lyner that if your republic's most honorable senate knows what our people have contributed, it will also be generous to the poor. Certainly, Bern made a contribution and sent ample aid a year ago. The Lord will repay all this on that final day of judgment. I give thanks to our Lord, who thus stirs the hearts of our people. Certainly, the merciful will obtain mercy. Furthermore, I received your letters in recent days, in which it was not necessary for you to give such great thanks for the book given to you; for I am prepared to serve you and yours in greater matters. You rightly judge that those wicked and blasphemous ones should be condemned and opposed under the names of the old heresiarchs. I fear, if what I recently read in the letters of a certain great man is true, that Blandrata has paid the king of Hungary the reward of hospitality. Such serpents cannot be nurtured in the bosom without the greatest and most immediate danger to life. May the Lord deliver us from such plagues. Greet your son, my lord, the chief scribe of your city, and all the brothers, including Mundtprat, the prefect of the abbot's praetorium, most amicably. Farewell very well with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 10, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I kindly ask you to send this enclosed letter to Nuremberg as soon as you can.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Kessler, director of the school in St. Gallen, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To St. Gallen, to Mr. Schoolmaster Johannes Kessler.</p>
