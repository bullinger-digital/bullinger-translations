      <p>More detailed description of the lamentable and sorrowful fire in Chur, on July 23, from Mr. Tobias Egli to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Honorable, dear sir and brother! We have received your comfort and truly it has uplifted our hearts not a little. May the almighty God thank you for your Christian compassion and mercy, and also protect you from all evil and heartache. You and all pious people rightly judge that our godless behavior is a just cause for this punishment and a warning and example to others who, like us, are in all kinds of wickedness and ignorance of God. For the pious and just God has now for 2 years shown us signs in the air, on the sun, in the sky, on the moon, especially with fireballs, earthquakes, and lastly with a drought and a painting, like sulfur and fire along with the storks falling upon us, predicting such and other well-deserved punishments. But when I presented these and other signs to them, they only considered it priestly nonsense, that God had to show His power so that one would not think it was nothing but words. But since you desire, dear sir and brother, to describe to you in some form the misery that has befallen us, I will gladly do so as much as is possible for me in my distress.</p>
      <p>As far as the time is concerned, you can well imagine that God did not look upon it in vain in all the heat and in the midst of the dog days, namely on July 23 between 1 and 2 in the afternoon, also exactly at such a time when people were day and night on the go with drums, pipes, eating and drinking, those who had themselves enlisted for the present campaign against the poor believers in France, where it had to go, God grant, what was taught and defended, and although it was strictly forbidden here, as soon as the Frenchman came, they ate with him, had flags made here, stretched out, indulged in their wantonness; in short: no one thought of the poor and oppressed Christians.</p>
      <p>I remember in vain how far exactly at this time fiery balls fell from the sky, shot here and there, were seen by everyone here shooting right over these places that are now burned, except that the earthquakes were felt day and night and just at this time with great fright. All of which were warnings that should incite us to repentance; but with us all in vain.</p>
      <p>Therefore, as far as the place is concerned where this fire first broke out, you should know that behind my lord's trading house there is an inn called the Golden Stag, in which Ludwig Lener, the old housemaster, recently moved. Next to the inn stood an old, black, wooden little house, with a barn and stable, next to the barn a washhouse and chicken house, belonging to our lord's city clerk, whose maid was told to clean the chicken house with the broom. For this, the drunken, wanton brat took a brand in Ludwig's house and a straw broom and went into the chicken house, laid the straw on the embers and thus wanted to drive away the chicken lice with the flames and smoke...</p>
      <p>This maid is from Rankweil, not far from Waldkirch. And since a strong wind was blowing, and after this brat lit the fire, he went away; meanwhile, the flames flared through the cracks into the barn and hayloft and there first broke out with a small blue flame, which some carpenters, who were working around there, first saw and, if they had had a bucket at hand immediately, could have easily doused from the nearest well. But before they ran for a vessel, the fire had become so powerful that it was in vain; therefore to the nearest to the black wooden little house and the beautiful house where Ludwig was hosting.</p>
      <p>I am credibly told that just before that the Frenchman's money came into this inn and the commanding officers had their business there, and also the next to this blood money was hastened, of which several thousand crowns were, and not without injury to the one who saved it, brought away.</p>
      <p>With what haste and speed, however, also how and in what form this general terrible fire has occurred, can hardly be expressed, let alone put into writing. For when the fire horn was blown, also soon after the storm was sounded and the neighborhood ran together from all sides and showed help, I also immediately hurried to Ludwig's house, as the fire just came into the roof, and gladly did my best with other people; but the wind increased and strengthened the fire so much that immediately no help or extinguishing could mean anything and no one could get on the roofs of the nearest houses, which were immediately also ignited by sparks, which the wind blew here and there, quickly overwhelmed, increased by haylofts, of which many around this area, immediately rushed to the preacher's monastery, hospital, city bailiff's Taggen house and other nearby houses and burned...</p>
      <p>As now everyone shouted: "On the roof it also smokes, on this and that too", I unfortunately saw well that the wind drove the fire further and stronger here and there, than it was possible for man to extinguish, for before and 1/2 hour was over, the whole Upper Street of the grain carriers burned one after another, and then it also jumped in front of the gate, burned in front of the Upper Gate most of all houses, also came up to the heights at the slopes, took everything away and let itself out towards the street, burned the beautiful pleasure St. Margarethen, where Mr. Mayor Ambrosi had 2 beautiful houses, which were miserably destroyed along with the vineyard. The sparks also flew far out towards the woods, therefore I made my way from Ludwig's house and arranged for my books and little possessions to come into the cellar. Dewas Toüß, the tailor, whose house was already in all fire, came and helped me afterwards; otherwise, I could hardly have brought down the 10th part of my books; for I had become very tired because of our long stairs and always had to avoid the approaching fire. We were also anxious that we had not yet found all our children and had them together; hence it came that we alone could save the most important things, leave everything else together and get out of the house; for the fire had already burned the butcher's shop and seized the corner houses in front of St. Marti towards our street, our street rose with incredible speed. And when I had already closed my two vaulted cellars and but after a little meal in a small box, I had it taken out of the house to the court in Mr. Hertlin's house and thus afterwards let God rule.</p>
      <p>As I now with my wife went up to the court with this plunder, Toüß Schneider's wife fell into a faint and labor pains. My housewife suspected nothing else, then she must also suffer damage to her fruit on the spot, so that I had to deal with her for a long time. Meanwhile, the fire was at our next neighbor's little house and already came to our roof, struck into the beams. Therefore, when I let myself down again, I found Dr. Berum; he first carried down opera Hieronymi and other things for me and still saved a lot. Meanwhile, strangers and locals were upstairs in the house, and those from Maladers and from Schalkwik did their best, threw off the roof, covered a beam with a wet blanket, held the other beam with force, so that it still burned completely, until one could pour down and overtop my neighbor's house; there it went to diligent pouring.</p>
      <p>But God, who shows His help and grace in the midst of distress, was especially there; for when the underwind drove the fire into the parsonage and into the beam, Mr. Ammann Ulrich Buͦl from Maladers, who was also one of the first on the roof and had received permission from Mr. Mayor Wille, who stood below on the street, to throw off the roof, told me that the Schalkwiker wind had come on the spot and driven the flames from the next burning houses back down; otherwise all human help would have been in vain, and it would have soon reached the churches, school and armory, also the court, on which they had already thrown off most of the roofs, also reached.</p>
      <p>This wind then blew through the whole night, so that the flames of the next houses, which rose and raged incredibly on our street through the whole night, could not harm our house, also (which is greatly to be wondered at) never did any damage to the church of St. Martin, although all the houses over to our street burned the whole night until 3 in the morning longer than any other in the city and so much that the sparks went far over the bell tower. And yet the houses are not well 2 steps from the church over. God also separated with a great rain at midnight, which wetted other roofs, so that they could be less seized by the sparks afterwards; otherwise it would have gone even further...</p>
      <p>And since it all happened with such haste and speed that within half an hour all the houses that burned were seized by the fire according to the drive of the wind, everyone can well imagine what unnoticed damage, fear and distress occurred there. For in the evening, when it started, and the whole night until the morning 174 houses, without stables and haylofts, of which 114, which were next to it, here and there (which is much more than half the city comprises) were miserably destroyed. The city is divided into 4 quarters, where each quarter has as many houses as the other; the 2 quarters are completely burned, from the 3rd quarter not more than 20 houses are left; thus the 3rd part of the city is burned up to 20 houses.</p>
      <p>Since at first everyone ran to Ludwig's house and the origin and many honest citizens and residents long hesitated and resisted there and paid little attention to the far-flying sparks, the fire was already in full force on their roof, which they would have gladly resisted and done their best elsewhere. Afterwards, before everyone ran to their house, many could hardly bring out and secure their children and household members, had to let everything else go. Many fled their children to the slopes and immediately hurried back to them and had to save their lives and limbs with the greatest danger. Many threw out of the windows from the beams, money and other valuables, which were stolen, stolen and otherwise changed in all ways by Lamparters and other worthless people.</p>
      <p>Many trusted their vaulted cellars, fled everything there (since the houses burned above); but many were overtaken by the raging fire, so that they had to stay and perish in the vaults and cellars; one suffocated, the other drowned, the third burned...</p>
      <p>Hans Rüfer's, the minter's wife, brother and otherwise a woman, when they fled the best rye into the cellar, they thought they were also safe in it; but the fire started with such smoke that they all suffocated miserably in the cellar and were pulled out and buried the next day.</p>
      <p>Likewise, Martin Kobler's wife, child and maid thought; but since a pile of beech wood came right in front of the cellar, they (when they wanted to go out) closed the cellar again and had to stay in it. Meanwhile, as the Müllibach was directed into the city, from which one could extinguish, the cellars were filled with water in several places and among others also Martin's cellar, hence it came that these aforementioned 3 persons drowned, so to speak, in the midst of the fire, from which they were surrounded. The water went up to a man's knee. In the morning they were found kneeling with outstretched hands, the child with its hairband still on its head next to the mother, the maid also not far from there, and all were buried. In all this misery Martin Kobler from Lindau had not yet come home etc. As it went with the water and smoke, so others were burned and perished by the fire. The guild master Dominicus had a sister burned, whom he caught by the garment above in the house and thought he was pulling her near; he only caught a handful of garment, and thinking he was pulling her near, it was nothing but garment, he burned his hand badly; but the girl remained and burned, so that no bone of her can be found. Jos Mathis, the guild master and furrier, led his old housewife by the hand and thought she was going near him; but she went back behind herself and wanted to flee something into the cellar; therefore she also remained in it and suffocated, but was soon found and buried. The same happened to a woman named Luscha Essechin and her maid, also an Italian mason, also otherwise a woman at the Upper Gate, who was half burned and pulled out and buried. These are 13 persons who all perished miserably.</p>
      <p>May God grant them a joyful resurrection. In addition, other persons were badly injured by fire and fall.</p>
      <p>Mr. Mayor Ambrosi was just followed by the fire, his son-in-law Francisco Carli's face badly burned, who lay on the ground for a long time, as he made a little ditch, with his face and thus kept himself alive. Long Lucy from Maladers was badly injured by a fall in front of Ludwig's house.</p>
      <p>Many are limping. Some have wrapped pillows and blankets around their heads and thus got away; most of them wore the best clothes and otherwise brought nothing away, and what was brought away was stolen afterwards. There was not little damage to the cattle; for 6 beautiful horses burned. The swineherd says that over 40 pigs burned. There was great damage to crops; most of the hay and grain of this year's bloom all gone.</p>
      <p>What vines were on the ring walls and burning houses were all badly damaged along with the nearest trees. Mr. Mayor Ambrosi had 4 houses burned along with half the vines at St. Margareta. My little vineyard on the city wall is completely ruined and the fences burned. Several thousand florins of foreign cloth burned in the dyeing houses, among which the accident also hit me somewhat, except for my coat, which I also had to leave behind and some cloth with the tailor, also not a few books with Pontisella in the monastery. It is well known that the Lamparters stole whole bales and large bundles of plunder and fled away, so that my lords wrote to the toll collectors at the passes to seize such goods...</p>
      <p>In short, this misery and damage cannot be told. The city is also unfortunately more desolate than if it had been blown up with the greatest effort with gunpowder; for the walls also burned and just as little healthy and upright remained: bridges, gates, all gone; the mill wheels burned in the water...</p>
      <p>The rich have moved into their estates and garden houses; the poor have camped in groups in the bishop's quadrants, in the mountains and vineyards, scattered here and there; where there is great lack. Those who remained upright are not accustomed to giving alms. Many poor beggars have become rich through theft, many rich people have become beggars and are also ashamed to ask for anything from others, since they had more than other people before and gambled day and night, so that they would not have to be pitied by anyone; therefore they wander about bleeding...</p>
      <p>And all this would still be a small suffering if only these rods of God were recognized as a punishment, which God repaid for our sins, and the improvement were taken in hand. But one hears from many people saying it is not a punishment from God; but evil people have done it, and if this maid had not been, it would not have happened...</p>
      <p>So a citizen here in front of Ludwig's house also spoke out, who is now also going to France and is not one of the least trölerers: "We have this misfortune from our rogue priests"...</p>
      <p>And since much woodwork is still on the ground and not torn out, it always makes new outbreaks...</p>
      <p>On July 27, a chimney came into Simon Schärer's house, over which the fire horn was blown and the storm was sounded; for it was thought the lower city must also burn...</p>
      <p>And just at this hour I went out with my wife through the street, and wanted to inspect the damage to our little vineyard; there they started blowing and sounding the storm, and they shouted at the Upper Gate (I don't know if they meant it well for me), the parson's house is burning. But I think it made me run!</p>
      <p>When I came home, my big boy had already fled the youngest child naked like that. In the morning, Jacob Seckler's cellar collapsed, and there was again a big fire right by our street, over which the horn was also blown. Also on that day, someone in the lower city had a wash, and one saw fire on the walkway by the ring walls, over which there was again a great fright and running...</p>
      <p>In short: in these 8 days we have taken in many frights, so that we had to press our beds not badly and stand in great worries, also always had the guards in our lodging, since the nearest houses or ground always smolder and would like to ignite something.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, on July 29, I preached again for the first time, but felt little diligence, also rarely saw a person who wore a coat or shoes, so that I thought I was not preaching in the city, but in a village.</p>
      <p>On July 27, a strange customer came in boyish clothing, called himself Johann Buchhorn and claimed according to his letters, he had been a preacher in Keßweilen, asked that we support him for half a year.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere he claimed to be a mass priest and had to speak with the bishop; also mentioned this fire, went around with frivolous talk, came like a wicked rascal.</p>
      <p>This one also ate at the court and suspected himself, so that my lords grabbed him and instructed me to find out what his actions and intentions were. But when they interrogated me and read his letters, he was soon released again. Now they say he was also in the chicken coop with the drunken, full maiden who started this fire. If that were so, he would certainly be a rogue, and it would be a shame not to use him further. I otherwise consider him a spy, who perhaps would have liked to cause us some damage, whom God has so far protected with His means against all the world's rage; for he otherwise looks like no hungry, but a well-kept person and has a patch on his head. This our suspicion is increased by many shameful words, which go out from him and others. Some shout, they want to take revenge on the lords of Rhezüns even worse, and today (God protect us) as on the next Friday this city will have to burn completely. It is certain and true that a pile of paper with gunpowder was found under the roof in the house of the Italian shoemaker Lorenzen, innkeeper at the Golden Goose, a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>So on Friday morning, when the fire started in the evening, the sun was seen bloody over the city and otherwise in other ways quite unnatural, so that some women were frightened by it and went home from their cabbage gardens and spoke to their husbands, a great misfortune would surely befall us. Towards the night, as my housewife sat in front of the school with other women and looked up with prayers, sighs in the midst of the fire, she said she saw a red cross over the churches, but was so frightened that she showed it to no one. So other people also talk about it, they saw a rod over the city in the morning, whereby everyone assumes that it may not be enough yet. Certainly, since we do not stop sinning and being godless.</p>
      <p>The papists rub salt into our wounds and drench us with vinegar and gall; they say: "Now one sees where the true faith is; the dear mother of God has preserved the monastery and foundation." In front of St. Marti is a corner house, which belongs to Mr. Mayor Ambrosi, in which Stephan Schneider lived and practiced his craft. This one made the flags for this bloody campaign in France, which were stretched out of his windows. Nothing happened to this house. They now say they saw the fire go around the windows where the flags were stretched out; but no harm happened to them there, and they think God performed a miracle there; saying that one should now be brave about it. But it is to be feared that these people will find and feel another fire than ours, and these wicked people are just taking a pretext for this campaign, so that they do not have to work and carry stones at home. And although my lords have strictly forbidden this campaign, there is nothing in the way for the journeymen but the preachers, therefore we are hated by everyone. This is now our improvement...</p>
      <p>The lord bailiff Füßli from Zurich, at this time bailiff in Sargans, has come to us and offers himself in the name of the VII places all loyalty and good against the common city...</p>
      <p>May God have mercy on us and protect us from greater sorrow and grief. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur, on July 30, in the year 1574.</p>
