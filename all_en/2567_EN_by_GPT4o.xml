      <p>Greetings. I am writing back somewhat later than I am accustomed to; if you ask the reason, know that throughout the past year I have been surrounded by bedbugs and beetles, jackdaws, magpies, and crows, and during that time I did not have anyone who could deliver my letters to you. It was therefore necessary for me to delay this duty of mine. The matter itself pleads my case; thus, I will not make a lengthy apology, lest I seem to distrust your goodwill towards me. And, so that you are not unaware of our affairs, know that I am still stuck here; this is required by domestic matters and my mother's poor health. Otherwise, I would have already flown to the Rauraci (a region in Switzerland) and bid a final farewell to all trifles. I now come to your last letter. That my adversities cause you pain is indeed something you share with all those who have witnessed my innocence, for whose sake I have even done good to those who had wronged me, forgiving the injuries I received, for Christ's sake. Although this was exceedingly difficult, it brought me honor, and in overcoming myself, I broke the evil of envy that had been stirred up against me among many. For those to whom I had previously been odious, I have now begun to be loved and, in a way, to be held in esteem. What you wrote about the British is indeed very bitter; but life is such that in human affairs nothing is less fixed than that which is associated with great power.</p>
      <p>These are almost all my thoughts on your letter. As for the rest, we are awaiting those other works of yours on the New Testament, which you have publicly promised us, and we are indeed waiting for them so that, as they teach that all things of mortals are vain, we may have something to fortify us against the impending misfortunes of these times. I am not pressing you here; but I only ask that you consider the Christians whose spirits are troubled. In doing so, you will have done nothing new, but you will have remained true to yourself; for your affection for the Christian cause, as it has previously driven you to various and by no means regrettable labors, should also drive you to undertake this one, which I know, for you, a most practiced and eloquent man, will be very light and will be accomplished without any sweat and toil. Live well and most rightly. Farewell, most illustrious Bullinger. In Nozereth, on the 26th of February, in the Christian year 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gilbert Cousin of Nozereth. To the theologian of profound learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, whom I especially revere.</p>
