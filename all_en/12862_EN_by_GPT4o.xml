    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Zwick encloses a letter from Ulm with his letter, which Bullinger should send back with the current messenger [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The letter from Emperor Charles V [to the Swiss Confederates] has definitely reached Lucerne. It was read to the St. Gallen Marti Hux, as Vadian will likely inform Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] As the enclosed letter shows, Georg Besserer did not write to Zwick. However, it could be that he wrote to Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Enclosed is a record from Nuremberg about the army of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, which Bullinger should also send back.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] 2000 Spanish soldiers were relocated to Biberach and immediately demanded the city keys upon their arrival.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Bullinger will have learned about Zwick's plan from Georg Müller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, is on his way to Burgundy and traveled through Stockach.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Hans Jakob von Landau has already twice imposed himself as a mediator between Konstanz and the Emperor. He offered to meet the people of Konstanz next Tuesday [February 15] in Sipplingen or on the Mainau, should some councilors be undecided. He wrote that Granvelle also advises against any delay. However, with God's help, the people of Konstanz are striving to postpone contact with the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] It is heard from Basel that Wolfgang Rehlinger has gone to Ulm to advocate for the people of Strasbourg, and that Granvelle is already on his way to Strasbourg. Others say that Rehlinger is trying to arrange a marriage between a son of Granvelle and a daughter of the Margrave of Baden [Ernst I].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] During a conversation with Peter Scher the Younger of Schwarzenburg, Johann von Naves told him that his father, Peter Scher the Elder, would make himself even more popular with the Emperor if he could get the people of Strasbourg to come to an understanding with the Emperor. For even if they were to ally with King Francis I, they would not be out of trouble.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The current messenger is not to be paid, as Zwick has already granted him an allowance of 12 shillings. Georg Müller should not worry; Zwick holds nothing against him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Bullinger, pray for Zwick. Sunday after the main meal. 1547.</p>

      <p>About 2000 Spanish soldiers have been stationed in Biberach. They immediately took the keys to the city gates. Oh God, have mercy on us!</p>

      <p>The one from Landau has twice approached my lord for support. He offers, if some of us are undecided, to come to Sipplingen or Mainau by Tuesday. He writes that Granvelle also advised that we should not delay. We seek guidance, as much as God provides.</p>

    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Naves told young Peter Scher that his father might make himself more favorable to the Emperor if he helps Strasbourg come to an agreement. For even if they ally with the French, they are not yet secure.</p>

      <p>You should not give anything to the current messenger, as I have already given him the next 12 shillings as an allowance. Georg has been informed of everything, and I hold nothing against him.</p>
