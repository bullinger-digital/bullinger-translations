      <p>I wrote that I received three of your books on Justification; one has wandered through the hands of theologians throughout the city, another I sent to Mr. Brenz, and the other, neatly bound, to the Duke, who is now at the assembly of princes, which is being held not far from Speyer.</p>
      <p>I wanted to offer it myself by hand; but it was not possible, as he has distanced himself from us. Brenz replied, as you will see from his letters, which I will collect here. I am in good health by the grace of God; but the Antichrist vexes me greatly.</p>
      <p>He has instigated scoundrels in my homeland to take away the remnants of my patrimony, which they will do; for no one dares to speak up to defend such a heretic. But let them have worldly things; they will certainly not take away the soul and spiritual gifts.</p>
      <p>It is astonishing how greatly that crime and destruction rages against me. A legate destined for Raetia, returning to Babylon, used the most pestilent fans to inflame the spirits of all demons against me; he reported that I had subverted everything in those regions, that I was a most deadly enemy and would attempt greater things unless I was suppressed. Blessed be the name of the Lord, whom I hope will defend me from the power of such great enemies. If there are assemblies, I will be there, even if all hell resists. You, my dear Bullinger, pray for me with the whole church, which I earnestly ask of you. There are no lack of struggles concerning that article.</p>
      <p>I, if no one asks me, do not open up; but if anyone (as often happens) asks me to say what I think, I speak freely and commend the cause to the heavenly Father. Now I do not wish to be anxious about my life or those things that pertain to sustaining life, not even a little, but to follow with closed eyes what I see to be true. The brothers in Augsburg inform me that Cardinal Burgensis made a journey through Augsburg and some armed men who were with him diligently inquired where I was. The assembly of the Bavarian and Salzburg bishops has concluded; they had gathered on the matter of religion, to consider whether the other species should be granted, and with the utmost harshness and cruelty, silence was imposed on all; they suspect (as prudent men think) that the Emperor is plotting something against us, otherwise they would not have been so cruel. The English affairs are in a very bad state; their army, which opposed the restored mass, has been slaughtered. Everything is full of evils. Odescalchus, that papal legate, reported in Rome the name of Mr. Bayonne and also of Mr. Ascanio Marsi; he falsely claimed that I had said somewhere that I had obtained from this Marsus the example of that brief, which you know. I pray, take care of this letter to him, in which I advise him to be of good courage; for I neither received from him nor said anything about him. The devil, a thousandfold artificer, spreads these things to confuse everything. The magnitude of the book on Justification terrifies me, which I wish to translate; but it will be done, as I hope, this summer. I have translated not only your little book on the Supper but also the Consensus with the Genevans and will publish it shortly. I hear that some demon has brought Servetus' books into Raetia, which are eagerly read. Meanwhile, Schwenckfeld in Swabia does not sleep; some of his very bad books have been printed recently, I hear, though I do not know where; for he writes in German. I say again, everything is full of evils; but nothing is to be feared with Christ as leader and Christ as guide.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well, and what I asked of you before, I ask again: pray for me. I hope you have received some of my writings, which I earnestly request you to read carefully (unless you have already done so); they will be useful at the next assemblies, I think.</p>
      <p>Soon I will send one of my own to Switzerland; to him, you will give both the writings themselves and your judgment and criticisms of them. I bid all the pious to be well. TÃ¼bingen, March 17, 1554.</p>
      <p>Brother Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To you, Bullinger.</p>
