    <p xml:id="regest1">Concerns himself briefly with the synod; sends the requested letter from Vadian [No. 894]. Recommendation for [Michael Adam]. Is disappointed with the outcome of the Frankfurt meeting and fears that the planned religious discussion will obscure the truth, as also indicated by the solar eclipse [of April 18].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We have celebrated a synod these days, my dear and most esteemed brother; therefore, being very busy with matters, I write these few things. I am sending the letter of our Vadianus, which you requested, but with the condition that you return it through this messenger. Besides you and Myconius, I would not have shared it with anyone else.</p>
      <p>I commend to you the messenger, a Hebrew man. For at the prayers of Leo and myself, as you requested, he comes to you. He is a pious and learned man. But how the Frankfurt assembly has not responded to our wishes!</p>
      <p>May God have mercy on us and on those whose counsels cast the church of the Lord into such great dangers. There will be a discussion in Nuremberg about the concord between the Papists and the Evangelicals. But what concord can there be between light and darkness? Those solar eclipses portend that darkness will be brought upon the truth.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me. I could not write more now. May 7, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Master Simon Grynaeus, truly his own.</p>
