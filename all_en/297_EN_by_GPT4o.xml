      <p>Since my brother was not in the city, I opened your letters, most honorable Bullinger, in which I perceive, as always, your diligence and concern for us; therefore, I will send the letters to my brother for him to read.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it seems worthwhile to dispel the suspicion you mentioned as the reason why our cause was postponed or suspended at the Baden assembly, namely that the majority of the city pursues the Emperor with love and the Swiss with hatred.</p>
      <p>This is how it stands: The entire city has been diligently seeking the Emperor's favor for more than two years now, solely to avoid the charge of treachery and corrupted religion. How steadfastly we have done this is clear, and it is testified by the widowhood and the very sad fire, which the Emperor's unworthy anger has prepared for us. But even so, the respect for his majesty has not been extinguished among the senate and the people, to such an extent that the multitude, having forgotten the omnipotence and divine goodness and the purity and sanctity previously confessed, has wholly given itself to the worldly rule of men, from which it is understood that our people, besieged by human fear, not hatred of the neighboring Swiss nation, aspire to the favor of the Emperor and the king. There are, I admit, but a few, certain loudmouths, who through the recklessness of their tongue spew insults not so much against the Swiss, but against all those who are not or do not wish to be under this yoke. However, good citizens are inclined towards the neighborhood according to the rights and laws of pious and opportune neighborliness. Therefore, I would like you to excuse our people, wherever you hear the opinion arise that we are not as sensible as before towards the Swiss, whose safety and fortune we have tried to promote even at our own inconvenience and will continue to do so in the future, God willing, if indeed we remain in control of our own rights and forum. As for our republic, I have nothing to promise you, and I seem to be still in exile, which threatens me.</p>
      <p>The other matters you mention in your letter, I do not have the leisure to discuss; however, I am grateful for your attentiveness. Farewell with your fellow ministers and deign to intercede for us with Christ in your prayers and supplications.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, 11th of October, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the honorable servant of the Lord, Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed friend in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
