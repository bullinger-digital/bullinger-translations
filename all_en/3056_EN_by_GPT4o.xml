      <p> Greetings. I wrote to you in previous letters about the damage a certain merchant has caused me; I also mentioned other matters that seemed relevant at the time. If you wish to respond, Zwicker in Rohr can send it to me in Regensburg. For tomorrow, God willing, I will begin my journey to the assembly; I hope I will not be forced to linger there longer than necessary. The King is bringing with him Canisius, Gropper, Witzel, and a large group of their ilk, to whom the vast majority are very agreeable. The Saxons are no longer as hard as stones, but softer than wax, having long since made pacts with certain impious ones. The German Empire has long been in decline, religion is in exile, and nothing remains but the amalgamation of both the old and new papacy. Furthermore, the brewers seem to be seeking this with all their might. The princes are, as is their nature, soft, effeminate, delicate, etc. Who can predict the end of these matters? </p>
      <p> I have requested your sermon, your apology, several times, but even though promised, I have not yet received it. I still ask that you send it. </p>
      <p> Zwicker can send it to Regensburg. I, however poor, will pay the price... The affairs of the empire are in such a state that any prudent person would prefer to withdraw rather than engage. If only my fortunes were in their former order. I would soon deliberate on what to do. Now, alas, I am held bound hand and foot. </p>
      <p> In these imperial negotiations, I hope to receive the same grace that all the best have received, that is, not to be admitted henceforth; thus God commands me, thus the world's injustice demands. </p>
      <p> The Duke of Jülich is said to have accepted the Lutheran gospel. If so, you will congratulate him as befits the matter. I am uncertain about what I will do; for the envy and hatred of the Lutherans harass me more than that of the papists; but it is well, the Lord sees. </p>
      <p> The Roman King will come to Regensburg within three days and will make things worse unless the nature of courtiers has changed. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Greet the councilors and all those who are benevolent to me on my behalf, and remain mine as always. Farewell again. September 29th, in the year 56. </p>
      <p> Yours, Georg Frölich from Lemgo in Schlachtegk, etc. </p>
