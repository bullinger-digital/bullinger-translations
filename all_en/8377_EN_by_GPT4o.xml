      <p>S. Linerus will report everything to you that I could have written.</p>
      <p>He also has with him a copy of the proclaimed peace. Our people are preparing for Gasti's departure. I hope not too hastily. I am confined to bed due to erysipelas and can write no more; therefore, forgive me. I sent Felicem to Lausanne; there, Blasius, my son-in-law, received him. He left here on the 1st of September and arrived there on the 2nd. I also took care of sending his small belongings there.</p>
      <p>He left a note with me, which I do not have at hand now, but I will send it to you shortly.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May all your people be safe. Ours send their regards to you. Bern, 7th of September 1570 from our bed.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
