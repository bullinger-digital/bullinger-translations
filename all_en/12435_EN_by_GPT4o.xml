    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has nothing to report because he wrote extensively to Haller just a few days ago [Nr. 2377] and is waiting for Haller's response. Haller should continue to proclaim the truth of Christ.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Allegedly, Duke [August] of Saxony and [Franz of Brunswick]-Lüneburg have come to Augsburg. Emperor [Charles V] is said to be on his way to Regensburg. Haller should report whether this is true.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Who is this false Frederick? Such deceivers have existed before. During the time of Count Rudolf of Habsburg, a false Frederick [Tile Kolup] deceived many people, but Rudolf had him burned near Cologne, in [Wetzlar]; a glorious end for this Frederick! Frederick the First, Barbarossa, is buried in Tyre. Frederick the Second in Sicily. Frederick the Third, the father of Maximilian [I], in Austria. There is no [biblical] prophecy that proclaims a Frederick as the Messiah! If only Germany would accept the word of the Lord from John 5 [43]! Christ alone is our King, Priest, Prophet, and our Peace. May all the Fredericks perish! Christ foretold the coming of false prophets.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have nothing, dear Haller, because I wrote extensively a few days ago, to which I am expecting a response. Be strong in the Lord Christ, whose truth, if you sincerely preach it, you will not be deserted either by the Lord himself or by the cause. Pray diligently to the Lord, that he may increase the gifts of his spirit in you, so that you may understand, advise, and act on whatever is beneficial to the church.</p>

      <p>There is a rumor that the Duke of Saxony and the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg have come to Augsburg, and that the Emperor is on his way to Regensburg. I do not know what is true; however, I wish to know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The world does not cease to attack the truth with its arts and machinations, both secretly and openly. But he lives, who has overcome the world. His word remains forever.</p>

      <p>But who is this false Frederick? Is he an impostor sent to break and terrify the spirits of many? His deed is not without precedent. For in the time of King Rudolf, who was Count of Habsburg, a certain false Frederick promised golden mountains and deceived many. But Rudolf besieged him not far from Cologne, in Wetzlar (if I remember the name correctly), and captured him and burned him. This was the end of that glorious King Frederick. The first, Barbarossa, lies buried in Tyre. The second in Sicily. The third, the father of Maximilian, in Austria. We have no promise of any Frederick Messiah. If only Germany would heed the Lord's words: "I have come in my Father's name, and you did not receive me; another will come in his own name, and you will receive him," John 5 [43]! Christ is our King, Priest, and Prophet. May all Fredericks perish and depart far away! Christ is our peace. He foretold that false prophets would come into the world.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus protect you with your wife and daughter.</p>
