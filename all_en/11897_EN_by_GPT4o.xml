      <p>Greetings in abundance. I would rather write nothing to you than write in a troubled manner. For thus our affairs stand: our republic still wavers; our school is falling apart; most things are conducted under the auspices of a tyrant, into whose snares the calamitous republic of the Rhaetians has now fallen. Therefore, it will be necessary to forgive us a little if we have detected hypocrisy. For we must depend on both masters, if we wish all our things to be safe. You, oh my most pious Bullinger, rescue us from these things, so that we do not have to perish together. For you are a man of such genius - and I do not speak without experience - that you not only love all the studious and cherish them as if in your bosom, but also protect them from all injury and harm. What if I, miserable, were to become callous to these contagious diseases, and seek advantage from them? Surely, having fallen into such Sirens, I would either fall asleep completely or be overthrown together. Therefore, unless I am completely thoughtless of all, I do not want to embrace both, Christ and Belial. For with one set aside, I would gladly embrace the other. Here you would have to block your ears, you would have to wink, you would sometimes have to limp a little and also dissemble everything; thus it is with us. I do not know, by my faith, whether faith or charity is more endangered in the world. The end of things is involved, involved, may I perish. We have before us the dregs of either consummation or alteration, as the prophet cries out. This is often in our sole prayers: to be released from this bondage of the body and to be with Christ. For I fear, I say I fear, lest, if my days are not shortened, I fall into worse; for thus snares are laid for me. You, who are pious, struggle for us and obtain pardon from God, with whom you have that goddess of persuasion and as if the marrow of Suada. Oh how many things would be lamented here by you, which, however, we omit due to the constraint of time and other matters. For we would seem to have taken great solace for our torments and self-punishment in this way, if we poured these things into the bosom of such a great man. We despise letters, we tear apart religion, we trample on, finally, whatever pertains to the worship of God. What else will follow, but a great famine of truth, as Amos said? Which indeed can be seen openly and without hindrance. For here, the one who delivers the letters, a man of proven learning and integrity, perhaps now torn from his church, strives for another pasture, about to yield to this our ingratitude; whom I commend to you in every way as a most faithful client. You know, of course, what that good and most noble Philalethia brings forth in this age, what it usually carries with it. This man of ours has composed some dialogues, in which he somewhat freely and not without wit criticized the obstinacy and insolence of some, which immediately brought upon him both hatred and reproaches. It is amazing how he sinned here, what a great crime he committed, so that he could hardly be redeemed by the indulgence of the pope, that great lord. You will deign to treat the man as he deserves. Meanwhile, farewell with our Jesus forever, to whom you will diligently commend us. You finally, oh most pious man and our intimate, if we have done anything amiss, will correct it paternally. We are, as you know, sometimes incautious. Again, farewell together with your Penelope. With the swiftest pen. February 19. You will draw the rest more fully from the bearer of the note. Of your kindness, Vitus Sacellus, most devoted teacher of Chur.</p>
      <p>To the most renowned master Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and ever to be respected patron.</p>
