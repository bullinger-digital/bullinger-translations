      <p>Greetings. I received your letter written on July 24th.</p>
      <p>However, since these days I am suffering from a domestic and severe headache, I am writing nothing now except that I received your letter and thank you for your diligence. The Lord has removed the king by manifest judgment, who wanted to lay a heavy hand on the church of God. May the Lord grant that the counselors of Francis recognize this, to whom I wish all happiness.</p>
      <p>Commend me to Mr. Legate, the honorable councilors, Mr. Gallicius, Pontasella, and all good people. I ask you to diligently ensure that this is delivered by Mr. Friedrich, who ordered it to be sent to Samaden, where he is now.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 27, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, announcer of Christ in Chur of the Rhaetians, his compatriot and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
