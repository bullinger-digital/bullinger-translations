      <p>Greetings. After I recently began to write to you and mentioned in passing that I feared the devil might stir up some tragedy, it seemed appropriate to explain more openly to you now, but in a whisper, as they say, lest it be a detriment to you, to me, and to the one who informed me, who also forbade me to tell anyone. And I truly think it is in your interest to know openly what some are secretly doing with your writings, with what zeal or intent, God knows. I, led by the precedent of your writings, which have been received and approved without any doubt among us, did not think it necessary to present what you annotated on the Apocalypse to our censors for reading, but began to print freely without anyone asking, and to proceed as much as was allowed. But (now listen, but listen alone, for do not let it be told to anyone else), while I was proceeding thus securely, Sulcerus came upon me (I will speak freely, openly, and truly about what happened) and said that he had dined with your consul Habio, who was recently with us, and among other things, he asked him what was being printed in Basel. When he responded that he was unaware, he added that Bullinger's sermons on the Apocalypse were being printed here; that they had been offered to the magistrate of Zürich, but it was not permitted for them to be printed in Zürich; the same was attempted in Bern, but was rejected, and he wondered if it was allowed here in Basel. Thereupon, he responded that he did not know if anything like that was permitted; for he was unaware, except that he had understood somewhere that they would soon be committed to the press with us. So, after the end of that conversation, Sulcerus suddenly flew to me and recounted everything I have now explained, meanwhile advising that before I proceed, I should present both what remains to be printed and what has already been printed to Mr. Wolfgang for inspection. I comply with the friendly advice. Wolfgang refuses; for it is no longer his duty, but he orders me to present it to Borrhaus. I approach him, who at first affirms that he entirely agrees with us, urging me to proceed at my own risk, and it does not seem necessary to him that it be inspected by anyone. I, to satisfy Sulcerus's advice, entirely beg him to rather order me to proceed after inspection, adding moreover that if he finds anything offensive in the already printed sheets, I would willingly reprint it at my own expense, provided he first advises me of the changes. Finally, Borrhaus agrees to inspect it. The next day he returns to me and says that Sulcerus should not be neglected in this matter; therefore, he has handed everything over to Sulcerus for inspection and has thus deemed it worthwhile. Meanwhile, I proceed with good hope, easily completing the second part before Sulcerus goes through the rest. What will happen, the Lord knows. But I could not help but be moved at first when he recounted to me the conversation of that concerned fellow countryman (whom I mentioned above), and I think it is very much in your interest to understand how people (about whom you perhaps suspect nothing but good) feel about you or your works. If I fear wrongly, I ask you to attribute it to my love for you and my eagerness to gratify you, and do not disclose it to Sulcerus or anyone else, lest I begin to suffer from the accusation of either levity or not faithfully keeping the secret entrusted to me by Sulcerus, who could greatly hinder our efforts if he wished. You will easily judge from there what you should write to either Sulcerus or Borrhaus on occasion, and it would seem entirely worthwhile to me that you write to Sulcerus in passing that you have given your Apocalypse to me to be printed and ask him to inspect certain things at his leisure, and if anything might displease him or anyone else, you wish to be advised in time, lest it be a detriment to you, the printer, or the republic, etc., or something like that, and entirely conceal this whole story I have now recounted, and also instruct me later on what needs to be done on occasion. Meanwhile, I do not cease and proceed as much as is allowed for the time being, and I hope the Lord will not fail our endeavor. I am now sending again a quire h; today I sent f and g through a certain person from Strasbourg. Write back whether you have received these letters and immediately consign them to Vulcan after reading; for trust is safe nowhere.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, Basel, May 30, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his especially esteemed friend.</p>
