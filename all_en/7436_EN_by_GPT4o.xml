      <p>S. D. The rumor of peace in France, and indeed a good one, is being confirmed more and more. This week, the syndics and senate of Geneva write about this matter to the most honorable senate of Zurich, today they send a messenger, and the Bernese announce the same; at eleven before noon, friends from Augsburg write the same, affirming that they have received this information by post from Antwerp. If, therefore, peace has been made, which I am beginning to believe, eternal thanks must be given to God, who has dispersed so many cruel and savage plots. May we be grateful to our God and live a holy life! I do not remember receiving those letters, perhaps due to a lapse in memory, about which you write. Various and many things are being announced at the same time, about which, when I have more certain information, I will write, that is, after the Easter holidays, when our Froschauer returns from Frankfurt, laden with letters from friends in the Palatinate, Hesse, Saxony, Prussia, England, Poland, etc.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell, my dearest brother. May the Lord bless you, grant you a good Passion Week, and a joyful Easter!</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 9, 1568.</p>
      <p>Greet the consuls, Gantner, Pontisella, etc. Most swiftly.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
