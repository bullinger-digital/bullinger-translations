      <p>Greetings in Christ. Reverend father in Christ, the letters of your reverence were most pleasing to me, in which, although I am unworthy, you offer me your friendship, which I have often desired but never dared to seek, and nothing could ever happen to me more acceptable or pleasing than this. I will strive diligently so that your reverence may never be ashamed or regret the friendship contracted with me. Although I have never seen your reverence, from your most praiseworthy writings, which are diligently handled by all the faithful, of which I have not a few, you have been most well-known to me for many years, whom I have always regarded and admired as a chosen instrument of God because of your singular gifts. May God, the best and greatest, preserve, protect, and defend your reverence not only in this current year but also in many following years for the glory of His name and the salvation of the afflicted church. I have served Christ in the ministry for 14 years, nine in Ungerhausen with the Vehlin family, patricians of Augsburg, and five in Memmingen at Woringen, where before me pious and learned men, Mr. Leonhard Rivulus, father of Johannes, and Bartholomäus Bertlinus, who was then called to Memmingen and ruled the church with great praise and there ended his life in Christ in the very confession which we profess concerning the Holy Supper. I have been a lover and devotee of public peace and tranquility throughout my life, and I have never offended any of my fellow brothers, as far as I know, which they will testify about me, although now they greatly avoid and shun me.</p>
      <p>I was expelled by the people of Memmingen for no other reason than that I refused to subscribe to that insidious confession, which was fabricated not for the peace of the church as was pretended, but for the oppression of truth and myself.</p>
      <p>They suspected me of being infected with Zwinglianism because I was more familiar with Mr. Rivulus, my neighbor, and Victor, who had gone to the Palatinate, because I sometimes opposed those who attacked Zwingli more coldly, and because shortly before in a public assembly I had protested that I had never condemned Zwingli nor would ever condemn him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a confession was drawn up that was entirely dissimilar to the one they had presented to Emperor Charles at the Diet of Augsburg, in which the monstrous doctrine of ubiquity, the real communication of idioms, the bodily and oral eating of the body and blood of Christ were confirmed, and the sacramentarians, as they contemptuously call us, were expressly condemned in antithesis. Since I could neither approve nor wish to approve these things, having presented my reasons to the most honorable senate, I was deprived of my position and expelled with my pregnant wife and five children. I do not accuse the pious senate, who did not understand the intrigues and in that whole action showed by not obscure signs that they dismissed me unwillingly, as indeed many faithful were greatly offended by this unheard-of act in Memmingen. I had indeed decided to go to the Palatinate; but the Lord drew me here. For on that very day, the position in Grönenbach was offered to me by Rivulus, which I accepted unwillingly; for I feared that I might be imposing a heavier burden on myself than my shoulders could bear; for I did not want to give my adversaries a handle for slandering that everything was done by me and Rivulus by prearrangement and that I opposed them not out of love for the truth but for a better position. But I could not resist such esteemed men, who, having presented the most serious reasons, urged me so much to accept it. I know that I am not equal to Mr. Rivulus in authority, knowledge, or teaching success, but I am consoled by the fact that the Lord also wants to work the salvation of the elect through weak vessels; may He make it so that I do not run in vain.</p>
      <p>I desire to change nothing in the church, either in doctrine or in ceremonies; I know and have experienced how much the weak are offended by untimely changes. Pray for this our little assembly, that the Lord may graciously protect and defend it in these whirlwinds of the world and the furies of enemies who attack us from all sides. For those who ought to defend and protect us in this vicinity are more hostile to us than the papists themselves.</p>
      <p>The day of the Lord is at hand, Satan rages, the world rages, everything hastens to destruction; may the Lord deliver us from all evil by His coming. Your little book, which I had previously seen and read, communicated to me by Rivulus, was pleasing to me, for which I give your reverence the greatest thanks; I will make an effort to repay it on some occasion.</p>
      <p>My lord could not write back to your reverence at this time; for he is away from home on account of a very difficult and odious business, which he has had with a relative for a long time, which now, as we hope, will be settled; however, he instructed me to greet your excellency most warmly in his name. My colleague Johannes Eccelius also greets your reverence. Give my greetings to all the pious ministers of Christ in your church, my reverend fathers and brothers in Christ, especially to your son Heinrich, who studied with me in Wittenberg about sixteen years ago, along with the two Collin brothers, Rudolf and Theodor, and was familiarly known to me, as I visited him several times with Michael Lucius of Augsburg, now a minister at Kaufbeuren. May your reverence, together with your wife and entire family, fare well and happily.</p>
      <p>Given on the 19th of January, the day after that on which my wife, after a difficult childbirth, gave birth to a son, Philipp, at whose birth both the most pious matrons Magdalena and Ursula, my most esteemed ladies, were present. But both mother and son are in good health, to God the best be praise and glory and honor forever, amen. 1573.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your reverence, Georg Kugelmann, minister of the church in Grönenbach.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful Antistes of the church in Zürich, his reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>"The letters of Kugelmann of Grönenbach, January 19, 1573."</p>
