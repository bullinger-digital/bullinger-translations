      <p>Greetings in the Lord. May the Lord guide the hearts of the cities so that they approve nothing except what is in harmony with the pure word of the Lord. Various rumors are being spread about the introduction of the papist mass into our cities. There are various practices by the imperialists; but the Lord will undoubtedly scatter them if we truly repent. What is happening in Strasbourg, you will find in the enclosed note, and then what is happening in Saxony; I wish for these notes to be returned with your speech, which you delivered against the Interim, and if you have anything else that has been written against the Interim by others, I pray you will share it.</p>
      <p>Our senate read to us what it intends to propose to the pagans; we could not approve it. More on this matter another time.</p>
      <p>In haste, Basel, 1548, November 28th, during lunch. Please greet Theodor, Pellican, and Zwingli in my name.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>Bucer sends his greetings to you all in the Lord.</p>
      <p>It is said that von Rosenberg and von Heidegg are under imperial ban, likewise von Büchlingen, the count, was caught in adultery and shot.</p>
      <p>The emperor is said to be seriously ill, so much so that he must be bled; he has never been so dangerously ill. I heard this from a certain nobleman from Ensisheim, who came to us from Bühl.</p>
      <p>This letter belongs to the well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, to my gracious lord's hands. Zurich.</p>
