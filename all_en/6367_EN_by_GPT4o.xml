      <p>Greetings. When I learned from our Treschius that this courier would soon return to us, I could not refrain from sending something to you and first of all, I would ask you to inform me at the earliest opportunity whether our letters (I mean mine and those of Mr. von Stetten, to which some money was attached or enclosed) have been delivered to you, which I sent to Constance in December. I am surprised that there are so few who travel to you. For although we have quite a few here who go to Constance, I see that it usually takes a long time for them to reach you from there.</p>
      <p>But more on this another time.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us, except that a diet is said to be held here in May (though the sources are not very reliable) and that in the County of Oettingen, two preachers (one of whom I also know) were recently dismissed for attacking the doctrine of ubiquity.</p>
      <p>Thus, the evil of Brenz and Jakob Andreae (whom Count Ludwig used as a reformer of his churches last year) spreads through their work and diligence.</p>
      <p>But we will finally see that it is indeed true that truth can struggle, but it cannot be suppressed, no more than God himself, who is the truth itself.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue to pray for me, and give my regards to your family and to Mr. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, January 27, 1565.</p>
      <p>Matthias Schenck, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
