    <p xml:id="regest1">Has already written regarding [Hans] Vogler [the Younger] [Nr. 1484] and asks his father [Hans the Elder] to spare him difficulties due to the debts incurred by the son; the latter recognizes his mistakes, and his recklessness is hopefully still correctable. The news from the Imperial Diet [in Regensburg] shows that the monarchs only think of themselves: [King] Ferdinand calls for help against the Turks, and Emperor [Charles V] goes hunting - probably for new realms; may God put an end to such tyranny! Writes again about Vogler, because he came to him today a year ago. Greetings; suffers from dizziness like Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have written about Vogler, as you see. I beg the father not to impose on me, so that I do not have to quarrel with many creditors. The boy owes me for more than half a year of sustenance; for the rest, I lent about five florins.</p>
      <p>My wife has noted everything. The boy now restrains himself and, unless he were aware of his own frivolity, he would seem capable of applying his mind to learning. Therefore, I hope; he will consider his situation rightly in the future. There is no vice in him, as far as I know, except this certainly very dangerous lightness of mind, like the wind, which, I hope, can be corrected by the methods I have written.</p>
      <p>You have understood from the Imperial Diet what the monarchs are doing. In summary: Those who strive to care for the people redeemed by the blood of Christ, oh your faith, Jesus Christ, how few of us live! Everyone seeks their own interests. Ferdinand cries out for help against the Turks, the Emperor hunts - I believe for kingdoms. But I hope that soon the Lord will free the world from such horrendous tyranny.</p>
      <p>The reason I write again about Vogler is: Today marks a year since he came to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Christ, who keeps you. I have been suffering from dizziness, that is, your ailment, for about a month now. Greet everyone.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed friend.</p>
