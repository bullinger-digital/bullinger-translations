      <p>When I wanted to respond to your two letters written to me in France (most illustrious man), I found that I had left them in Solothurn.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I wanted to write here in passing, so that you understand that they were safely delivered to me, for which I give thanks, and indeed they were the reason for hastening my return to the Swiss; otherwise, it was safer to stay in France due to my health being more afflicted than usual, so much so that the doctors doubted the health of my body for several days, and I have not yet recovered from that illness. I am indeed suffering from a great weakness of the stomach, which can in no way digest, all appetite is lost, so that I use meat with great difficulty; phlegm torments me in a remarkable way, and I have come to the point that I cannot bear the air of your region without great discomfort. This was the reason that I am thinking of leaving the assembly tomorrow, to take care of my health; otherwise, I would have waited for the end of it. If I see that I do not recover in one or two months, I will be forced to ask for leave from the royal majesty. One thing also harmed me greatly, that this summer, in the absence of the royal majesty, almost the entire burden of the war to expel the enemy beyond the borders of France fell on me alone, not without great effort; for our fortified towns, which are adjacent to the enemy's borders, were everywhere threatened by the enemy, and if the Lord had not obscured their eyes, it would have been over for the three neighboring towns, which provided easy entry into France. For the Swiss would have had to die in the field or retreat into the nearest town from hunger, unless they preferred to throw themselves at the feet of the enemies and beg for miserable mercy. Meanwhile, the return of the royal majesty freed the country from fear, which, having recovered the town that the enemies had taken from us in Lorraine, wanted to advance further and occupied the town of Anullier in the Duchy of Luxembourg and the town called Ynoy, which was very fortified, but not without great slaughter, and the citizens were forced to surrender at the command of the royal majesty, who let the soldiers go naked, but kept the captains and nobles as captives, and certainly, if the Lord had wanted to preserve it, the town was impregnable. This night, through letters from the royal majesty, I understood the whole matter in order. I now come to the books that you sent to me when I was in France. I offered one to Margarete, the only sister of the king, which she accepted not without trepidation, asking me if there was anything in it that could harm her; for Castellanus, who while he lived was the bishop of Orléans, about whom you have heard much, under the pretext of the Latin language, which he taught the prince, so frightened her conscience that she hardly dares to touch the sacred books, as her household told me. Nevertheless, she gives you great thanks for the book and letters.</p>
      <p>Indeed, there was a senator present, not unlearned, who highly commended your letters, learning, and piety to her. As for the royal book, I did not send it, since you wrote that I should give it myself; but since I could not do that (for I did not see the king), I did not want to entrust such a matter to anyone. I wrote to the royal majesty that you had published the book "On Christian Perfection" and dedicated it to his name and that I would send it through my own messenger if he ordered; but he did not respond at all to my letters. Another opportunity will have to be sought, unless you prefer me to send it sooner, which I did not want to do without consulting you.</p>
      <p>Write in this matter or in others what you think I can do in your name. The privilege that I promised, I brought and gave to Mr. Gensner; he wanted to reimburse the expenses; but I did not want to accept anything, although such things are not easily granted.</p>
      <p>It is enough for me if you consider that small service towards you as pleasing; for I would like to declare the readiness of my mind in a more serious matter. I am setting out for Basel, from which I will not depart for two months, waiting for the Lord's good will, and if I learn anything worthy of knowledge or your genius, I will inform you. Meanwhile, I commend myself to your prayers and those of your church. Farewell. From the assembly in Baden, July 4, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Maurilius Musaeus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>"On July 4, 1552."</p>
