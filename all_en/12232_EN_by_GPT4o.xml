    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich is so impressed by Bullinger's friendly and pious response [not received] that he hardly dares to continue the correspondence with Bullinger, especially since he cannot respond appropriately due to lack of time, work overload, and his limited abilities. - He is ready to confirm or repeat what he has written about the [“True Confession”] to openly declare his faith to posterity. He thanks Bullinger for counting him among his own. - He completely agrees with the statements Bullinger formulated in his letter regarding the ecclesiastical and political state of the world. The Antichrist lures people with one hand and threatens with the other. Since the mysterious prophecies transmitted by God a thousand years ago are now mostly deciphered, Frölich is convinced that the Babylonian harlot [of Revelation] will soon be destroyed. - He would have liked to send Bullinger Bucer's [“A Christian Harmless Consideration”], but he does not have a copy at hand. The copies circulating in [Augsburg] come from Strasbourg. - Frölich is surprised that [Anton] Fugger is trying to win [Konrad] Gessner as an educator for his sons and nephews and hopes for great benefit from it. The nephews openly lean towards the [evangelical faith], so much so that there is even concern for them. They had [Ludwig] Carinus as a teacher, who probably promoted Gessner's appointment. - What Bullinger writes about Matthias Erb pleases Frölich. However, since the second mayor [Jakob Herbrot] is unapproachable due to illness and the matter [of appointing a preacher in the sense of Zurich to Augsburg] has not yet been presented to the council, Frölich cannot currently achieve anything concrete [regarding Erb's appointment]. However, he would advise Erb to undertake a trip to Augsburg on his own. Frölich would then take care of Erb and recommend him. If he pleases the people of Augsburg and is inclined to work there, appropriate employment conditions would be negotiated. If it does not come to that, Erb would be generously reimbursed for his travel expenses. If [Erb] does not like this plan, Bullinger should continue to give him hope and encourage him to wait until Frölich has negotiated with the mayors [Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot]. Frölich fears, however, that the people of Augsburg will hardly appoint anyone they have neither seen nor heard before. - He is pleased with the unanimity of the Confederates, especially if they have recognized that [the conflict with the Emperor] is not just a matter of religion, but also of the freedom of the [German Empire]. If the Helvetians felt themselves to be Germans just like the Swabians, the Meisseners, and the Saxons, they would finally resist [Charles V.] together. - Frölich hopes to visit Bullinger, [Kaspar] Megander, [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Konrad] Gessner, and the other brothers [in Zurich] after the deadly Diet [of Worms] concludes. - There are reports of a (doubted by Frölich) truce between the Emperor [Charles V.] and the King [Ferdinand I.] with [Sultan Suleiman I.], whose terms are shameful. Germany, already sufficiently betrayed, can only count on the Lord.</p>

      <p>Greetings. To respond to your letter, incomparable man, with the decorum and dignity it deserves, neither the lack of time, the burden of work, nor the smallness of my intellect allows me, for you have overwhelmed me with the offering of friendship and piety to such an extent that it is better to remain silent than to give you any response. Therefore, convince yourself that unless your remarkable learning, unless, I say, your heavenly grace and the resulting piety and humanity encouraged me and assured me that you would bear my simplicity with an even mind, I would immediately cease to correspond with you. But thanks be to our God, who has given the gift of tolerating the smallness of the humble to the more exalted minds.</p>
      <p>As for your letter, I want what I previously wrote about the Zurich Confession not only to be ratified but also repeated for the perpetual memory of posterity, so that, whether I must depart soon or after many years, the whole world can testify to my faith from it, and indeed not in darkness, but openly. Then I give you immortal thanks for counting me so piously and humanely among your own. I hope you will one day feel that you have gained not a light nor useless friend.</p>
      <p>The rest of your letter pertains to the common state of the Christian republic, and partly to the secular state, in which there is nothing with which I would disagree with you even in the slightest. The Antichrist shows bread with one hand and a stone with the other, clearly indicating that if we obey his commands, he will give us the treasures of the earth, but if not, the furnace of fire. However, God, the heavenly Father, has now so widely dispersed the hidden oracles delineated a thousand years ago that I firmly believe this Babylonian harlot will soon perish; in which I pray nothing happens except by the Lord's will.</p>
      <p>I would have liked you to see Bucer's concord and for that reason, I would have sent it to you if it had been at hand. But since I no longer have it and do not care much, I do not want to burden you with this bundle. These copies are found in Strasbourg. I am very surprised that Lord Fugger is summoning Gesner as a tutor for his sons and nephews. However, I congratulate us that this man seeks a teacher for his pledges among you. I wish Gesner would be granted to him!</p>
      <p>I would indeed hope for much benefit to arise from this. For the nephews of Fugger are otherwise naturally inclined to piety and declare themselves so openly that some fear they may incur danger for the sake of truth. These young men previously had John Carinus as a teacher, a man equally pious and learned. From this, I gather that by Carinus's counsel, Gesner is called to this office. May the Lord support him in this most honorable function. I wish that such a great man would benefit such great youths.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, what you wrote about Matthias Erb, the theologian, greatly delighted me, nor did I neglect to perform my duty in this matter. But since one of the consuls has not left his house due to illness these days, and nothing has been dealt with him, and the matter has not yet been brought before the council, I could not handle anything solid in this matter. However, I write to you on my behalf that it would greatly please me if Erb, as if by his own motion, would undertake a journey to us and introduce himself to me. Then I would be the one to provide him with the opportunity to speak and be heard. If he is then accepted by our people and it seems good to him to stay with us, we will negotiate fair conditions; if not, he will return to his own with a not ungenerous travel allowance. But if this plan displeases him (although I fear that no one is admitted among us unseen and unheard), I beg you to support and encourage the good man with good hope for a little while.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I will diligently pursue the matter with our consuls and will send you their opinion written with a personal messenger.</p>
      <p>I gladly hear of the unanimity of the Confederates, especially if they recognize that not only religion but also the freedom of the Germans is at stake; and since we are Germans, as much as the Swabians, Meisseners, and Saxons, we will finally be one heart, one hand.</p>
      <p>I will make an effort, once these deadly diets are concluded, to see my Bullinger, to see also Megander, Gwalther, Pellikan, Bibliander, Gesner, and the other brothers in the Lord, to whom I send many greetings from me.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new except the most shameful truces of the Emperor and the King with the Turk, whose terms I am ashamed to write. They are mere conspiracies against the Lord and against His Christ. Oh my Heinrich, how rare is piety on earth! Germany, betrayed three and four times, is still supported by the Lord of heaven. However, the truces, which almost everyone proclaims to be true and certain, are doubtful to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again. June 20, 1545, quickly and without rereading.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Georg Frölich, chief scribe of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>[To the Christian and] highly learned lord [Heinrich Bullinger], esteemed (Antistes) of the Christian [church in Zurich], my trusted [and especially dear lord] and friend.</p>
