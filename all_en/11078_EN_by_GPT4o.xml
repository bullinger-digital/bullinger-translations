      <p>My willing service, dearest Heinrich. I, along with mine, am still in good health. I hope the same for you. Otherwise, I have nothing special to write to you, except to fulfill my promise (I will always write, even if I only write "farewell").</p>
      <p>So know that in Cologne, things remain as they have always been. They still do not concern themselves with any change, whether in teaching or ceremonies. Greed still dominates everywhere. And although the gospel of Luther has been preached there, as some boast of it, without improvement of our sinful conduct, the fruit of the gospel is still very small.</p>
      <p>Consider this my childlike writing in good faith and do not forget our old friendship, but fulfill what I lack in writing, as the Almighty has granted and given you to accomplish.</p>
      <p>Herewith, I commend you to the Almighty. And if I knew of anything special here in the land that might be pleasing to you or your spouse, I would be mindful of it.</p>
      <p>Given in the year etc. 37, last day of August.</p>
      <p>Dietrich Bitter, your well-wisher.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, exceedingly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my beloved friend, to be delivered. To Zurich.</p>
