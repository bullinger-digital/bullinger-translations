      <p>S. D. I received your letters, dearest brother, and I thank you for them. From the recent letters written by the Bernese praetor to our consul in Cham, he sent others written on November 6th to the same person, which contain the following: Although it was truthfully written to my gracious lords and me that I sent to you on November 2nd, yet Lord Bellievre is not aware of these matters or that any battle has taken place to his knowledge. However, the prince has taken the city of AngoulÃªme. There is talk that the prince's forces have come together against the king's will, which, it is to be considered, will not happen without harm to the king, and the prince is now strong with 40,000 men.</p>
      <p>But Bellievre acknowledges that the queen in Spain is dead; likewise, there is talk that the king has released all his prisoners, but with the condition that they wage war against the Huguenots. Those who return from the Basel fairs say the queen of Spain is dead; the king is insane and deprived of reason. They do not know if there has been fighting either in France or in Belgium; but certainly, the Prince of Orange has crossed the Meuse and is pressing the Spaniards; on both sides, everything is being prepared for conflict. May the Lord be with us! This is what we have at present, to which is added that Angusola recently requested in our senate to be given soldiers, as others have granted him, like the 5 Cantons, since this is required by the hereditary pact of Burgundy.</p>
      <p>Regarding the hereditary pact, erbeinigung, nothing was answered to him now, but simply denied what he requested, and my lords let it remain that they forbade the mercenary service under the penalty of losing the fatherland. Thus, he soon departed, etc. In the 5 Cantons, there is great dissension among themselves, and there are major altercations. Angusola and Spanish money are the spark for the fire and destruction of Switzerland.</p>
      <p>The venal people will perish most miserably.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with us and the Lord be with you! November 12, 1568.</p>
      <p>Greet all of ours by name.</p>
      <p>Bullinger the elder, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, esteemed lord and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
