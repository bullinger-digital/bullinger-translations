    <p xml:id="regest1">Refers to Bucer's letter No. 176. Intends to approach RÃ¶ist in the same sense. Strasbourg is ready to help. Capito, however, advises that Zurich should behave differently than before towards Philip of Hesse. Criticizes Zurich's dismissive attitude towards the reformed regions. Recommends addressing a request for assistance directly to the political authorities of Strasbourg, without involving the clergy, and to do so as secretly as possible in consideration of the truce with the Emperor. The friendship with Bern and Basel must be restored.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Carefully consider Bucer's letters; he freely advises on matters that should be remembered. I have similarly addressed Royst, the consul, in such a way that it can be read to the treasurers. Furthermore, know that the hope we have given is not in vain. Then know that your magistrate, if he acts on his own, will obtain all that you have listed to us. But let it not be revealed that this hope was given through us. For they do not want to appear to us as having been explored. Nothing makes your assistance more sluggish than the fact that it seems to your greatest friends that you are more desperate than those who would accept what is offered. What did Hesse offer, what did he attempt for you, how coldly, not to say almost contemptuously, was he received! A completely different approach is needed if there is still a plan to assert oneself and one's own into safety. Reflect with yourself on what I said in person, with what freedom, and you will easily see that your safety is dear to us. Now receive what we desire in your letters. I would like these words to be omitted in the future: "I write in German so that you may show it to the pious, Christian lords who have previously urged you to write." For they do not want to appear to have discussed anything with us. They conduct the matter so secretly and stealthily. However, it would be better if the entire handling of such letters seemed to have originated with you without any admonition, for you and yours to expect everything from us and thus freely and simply write to us about your affairs, so that good men may become participants in them through us, with the addition of a request for protection against the impious force of the enemies. For whatever is done as if from friendly trust now wins hearts. This about your letters.</p>
      <p>Regarding the remaining cause, I will add. You should prepare your people against dangers with constant private admonition, especially with patience, the safest bulwark. Now others want to join you. You do not even endure to hear their consultation, then you descend into quarrels and sharp rebukes with friends in the presence of attacking enemies. Thus, the way is prepared for the Five Cantons to gain power. For, having conquered the faith of Christ in you piecemeal, they will strip you of your dominion. For if you begin to relapse into papal errors, nothing will be more contemptible than you to your own people, nor will Ursus leave his possession intact. This will be the just retribution for neglected Christian love. Finally, the robbers will be miserably plundered. Yet I predict better things: First, because you are courageously preparing to face these storms; then, because you acknowledge the deserved scourge; finally, because the fury of the enemies is increasing. For God willingly assists the oppressed against cruel violence. However, it is a small thing that you ask, namely that we write what hope we have for our own. That will be of great importance if your magistrate requests assistance from ours through appropriately written letters, unless you think we should do it. But it is not allowed, nor would it be accepted at all. Suspicion would arise that the preachers are colluding with empty letters, that your magistrate is not contemplating anything of this. For they have so often contemptuously rejected the offered assistance that now many have publicly abandoned the intention of helping, because they think the situation is more desperate than that you could accept assistance.</p>
      <p>Our princes and cities have peace with the Emperor. It is not permissible for them to publicly display efforts to help his enemies. For the Emperor's supporters consider you as enemies. But if you did not hesitate to ask, it is certain to us that you would receive what you asked for, provided it seemed likely that you were seriously asking and prudently considering, so that you would not rashly reject any assistance. Therefore, there are two things you must attempt: One, to bind the allied republics to you with much humanity, dissimulating the misfortune of the previous year, the other, to request assistance from us foreigners with an accurate narration of what the adversaries are plotting, what your will to resist is, what your spirit in religion is, what expectation you have towards us, indeed the whole essence of the cause will seem to us if your people will endure to write that they will restore friendship with the neighboring Bernese and Baslers to the best of their ability, nor will they be entirely unwilling to meet. You must be vigilant, my Bullinger, but in the fear of the Lord. Truth will one day emerge into the light even against the will of the enemies. I only pray to the Lord that he does not take away the public ministry of the word.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>January 14, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your V. Capito.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to be respected in the Lord.</p>
