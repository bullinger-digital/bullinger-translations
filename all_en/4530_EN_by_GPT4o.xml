      <p>Greetings. How much I would wish, reverend father in Christ, that you and all yours are in the best of health, but I hear otherwise from you, and not without particular distress; for private calamity adds to public difficulties. But since I know what resources you have equipped yourself with against all human misfortunes, I easily think that you also have a remedy ready for this case. It is the Lord who leads to the underworld and brings back.</p>
      <p>In previous months, something similar was announced about Calvin; but the Lord restored him, who is also able to raise the dead.</p>
      <p>As for me, I have long fortified myself against all these things; for nothing bad can happen to a Christian man, since even death itself, which is counted among the worst by men, is gain for him. I respond to your matters: I had written about eighteen hundred crowns per month, not, as you perhaps understood, about a larger number; however, I would not want the author to be exposed and I have already asked you more than once to destroy letters that could sometime be harmful to me. So I approached the author G[regorius] C[arlinus] again; he solemnly affirmed that he was not sufficiently certain about the author; but when he was recently dealing with the case of the Bishop of Constance in Baden, he heard this from his people, that is, from those who considered him one of their own from the papists, and these things were recited more than once at banquets, even in the presence of the dean of the chapter of Constance and the prefect in Keiserstuhl, and it was added that "that Bishop of Como, who distributes these things, is a cunning and industrious man and does not have very large revenues from his bishopric due to the proximity of the Archbishopric of Milan; therefore, the Pope, in order to be able to tempt those men more liberally, supplies these things." - I was not going to write anything more about our bishop until the matter was settled, partly because I did not want to trouble you in such great turmoil, partly because I understood that our plan was not entirely approved by you, as you perhaps gave more weight to some people, whose sincerity I preferred you to experience rather than betray to you. For what they themselves have done in the Glarus case, you have understood, I suppose.</p>
      <p>Now, because you are eager to know if I have anything, take it thus. I attempted, I confess, with a few other men, a difficult and arduous matter, the attempt of which I regret less and less by the day and hour, although the episcopals shouted that I wanted to exercise some kind of dominion and were in every way advising our people to shake off my yoke. But in vain; for we made moderate progress, and if we achieve nothing more, we have nevertheless thrown him into many straits, and if he had wanted to attempt anything in the Glarus case, we have hindered all his efforts. He rages in his fortress; there is not a day that he does not send his emissaries; those who visit him say he is wasting away. But since I know many secrets with my people, since his filthiness is such that even the walls could cry out, I used a certain circuit through his familiars to indicate to him to take care of himself and still resign and be the author so that everything may be turned to good use. But he rages more, although his disgrace is fouler than to be able or dare to try anything with anyone, etc. Enough for the understanding.</p>
      <p>Finally, after many things, our citizens also joined the Praegallians. However, they constructed articles, which I send here; for the matter was settled yesterday.</p>
      <p>Today these articles are proposed with the sworn, sealed articles letter to the community in the next 4 villages; but since most are papists, I do not hope much from them. Yet it must help: he has a messenger in those places, and as he rode out from here, he saw poor children in Trimmis, to whom the messenger filled their buckets with scraps; when he saw them, he ran to them, tore the buckets from their heads, and threw them to the pigs. Now is the time, it has not been until now.</p>
      <p>Let it go as it may: I know that I sleep more peacefully than he does. But if I had known what effort it would take to climb a decent mountain, I do not know what I would have done. So he and his lawyers alone can be valued, sitting in the councils is enough for the beginning; for with this many practices are broken for him, and he will no longer have so many who flatter him. For when his officials sat and the common offices in Valtellina were compared, he was able to influence the votes of one or the other, whom he favored, with his followers. Hence it happened that he was observed by many, although very sordid.</p>
      <p>There it counts: help me, so I help you. - What the Five Cantons of Lucerne have written, I indicated for this reason, that you may understand that they will not cultivate peace except most unwillingly. Now, since I have understood the response of our envoys in Baden, I have sufficiently noticed that it is not necessary for you to write to ours unless war is entirely to be feared. However, there are some in the Upper League as well as in the House of God who would gladly disturb everything, but they cannot. Among such is that Planta, the envoy, doctor.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is seriously to be dealt with the envoys and not too much trust to be placed in the 5 Cantons; for fear that if the Savoyard, having found an opportunity, should wage war on the Bernese, they too would seek an opportunity and say that the sheep disturbed the fountain. Since they have now written from the day of Lucerne to ours in the Upper League and among other things, they hope in God, one should not point them to the right, and asked ours to sit still, it is clear what they intend to do. Our consul in Baden almost the same as you, and among other things: "The 5 places see rough: they are annoyed that those from Zurich have so stately armed themselves" etc. Ours, who are destined for war councils, have not yet convened; therefore, if anything happens, announce it as soon as possible; for then it will be convened. Otherwise, not a single person is arming, which displeases many.</p>
      <p>So much for these things.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, November 3, 1560.</p>
      <p>You know the hand.</p>
