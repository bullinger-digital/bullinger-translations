      <p>May the almighty God grant us grace and peace through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and faithful brother, I want to inform you that a court day has been set for me on June 12, due to the actions of young Hans Wilhelm. Therefore, I urge and request you, as my faithful brother and dear sir, to support me, as you are already informed about my matters concerning young Hans Wilhelm. He, along with his supporters and followers, has slandered me in Zurich to such an extent that I am in great need of divine help and the counsel of faithful brothers. However, I am hopeful that the gracious God will recognize my innocence in this matter and will not allow me to be put to shame and disgrace in my office. The council should also consider what I was obliged to do for the sake of honor, oath, and office, etc. I also ask you to sincerely pray to the Lord God for me, that He may grant me wisdom and understanding, which even the gates of hell cannot withstand, etc.; may He protect us with His Holy Spirit at all times. Amen.</p>
      <p>Erasmus and Benedikt have been summoned regarding their matter now on Saturday to Schaffhausen before the council and citizens.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, my brother, all the people of Schaffhausen, both in the city and in the countryside, are for sale and ready for military service, and no one considers the sworn obedience, everyone disregards the decrees of the magistrates, wives along with their children lament the departure of their parents. This has been instigated by the French during their time in Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>Dated May 31, Laufen.</p>
      <p>Peter Schnyder, your faithful brother.</p>
      <p>To my especially trusted, dear sir and brother, Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, by hand.</p>
