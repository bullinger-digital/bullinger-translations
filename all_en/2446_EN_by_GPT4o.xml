      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, honorable compater, sent through Mr. Claudius Mey. Today, the deacons were gathered; however, I do not know what was decided. This messenger is immediately sent to Zurich.</p>
      <p>I was in Solothurn these days; for I was accompanying my mother. While passing through, I encountered the interpreter of the king's envoy, who is stationed there. He told the young man traveling with me (who is a relative of his) that it was written to his lord that the people of Zurich were armed against the people of the countryside. Although I know this to be false, I gather from it that they suspect something.</p>
      <p>Would that we were finally freed from those blasphemous conditions of peace!</p>
      <p>Regarding Calvin, I wrote seriously to Zebedee; I hope that we will settle this matter. I wish to see what he wrote against Westphal; the subscription will be difficult for us to obtain due to the various corrupt judgments of those judging; however, I do not know what will happen yet.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, the Lutherans are in great conflict with our people. The people of Ulm have driven out the Interimists along with the papists; Frecht hopes to return there. They would like to have ministers from the Swiss; but I fear that Frecht will dissuade them; for I seem to sense this.</p>
      <p>The wife of Johann Jakob Fugger has died; no papist funeral rites were celebrated for her; but as she departed in the true confession of faith, only Christian rites were performed for her.</p>
      <p>There is nothing else new. Emanuel Tremellius has written a catechism in the Hebrew language, which you will see shortly. All of ours greet you, and we also wish well-being for your entire family along with the brothers and fellow ministers, our esteemed lords. In Bern, on the first of November, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and compater.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
