      <p>I offer all my respects to your piety, as dutifully as I can, and with all my wishes, I desire grace, peace, and the most successful outcome from God the best and greatest, and Christ our prince.</p>
      <p>I received three of your letters, one dated the 5th of May, which was delivered to me in Strasbourg through the work of Mr. Miconius, another written by you on the 6th of June, which was brought to me on the first of July as I was recovering from illness; the last one was delivered to me by Mr. Johannes Brichmanus. All are full of duty, humanity, and singular benevolence, not only towards me but also towards my entire homeland, for which I give you immortal thanks and will strive not to be unworthy of such a great friend. Therefore, I ask you again and again to retain that paternal affection and care (I am pleased to acknowledge you as a most honorable parent and teacher) towards me perpetually. All your letters were very pleasing to me, but the last ones were the most gratifying; for they were offered to me at the table of that most holy prince of Cologne. There, your name was mentioned with great honor, and the prince himself reported that he had known you for a long time through the recommendation of Mr. Johannes a Lasco. And indeed, he speaks and thinks candidly about your church. Truly, the admirable gifts of the Holy Spirit have shone in this prince; for you should know that he bears the present condition with great modesty; he is so stripped of all good things that nothing more is counted to him. However, that modern rascal has stirred a very serious tragedy with the Cologne republic because of his ambitious inauguration, which not even that ambitious corpse could settle.</p>
      <p>I now return to your letters. Indeed, it is necessary for us to agree and establish sacredly that if I ever write to you about more serious matters, you should not easily share them with others, especially if you find them to be such that they require faith and silence. For I will not hesitate to write to you even about the most serious matters (which I can reveal with honor and will be retained by you). I stayed longer in Strasbourg than I had ever planned, and it did not happen by my will; for I was overwhelmed by such great affairs that I easily felt and recognized myself unequal to undertaking them. But the mandates had to be executed necessarily. A good part of the letters was brought to me by the Pole himself and others; I dispatched my own courier; thus, as the affairs demanded, you will soon learn from me, in the same city, I conducted not so much private as public affairs. I conferred five times with that most eloquent prince of the republic about the most serious matters with such constancy of mind and freedom of speech that I did not hesitate to accuse him, if not as the author, at least not as the last cause of this defection; but he began to deny it firmly and to deal with me familiarly, and I heard him accuse the faith of the Swiss in this part; for he explained that many embassies from your people were arrogantly rejected. But, hey, you, most honorable friend and patron, let these things remain between us, and if you have anything against it, oppose it. I have already received two very serious letters from the Archbishop of Canterbury, in his name I dealt with the ministers of that church, among whom, after the departure of Bucer, great dissensions and contentions arose, such alienation of minds, that unless they had been immediately settled, they would undoubtedly have caused great harm to the church. For a certain impious Beatus had indeed stirred up great disturbances; many of them refused to accept the discipline of the church, about which for seven years the greatest contention was conducted by good men. Which I judge to be absolutely necessary in the church; for the affairs of the church would not have come to this if discipline had been established. At least this has been achieved, most pious Bullinger: the obstinacy of Beatus has been diminished, the dissensions among them have been laid aside; they have now agreed on discipline among the ministers.</p>
      <p>Finally, with all zeal, I urged them to reconcile the article on the sacrament of the Eucharist with you. I wish that we may all finally feel the same, which would undoubtedly be of the greatest benefit to the church. It was pleasant for me to hear about your friendly meeting and conversation with Calvin and Farel; for I received from a great man there that Calvin was there and that you had met. When I reported this to the most holy old man, he was greatly rejoicing and giving thanks to God; for he is well instructed in this matter by Mr. a Lasco. I am very concerned that you did not say a single word about this matter. Therefore, for your benevolence, I would like you to write to me diligently about these matters. It would be very pleasing if you also sent me a written account. However, I do not doubt that by the kindness of God the best and greatest, Bucer will also join, who today affirms that he stands firm in his former opinion and often extolled that book of Zwingli's and Oecolampadius's letters with the highest praises in my presence. Indeed, whatever I can achieve by effort, industry, and labor, I will direct all my efforts to establish concord and unity at last, nor will I hesitate to expose my life to any dangers for this sole cause, provided we all feel and speak the same.</p>
      <p>The day after the Nones of June, I left Strasbourg and immediately experienced severe toothache. Moreover, alas, a very severe pain in my foot occurred, for the big toe of my right foot was in danger of amputation. This matter detained me for 16 days on the journey, and the toe cost me a great deal, for I spent almost the money I had already counted for you for that purpose, for I paid the doctors and surgeons about 17 crowns. When I first came to Mainz, I eagerly wanted to know what the archbishop had decided in his little assembly, and after many labors and expenses, we finally achieved it. What do you ask? Never have they played more licentiously, never more shamefully. They have clearly decreed everything against the divine oracles and ancient councils. Nor do they want to stand by the edict of that impious doctrine, but they have finally exposed their shamelessness there. Indeed, after reading that writing, I was not so much cast down as raised to the greatest hope. For I do not doubt that their empire is now tending towards destruction and decline, and therefore God allows them to fall so shamefully and to be so blindly impudent in such a light of truth, so that their impiety may finally be conspicuous to all. Now hear what happened. In my presence, a legate of the pestilence came to Mainz. He, in my sight, absolved three pastors (who worshiped their belly as a god) from the bond of marriage, but by what means? So that they might keep the same women as concubines.</p>
      <p>Behold, a new decree from the Roman and purple prostitute: "To avoid marriage, let each have his concubine." O lost and miserable thing! I would be ashamed to write these things if I had not been present.</p>
      <p>I came from Mainz to Cologne and did not find my servant, whom I had dispatched with letters and mandates from Strasbourg to Mr. Johannes a Lasco, whom I will see immediately. For I had instructed my servant to wait for me in Antwerp. Therefore, I will write to you in detail about Polish affairs and Mr. Johannes a Lasco. On the first of July in Mainz, I received many letters from various places. Mr. Balthasar Alterius also used very serious protests in his letters and asked me to come to him for a conversation, saying he wanted to deal with me about the most serious affairs of the church, and which could not be accomplished without me. I was very upset that the letters had not been returned to me sooner. I could not return so suddenly in any way.</p>
      <p>For I had not yet fully recovered, although there was no longer any danger from the toe. My money is also still in Antwerp, and moreover, serious affairs, which did not allow delay, reminded me of my duty. I further replied to Mr. Alterius with three letters, if he judged the matter to be so serious and my assistance necessarily required, that I would not want nor be able to fail in my duty to the church, to which I have wholly dedicated and devoted myself, and I asked him to appoint a place and time (for when I have completed my affairs in Antwerp and with Mr. Johannes a Lasco) I will come wherever he wishes, and I will do so by arranged horses. Indeed, no expenses or labors are spared by me, provided I can benefit the holy church with my service.</p>
      <p>In the same packet, your letters were included, through which I received a response to those which my Plancius took care of. I was very upset by that, for you write that you do not want to be a burden or trouble to me. But by God, let such words cease between us. For what could be more pleasing or delightful to me than to serve you and all yours with my labor, duty, substance, and finally my life? If only my mind were well known to you. Whatever burden Bullinger has ever imposed on me, whatever he has commanded, it will never be troublesome, never burdensome, nor finally ungrateful, indeed you will have done the most pleasing thing if you are willing to use my service familiarly. Indeed, I acknowledge that your benefits towards me have been so great that I feel completely unequal in returning thanks, yet I will not fail in my duty in this part as far as it can be done. It was very pleasing to hear about the marriage of your daughter with the son of that most holy man, I wish them a happy outcome and blessing from Christ the prince and greatest pontiff. The treaty and the conditions of the treaty, which you did not write, are entirely displeasing not only to me, who am the lowest of all, but especially to the most serious ones, if they have undertaken to maintain the seat of pestilence. I was very pleased to hear about the constancy of your mind. As for the causes of the princes, I thought it should be entirely deferred, but in the next letters, I will write to you in detail and diligently about everything. As for what you write, that I should appeal to my prince, that he should be willing to interpose himself as a mediator, although I do not think it is my duty, yet some of the leaders want to know certain things about these matters, and as I have heard, everything certain will be written to them.</p>
      <p>However, I think these tragedies have settled more deeply in the minds of the princes than they can be easily composed. England, however, is almost in arms.</p>
      <p>I would not value the town of Boulogne and some other things so highly. But about these things more freely, provided they remain between us. I only add that I greatly fear lest the Pole rashly moves arms.</p>
      <p>As for what you ask about the writing against the impious and in every way to be attacked doctrine, whether it is now completed: indeed it is being prepared and will soon be published; but I want you to know that many things have been added and illustrated. For we intend to publish such a book, in which both the impiety of the doctrine is proposed (which you have skillfully accomplished with your divine genius) and the insult of the author Charles against the greatest God and his oracles, and that he has openly declared himself a [griechisch] of Christ in that way. Finally, the patchers of his impiety will also be treated with dignity. Nothing at all will be taken away from your opinion; but when the work is completed, I will send it to you immediately. Plancius has pledged to be a faithful companion of my journey; I (as I hope) will wait for him in Antwerp. As for your book, which you are about to publish shortly, you ask for my opinion. I would like you to be persuaded of this, most holy Bullinger, that I was not moved by any ambition to write to you about this matter; but I wanted to express my incredible love for you more openly, that I greatly honored your church and that I acknowledged you as a most revered parent; I wanted these things to be known to others at some time.</p>
      <p>However, I entirely commit the present writing to your will; I advise in every way that if a more worthy person presents himself, you should dedicate it to him; but if you absolutely want to testify our friendship with this writing, do not overlook Johannes a Lasco, the illustrious baron, I earnestly ask you. I also pray and beseech that we do not use any ambitious titles between us; I will certainly never be ashamed of your friendship and piety, and I will also strive with all my might not to appear unworthy of you.</p>
      <p>I have decided to send you books, the works of Eusebius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus in Greek, Tertullian and Athanasius in Latin, and some others shortly; however, it might be convenient if I dispatch my servant. If you wish to send letters to me, which I strongly urge you to do frequently, you will arrange for them to be delivered to Münster; he will send them to Doctor Marbach in Strasbourg; from there, wherever I may be, they will be taken care of for me. You will expect from me shortly copious and serious letters; but let them be contained between us sacredly and safely. I pray to God the Father and Christ, the best and greatest prince, the eternal pontiff, that he may keep you safe and sound with us for as long as possible. I commend myself to the prayers of the holy church.</p>
      <p>Greetings in my name to all the saints, to the best father Pelican, to Theodor, and to your son-in-law Huldrych. I offer my respects to your most holy wife, a most excellent woman. If only you had entrusted your son to me; I would at least ensure that he was well instructed, and you would easily perceive my love for him. Forgive me for writing so tumultuously; for I was burdened with many occupations beyond my strength and was not free from great disturbance. Farewell again and again, most honorable father. After a few days in Antwerp.</p>
      <p>In Cologne, on the 17th of the calends of August 1549.</p>
      <p>Your servant Florian Susliga from Warsaw, a Pole, by my hand.</p>
      <p>I will take care to provide for you concerning the furs of our homeland through me; I will send them to you with the books.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful bishop of the church of Christ among the Zurichers, most revered lord and friend. To Zurich.</p>
