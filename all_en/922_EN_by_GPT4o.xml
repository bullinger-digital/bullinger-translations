      <p>Greetings. I should have responded to your letter, most distinguished man and highly esteemed in Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, long before now. I was strongly urged to do so not only by the usual duty among friends but also because your letter was most pleasant and accompanied by the delightful letters of other fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>However, when they were delivered, I was somewhat afflicted by poor health; and as soon as I recovered, I was almost overwhelmed by such a burden of affairs that I was not allowed to do what I most desired: I will briefly explain what these occupations were. Besides the daily interpretations of Paul, which almost entirely claim a man for themselves if he wishes to engage in them with dignity, a new burden has been added to this academy by the laws recently enacted by the royal majesty: it has been decreed that public theological disputations are to be held frequently, that is, every other week, in which I am instructed to both attend and preside.</p>
      <p>Then, in this royal college where I reside, theological disputations are held every week, which, since access to hear them is open to all, can be called public: and I am appointed as a judge for these as well as for others. Therefore, I must constantly wrestle with adversaries, and indeed very stubborn ones: which means that, whether I like it or not, I am often compelled to set aside other matters and devote all the time granted to me to the vocation to which I am bound. But I am certain that you will take this in good part and not interpret it negatively (such is your humanity) because you will perceive that it did not arise from contempt. I am glad that the letters I wrote were received by you with a cheerful and joyful spirit: and I do not give ordinary thanks for your prompt and eager offer of assistance, should you be able to help me in any way: may God reward such a spirit, as I embrace it with sincere love.</p>
      <p>Know that the matter of religion here is progressing, not indeed with the success and fervor I would wish, but still more than our sins deserve, and somewhat more successfully than I would have dared to promise myself four months ago. Certainly, there are many things that stand in our way, especially the abundance of adversaries, the scarcity of preachers, and the gross vices of those who profess the gospel; and furthermore, the human prudence of some, who judge that religion should indeed be reformed, but would like as little change as possible, because, being civil in mind and judgment, they think that great disturbances in the state would be harmful.</p>
      <p>But you yourself see that, since countless corruptions, infinite abuses, and immense superstitions have grown rampant in the church of Christ, it is impossible for a proper restoration to be achieved unless those things that have deviated into vice are recalled to their genuine origins, purest sources, and unadulterated principles.</p>
      <p>Satan cunningly attacks holy endeavors: for he would like, under this pretext, to leave as many remnants of the papacy as possible; partly so that people would not easily forget him, and partly so that a return to him would remain easier.</p>
      <p>But in turn, we draw no small consolation from the fact that we have a truly holy king, who burns with such zeal for piety: he is endowed with such learning in this age, and already speaks with such prudence and gravity, that he turns all who hear him to admiration and amazement: for this reason, God must be prayed to with the most earnest prayers, that he may preserve him for the kingdom and the church for a much longer time.</p>
      <p>There are also many heroes and nobles of the kingdom who are very well-disposed: and we have some bishops who are not the worst, among whom is the Archbishop of Canterbury as a standard-bearer.</p>
      <p>Then Hopper was added to their ranks, to the great joy of all good people; and as I hear, he has been given a not bad people. I hope to see him when he makes his journey to his bishopric; for if he travels to Gloucester, which is his church, he will pass through here: how he could be persuaded to become a bishop, I would relate in more detail, if I did not know for certain that he himself (such is his regard for you) will write everything most fully. There is also another good man, Michael Coverdale, who in previous years served as a pastor in Germany: he labors much in Devonshire both in preaching and interpreting the scriptures: I believe you know him well, as he will become the Bishop of Exeter; and nothing could be more advantageous and useful for the reformation of religion than if all of this kind are driven to the administration of the church. Master a Lasco has also come here, since his Friesland admitted the imperial Interim; and as I perceive, he will preside over the German church in London, which pleases me greatly: he is now staying with the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
      <p>You have now received an account of the state of our affairs in England, which this peace made with the King of the French somewhat improves, and which seems to be strengthening daily. Only some fear that a council of the pope, which they are beginning to boast about, may be celebrated to the ruin of the good: but if we are wise, we will cast such thoughts upon God. The sermons you published were useful admonitions at this time, which, as they were drawn from the midst of the holy scriptures, were both pleasing and, I hope, will be read not without fruit.</p>
      <p>I treat Johann von Ulm and Stumphius, whom you commended to me, with as much affection as I can, and they in turn honor and respect me: they often visit me, and if there is anything to be written or any other matter to be done on my behalf, they do not refuse to perform it, but do it with a willing and eager spirit: for which reason I owe them no small debt. But I hear that Stumphius has been reported to you, because, contrary to your laws, he receives some stipend from the English, which I do not know.</p>
      <p>But you should know for certain that this is false: he lived here for some time in our college, but on his own money: to prevent this from being a disadvantage to him in the future, and to abstain from any appearance of evil, he has left here and moved to a citizen bookseller in the town. Now, what remains, I implore your prayers and those of your people with as much urgency as I can, that the work of the Lord may progress in this kingdom, and that finally the hearts of the fathers may be turned to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers through our ministry: Oxford, the first of June, 1550.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, and love me (as you do). Yours sincerely, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>Please greet all good brothers in Christ there in my name, and especially Master Bibliander and Doctor Ghisner.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
