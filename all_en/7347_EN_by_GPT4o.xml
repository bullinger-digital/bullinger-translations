      <p>Greetings. Due to a lack of messengers and the frequency of holidays, I have been unable to respond to your last letter, most esteemed sir. Now, I hope our merchants will resume their journeys, having rested somewhat during these sacred holidays. Therefore, I will write in fragments what we have gathered from various rumors these days.</p>
      <p>Our captains assert that Mâcon has surrendered to the royal forces, and it is quite certain; however, disregarding the military law of war, everyone there was massacred, approximately 8000, while only 2000 of Condé's garrison were present, as was written above and before; it is believed that violence was indiscriminately inflicted on all, regardless of sex. Charles reported from the opposing Ramschwagians that 7000 other and new German cavalry, namely imperial ones, are ready for Condé's use, from which many infer a certain clandestine pact between Condé and the empire; three bishops, from Cologne, Mainz, and Trier, are sending 10,000 to the king; our envoy through the Diet reported that the Prince of Navarre is approaching with 10,000 cavalry and 3000 infantry for Condé. The envoy, distrusting I don't know whom, has either already departed or plans to leave every night, evidently warned by Mr. Bellievre. - You have surely heard from Mr. Zancho passing by what is happening in Italy. It is certain that many monk emissaries are wandering around Clavenna and Plurii and other neighboring places, hired and sent in the name and pay of the pope as spies and Corycaei, to explore everything and find out what the Rhaetians are planning regarding religion, and finally to approach different people one by one and gradually, by attempting partly by force, others by showing fear or rewards, to turn them away from the true religion. And if ever that Spanish, or rather nebulous, bloody inquisition was, now it is at its peak. For almost none of the merchants is it safe to travel to Milan (where those suspected are either killed with utmost cruelty or sentenced to the galleys or finally held in domestic chains, as nobles, most disgracefully). For immediately they are betrayed either by letters or by certain spies placed everywhere to the inquisitors and papal officials of that ilk, and finally reported to the pope under the name of Lutheranism.</p>
      <p>Recently, they also captured a certain Jacob from Seravalle, a Venetian by nationality, who had professed the gospel in Clavenna until now, while he was going to Italy for his business in Crema, a town of the Venetians, and with his hands tied behind his back as the leader of all scoundrels, they finally took him to Venice after many injuries they inflicted on him, and sentenced him to the galleys or, as many believe, threw him into the sea. The same slaughter is exercised in Bologna and indeed far more cruelly. The same death, equal chains, the same tortures await the highest and the lowest. Near Clavenna, a certain monk is active; he, trusting in the goodwill of the papist townspeople and the liberality of the pope, wrote treacherous letters, by which (having conspired with the nobler ones of that place) he would gain the power to rage against the preachers and supporters of the gospel. He wanted to take these to Rome, so that the pope might see the power made and lavishly pour out money, with which he might also corrupt the minds of many others and draw them to his wishes. But when the consul of that place refused to seal the letters, the matter was betrayed by the papist parish priest himself. The monk, having been imprisoned, escaped again with a fine of 200 crowns. But I think all this has been revealed to Mr. Zanchus; if he has forgotten, let him send the summary of the matter, as Mr. Hieronymus Turrianus, the preacher of Plurii, left it to me in Italian through Mr. Z[anchus], and the son of the consul Ambrosius translated it word for word into our language (I don't know how well).</p>
      <p>Mr. Vogler, who is pursuing a lawsuit against our mint officials, returned from Innsbruck (I don't know, however, if he came to you before) could hardly adequately describe the monstrous tyranny of the Jesuits. They killed the queen, Ferdinand's sister, by starvation, and canonizing her, they included her among the goddesses. Not long ago, they forced a certain honorable man to capital punishment under the pretext of the error of Anabaptism, although he was truly a Christian. It is asserted that the people of Carinthia, Carniola, Styria, and that region are so struck that they do not even think of resisting the Turkish terror; but they all intend to surrender, lest this enemy fury be annual and daily terrifying to them. Recently, Mr. Dietägius reported about the Turkish emperor that, contrary to custom, he competes with cups and gets drunk, and also grants and commands the use and cultivation to all his people. He boasted that much was gained for the Christian world from this; but I judged differently, since in this kind of contest the Turk is far surpassed by the Christians, etc.</p>
      <p>It remains for me to add the departure from this life of the abbot of Weingarten. Mr. Charles and Mr. Dietägius reported it as most certain from those who heard it from the abbot's steward; but I hardly dare to write, yet I preface it with honor. It is said that just before his death, a little kiss fell on the abbot's face, as sometimes happens; he turned to his attendants, who were watching over him, and said, it seemed to him as if a spider had crawled on his nose. The minister said: Gracious lord, your grace is in need. He replied: No, no, it seemed to me as if a spider had crawled on my face; take it away then; I can no longer bear it. They had to leave it on his face, as it was, and after a long struggle, they took a wet sponge to his face and nose and said: Now, gracious lord, your grace is clean. Soon he fought valiantly and said to everyone: Oh, I fear I must make a mess in hell or leave it in hell. Our people affirm this as very true. But may your reverence forgive me, who dares to write such things so shamelessly. Furthermore, as far as I know, there is nothing else, except that I sincerely congratulate you on this most pious consul; may the best and greatest God grant that you may sit together at the helm for as long as possible with great benefit to the country and the safety of all. Amen. Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>Quickly from Chur, December 29, 67. All those greeted send their regards to you.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zurich, his most faithfully honored lord. Zurich.</p>
