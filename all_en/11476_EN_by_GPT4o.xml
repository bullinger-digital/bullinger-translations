    <p xml:id="regest1">Requests the forwarding of a letter to Jakob Zorn. The council of Konstanz presents Z端rich with a previously unregulated marital legal issue for an opinion: A woman had relations with a man who was divorced because his wife had committed adultery with the former's husband. Due to the offensiveness of this particular case, some are inclined towards excessive strictness and question the remarriage of innocently divorced individuals; certainly, the Z端rich council will seek Bullinger's opinion on this. He will hear from another source about the testimony that Konstanz requests for Michael [Back].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I ask you to ensure that this letter, which I have written to Jakob Zorn of Konstanz, is delivered to him.</p>
      <p>Our council is writing to yours, seeking advice on the case of a woman who had relations with the husband of a woman who was divorced for committing adultery, and who is now pregnant by him. Initially, there is uncertainty about the penalty, as none has been established so far. The novelty of the case seems to provoke some to an excessive reaction against a vice that otherwise goes unpunished; furthermore, many are uncertain whether it is permissible for those whose spouses have been rightfully dismissed for a single act of adultery (since they are innocent and both parties are free to enter into marriage with others) to contemplate marriage. There do not seem to be any reasons (that would prevent this), but they claim it is a stumbling block and a matter of bad example. Your council will undoubtedly understand your opinion, which is why it pleased me to remind you of it.</p>
      <p>You will learn from others about the testimony we request from your people for the sake of Michael [Back]. Farewell, dearest Bullinger, with all your people.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, November 16, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of evangelical truth in Z端rich, his brother. Z端rich.</p>
