      <p>Greetings. That I so often, reverend father in Christ, impose my trifles on you, who are so busy, indeed makes me feel ashamed and embarrassed. But what else should I do, since your incredible kindness first imposed these rules of writing on me.</p>
      <p>Now, besides sending you empty words, I dare to further ask you with my prayers to send this my second letter to the illustrious man Mr. Martinengo; a great necessity compels me to do so. I hear that my response is there at the press; Martinengo sent me a sample of it, or what they call a proof; he asks that I entrust the task to certain men who will transport the copies from there to us. But I conveniently came across the Pellizarios, whom I have been serving for a long time; they affirm that Hieronimus Pellizarius, who is staying in Geneva, is planning to come to us within 14 days; if my letters are taken care of in time, he will not be unwilling to add the copies to his luggage.</p>
      <p>If I therefore overstep the bounds of modesty, necessity can excuse me to you. If only there were certain men who would deliver them promptly, about which I am nevertheless hopeful; for if they are sent to Bern, there will be no danger from there to Geneva. If Pellizarius, to whom the other Pellizarios write, takes on this task, it will free us from much trouble in the future. I read the rest of your writings most gladly.</p>
      <p>If Augustus is alive, I marvel at the audacity of men who are so fertile and ingenious in forging lies.</p>
      <p>I have known Lord de Bellieure as a prudent and learned man, and I also judge him to be upright and free from deceit.</p>
      <p>But I did not fear so much trouble from him as from the business itself, which is varied and complex. There is much unrest, and everyone tells me something, one means well, the other ill.</p>
      <p>But I was surprised that you attributed greetings to him in your letters to us, as he appears nowhere here; but perhaps he is on the way. I read the Glarus acts; Gregor Carlin brought them with him, who added that he had met you at home for the sake of greeting you. There is no plague in Chur, but it surrounds us on all sides; it has taken away three priests, each of whom was in charge of their churches.</p>
      <p>We also await what the Lord will decide about us. I am indeed glad that yours show themselves so fearless; I never doubted your constancy and fortitude.</p>
      <p>I pray to God to look upon us mercifully with His mercy. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, for a very long and happy time.</p>
      <p>Our lords, the consuls, wish you well.</p>
      <p>Georg Carlin also ordered me to send greetings. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, September 11, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>Today our lords received a letter from the government in Innsbruck; the messenger reports that the government has moved because of the plague that has broken out. Thus it seems that a general dying in the land will follow; with us, it is dying in the highest wilderness, where one has sometimes fled from death. To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
