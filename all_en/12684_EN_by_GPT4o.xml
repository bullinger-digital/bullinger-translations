    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Thomann is very pleased that the Zurich authorities are satisfied with his work. His wish is to continue to be of service and pleasing to God and his superiors! Should he make any mistakes, may Bullinger defend him [before the councilors], attribute the error to his ignorance, and then notify and admonish him. For his part, he will spare no effort. He is well aware that the Zurich council could have appointed a more experienced envoy [to the Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Since the [Schmalkaldic League] left Nördlingen, [Hartmann] von Hallwyl has never come to the camp. He is said to be in Göppingen. As soon as Thomann sees him, he will not deliver Bullinger's letter [not received] to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger surely learns the news that Thomann conveys to the Zurich councilors. If not, the latter will make the effort to notify Bullinger as well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [Sebastian] Schertlin thanks for the good wishes. He would like to meet Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] May God direct everything for the best.</p>

      <p>Revered, well-learned, especially gracious dear sir, I am always your willing servant. That my gracious lords are satisfied with my humble (insignificant, unimportant) work, to which I truly devote all diligence, pleases me greatly. May the Almighty grant me further grace, always according to His divine will, and also to please and serve you, my lords, in my actions and life. And I earnestly ask, if you hear or learn that I have not done something, whether small or large, as I should have, to defend me, attributing it to my ignorance (which, truly, would be the only reason), and then to inform and remind me of it. If God wills, no diligence, effort, or work shall be spared, although I would heartily suffer if my lords had appointed someone more knowledgeable here. Such, and also to offer you my loyalty, I am always willing to earn.</p>

      <p>Since the camp moved from Nördlingen, [Hartmann] von Hallwyl has never come here, but he is said to be in Göppingen. As soon as I see him, your letter will be given to him.</p>

      <p>Since I have no doubt that all the news I send to my lords is opened (revealed, communicated) to you, I refrain from writing it to you. Otherwise, if I learn that it is withheld from you, I would at no time need to write the news to you.</p>

      <p>Captain Schertlin, to whom I have spoken much good of you, responds with diligent thanks, saying he hears much honor and good of you. And he would gladly make your acquaintance.</p>

      <p>May the Almighty guide and direct the matter according to His honor. Given in the field camp near Giengen, Thursday, the 21st of October, in the year 1546. Your always willing Heinrich Thomann.</p>
      <p>To the revered, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Grossmünster in Zurich, my especially gracious, dear lord.</p>
