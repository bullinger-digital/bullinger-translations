    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] After Ruman and Johannes Haller were recalled by the Zurich councilors for their protection, the Augsburg council did not let them leave and asked them to await the response of the Zurich council to their request to keep them in Augsburg longer. Ruman perceives his recall as a special grace and favor from the Zurich council. He considers his transfer to another place of work [Zurzach], announced to him by Bullinger, as a calling from God. The presence of Ruman and Haller in Augsburg does not contribute to the improvement of the situation there, and besides, there are already too many preachers. Furthermore, the councilors openly admit that in the foreseeable future, the mass along with the priesthood could be reintroduced and a campaign against the Confederates could take place. Ruman and Haller are only being used to deceive the common people so that no uprising occurs. The two mayors, Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot, have even admitted that Ruman would be dispensable as long as Johannes Haller remains. However, he cannot advise the latter at all, as Haller is very much opposed by the Imperial side.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Therefore, he urgently asks the Zurich council to adhere to the recall. Although he has been obedient so far, he does not intend to stay in Augsburg, even if he will still await the response of the Zurich councilors out of respect for them. However, since the Augsburg mayors can do without him, he has already packed his belongings. These are already on their way home with his wife and child(ren). The Augsburgers are corrupt. Eloquence, interest income, and the maintenance of all sorts of vices are regarded as the Gospel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Ruman does not doubt that Bullinger will look into the matter, especially since the [Zurich council] could justify the recall with valid reasons. Greetings, also to the colleagues.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ. Amen. Dear lord and brother, Master Heinrich, as our gracious dear lords and fathers have called us back for our good (which I consider a special grace and favor from them, and, as you have written, that I am appointed to another place - I consider all this a true calling from God), the lords of Augsburg have not wanted to let us leave until they receive a response from our lords, and they ask that we be allowed to stay longer. However, since it is not necessary here and there are already too many preachers with us, and to speak freely, they cannot assure us that the mass along with the priests will not be reintroduced in a short time and that a campaign against the Confederates will not occur, but they only present us to the common people so that no unrest arises against them. Thus, we must be their cover against the community. Furthermore, both mayors have said that it does not matter much to them, they could do without me, that is, they could spare me, as long as Haller remains with them (which I cannot advise at all, as he has many objections from the Imperial side).</p>

      <p>Therefore, my heartfelt and friendly request and plea is that you ensure that we are allowed to remain by the recall! For I have been obedient, but I do not want to stay on my gracious lords' writing, although I will await the response from our lords. Meanwhile, I have packed all my things and prepared for the journey along with my wife and child, since they say they can do without me. Moreover, everything in Augsburg is corrupt with everyone, and the Gospel is the word and the interest and all vices are the treasure.</p>

      <p>Do this, as I trust you, for we would now have a justified reason before God and the world. Farewell. Greet all the brothers in my name. Given in Augsburg, 25th day of May, in the year 1547. Johannes Ruman, preacher in Augsburg, your always willing.</p>
      <p>To the most humane and pious Master Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Zurich church, his dearest brother.</p>
