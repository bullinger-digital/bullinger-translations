    <p xml:id="regest1">Regarding the Zurich students living with Myconius, he himself can provide better information. Lists the lectures offered in Basel. Only a single student from Zurich attends his own lecture; the others perhaps prefer self-study. Interruptions in the teaching operations are frequent among the medical faculty; he himself tries to compensate for the few absences. Others can report more about the day in Hagenau.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Most learned Bullinger, you encourage me to write to you about the studies of your boys who are now with Myconius and also about our public lectures. I would certainly do so gladly, if it were not either tedious to inquire too curiously into the neglect or diligence of others, I mean those whose care is entrusted to others, or if it were free for me, through private occupations, to inspect and observe what is being done by others. Therefore, I can more quickly and truly affirm that I am ignorant of which lectures they either attend or do not attend, than I can know. However, I think that Myconius, their host, by no means neglects them.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, certainly, there are quite a few public lectures: In dialectics, Hieronymus Rhetus lectures daily, in law Amerbachius, in Aristotelian philosophy Gemusaeus, in oratory or Cicero's speeches Affinius, in mathematics Vitus, in Hebrew Monsterus, in Greek myself, in theology Carolstadius and Grynaeus alternate weekly. I am silent about the lectures of the paedagogium, which I think least of all cease.</p>
      <p>Regarding my own, I can say that only one of your boys is present and accustomed to attend occasionally, and the author we are lecturing on is otherwise so easy that they can very easily grasp it through private study, nor do they seem to need another interpreter or the living voice of an explainer. Perhaps, however, they think they can make more progress at home through private studies, which has been the custom of almost all the Zurich students residing with us so far, than by listening to others. Whatever it is, I can neither certainly say nor, if I could, would I willingly thrust my sickle into another's harvest.</p>
      <p>Regarding the cessation of other professors, I can affirm nothing certain, except for the medical professors alone, who abstain from lectures so frequently, even though there are two of them, that nothing is more so. I have not ceased this whole year except at the time when I was with you, and now for eight days, while I had set out for Hagenau, for which neglect I am now continuing my lecture for the whole month, during which otherwise it was allowed to rest even by the privilege of the academy, namely because that heat can be less troublesome to us early in the morning.</p>
      <p>These are the things I had, most learned and kind Bullinger, to respond to your questions suddenly and too tumultuously. Therefore, consider rather my spirit as most devoted to you and all yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue to love me as you do.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 22, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus.</p>
      <p>You will understand better about the matters in Hagenau from Quirinus and the letters of friends; for I saw nothing that is worthy of narration.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest friend and brother.</p>
