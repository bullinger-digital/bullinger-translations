    <p xml:id="regest1">The question of publishing the Quran remains controversial in the council, as the representatives of the university could not reach an agreement; [Oswald] Myconius, Markus [Bertschi], [Martin Borrhaus], and Jakob Imeli have spoken in favor, [Bonifacius] Amerbach, Wolf[gang Wissenburg], Jakob [Truckenbrot], and [Sebastian] Münster against it; both parties are requested to present their position to the council in writing by Saturday [August 26]. Although the supportive stance of Luther, Philipp [Melanchthon], Bucer, and the Zurichers is already known, Oporin requests a formal letter from the church and possibly also from the council of Zurich; he will try to achieve a postponement of the negotiation to Monday. He forwards Bucer's judgment from his just-arrived letter; the opponents refer to edicts of Theodosius [II.] and other emperors, which is why the council harbors grave concerns.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The matter of the Quran's publication is more disturbed now than ever before. The senate hoped that something definite would be concluded by those most prudent men of the academy; but after seeing them disagree among themselves, with some deciding for us and others against us, and both sides firmly pressing their opinions, the senate itself is still very uncertain about what should be decided in such a difficult matter. Myconius, Markus, Cellarius, and Jakob Imelin, who is the deacon of Doctor Wolf, have entirely taken their stance for us; however, against us, Amerbach, Wolf, Jakob the preacher at St. Theodor, who is Amerbach's imitator, and Münster, that most shameless head, who does not hesitate to give his opinion against us in his own matter and one common with me, have opposed us most fiercely. They do not cease to break what was once established by clandestine counsels, and they have achieved so much that now even before the senate, those four who are on our side must respond again, where they will also present their arguments in writing. Therefore, unless the Lord turns some hearts, I see great danger looming for us. The day for presenting this to the senate and deciding on the whole matter has been set for the next Sabbath, and although it was announced to me a little late by friends, I could not omit to hire this courier at my own expense and explain the whole matter to you, and furthermore, I implore you, my dear Theodor, Bullinger, Bellicanus, that you send letters to our senate in the name of all of you, that is, your church, and advocate for this common cause, which is established for the glory of the Lord to expose that Mohammedan impiety, before our senate, otherwise it will be in grave danger. Although the leaders and primary bishops of the principal churches, Luther, Philipp, Bucer, and you, agree with us, yet somehow some are still carried away by their emotions, which undoubtedly can be addressed or satisfied even more if your letters written in the name of the church are also heard by the senate. For they have not moved the university more than if someone tried to push the Caucasus with a fist. I beseech you by the love of Christ and the glory of His name, do not abandon me in this matter, a pious and church-benefiting business. However, it might not hurt if letters from your senate also accompany, by which the wrong opinion conceived by some about this act concerning us is excused, and our senate is reminded not to persuade itself that what seems most useful to so many principal churches, Wittenberg, Strasbourg, Zurich, and also the principal ministers of the word among us, is displeasing. I can neither be longer nor should I; meanwhile, I will make an effort, if at least I can achieve that the decision is postponed to the next Monday, even if the opinions of those I mentioned must be presented by the Sabbath. May the Lord help, and He will reign forever, despite all the devils and their members.</p>
      <p>Farewell, brothers and most esteemed lords. Basel, August 24, 1542.</p>
      <p>I send here Bucer's opinion, which I copied from his letters just received today. The edicts of Theodosius and some other emperors are strongly emphasized by the adversaries; hence the magistrate fears the sky will fall if such a book, destined to be pestilential in all ways to the whole world, is brought to light.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus.</p>
