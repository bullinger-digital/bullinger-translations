    <p xml:id="regest1">If only it were possible to surpass Blarer in good deeds! Bullinger is pleased and thankful that letters and writings [the "True Confession" or the "Orthodox Confession of the Church of Zurich"] have reached the recipients. - He wished Musculus greater success [as a preacher in Donauwörth]; however, the world delights in ceremonies that obscure God's word. - Bullinger did not learn about [Johannes Marbach] from the unknown dean [Georg Denneler], but from a credible Swabian [Gervasius Schuler]. He does not doubt that Blarer will handle the matter in Isny well. - Greetings to [Konrad] Zwick and [Thomas Blarer]. - [Jakob] Metzler is an excellent young man and has not needed any admonition so far. - Bullinger has meanwhile heard another reason why the [Basel] council dismissed [Johannes] Gast: the Abbot of Murbach [Johann Rudolf Stör von Störenburg] is said to have been the godfather of Gast's daughter [Placidia II.]. - Blarer should not be ashamed of the [Zurichers] as long as they are not ashamed of the truth. Although they are slandered as sacramentarians, enthusiasts, and stubborn people, God and posterity will judge better. - Bullinger trusts [Heinrich von Ulm]. However, he has not disclosed to him all that he and Blarer [in May 1544] confidentially negotiated about [Konrad Zwick's military skills]. [Von Ulm] should continue to negotiate with the Confederates in this regard. - Blarer's remarks about the old drunken [Zurich] envoy [Andres Müller] deeply trouble Bullinger; he will take up the matter. - Greetings to the brothers in Isny. - Recently, a learned man from Mainz [...] arrived from Italy. He showed the writing [“De vita monachorum”] composed by [Lelio Capilupi] and printed in Venice. The [Zurichers] had the writing reprinted and enclose some copies. Gwalther has prefaced the print with an image of a Minotaur, which he soon wants to publish with a poem [“Minotaurus Romanus sive Antichristus”].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>If only it were possible to conquer with good deeds! I would consider this a remarkable victory. Now, with modest strength, I pursue a great matter; but even in great things, the will is enough. I am glad that my letters and booklets have been delivered to all those to whom I had intended them, and for this, I give you great thanks.</p>
      <p>I would have preferred that our dearest and most esteemed brother Musculus had placed his faithful ministry more successfully; however, he did what he could. The world delights in ceremonies, and these obscure the clarity and purity of God's word. You have satisfied me regarding the doctor from Isny. I would believe you, and rightly so, even without an oath. However, I have nothing from the deacon; he is not known to me, nor have I heard anything about him before receiving your letters. I received that information from Swabia, from a man of not fleeting faith; but it is necessary that this has been attributed to him beyond his merit. Since you are going there, we trust in your faith, piety, and prudence that you will handle all these matters correctly.</p>
      <p>Greet cousin Zwick and especially the honorable consul brother diligently. Metzler is an excellent young man, who has not needed an advisor so far; for he does what is proper of his own accord.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I hear another reason about Mr. Gast, why the council deprived him of his function. They say, I do not know how truly, that the Abbot of Murbach lifted a boy from the sacred font for him, etc. But I will write more certain things shortly.</p>
      <p>Do not be ashamed or embarrassed of us, as long as we are not ashamed of the truth. We are called sacramentarians, enthusiasts, and stubborn people. The Lord and posterity will judge more rightly. Let us adhere to the truth, conduct ourselves honorably, be religious and eager for the best things, so that we may please Him, to whom it is salutary to have pleased.</p>
      <p>I trust your brother-in-law with all good and consider him a faithful, honest man before God and the Confederates; but since you have dealt with me in secret and trust, I have not dared to open or say everything to him. However, I think it would be very good, useful, and fruitful if he took the matter in hand to negotiate with the Confederates; he might achieve something.</p>
      <p>May God grant that it serves to honor His name and is useful and honorable to us. What you noted about our envoy troubles me greatly because of the scandal. He is an old man, but foolish, otherwise not a bad man, but too addicted to drinking. However, I will ensure, as part of my duty, that what is proper is done, and I thank you for your faithfulness.</p>
      <p>When you come to Isny, commend me to friends and brothers. A learned man from Mainz came to us from Italy in recent days; he stayed with us for a few days and conversed familiarly with us. Among other things, he brought forth a Cento Vergilianus written by a certain Italian and printed in Venice. We have recalled this here to the anvil again. I am sending you some copies. Gwalther has prefixed it with a Minotaur, which he will soon publish illustrated with a poem. Farewell together with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 19, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, esteemed and very dear brother. Constance.</p>
