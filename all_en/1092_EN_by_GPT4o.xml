      <p>Greetings. This evening, my dearest brother in the Lord, I received from my dearest brother and co-brother, Mr. Haller, that you have written to Lord Treasurer Sulpicius Haller and to the leader Hagius about increasing my salary.</p>
      <p>For this kindness, which you have shown several times in this matter, I offer you the greatest thanks I can.</p>
      <p>I have dedicated my Psalter to this republic; when it is completed, there may be an opportunity to do something about this matter.</p>
      <p>My house has been afflicted by the plague for two weeks now. My wife Sara passed away in the Lord on the 20th of this month. Nicholas, my nephew from my brother, began to suffer from the plague on the fifteenth, but by the grace of the Lord, he recovered; similarly, Esther, who was struck by the plague on the morning of the 22nd and is still struggling with carbuncles, of which she has four on her left hip, is expected to recover by the grace of the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am sending here what was written to me by the Hungarians. Some friends from Augsburg asked me to publish it. The spread of the word of God is remarkable. May the Lord grant that we are not deprived of it. You know about the people of Magdeburg, how they are surrounded by a siege. The King of Poland sent in two cohorts of soldiers despite the siege; then the citizens broke into a certain monastery where the enemy captains were to feast and indulge themselves, and they killed them all. This was reported to me by Schertlin. Farewell very well, my dearest brother in the Lord. Greetings to all yours, and also to the lords and brothers Mr. Theodor, Pellican, and Gwalther. Bern, November 28, 1550.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musc[ulus], your brother in the Lord. To the excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the church in Zürich, his lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
