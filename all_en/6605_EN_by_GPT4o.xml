      <p>Greetings. I have not received any letters from you for a long time.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I have been informed from France that even the Sorbonne theologians, with the consent of the Pope and some bishops whom I know very well, are pretending to have some agreement with the Metusiasts (a group of reformers), in order to use these tactics to obtain the condemnation of the Zwinglians and Calvinists at the next assembly. Affairs at the court are in great disorder.</p>
      <p>The Cyclopes, who had already devoured their living brothers, upon realizing that neither courage nor strength was lacking in them, have reverted to their usual tactics, swearing that they will not allow the peace edict to be rescinded.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, impunity has been granted to the seditious, even those convicted and condemned of the most heinous crimes. However, some of our people who opposed them have been captured as if they were guilty, among whom is counted the father of those boys whom you had with you for some time, whom I ask you to commend to the Lord in your prayers.</p>
      <p>What our people will do in response to this, I still do not know. Condensis has married a very religious and highly reputable virgin, the sister of Heinrich, Duke of Longueville, who is also the Count of Neuch√¢tel. They say the Queen, having been troubled by a dream (for she is very studious of these arts), in which she seemed to be strangled by someone, has halted her journey and is taking care to fortify the Ambrosian citadel, where she will stay for a time with the King. Therefore, it is not unclear what is being prepared.</p>
      <p>As for what Mr. Ehem has written to me from Germany, you are not unaware, nor do I doubt that you have received letters from him on the same subject. All these things combined have so awakened us that both our senate and our assembly have judged it necessary to write to the Bernese brothers and also to you about this matter. Therefore, I beseech you, my father, to consider what needs to be done; for if we miss this opportunity with that most excellent prince, I do not know when we shall have another like it. Therefore, I beseech you again to take this matter seriously, if ever before, and always remember that the sole aim is to thwart their plans. Even if we seek a conference and indeed without any pretense (for all deceit is far from us), yet I do not see what the method of obtaining or executing it would be. But what prevents us from consulting our own interests by seeking what is fair? Therefore, I ask for the third time that something be decided here, if possible.</p>
      <p>The French churches will decide what needs to be done at the Lord's birth (Christmas), and, as I believe, will follow the proposed plan. However, my father, I am affected with incredible sorrow, having learned from rumor of the fall of Mr. Gualter, our dearest and most esteemed brother, and not I alone, but all my colleagues with me. Therefore, the one thing we can do for you is to offer prayers for you, which we also hope the Lord and most merciful Father will hear. I am also writing some things to him, but as those do who need consolation themselves, rather than being able to console others. May the Lord Jesus, whose judgments I see beginning with his own house, have mercy on us and at least bring it about that all things, as he promised, work together for our good.</p>
      <p>I also pray that he may preserve you and the other brothers and your entire church and bless your labors. Simonius Lucensis, a professor of philosophy with us, a man of great learning, responds to Steckius, so that Eserinus may be matched with Pacidianus.</p>
      <p>Geneva, December 14, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours, Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my most esteemed father. In Zurich.</p>
