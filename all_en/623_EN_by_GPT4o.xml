      <p>Greetings. Before I returned to the land of Zurich, I wrote this letter to you, which you now receive. Our friend Buttler and the treasurer from Neuburg were coming to us, to whom Conrad and I explained the arrival of the captains in the city; this was the reason why I held back this letter. However, with the growing rumor that King Ferdinand would soon come to the city, I wanted to recall the discarded letters to duty and send them to you in leisure.</p>
      <p>I believe it is important for the Swiss to carefully observe what the kings are doing or planning in these times. Regarding my affairs, I will soon speak to you in person. By divine will, I have brought my wife and children here safely, and they are quite content with the place. Therefore, I commend them to you and the other fathers. Tell Theodor that I received his letter about Phrygius from his brother. We soon learned from Conrad, our cousin, that he sent a reply to his wife; I therefore wish that it turns out well.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ.</p>
      <p>Kempten, August 8, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
