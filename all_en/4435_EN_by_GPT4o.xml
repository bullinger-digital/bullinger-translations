      <p>Greetings. I, my father, am suffering greatly; I feel incredible torments.</p>
      <p>It is colic pain; if greater inflammation occurs, it is over for me. I have served Christ, in whose presence I will soon appear to give an account of my duty. Concerning the bishop, there is nothing to fear; the greed of the evangelicals is so great that all their treacherous efforts must be countered. Everyone seeks their own.</p>
      <p>If God were to call me from this troubled life, do not be the author to send another from ZÃ¼rich; for to all the difficulties that my function has had, the ingratitude of these people is immense.</p>
      <p>You too take some care of my children, which I beg you by the immortal God; for I have not sought my own, but rather expended myself, so as not to give offense. I write this with a trembling hand.</p>
      <p>I pray to God to keep you safe for His church. Amen. Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>In one God my hope is firmly fixed, to whom I commend myself and all mine; but in the meantime, care is not lacking. We have a very skilled doctor; he counters obstructions and inflammations with enemas and says there is still some hope. But whatever it is, I am prepared, wherever God may call me.</p>
      <p>I do not want anything to be said yet to my father-in-law; if the illness worsens, tomorrow I will arrange everything concerning my wife and children.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed father.</p>
