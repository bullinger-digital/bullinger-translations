      <p>Just as you have worked, dear brothers, both voluntarily and at my urging, to properly establish the Polish church, I believe it is in your interest to know with what increases in piety the Lord enriches it daily, and with what ailments it struggles, so that you may assist it with your counsel and prayers. Thus far, despite the iniquity of the times, we have worked quite successfully in that small church by gradually removing wrongs and substituting better things. I mean this to be understood both in terms of doctrine and rituals.</p>
      <p>In ecclesiastical discipline, more is indeed required than is obtained.</p>
      <p>For it is exceedingly difficult to bring free people into order, especially those scattered here and there, as are the members of our church. Therefore, while true pastors still sweat profusely in this area, pray to the Lord that He may turn all His sheep to the obedience of that great shepherd, Jesus Christ, so that the Sarmatian (Polish) church may profess heavenly philosophy not only in word but also in pious and holy manners. Since this flock of ours is exposed to any snares of wolves, indeed to prey, for the sake of religious freedom, strive, most beloved brothers, to ask the Lord to keep this church of His, barely emerging from the ground, free and unharmed from false prophets. And above all, give thanks with us to the eternal Father through Christ, for He has deigned to defend our people from the pestilential doctrine of Stancarus. Stancarus, having returned here not long ago, revived the exploded heresy of Nestorius (which he also attempted in the March of Brandenburg and Prussia and recently in Transylvania), dividing the flesh of Christ from the Word in such a way that it had a place only in our reconciliation with the Father, thus establishing a mere man as our mediator and accusing all of Arian impiety who were unwilling to swear by his words, while he himself wishes to be counted among no assembly at all. The impiety of this man has grown so strong that a synod was convened to expel it, lest any scruple remain in the minds of the brothers. But so that you may know what his judgment is of all Christian churches, receive this infamous paper written by him and secretly examined among us, which, when he published it, some copies were burned, and some were also preserved to be sent to all of you. Although it may seem that this evil has been sufficiently countered, the poison of such an impious doctrine still clings to the marrow of some, so much so that the church has not won a bloodless victory. Therefore, you will place a happy and opportune effort both in this church and in the whole world if you publish a booklet explaining the cause of the mediator in detail. Meanwhile, (as I have already entreated you,) since you cannot yet help us with your presence due to the distances, assist us with your prayers and counsel, in which we trust there is much weight. May the Lord guide you with His spirit and preserve you unharmed for a long time to the glory of His name. Farewell, most beloved brothers.</p>
      <p>In Pinczów, where the Lord has appointed me as inspector of His church, although I am not yet completely freed from human bonds, it seems that little is lacking for us to achieve freedom, although no one is hostile. September 1, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Franciszek Lismanin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, the pastors of the holy church of God in Zürich, most esteemed brothers in Christ.</p>
