    <p xml:id="regest1">[Dating issues regarding the Lucerne tradition register:] In view of the dating [503] of the Lucerne document, the name Leodegar may have been added later; if not, the [document only] originated in the time of [King] Louis II, who succeeded his father Dagobert I and reigned for 16 or 17 years; according to [Hermannus] Contractus [of Reichenau], Dagobert [I] died around 658; thus, if the Wichard and Rupert mentioned in the document are relatives of this Louis, it may have been written in 663 (in the 5th year of Louis II), as it is suspected that [over time] 663 was mutilated to 563 and then to 503. Bullinger seeks Stumpf's opinion on this; he also wants to obtain the opinion of the provost [Jakob Buß] of Lucerne on this matter and ask him to verify the [copy of the document against the original]. [1st Attachment:] Copy [by Felix Frey] of the Lucerne tradition register, dated to the year 503 in the time of a King Louis and mentioning Saint Leodegar. According to [Frey], his copy goes back to another copy of an original [document] that is kept in the Benedictine monastery of Lucerne; it should be inquired whether the document is still preserved; if so, eyewitnesses should confirm this. [2nd Attachment:] [A.] The Martyrdom of Leodegar. According to [the chronicle] of Otto of Freising, Ebroin, appointed [as steward] by [Queen] Brunhilde, is responsible for Leodegar's martyrdom, and according to Hermannus Contractus, Brunhilde and her descendants were killed in 630 during the time of Sigibert [II.] (son of Theuderich [II.]) by Chlothar [II.]; accordingly, Leodegar's martyrdom must have taken place [earlier] around 615. [B.] Speculations [of Bullinger]. If the year 503 in the [Lucerne] document is correct, the Leodegar mentioned there can only be a namesake, unless the name [in the document] was added later; but if it is the Leodegar whose death is attested by Antoninus of Florence and Vincent of Beauvais, the dating [of the document] is incorrect. Furthermore, if one searches for [other kings named] Louis, one finds [the already mentioned] Louis II and a Louis III (successor of Theuderich II. [actually III.], Childerich II., Theuderich I. [actually III.], Chlothar III, and finally of Louis II.), who reigned around 690. [C.] The great age of the Zurich church. 1. If the number 503 is correct, the [Zurich church] is very old. 2. If not, its great age is evident from the document of Charlemagne; particularly famous places always go back to a martyr's grave; the [custom] of naming places after martyrs is very old (since 300 AD, a cult seems to have been established in connection with the remains of the martyrs - the end of the Christian church -, even if only by a few and mostly idolatrous persons). 3. The [document] of Charlemagne actually refers to earlier foundations. 4. There was [therefore] already a community before the establishment of the foundation by Charlemagne: [the document] of Charlemagne mentions [namely] tithe income, which is to be transferred from this [first] community to the brothers [of the new foundation]. The document of Charlemagne was written in 810.</p>

      <p>The year number in the Lucerne document aligns so precisely with the histories and times that it is quite possible Leodigarius was added later. If not, it seems to me entirely that it happened under Louis II, son of the great Dagobert. Dagobert died according to Contractus (whom I trust greatly in Frankish matters, as he lived in a Frankish foundation, St. Gallen, where they would have known the Frankish dealings well and recorded them accurately) in the year of our Lord 658. His son, the first among the negligent and dissolute kings, followed him and reigned for 17 or 16 years or so. It is quite possible that these cousins of King Louis were Wighardus and Rupertus, dukes of the Swabian soldiers, and that the foundation happened around the 5th year of Louis's reign, which is the year 663. It is also quite believable that the year number in the document was originally 663, which was then changed to 563, as how easily could it have been mistaken? 563, which he might have seen as 503.</p>
      <p>On this matter, I desire your opinion and what you have found. I want to write to the provost of Lucerne about our conjecture and request that he examine the original document.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given on October 24, 1544.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To D. Johannes Stumpf, his own. Stammen.</p>
      <p>In the foundation at the provostry of Zurich, the old great city: In the name of the Lord, etc. Let it be known to all nobles and commoners, both future and present, how I, Wichardus, and my brother Rupertus, duke of the soldiers of King Louis, who is related to us by blood, divided all our estates, which came to us from paternal inheritance, with his permission and assistance. Later, my brother, driven by the love of God and for the salvation of his soul, gave up all his part, which belonged to him, to his lord the king, with the condition that he would build a church in the castle of Zurich by the river Lindemach and establish the service of God there perpetually. Whereupon I, Wichardus, a priest, though unworthy, moved by deep desire, built a small hut in a place called Lucerne from antiquity, by the river called Rüsa, which flows from the top of the great lake, in honor of Saint Maurice and his companions and Saint Leodegar the martyr and all the saints. I gave all my possessions, starting from my estate Lunkhuft and all the surrounding places, with the king's permission, to that place and settled there for the service of God and gathered as many monks as I could. A certain noble and good man came to me, who, having renounced all worldly cares, whom I myself ordained as a monk there named Alwicus, so that I may bless him, a friend of God in all things, wise in the holy scriptures, who with his admonitions and salutary words turned the hearts of all the people of that region to the love of God. As the service of God grew day by day, I left Alwicus as my successor and rector of that place. These things were done in the time of King Louis (this king was previously called Clodoveus), in the year of our Lord 503, in the 13th indiction. This copy is written from the original letter, which is kept in Lucerne in the monastery of the lords or brothers of the order of Saint Benedict. It should be inquired in Lucerne whether those original letters still exist; if so, they should be exhibited and witnesses should be recorded who have seen them intact with seals, etc.</p>
      <p>The Passion of Leodegar.</p>
      <p>Ebroin, enticed by Brunhilde, renounced monastic life and, becoming the mayor of the palace, made the blessed Leodegar a martyr. However, Brunhilde, suffering the punishment for her crimes, was later torn apart by horses by King Lothar.</p>
      <p>This is from Otto of Freising, book 5, chapter 7. Hermannus Contractus, however, in his chronicles under the year of our Lord 630: Sigebert, he says, the king, son of Theuderich, was defeated in battle by King Lothar, and with his great-grandmother Brunhilde and the entire lineage, was slaughtered.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it seems the case of Leodegar was around the year of our Lord 615 or so. Conjectures.</p>
      <p>If the number of years in the document is not false (503), it is necessary either that there are several martyrs named Leodegar, or that the name Leodegar was added in later times. But if the name Leodegar is that of the one who was killed by Ebroin, whose eyes were gouged out, as Antoninus of Florence reports from Vincent's Speculum, part historical 2, title 13, chapter 6, §27, it is necessary that the number added is false.</p>
      <p>If you look at other Louis, who are also called Clodoveus, you find: Louis II, son of the great Dagobert, who reigned. Dagobert dies according to Contractus in the year 658. Louis reigns for 16 years.</p>
      <p>Louis III; reigned around the year of our Lord 690. For from the death of Louis II, 32 years are counted to the beginning of the reign of Louis III. - Lothar III succeeded Louis II, reigned 4. Theuderich I, 1. Childerich II, 12. Theuderich II, 14. Louis III, 4.</p>
      <p>The oldest of all is the church of Zurich. 1. If the number is not wrong 503, it appears very old. 2. If it is wrong, its great age is evident from the document of Charlemagne; always memorable famous places are said to be and are called from martyrs, etc. Therefore, from 300 years after the birth of Christ, it appears that faith lasted from the martyrs being killed - and there was a church of Christ -, although there were few, and more idolaters. 3. Charlemagne mentions predecessors who made endowments. 4. There was also a parish before Charlemagne established this college of canons.</p>
      <p>For in his document: he says, the tithe, which will come from the subordinate parish to the old church itself, I have proposed to be a perpetual investment for the brothers.</p>
      <p>The Carolingian document was given in the year 810.</p>
