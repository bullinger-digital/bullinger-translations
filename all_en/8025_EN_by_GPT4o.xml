      <p>From Innsbruck we hear that a prominent Jesuit was there, who converted to our faith, and has since left. However, it is not known whether he has escaped, as he is being pursued vigorously. In Bavaria, the prince has issued a strict mandate against those of our faith, ordering all believers to leave his land with their lives and goods within 14 days. If anyone lets the deadline pass, their possessions and goods shall fall to the treasury. In Munich, it is said that several hundred of them have been found. King Maximilian is said to have recently been at the Diet in Pressburg. The Hungarians and he do not get along well. Recently, several lords have fallen to the Voivode. Now he is said to have traveled to Breslau, where the King of Poland is also coming.</p>
      <p>He has married off two of Maximilian's sisters one after the other. What if he also tries for the youngest and third? These are the ways of princes. What good will come of it, we shall see. From England, the Bishop of London writes to me on August 13th, that things are peaceful and well in England in religion and politics. However, there is discord between the Queen and the Duke of Alba; for the Queen has received some money, three times a hundred thousand crowns, from the merchants of Genoa, which Alba would have liked to have, and since it was not given to him, he attacked the English. Therefore, the Queen has also captured all Spanish and Dutch ships; they no longer travel to Antwerp, but to Hamburg, etc. In Scotland, there is also similar good peace. The Queen is still imprisoned. Lord James Stuart, Earl of Moray, is the governor of the King (who is still a child), and all the princes and lords, even those who were with the Queen until now, have pledged allegiance to the governor. They are also of our religion.</p>
      <p>The King of Denmark and the King of Sweden are at war with each other again. The Duke of Alba tyrannizes in the Netherlands, which is hardly believable. The papists, having something to lose, are also fleeing; he leaves them without the form of proper judgment and then takes everything they leave behind. He wants to finish it completely. May God deliver his captives.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
