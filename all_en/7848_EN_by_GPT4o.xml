      <p>To your three letters, most distinguished man, I recently responded quickly and briefly indicated what the fear of men was. Now we hear that Duke Ludwig is also coming to the wedding, which will take place on the 25th of this month; for the Elector wants, as I hear, to recite his will to his sons. A fire that was recently kindled was extinguished without great harm, which all good people rightly wish from God to happen in other fires as well. From France, nothing certain, except that it is believed that the Count of Zweibrücken has joined his forces with Condé. Now two thousand more cavalry are passing through here to follow his footsteps.</p>
      <p>Philibert, Margrave of Baden, has been ordered to lead 1500 to the king, whom he is said to have barely been able to gather 600. An English envoy is present, who fears somewhat that a war might arise between the Spanish and the English because of the money intercepted by the queen. The total amounts to 100,000 English pounds, each of which is valued at four Philippics or 100 batzen.</p>
      <p>Our affairs are as they were before. I hear that in Geneva they are consulting on how to expel me from here. But unless the prince attempts something against the laws and statutes of our school more in the manner of a tyrant than a good prince, to which he is diligently urged by those who are here and there, they will attempt in vain. I certainly care little about what they do, attempt, and accomplish, as long as my conscience is kept safe and unharmed.</p>
      <p>Until now, they do not speak to me unless they are compelled to respond when greeted by me.</p>
      <p>I greet them more eagerly, seeing that I am less pleasing to them, so that they are compelled to speak to me even unwillingly. Certainly, my mind is as free towards them as it was before and, by God's grace, free from all hatred. It greatly troubles them that the younger princes abhor them in a remarkable way both because of their merits and their doctrine.</p>
      <p>I would not want to fall into their hands after the Elector's death if I were in their place.</p>
      <p>I wrote to Mr. Beza today and now send to you what I wrote. I want him to know that I am determined not to yield even a little to our people or to him and his, where they will not have the Scriptures clearly on their side and their opinion.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I will not stir anything, indeed I will not spread refutation rashly, but I will strive, as much as possible, for peace; for we are still in possession of not having this tyranny (although we have the tyrants themselves), from which if they want to drive us out, we will not fail in the duty of good and pious men in a holy and just matter. Beza will be displeased that we dare to contradict him; but we are also displeased that he wants to reign here just as he reigns in Geneva and in France.</p>
      <p>My book on predictive astrology has now been published through his efforts, but it is disgracefully stained in several places. If I can have copies today (the ships have not yet arrived), I will send them together, so that you may read and judge. I know that I have written in agreement with your expositions on Isaiah.</p>
      <p>Our Miscovius, recalled by his own, went to Poland eight days after he had returned, given the opportunity of other companions. He thought he would return after half a year. Our Gregory recently, while I was in Frankfurt, fell ill one day, so that he is said to have felt his paroxysm four times on the same day; now he seems to be well; he thinks the cause is the sordid and hardly credible depravity of courtly treatment or living. I think I will take him back to me; he is very good, pious, modest, serious, but too diligent. He who allows many things to be imposed on him at court, has many things imposed on him and then feels less gratitude from all others, who do either nothing or little. I wish his father well, an excellent man.</p>
      <p>"Keep this to yourself alone. I will tell the father when Bada returns." The young men now returning to you have lived very well and honestly and have been diligent; I hope they will be useful to the church and I wish many such for you and for us, unless perhaps there is something that I have not discovered. I had lived in fellowship with Mr. Simon Grynaeus, the son of Thomas, an excellent man. What more I should write now, I have nothing. After the wedding, I hope, I will have more; may God grant that they are good, as I somewhat hope; for I hear that certain wise men have been chosen for the council. May God, the best and greatest, bless you and all of you. Amen. April 13.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Thomas Erastus. To the most illustrious lord Heinrich Bullinger, primary minister of the church of Zürich, always to be honored as a father.</p>
