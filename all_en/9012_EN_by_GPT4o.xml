      <p>Highly and well-learned, honorable, dear sir, at this moment I have received the enclosed letter from my friendly lord and brother-in-law, the mayor of MÃ¼linen, who desires that the distressing news contained therein be shared with you, which would otherwise have happened without his command, had I heard it. Since the situation is thus, it is of utmost necessity to faithfully beseech Almighty God for grace and mercy, so that the wretched Satan does not rage so and does not disgracefully oppress us Christians.</p>
      <p>I have very useful news from the Netherlands, and I ask you, if you have anything regarding the defeat of Captain Zenly, to share it with me at your convenience.</p>
      <p>The bath here is the reason that I write briefly and poorly; I ask you to kindly understand everything in the best way, and hereby I commend myself faithfully to Almighty God.</p>
      <p>From Baden in Aargau, 4th of September 1572, 10 o'clock before noon. Your always willing servant, Johann Steiger.</p>
