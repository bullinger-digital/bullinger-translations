      <p>My willing service along with everything I am capable of, first and foremost.</p>
      <p>Especially gracious, dear lord and friend, I have understood your letter, recently sent on June 17, and I refer to the source of truth, that nothing could be dearer and more pleasant to me than a common, honorable, and well-ordered society, to which I could in no way be considered equal in terms of appearance and honor. However, the duty and obligation of my current office of leadership is such that I cannot turn to any particular party, especially not to a faction; for in such a case, I would stand under much suspicion and various considerations would follow; especially if it should happen that I would have to make a judgment in favor of my gracious lords of the seven orders (of which I am not yet fully aware). And you can well see that this matter is not to be settled between small and insignificant parties, but must and will be brought to an end between powerful and notable authorities, and it would be easier for me to judge between dukes and counts than between those people, any of whom I would most gladly avoid offending. Although the oath I have taken would well excuse me, so that no one should think that I am inclined to act otherwise than is fitting for an honorable man, you know that even those who act simply and justly cannot be free from suspicion. Therefore, it will truly be safest to ride next to Baden, where I, God willing, intend to appear in due time on Sunday. And if I can then arrange it with some justification, so that I have the opportunity, after the matters are completed, to turn to your honor, as my beloved and trusted friend, and to other gracious lords and friends, I will certainly not hesitate, but will visit Zurich with great desire. Thus, I wish to have promised myself to the college and other dear lords.</p>
      <p>I hereby send you back the letters of Lord Florian. Given in St. Gallen, on June 25, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Your willing Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most ample city of Zurich, most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
