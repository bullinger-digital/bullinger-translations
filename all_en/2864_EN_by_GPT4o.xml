      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Although I fear, most vigilant bishop, that I may seem to act foolishly by asking you, the most diligent shepherd of God's people, to counsel my troubled mother, yet partly relying on your kindness towards me and partly driven by the piety and respect owed to my mother, I have not hesitated to write these letters to you, though you are very busy. I ask you, please, to receive them kindly in your benevolence and not let them be in vain. I commend to you my mother, a matron, as you know, noble by birth, but most noble by her own virtues, who, as a widow, has always most diligently and faithfully instructed, admonished, and finally tried to compel her children to the love of God and every kind of virtue. I beseech you to console her, troubled by the affliction of illnesses that have long plagued her and by her unsuccessful efforts in raising her children, and to encourage her to patience. I ask you to show your good spirit and goodwill towards me in demonstrating piety and respect towards a parent. If you do this, and I do not doubt you will, no oblivion will ever erase the memory of your merits towards me. My mind is never at rest but is always troubled when it considers the immodesty of its youth and its disobedience towards its mother and other elders, or rather its parents, of whom you are the foremost. Therefore, I humbly beg and beseech you again to console my mother not only publicly but also privately and to admonish her to be fully persuaded that I follow her most faithful advice. For I see with my eyes as well as my mind that I can someday achieve advancements in fortune and dignity and, after this life, become a co-heir of eternal glory by living a pious, honest, and praiseworthy life. Now I commend and entrust my mother and myself entirely to you.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write except a few things about the state of religion. A certain cardinal sent by the pope arrived in recent months, bringing with him some monks, doctors of theology, with whom he will remain in Poland until the feast of Bartholomew, at which time a general synod of evangelical and papal priests of the entire dominion subject to the King of Poland will be held. In this synod, the king wants all religious controversies to be resolved and something certain to be concluded. The king refuses to resist the Lutherans, as they are called, by force, as the priests demanded, asserting that they should be refuted from the word of God and at the same time accusing the bishops of the immodesty of life by which they have offended the sheep of Christ. Several weeks ago, priests favoring the gospel of the princes convened and concluded which articles they wish to defend against the Roman church, as many most trustworthy citizens of Krakau have told me. Indeed, there are many here among the evangelicals who are truly Christian people and much holier in life than ours, but many, on the other hand, are far more luxurious than the papists. May God the Father of our Lord Jesus illuminate their minds with His Holy Spirit, who may lead them to modesty and temperance. Amen. A certain monk of the Franciscan order publicly preaches the sincere gospel, and no one has yet prohibited him. I wanted to write these brief things to you, occupied with many affairs; I ask you to take them kindly, and to have me and my endeavors commended to you and to deign to commend them to others. I also wish you to consider that all my labor, all my effort, care, and study are owed to you and your children. May you now with your wife and all your children fare excellently well. May God, the best and greatest, keep you safe for a long time for His church and the fatherland, amen. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given in Krakau on the 17th day of March in the year 1556. Your most devoted Anton Schneeberger.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and learned shepherd of God's people, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, to be revered as a lord and as a father. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
