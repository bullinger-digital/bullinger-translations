      <p>S. When I, dear sir and godfather, recently wrote to you briefly about the substance of the letter from Solothurn, the letter was sent to me by Lord Landscribe Elmer. I copied it quickly, and since I found no messenger without fear, I sent it here so that you can see it and make your considerations about it. God helps wonderfully those who hope in Him, against all human expectations; for even if this peace is of no use, He still gives those who have been distressed for a long time a little respite, so that they can recover and better provide themselves again with provisions and all kinds of ammunition. For it is worth considering, if they are prudent, they will not trust the king and certain courts. May God grant that it is a good and lasting peace. If he had kept the previous peace, he would not now have to confess through his writing that he had lost the best and foremost of his servants before La Rochelle; much sorrow and great misery would also have been spared. If you have obtained some foundation of the articles of peace, share it with us, and also if you have anything from the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Today, Captain Fridolin Schuler informed me that someone from Salis in the Grisons spoke with him, saying he knew well that the King of France and King Philip of Spain had reconciled and allied with each other, and they had made the Duke of Savoy the supreme general captain over their forces. But where they intend to use it, he could not say and said that the lords would not yet reveal this to everyone, and suggested he should ride with him to Turin; there he would help him with the Duke for a handsome gift and good position, etc. However, he declined politely and stated he would wait for his lords.</p>
      <p>Thus, the practices are wonderful, and one doubts what this peace will bring. May God turn everything to good.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Lord Landscribe Elmer, my wife, and all my people greet you.</p>
      <p>Given at Glarus on the 13th of August, in the year 1573. Your always willing Johannes Hugo of Glarus.</p>
      <p>Captain Schuler sends his greetings and friendly service to you with a request to inform us whether the King of Spain is said to be dead; for Vogt Hößlin informed him that a letter had come announcing his death. Also, if you have not heard whether Casimir has let his forces disperse again, as it is said he is in great preparation with cavalry and infantry; also, if you have not heard from the German princes and their diet, which they have in Saxony. He will also serve you later, where he can. He came to me just as I was about to close this letter, etc.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned, and faithful Lord M. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zurich, my dear lord and godfather, to answer.</p>
