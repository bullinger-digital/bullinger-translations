      <p>S. Honorable, well-learned lord and truly beloved brother, while this letter lingered here for a while in the Stork, it became known to me as a truly pious, godly man, who for the sake of the truth of Jesus Christ has given up the world, his fatherland, and great wealth and pleasures in this world, striving to keep Jesus Christ, as I have understood from other of our Genoese who settled here a year ago. His homeland is Rome, and he is of good nobility from Rome and still receives many writings daily urging him to return home.</p>
      <p>But praise be to the Lord God, who still today performs much greater wonders in many pious enlightened hearts than when he made the blind see and the dead live. He also shows us through such examples our great coldness, into which we have generally grown by our holy gospel, so that it would be no wonder if he took away from us this precious treasure entirely. I ask you to let him be encouraged and perhaps speak to him comfortingly.</p>
      <p>For he intends to remain with the Italian church with you. I do not doubt that our republic will have peace and the blessing of God for the sake of such foreign pious people. May God grant that my lords of Basel believe in the truth, to which I will not cease to exhort them earnestly. Regarding the matter of the Cappel War, I would indeed like to inform you of everything; however, it is no longer possible for me, except that Hans ZÃ¼ger, now my German house, has further informed me that I may well write to you that from the city and country on the mountain there remain no fewer than 60 men. Your protectors will also bring the matter to an end here today and, as I hear, bring the best home with honor and praise to Colmar. Now I ask you to advise me on a matter: Years ago, I solicited your lords and obtained a letter to the abbot of Petershausen and to those of Constance regarding my written claim, and after I obtained that from your lords, but nothing followed from the abbot's and the city's response, as was to be expected, my claim was brought to the common confederates by my lords of Basel, who also recognized my claim as legitimate and wrote to the chief and council of Constance about it.</p>
      <p>However, the chief and council wrote back to the common confederates, as I have copies of both writings at hand. The content of the letter from Constance is: they acknowledge that their ancestors granted me a claim on the monastery, to which they affixed their seal, they would also gladly allow me to be paid; but they also ask the confederates to deal with me so that they are at peace with me, since they no longer have the monastery and its rents and revenues in their hands, but that I should address the abbot about it, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have let the matter rest and have not pursued my lords of Basel further; for I feared not only to achieve little but also that they might take offense at me. Now, however, good lords and friends advise me to pursue the matter, especially since there is now another abbot, in case I might eventually come to some agreement, to which I would be inclined and take very little. But since the abbot has holdings under your lords' jurisdiction, it might easily come to pass if your lords would let me arrest him; then the matter would come to an agreement; I would not let it fall apart, no matter how little I would receive, just to rid myself of the unrest. Therefore, I ask you to advise me on what to do and how to proceed; for this, I ask you sincerely. Dated Basel, August 7 [...].</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, faithful overseer of the church of Zurich, his lord, both esteemed and most beloved. Zurich.</p>
