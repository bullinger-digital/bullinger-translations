      <p>Greetings. What my mind has long foreseen, alas, has come to pass today. Our Laurentius, to whom you will give full faith, will declare to you the lamentable event. I have given him testimonials to your magnificent magistrate, which you will undoubtedly see yourself.</p>
      <p>That excellent brother of ours will narrate my successes. I cannot say more due to my sorrow. Ensure that my letters are well kept with the senate, so that my candor does not lead me into danger.</p>
      <p>Farewell quickly from Schlachteck, August 21, 1556. Yours, Georg Frölich.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, a desired brother and friend.</p>
