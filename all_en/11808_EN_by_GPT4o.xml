    <p xml:id="regest1">Hopes for a speedy deliverance from earthly evils. Emperor [Charles V] is expected in Kempten; he is trying by all means to fight the French [Francis I] and [Duke William of] Jülich, but in doing so forgets the danger threatening from the Turks; Blarer strives to keep Bullinger informed. Has received [a part of] Bullinger's [John] commentary and was convinced of its quality in advance. Recommends Michael [Adam], whom he found exactly as Bullinger described, and hopes for his speedy return. Greetings. Bullinger can write back through the fellow brother Michael [Back?].</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Even I, my venerable Bullinger, if anything could be achieved by wishes, would wish for one thing from the Lord: that He would deliver me as soon as possible from this body and from the more than deplorable calamities of this world. For what is the point of staying here for a long time, not to say living, but dying six hundred times a day? I am not led to believe that the affairs of mortals have ever been in a worse state than now, just as the piety of the faithful has never been more conspicuous to all; we must strive with all our might that the Lord may count us among them.</p>
      <p>The Emperor [Charles V] was expected in Kempten in these last days; whether he has arrived there, we wish to learn from our people at any moment. He will experience the utmost against the French [Francis I] and [Duke William of] Jülich, equipped with more than the greatest force of gunpowder and military troops, while stubbornly ignoring the dangers threatening the Christian world from the Turks, which he bravely and with a lofty spirit despises in comparison to his private, as he thinks, injuries. May Christ have mercy on him and on us! I clearly see that there is no place left for remedy, after those who ought to heal Christians are killing Christians with such cruelty with their own sword, thirsting more for their blood than for that of the Turks. We must once put the cat in the bag; it is a long-standing matter; therefore, it is fitting to do so. Whatever I learn about the current pressures and storms of affairs, I will diligently ensure that you are informed, although I often miss the messengers.</p>
      <p>I have received your very splendid commentaries with reverence, being convinced that they will be no less learned and fruitful than all the previous ones, which not only I, who am nothing, but all the best and most learned people value highly. I would express my thanks more abundantly, if I had not already given you more than enough words. Would that the Lord would provide from somewhere, so that I could prove my gratitude to you in reality, which is my greatest wish.</p>
      <p>I commend to you Michael, whom I found exactly as you described to me. We have begun to love this good man very much here and hope for his return soon.</p>
      <p>Pray for us fervently. Commend us to the brothers, to whom convey much health in our words along with your whole household. All of ours greet you. Farewell, dearest brother of my heart.</p>
      <p>In Constance, July 10, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>Through Michael, our fellow brother, you may write back if you wish.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
