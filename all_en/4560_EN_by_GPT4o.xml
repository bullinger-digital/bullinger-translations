      <p>Greetings. I received your letter dated November 17, honorable lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>I shared it with Mr. Diesbach, our mutual friend; he says he received what you sent to him. Therefore, he thanks you and sends his regards in return."</p>
      <p>Nothing has been resolved in Neuchâtel.</p>
      <p>The duke has, through his envoys, of whom he sent two, very skilled, learned, and friendly men, presented his demands in the highest degree and requested restitution not only of the land but also of all interests, rents, revenues, whatever has been collected by my lords during this time, and also that all church properties, churches, and their ornaments be restored in every way as they were before. Furthermore (so that he forgets nothing), he has also demanded the tolls or taxes that were collected from the land in previous years, especially those imposed on the nobles. My lords have given them a brief reply, stating that if they do not propose other means, they will not negotiate with them but will let the matter be brought to the others who have a share in the land, such as Fribourg, Valais, Geneva, etc., and another day has been set for this, namely February 10. The duke's envoys have only noted that if the land is returned to the duke according to the aforementioned demand, he will graciously consider the cost that my lords have incurred to take the land. They have also requested from my lords that they be provided with copies of all judgments and proceedings that have previously occurred between the old duke, the common Confederates, and my lords, and to present and use everything that my lords rely on against the duke, so that they know how to respond. My lords have refused this and suggested that they have their scribes as well as my lords have theirs. Thus, they have parted ways (otherwise friendly).</p>
      <p>In addition, it is heard that the leaders of the Confederates are traveling to Vercelli to the duke. What good they have in mind, we know well; but no one dares to say.</p>
      <p>Many are also passing through here from the places in Jacob's clothing, as if they were going to S... but it is said they are going to the duke.</p>
      <p>As for how it went with the duke and the Waldensians or the believers in the Turin Valley in Piedmont, I assume you have good reports from elsewhere. He intended to attack and destroy them; they have reportedly inflicted losses on him with about 10 companies. It is also said that they have won again the second time.</p>
      <p>From France, we have nothing good, but rather the certainty that, as your writings from Navarre and his brother, the lord of Condé, say, God have mercy on his believers. It is said that they are thrown into the water with large stones and secretly drowned. Beza is said to have returned to Geneva: he is now a chancellor in France.</p>
      <p>With Geneva, my lords, by the grace of God, have been successful in almost all matters. They are supposed to let the judgment given in Basel stand, and my lords are supposed to lift their judgment given in Ternier. May God make everything right and may we mean well and stand faithfully with each other in these difficult times; for we are in need. Otherwise, I know nothing at the moment.</p>
      <p>My brother has diligently described the Glarus tumult to me; I have reported it to my lords, who are very shocked and amazed. The lords' treasurers, Haller, Dilger, Steiger, all greet you, as do Hagius and Vischer, Musculus, my father-in-law, and finally my mother. Send my greetings to all of yours in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, the last day of November 1560.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
