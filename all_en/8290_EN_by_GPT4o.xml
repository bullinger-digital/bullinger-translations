      <p>S. The reason I did not reply recently via the Zurich courier was that he returned from Fribourg and did not find me at home; for I had gone out to a certain village that day. Meanwhile, I received your other letter through Felix Lavater, whom I would have gladly kept with me, as you requested; but he reported upon his departure that you were not in the city, and that he had meanwhile found a horse and a certain merchant who would take him to Geneva. Therefore, he stayed here only one night. Nothing has happened here in the meantime that is singular or worthy of writing, except that four senators have died within two months, and those whom the plague, which raged here for three years, spared, so that not even one of their number perished, have now given from their number these four within a few days: German Gentsch, Adrian Baumgartner, Nicolaus Schorr, all old men, and now finally Philipp Kilchberger, the pandar, a relative of our Fellenberger. Within a few days, Johannes Rodolphus Hagenberg (the son of a minister; for his father was once a deacon here), whom I think you know, succeeded him in the tribunal, because not long ago he served as prefect in Lenzburg. Now he was prefect in Aarwangen. Another matter is that Nicolaus Wyerman, at whose wedding Mr. Zwingli once attended (for he has the daughter of the late Frisching of blessed memory), has been proclaimed from the city, as they call it, that is, he has been ordered to exile for 101 years due to a murder recklessly committed; he now resides in Muret. Thirdly, envoys have been sent to Cambrai to the Duke of Savoy to receive from him the oath and confirmation of the treaty; these envoys are: Mr. Consul von MÃ¼linen, the treasurer von Gravenriet, and from the dioceses Johannes von Wattenwyl and Johannes Jacob Delsperger.</p>
      <p>They set out with a great and almost excessively magnificent display and retinue. Meanwhile, the prince's envoys, Count Valangin and Lord de Montfort, came here with a large retinue themselves; they were splendidly received here. They were met with many horses, well adorned. The Bernese chains could be seen. And when they took the oath last Sunday, they fired with 32 large cannons all day long. A splendid banquet was held for them, and when they had completed their business, they addressed the council and citizens, as they had been instructed by their prince, to show his good and gracious will to your city of Bern and to maintain more friendship, to honor the societies with some gifts, and likewise some particular persons who had made great efforts in this peace negotiation, with the request that my lords would allow them this; they knew well their honorable statutes, and it was not done to break them, but solely for the sake of friendship. Thus, my lords thanked them in the name of their prince and informed them that the union was not made for the sake of goods or money, but for the sake of common peace, friendship, and love, and what was done was done out of good will and with the intention to uphold it faithfully, as they also expected from his princely grace.</p>
      <p>In addition, we have certain statutes that are sworn annually and have served us well so far; they intend to remain with them; they would not take it amiss, etc. With this, the statute was also read again before the citizens and confirmed anew. That is about the matters here.</p>
      <p>From France, no one can learn anything. The Lyon merchants say that nothing can be heard from the Confederates either, where they are. Some say the peace has been made; but it is not quite certain. It is said that there is a terrible misery in France on the streets with murder and robbery on both sides. No one is spared who does not travel with a retinue. It is said of the admiral that he is around Avignon and in the province and has a great following.</p>
      <p>Those from Lyon are very concerned about him. A very knowledgeable nobleman told me that there is a certain arrangement in Germany on his side, and they are only waiting for the Reichstag to pass; then an uprising will occur.</p>
      <p>From Italy, we have nothing further than what you also have. May the Lord send it all for good! My father-in-law, also my lord Steiger, and other good lords and friends, along with all mine, send you warm greetings. Greet yours for me as well. I am surprised that you are sending Lavater to Geneva; for the plague is spreading there to such an extent that my lords do not allow the envoys to ride through Geneva because of the duke; for he does not allow anyone from Geneva to enter Cambrai. I wanted to warn you of this; for you see what happened to Bibliander's son there.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 17, 1570.</p>
      <p>I ask that you also share this with my brother; I have hardly had time to write to him, your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my honorable lord and very dear compatriot.</p>
