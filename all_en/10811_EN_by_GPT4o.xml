      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>I give you many thanks for your letters, most esteemed brothers. For it has been enough for me in large part, indeed not only for me, but also for others equally desiring clarity with me. If I seem to have asked some rather foolish questions or read the articles too carelessly, you will grant pardon. I am glad that, through whatever foolishness, I have extracted from you a clearer interpretation of the articles. If there is anything that troubles me more in the future, I will freely indicate it. You will bear with me, I am sure, in your usual most humane manner.</p>
      <p>Now I have nothing, nor is there leisure to write more. The phlegm almost overwhelms me.</p>
      <p>Farewell then in Christ, always concerned for our church. Thomas, brother Konrad, and all the fellow ministers greet you most diligently.</p>
      <p>I am sending back your articles, from which ours differ in many places; but I have corrected them according to your example.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, March 24, 1536.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>I wish your wives and all your family to be well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed brothers in Christ, Heinrich Bullinger and Leo Jud.</p>
