    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Grynaeus does not read unbound books, neither of them has yet studied Bullinger's [„De origine erroris“]. Myconius wants to remain silent about the negotiations in Frankfurt and only mention that the Emperor, who is preparing for war against the English King [Henry VIII], is trying to prevent his admission into the [Schmalkaldic] League. The hostile attitude of the Imperial forces was also evident in an incident with followers of the Grand Master [Adrian von Croy] at St. Jakob an der Birs. It is unknown whether Mayor [Jakob Meyer] has advocated for [Diethelm] Keller as promised. Whether Grynaeus can accommodate Rudolf [Gwalther] is still unclear given the changed circumstances; Myconius has high hopes for Gwalther in the future.</p>

      <p>Greetings. We have not yet read your book because it is not yet bound, and Grynaeus does not have the habit of reading unbound books.</p>
      <p>Regarding the events in Frankfurt and what can be known, you will be sufficiently informed by the merchants, from whom we also expect more information. I will remain silent in general, saying only that the Emperor, if given the opportunity, will not omit anything that seems to pertain to the eradication of the Gospel of Christ. Hence, he seeks a beginning from the Englishman; here is the Turk, against whom such a great force of ships, arms, food, and men has been prepared so far. Therefore, he is entirely focused on deterring princes and cities from receiving him and some others, whom he wishes to see extinguished, into the league.</p>
      <p>He says he cannot concede anything beyond what was granted at the Nuremberg Diet. From these, he seeks, whatever they may ultimately contain, an occasion to prevent our people from supporting the king. In contrast, he promises himself certain victory and from this, which he had promised in his mind, after he had subdued the Frenchman. These are the arts of the most merciful, best, and most pious Emperor.</p>
      <p>In recent days, the commander of the Imperial guard passed with forty horses towards Lucerne. When some of his men came to the church of St. Jakob near the Birs, a toll was demanded; they, however, began to be indignant, to curse, and to reproach heresy, until a crowd gathered at the sound of the bell drove them away, yet without a penny being paid. Had this not happened, without a doubt some of our people would have perished. Such are the Imperial forces towards us; what then is the Emperor like?</p>
      <p>He is in league with the Pope, etc. I have dealt very diligently with the matter of Keller, and the mayor had promised well; I have not asked further whether anything has been written, trusting in the promise. You can know whether I have achieved anything.</p>
      <p>I reminded Grynaeus about Rudolf, but he did not respond. Perhaps he has changed his mind along with his wife, indeed with his circumstances: He could have used Rudolf if he had stayed with the Augustinians, and thus also much more easily supported him, as he now, being more concerned with his own peace and studies, neither needs the work of another nor can afford to support anyone with lighter expenses. But in any case, I have so far found him to be such that I do not yet believe the promises to be entirely empty. Rudolf conducts himself well, progresses daily; this makes him dear to everyone, especially to us. If the Lord preserves him, you will someday have an uncommon ornament.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 8, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his venerable lord in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
