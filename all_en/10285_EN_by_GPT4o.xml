In Strasbourg, they are dealing with the heretics. Melchior Hoffman is in prison. The reinstatement of the Duke of Württemberg is being pursued against Ferdinand's resistance.

      <p>Grace to the Lord, esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>We have learned about the proceedings at the Baden Diet, and I wish that the Zurichers had withdrawn from the council of those who, contrary to what they had previously decreed and to which they had given authority with sealed documents, passed judgment in the matter of Constance. I am glad that the Bernese were appalled by such impudence. I am saddened that the Zurichers were not as appalled, who ought to have detested it more. But this is how things stand now both in Bremgarten and in other common jurisdictions. Truly, it is not without some mystery of evil that your people so stubbornly abhor the company of their own, yet so impudently seek the favor of their enemies. Now I finally believe you. But all these things, as far as the cause of the church is concerned, do not dishearten us so much, as long as I see with what faith, what gravity, and what zeal you pursue the cause of Christ in the city and countryside. It is now the time to allow a little more to the wicked, who are reserved for their own punishment.</p>
      <p>We are unaware of the plans of our princes; are the cities inclined towards peace? We are dealing with heretics and traitors. For from among us come those who present the business of the church, but to their own great harm. This makes us more courageous in the Lord, as we recognize the ancient struggles of Christians. Hofmann, the old Montanist and Manichaean, is held in chains. Therefore, he boasts of the spirit and endures incredible abstinence. It is the energy of Satan to disturb the church of Christ. Our senate was previously led into leniency, which, when it believed it had adopted according to the will of Christ, now, taught by the matter itself, condemns it, but very late.</p>
      <p>Various plans are perhaps being devised for the reinstatement of Württemberg by those who perhaps wish not so much well for Württemberg as ill for Ferdinand. But nothing has yet revealed itself.</p>
      <p>That we visited you was a great benefit to us. For we found you to be such that we give immortal thanks to the Lord and have the best hopes for your affairs, although I frankly confess, just as you ministers of the word exceeded our expectations - although I always hoped for the best from you - both in the countryside and in the city, so in the council everything seemed below our opinion, and very much below. But things are well, as long as the salt is still intact. Therefore, we give immense thanks that you received us so and treated us kindly and with excessive reverence beyond our mediocrity.</p>
      <p>Farewell. The brothers, Capito and all the others, greet you. You should convey our most dutiful greetings to the entire choir of saints there, the lamb-like Leon, Erasmus, Engelhart, Bibliander, Carlstadt, and all the good men there.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, August 22.</p>
      <p>Your Bucer.</p>
      <p>My count commends himself to you and thanks you for your excessive kindness.</p>
      <p>To the most pious minister of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, esteemed brother.</p>
