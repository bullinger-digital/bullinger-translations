    <p xml:id="regest1">Thomas [Blarer] met Bucer at Ambrosius [Blarer] [in Tübingen]; Zwick will report on the outcome of the conversation after Thomas returns. He has not yet been able to copy Bucer's letter. He is satisfied with Bullinger's and Pellikan's opinions [for Chelius]. He sends copies of Bucer's and Philipp [Melanchthon's] opinions and expects Bullinger and Pellikan to provide arguments to respond to them. Konrad [...] will present a concern from [Leonhard] Hospinian, who presumably wants to move from Kempten to Stein [am Rhein]. Greetings. [Martin] Frecht, Gervasius [Schuler], and Thomas [Gaßner] have agreed in writing with Bucer's and Melanchthon's opinions.</p>

      <p>Peace and grace through Christ.</p>
      <p>Our Thomas discovered Bucer at Ambrosius's place, but I cannot know what benefit he gained from dealing with him, as Thomas has not returned. After his return, you will know everything. For although it is not always safe to entrust everything to letters, nor is everyone's trust proven, I cannot help but pour everything into your lap.</p>
      <p>I am not sending Bucer's letter now; it has several pages, and it was not possible to copy it, and perhaps, when Thomas returns, it will be useful. But you will not lack it.</p>
      <p>I thank you very much for your advice. I am entirely committed to your words. I wish our people had responded equally, so that the enemies, and even those who stand with us, would have no occasion to slander. I am sending back Pellican's advice along with yours. Both are pleasing, as they are clear and supported by the word of Christ.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, uncertain whether you have the written opinions of Bucer and Philipp, I am sending them to you with this messenger, so that after reading them carefully and collecting your arguments on the contrary, you may join hands with us. For we have decided to oppose with all our strength, but you know my inexperience; therefore, I will await from you and Pellican stronger arguments, with which we can resist and respond more forcefully. See that you do not fail us.</p>
      <p>Then, Konrad here has something to discuss with you on behalf of Hospinian, who seems to be seeking a school in the town of Stein, as he is about to leave Kempten. I beseech you to move every stone in promoting this learned and pious man. You will do this, I am sure, not unwillingly, and for the sake of studies.</p>
      <p>But now farewell with your whole family and all the brothers, Pellican, Theodor, Leo, etc.</p>
      <p>February 20, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your I. Z.</p>
      <p>And so that you are not unaware: Frecht in Ulm, Gervasius in Memmingen, and Thomas in Lindau have subscribed to the opinions of Bucer and Philipp, given and signed with their own hands.</p>
      <p>To his most esteemed brother in the Lord, Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
