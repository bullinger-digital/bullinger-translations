      <p>Since I knew that Mr. Friedrich would come to you after these Chur fairs, most esteemed Mr. Bullinger, I thought it would not be the slightest mistake if I did not accompany him with these little letters written to you. For it is the duty of inferiors to have regard for their superiors.</p>
      <p>And although I have nothing worthy of your knowledge, nevertheless I will seem to have satisfied myself if you perceive that I have fulfilled my duty. However, I cannot sufficiently admire how much gratitude I have for you; for in all your letters, which you write to the aforementioned Mr. Friedrich, our common friend and dearest brother in Christ, you bid me farewell in your name, so that no one who judges otherwise would not think that I am dear to you and that you are most loving of me, not to mention the great pleasure, which is not small, that I take in reading your letters. For besides the fact that they display much elegance and familiarity, they are filled with news concerning both the political and civil state and the state of religion. Although I hope to perceive much more when I have read through your pious and learned sermons on Jeremiah and the sacred Apocalypse.</p>
      <p>For the possessor of them is of such humanity that, after he himself has seen them (for the first fruits are owed to the master), he will also make them available to me. But lest I be too burdensome to you, occupied with more serious business, with a longer reading, I will make an end of writing. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Samaden, January 24, 1558.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Peter Parisotti, unworthy minister of the church of Samaden.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Bullinger, my most esteemed master.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
