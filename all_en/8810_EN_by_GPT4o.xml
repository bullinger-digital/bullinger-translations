      <p>Greetings. Yesterday evening, when the syndics of the Upper League entered Chur to hold a subcommittee meeting, among others, Mr. Rhätien also entered, surrounded by many, showing little fear of the fire, which he himself was judged by all to be the blower and heater of. Shortly after, at the same evening time, the larger council of this city was gathered, in which there were many who advised to seize the Rhätien and keep him in custody for certain purposes. They were very discordant in that consultation, with some objecting that it was not permissible, while others insisted that it was permissible to capture a traitor, and those who thought otherwise were similar.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while these things were being deliberated, Rhätien quickly took a horse and, accompanied by a few, left the city in tears and immediately retreated to his fortress. We will hear what the remaining envoys will do. I truly fear that, torn into a thousand parts, they will soon feel the wrath of the Lord due to such bloody arts. Pray for us and our churches, which are now exposed to a thousand snares. Pray for our entire most afflicted and turmoil-filled Rhätia.</p>
      <p>From my Chur, in the year 1572, March 11.</p>
      <p>It is said that Josua von Salis is going to gather a foreign soldier somewhere, not a Rhätian.</p>
