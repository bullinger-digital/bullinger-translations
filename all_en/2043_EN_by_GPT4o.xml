      <p>S. I give you the greatest thanks, most esteemed and dearest lord and godfather, for your diligence, through which you ensured that we received your response given to the people of Geneva promptly and in time. Our response completely agrees with yours, and the same method was maintained in responding. We presented to our senate (as instructed by them) the primary errors of Servetus in detail.</p>
      <p>Upon hearing these, everyone was so enraged that I would not doubt, if he were held in their chains, that he would be burned. However, since the matter was somewhat unintelligible to them, they wanted us to respond to the Geneva senate with a private letter.</p>
      <p>They also added a letter on their behalf, in which they earnestly urge the Genevans to remove this plague, so that our neighboring fields are not also infected through their negligence.</p>
      <p>For it often happens that the disturbances entangled in Geneva eventually have to be dealt with by us, as they break out beyond their walls into the jurisdiction of our city. Therefore, they were seriously admonished. Since our response agrees with yours in every way, there is no need for me to send it. I have received nothing from Sulzer. However, I sent a copy of your response, sent through Fridolin, to Mr. Blaurer, as you instructed. We now await the outcome. As for new matters, we have nothing at all.</p>
      <p>Musculus is being solicited by Pistorius to move to Hesse, having been called by the Landgrave; but there is no danger of him being torn away from us. For he now sees what would have happened to him if he had gone to England. He sends his greetings to you with all his family. My wife does the same, who has returned here safe and sound, on whose behalf I give you great thanks for the kindness and benevolence shown to her. May the Lord grant that I can repay it. May all yours be safe. Bern, October 19, 1553.</p>
      <p>We will have Gervasius's response as soon as possible. Johannes Haller, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his venerable lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
