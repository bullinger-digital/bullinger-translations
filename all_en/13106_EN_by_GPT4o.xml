    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] If Bullinger had written that Helvetia was being attacked, Myconius would be much less devastated than by the news of the [negotiations of the] people of Constance [with Emperor Charles V]. This message means, namely, that Helvetia has been defeated or no longer exists! He hoped never to have to experience something like this. But if Constance surrenders, he must give up his hope, especially since this corpse [the Emperor] will keep the city in a completely different way [in the Empire] than Emperor Maximilian I did. What will then become of Thurgau, of us [Basel, Bern, Schaffhausen, and Zurich], and of the other [Confederates]?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Was there really no other option left for Constance? Why did the people of Zurich not offer protection to this city (whether alone or together with the other [Protestant] places)? That would not have been a violation of the alliance [that the Confederates have among themselves]. With God's help, the people of Zurich could have protected the people of Constance all by themselves against these devils [the Emperor and his foreign troops]! But they are afraid, namely of the Five Places, before whom they cower (as was evident from a letter recently addressed to the people of Basel). At the same time, however, they reproach the people of Basel for wanting to be too accommodating to the Emperor. This is all very confidential. Myconius learned of the fear of the people of Zurich from a letter addressed to him, which he believes until he is taught otherwise. He expresses himself here as is customary among friends.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Whatever beautiful promises the Five Places make, he cannot trust them, as they fight against the faith and are willing to endure suffering if only the [Protestant Confederates] perish in the process. [Previous] examples of this cannot be cited now, as the messenger [Andreas MÃ¼ller] wants to depart. Therefore, Myconius can also not share any news, except that the Diet of Augsburg will destroy religion (not to mention everything else) if God does not intervene! Johannes Gast made a copy of a report about it, which Bullinger might receive from him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] From Antwerp, it is reported that the English continue to act in a godly manner. They have fought twice against the Scots. First, the English killed 15,000 men, then 6,000. Now they are said to be striving for peace in London.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It is also said that in Italy, Pope Paul III has declared war on the Emperor. However, Myconius doubts this, especially since the people of Zurich, who are closer to Italy, report nothing of the sort, and this corpse neither sends soldiers to Italy nor shows concern about the Pope. Rather, both are in cahoots, just as it is certain that an understanding has been reached with the Turkish Sultan Suleiman to enable the corpse to subjugate Germany! Because of the Five Places, Helvetia will now suffer a similar fate, unless God protects His own from it. But how is He to save people who do not want it?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] A pious, learned, and eloquent French refugee [...] told that King Henry II maintains a mistress [Diana of Poitiers], with whom his father Francis I already had relations. Since Myconius was very astonished by this, the narrator repeated his statement, so that he had to believe him, even if not everyone present did.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Enclosed is a letter for immediate forwarding to John Butler in Constance. Hans Heinrich Winkeli has passed away and will be buried today.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger should prevent an agreement between Constance and the Emperor, otherwise, everything is lost!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings, also to family and colleagues.</p>

      <p>S. If you had announced that Helvetia was being attacked, you would not have devastated me as much as when you wrote about the people of Constance. This message means to me: Helvetia has been defeated and is therefore no more. I had hoped until now that I would end my life before hearing or seeing the end of Helvetia! I seem to be mistaken if Constance has surrendered. For this corpse will defend this place differently than Maximilian did. What then of Thurgau, of us, and of the others?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Constance could not have done otherwise! What if you had taken them under your protection along with the others who have the gospel? Or what if you alone had taken them under your protection? Would that have been against the alliance? I do not think so. You could have defended them by the Lord alone against these devils! But you fear where there was no need to fear! You are so devoted to the Five Places! You recently wrote letters to our people, from which that fear is quite evident. Meanwhile, you tend to attribute to us that we would be the first to accept the emperor's will if someone demanded it. This is confidential to you. For it came to me through letters, to which I attribute as much as is appropriate, until I have asserted them or received better ones. You know what friends share among themselves. I follow that reasoning here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I do not trust the Five Places (in summary, because they persecute our faith so that they can endure evil, only for us to perish), whatever they may have in their mouths! There are examples that do not fade, which I cannot write due to the speed of the messenger. For this reason, I cannot signify anything new except this: Religion perished at the Diet of Augsburg, to say nothing of the rest, unless the Lord takes care. Gastius described the cause from me. Perhaps he sends it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>From Antwerp, it is reported that the English proceed strongly and happily in the Lord. They have clashed twice with the Scots. Now they have killed fifteen thousand, then six thousand. Peace will be concluded in London.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>From the same place: In Italy, war has been declared by the Pope against the Emperor. I doubt this somewhat, as you are closer and know nothing of it. For it is said that the corpse has not even sent a soldier to Italy nor cares about the Pope. They collude, just as they have colluded with the Turk so far, while making Germany miserable, exhausted, and a servant to the corpse. The same will happen to Helvetia through the Five Places, unless the Lord wishes to save His own. But how will He save those who do not want to be saved?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>About the Frenchman, I say nothing except this one thing, which a learned, pious, exiled man, sweet in speech (as I have never heard such a one), reported six days ago: "The King," he said, "favors, feeds, and enters into relations with a mistress, which his father did until now!" I tell you what he said freely. I was astonished; he repeated the narration; I was forced to believe, but not to persuade anyone.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Please send the letters to Butler in Constance as soon as possible. Lord Heinrich Winckeli has passed away. We will bury him today.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Beware, as much as you can, that the people of Constance do not come to an agreement with the Emperor, otherwise we are lost!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your family and brothers. In Basel, hastily, October 27, 1547. Yours, O. Myc.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful and learned minister of Christ, his venerable brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
