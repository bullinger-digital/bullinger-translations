    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for his letter [No. 1789], which contained encouraging news about God's work among the bishops [Hermann von Wied and Franz von Waldeck], but also alarming news about the cruelty of the Spanish soldiers. If other bishops, like the one from Cologne, would direct everything towards Christ, Germany would soon be pacified, and the Turks would be weakened. He eagerly awaits the draft of the Reformation ["Einfaltigs bedencken"]; Joachim Vadian also urges its transmission and sends his regards to Bucer. Bullinger has admired Melanchthon since his youth and has long known that he is well-disposed towards him; he asks for a recommendation to him. In his commentaries, he does not delve more than necessary into questions about the Lord's Supper, as he has done to the best of his conscience and with positive feedback in the commentary on Mt 26 [26f]; his interpretation of John 6 has a different focus, but in John 15-17 he had to address the end of Christ's physical presence, referring to his commentary on Matthew regarding the Lord's Supper. He does not understand why Luther, in his rage against [the Zurich theologians], surpasses himself despite their patience. He shares verbatim Luther's letter, which he wrote on August 31 in response to a Bible gifted by [Christoph] Froschauer: He refuses further such gifts, denounces the Zurich preachers as false teachers, and promises them the same fate as Zwingli. With his outbursts, Luther insults the churches of Christ and their Lord; the concerns [of the Zurichers] regarding the concord promoted by Bucer have been confirmed, yet they will not write against the Saxon churches and their confessional relatives, as they still hope to be united with the truth-loving among them. He writes this only because Bucer gave him cause with his admonition; the disunity of the Protestants benefits Emperor [Charles V], who, in the event of a victory over France, will restore [Duke Henry of] Brunswick[-Wolfenb√ºttel] and [Duke Charles III of] Savoy, rob the imperial cities and the Swiss Confederates of their freedom, reestablish the papal rule, and spare neither Lutherans nor Zwinglians; his intentions are clear from the mandate issued against Hildesheim. He asks for understanding for his complaint and calls for prayer. Greetings. He is surprised that Peter Martyr [Vermigli] has not responded; he sends his regards to him and Paulus [Lacisius].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I truly give you, most esteemed Bucer, immense thanks for your very friendly letters. There were things in them that delighted, and again, things that caused no small amount of sorrow. For who would not rejoice at such a remarkable display of God's benevolence and grace towards the bishops, which they have abundantly demonstrated through both pious and excellent works? May the Lord confirm and increase the gifts bestowed upon them. Who, on the other hand, would not be astounded by the stubborn malignity, cruelty, and sacrilegious impiety of the Spanish soldiers? They have exercised such cruelty among friends and allies not yet declared enemies, as barbarians are wont to do against enemies. These surpass any barbarians in cruelty. May the Lord see and demand justice.</p>
      <p>We give thanks to the gracious God the Father for the heroic constancy of these bishops, especially the one from Cologne. He has now shown in this prince, as he once did in his chosen ones, how great is the power of true faith. If only we had more bishops and shepherds of the people like this; we would soon see a more peaceful and happier Germany, and we would see the Turkish forces and victories weaken and decline day by day. And certainly, those movements and disturbances of kingdoms cannot be settled or composed by any other means than by a serious pursuit of piety.</p>
      <p>This is achieved through the pure and sincere reformation of the ministry of the word and sacraments, by which churches are stirred to holy repentance for sins and solid trust in grace, planted, advanced, and preserved. Therefore, the bishop of Cologne acts most wisely and prudently, directing all his plans towards this, so that what is done in the church may clearly proclaim and commend Christ alone through words and signs, and in this, the pursuit of a holy life and trust in grace.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await the draft of the Reformation. The dear man Joachim Vadian also urges me not to cease requesting it until I obtain a copy, which I will soon share with him. He sends you very affectionate greetings.</p>
      <p>I have loved and esteemed Master Philipp [Melanchthon] greatly since my youth to this day. I have always been pleased with the man's utmost modesty and most holy piety, as well as his most exquisite learning. Furthermore, friends have long since informed me of his fair and benevolent disposition towards me, which makes me love and esteem him even more eagerly now; if you would recommend me to him, you would do me a most gratifying favor.</p>
      <p>I do not dispute about the Eucharist in my commentaries, except when the matter itself demands it and the passage I am explaining requires it; not to incite new conflicts, not to provoke anyone, but to expound the mysteries of Scripture and teach those who are eager for the truth. Indeed, I could not have disputed the mysteries of the Lord's Supper more modestly or in any other way with a clear conscience and faith, God is my witness, than I did in Matthew chapter 26. Certainly, even foreign brothers found nothing lacking in that treatment, nothing to accuse, but rather commended it. In writing on John chapter 6, I barely touched on the matter of the Supper and turned the discussion against the common enemies, the papists. In John chapters 15, 16, and 17, the Lord so clearly removes the bodily presence from the church that I could not ignore it.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, lest anyone think that I do not acknowledge the mystery of the Lord's Supper or simply deny the Lord's presence in the church, I referred to the discussion on the Supper in Matthew, then explained with the words of Scripture how the Lord is present in the church. I could not act otherwise, nor do I think I have incurred or contracted any danger from this with a fair reader.</p>
      <p>It greatly pains me that Dr. Luther, an old man, is so combative, especially against us, common ministers in the gospel of Christ.</p>
      <p>There are countless other enemies; if he thinks he must fight at all, he should rather attack them, not draw the sword against friends and allies. Let him remember that the anger and fights of brothers are almost always the fiercest and most enduring. Let him remember the common proverb: "Even the ant and the wasp have bile." Indeed, we have overlooked many things so far for the sake of the peace and safety of the churches, we have forgiven many things to a man otherwise quite insolent, we have patiently swallowed and even digested many things for Christ's sake, and so as not to place a stumbling block before the weak. However, this man surpasses himself in his ferocity and, by afflicting us with unspeakable insults and injuries, seeks to break our patience with his stubborn wickedness.</p>
      <p>I will tell you, dear brother, what he did in recent days: Our Froschauer, with a truly sincere and benevolent spirit, gifted Dr. Luther a recently printed Bible prepared by our people. But he, in a letter written in his own hand, thanked Froschauer in this way and praised the useful labors of the interpreters with these words: "Grace and peace in the Lord. Honorable, prudent, good friend. I have received the Bible, which you sent and gifted to me through our bookseller. And for your part, I thank you kindly; but since it is a work of your preachers, with whom I can have no fellowship in the church of God, I am sorry that they should labor so hard in vain and yet be lost. They have been sufficiently admonished to desist from their error and not lead the poor people so miserably with them to hell. But no admonition helps, they must be let go. Therefore, you need not send or gift me anything more of what they make or work. I do not want to be part of their damnation and blasphemous teaching, but to be known as innocent, praying against them and their teaching until my end. May God convert some and help the poor churches to be rid of such false, misleading preachers once and for all. Amen. Although they laugh at all this, they will weep one day when they find Zwingli's judgment (which they follow). May God protect you and all innocent hearts from their poison. Amen. Friday after Augustine 1543."</p>
      <p>See, my Bucer, how this man has nothing moderate. Could he have spat more atrociously against openly and publicly impious and notorious people? And even if we grant that we err in the matter of the Eucharist, were we to be so rejected, condemned, trampled upon? Now, since the doctrine of repentance and forgiveness of sins in the name of Christ is sincere and pure in our churches, since the use of the sacraments is holy and legitimate for us, and finally, since our churches are the most holy witnesses and true signs of our apostolate or holy and just ministry, why does his insolent mouth spew such atrocious curses against us, innocent and faithful ministers of Christ? This insult also reflects on the holy churches of Christ and on the Lord Jesus himself, our head and king, whom we believe and serve. Where now is the concord with Dr. Luther, in which you labored so much to mend? You now see and experience that we were not anxious without reason, but for just causes in many things? For this mindset towards us did not begin now, but this abscess has been festering for many years. May the Lord forgive him the great sin and heal the most pestilent ulcer, which we fear will be fatal not to us, but to him. We will not pray against him, but for his health and safety. We will not teach or write against the Saxon churches or their confessional allies. For we hope to agree excellently with all pious and truth-loving people through those churches, even if Dr. Luther and some of his instigators, men given to passions and quarrels, abhor our fellowship and society in Christ and the saving religion.</p>
      <p>I would not have written this if you had not given me the occasion with your friendly admonition to signify these things and share them with fraternal faith. Certainly, the present times and the grave dangers threatening the churches seem to require purer minds. The papist emperor is looming over our necks, who, once he has subjected France to his lust, will restore Brunswick and Savoy, indeed, having driven out Christ and the gospel, will finally rob the free imperial cities and the Swiss Confederates of their freedom, restore the pope, and exercise tyranny. He will not spare the Lutherans, he will condemn the Zwinglians, and having accepted neither into grace, he will persecute them, but he will be kind to them until he subdues them, then he will not spare them. Nor do the enemies of the gospel conceal their secret plans. Nor is the mandate that the emperor sent to the city of Hildesheim from Worms unknown. From it, one can understand the mind, plan, and purpose of the emperor, whom we do not fear, but we do not think should be despised. His spirit grows insolent from the fact that he is not unaware of the embittered minds of some, that he observes many things not being conducted very harmoniously by the evangelicals. May the Lord Jesus Christ keep us from evil!</p>
      <p>I pray that you will kindly consider and faithfully commend my not unjust complaint and the common cause, indeed the danger of the churches, to all the saints, so that they may offer fervent prayers for safety to Christ, our king, and mitigate his wrath with repentance and true faith.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the brothers and fellow ministers. All the brothers greet you. I wrote to Master Peter Martyr at the spring fair; I am surprised why he has not responded. You will greet him and Paulus most affectionately.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 12, 1543.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
