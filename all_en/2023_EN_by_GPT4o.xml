      <p>S. Yesterday, the case of Servetus was presented to us by this courier from Geneva. We immediately copied all these writings to prepare a response in the meantime, while this messenger returns here.</p>
      <p>We also wish to know your response before we give ours, and therefore we ask that you inform us of it promptly. But what need is there for many words: the man is a most heretical person and worthy of being relieved from the church. Our opinion of him will be the same. However, please make sure that we quickly, quickly know your judgment. What else is happening in Geneva, you will learn from the messenger himself. Farewell. Yesterday evening Zwingli also came, to whom I have not been able to give attention so far because of this business. Bern, September 26, 1553, 8 o'clock in the morning.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
