      <p>My friendly greeting, also whatever I can offer in honor, love, and goodness, may it always be ready for you from me, pious, well-learned, distinguished, wise, especially kind, honorable, dear sir. I have received your friendly letter along with the sent sermons, for which I thank you greatly. And so that I can show some gratitude for your goodness and friendliness in some way, since I have received an uncertain message, I wanted to send you this cheese, with the request to accept it with the best intentions from me and to consider me, as always, at your service. I will pray to God for your well-being, and that He may keep you in health and long life, and I will strive to serve you.</p>
      <p>Dated from Aarwangen, June 19, 1570. Your willing servant Hans Rudolf Hagenberg.</p>
      <p>"Former bailiff of Lenzburg, now bailiff of Aarwangen and again appointed to the council in Bern for the office of banneret.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, distinguished, honorable, wise master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my especially kind, honorable, dear sir.</p>
      <p>"H. Hans Rudolf Hagenberg, bailiff of Aarwangen."</p>
