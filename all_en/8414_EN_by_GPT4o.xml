      <p>Greetings. You have relieved me of that anxiety which held me worried, as you indicate that you have received everything I sent.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the matter is well, and I am glad that Ganthner, since he does not present himself otherwise, has been seriously dismissed. It remains that another pious and learned man be appointed in his place. There is a need for frequent prayers, as the apostolic example in Acts 1 teaches us, and here faithful prayers achieve more than all other counsels. In my previous letters, I named Campell, whom I would consider to be appointed; however, I prescribe to no one. Brunner is learned; but he has a busy mind, which always has something to do. I would wish him to be more tranquil. But if they absolutely want to have him, ensure that he is instructed not to dispute or teach anything against the accepted confession, etc. Marius is also learned, but of the same kind as the other one and perhaps more obstinate, etc. If this matter were in my power, for the peace of the church, I would appoint neither in the place of the restless Ganthner. But let the will of the Lord be done. In the meantime, you must be vigilant, lest worse things follow. May the Lord be with you by His grace! I have not yet fully recovered. An abscess still afflicts me. I could not attend the synod. I have not come to the temple since the 8th of this month, nor do I know when I can perform my duty. I commit everything to the Lord, and I pray that He may have mercy on me and all of us. Therefore, forgive me for being brief. Excuse me to the most honorable councilor for not responding; greet him most kindly. Also greet the other councilor and our friends, Mr. Karl, Franz Bonet, whose letters to Mr. Zanchi I will send to Heidelberg by the first available messenger; however, I do not know when this will happen.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your entire household.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 27, 1570. Yours, Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the Church of St. Martin in Chur, my beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
