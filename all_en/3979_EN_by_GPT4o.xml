      <p>Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg.</p>
      <p>Last winter, I received several questions from Augsburg and Bavaria with the request that I provide a brief report in response, for the benefit and comfort of troubled Christians who are distressed by these questions, and that I have it published. I have done this for the honor of God and the comfort of believing souls, as Your Grace, if you have the time amidst your many duties, may see in this little book, which I am sending to Your Grace not because I believe that Your Grace needs my report, but solely to show my very willing intention, and that I am always ready to serve Your Grace willingly.</p>
      <p>I humbly and respectfully ask that Your Grace graciously accept this letter and little book from me.</p>
      <p>May God Almighty, through His only Son, our Lord Jesus, graciously keep Your Grace in His grace, for a long time in peace and all prosperity.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich...</p>
