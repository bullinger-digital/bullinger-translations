      <p>Greetings. Reverend and most illustrious man, in the past months I received, along with your letters, the apology which you recently published for the sake of your church. I am saddened by this renewed Eucharistic dissension; however, I am pleased that, as he says, you did not wish to act in any way by accepting abusive and indecent reproach in return.</p>
      <p>Christ, about to die for our sake, always commended to the apostles and to all of us the pursuit of peace combined with the love of truth, not throwing an apple of discord among his own. May his example be dear to all of us! Our Erastus is living quite comfortably; I hope that rivals will not undertake anything hostile against one who has deserved well in the future. Adam Neuser escaped from prison; may the Lord grant him to return to a sounder mind! Theodoric Simmelbeker of Heidelberg, who offers these letters to your piety, is my relative; he studied medicine in Basel, and in order to be able to speak to your excellence in person, he has set out for Zürich.</p>
      <p>I commend him to you on the condition that I require nothing beyond encouragement in the pursuit of virtue and learning. Our president, Johannes Conrad from Ulm, my friend and neighbor, lives and acts happily with his family. When I wished him health and all good things in your words, he asked me to greet you courteously and lovingly and at the same time to greet Mr. Johannes Wolf, a most deserving teacher. He departed a few days ago to return shortly to the Lower Margraves.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, most esteemed man. I wrote in Rötteln on August 12.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Johann Jakob Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man distinguished in wisdom and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zürich church, his most beloved master. In Zürich.</p>
