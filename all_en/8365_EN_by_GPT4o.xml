      <p>Greetings. We have finally received letters from Blasius. He writes that they are completely free from the plague in Lausanne. Therefore, today or tomorrow, as soon as we find a suitable companion for Felix, we will send him off. Meanwhile, peace is confirmed through the letters of the Solothurn envoy; however, he does not specify any conditions at all. But those conditions I wrote about recently are still confirmed, except that among the cities granted to the admiral, Jean Angeli Montabon is counted for S.</p>
      <p>It is further added that in each prefecture (which they call mandates) throughout the kingdom, two places should be designated where the gospel is publicly preached and religious exercises are conducted. Moreover, each prince and nobleman should be allowed to have the same in their territories and domains. It is certain that our neighbors in Fribourg are bearing this peace with great indignation, which provides us with a good indication.</p>
      <p>Linerus had written about sixty people hanged in Paris who opposed the proclaimed peace; the same is written from elsewhere, but with a definite number, stating that only 25 of them were involved. Whatever the case, the Lord is to be praised for bringing matters to this point. Some write that the king and the admiral have joined forces and now all receive pay from the king. Meanwhile, it is reported that there are clear signs of discord between the king and his brother, and the papists are secretly stirring up trouble to incite one against the other. It is also said that the pope, having sent a sword, is working to detest this peace greatly, lest there be an end to turmoil and bloodshed. Thus, it will happen that the king will eventually have to be defended by the arms of the Huguenots, whom he so greatly wished to destroy. These are the changes of the right hand of the Most High, to whom be praise forever!</p>
      <p>All of ours send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 28, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Among other things, Blasius also writes that he cannot accommodate Felix at this time due to the multitude of boarders; but he will make an effort to place him well elsewhere with some learned man. However, I will still urge him to keep Felix himself if it is at all possible.</p>
      <p>Dear one, write diligently about what you can obtain from Venice and their affairs.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>To M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
