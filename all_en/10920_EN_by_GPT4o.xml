    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes only now, as he himself wanted to come to Zurich. Has missed part of the [Wittenberg] negotiations, but can still report on them as a participant. Has realized that earlier fears regarding Luther's doctrine of the presence of Christ [in the Eucharist] were unfounded; on the other hand, Luther has also acknowledged that [the Upper Germans] do not deny this presence. Luther has refuted the concerns presented by Bucer on behalf of the Swiss. The [realistic] expressions are to be understood from the sacramental union. The value of the Eucharist should not depend on the worthiness of the participants. Luther has conceded that the unbelievers only eat the sign; the wicked and hypocrites in the church are indeed offered the body of Christ, but they do not truly receive it, which also corresponds to the teachings of Augustine and Oecolampadius. Clear boundaries have been set against misinterpretations of the presence of Christ. The article on baptism seems darker, yet Calvin's ["Institutes"] also speaks of the faith of children, and the assertion of the necessity of baptism is directed against its detractors. The article on absolution testifies to Luther's interest in the personal proclamation of the Gospel. Zwick has just learned of the upcoming concord discussions in Zurich with Grynaeus, Myconius, and Vadian and regrets the delay of his report. A statement from the church of Constance is still pending. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Health and peace of Jesus Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>The reason for my prolonged silence is none other than that I have been expecting the opportunity to see you in person at any moment, and, oh God, with what longing I have awaited it, and I still do not cease to expect it! However, since I see that it is the Lord who governs our efforts, I cannot allow you to believe me dead or forgetful of you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter of concord with Luther, you perhaps now have the whole affair, since I have understood that some from Basel have been with you. However, to speak freely, no one can successfully handle this matter who has not been present.</p>
      <p>And although I, hindered by illness, have neglected the most important part of the discussion, I still seem to myself to grasp the essence of the matter well.</p>
      <p>And first, as far as the Eucharist is concerned, I do not understand Luther to wish to establish such a presence of the body as we have suspected, although he gave us cause to suspect wrongly by writing these words of Christ: "This is my body" to be received without any trope, and that the meaning of these words is that this bread is substantially the body of Christ, in this bread is the body substantially. Who, I ask, was not justly deceived? But now, since he explains himself so that we understand that such a presence is by no means established by him, certain things must be overlooked because of his other remarkable gifts. Then, since he understood that our people never wished to deny all presence of Christ, but only fought against the local presence and that which could not consist with the truth of humanity, he also received us more kindly.</p>
      <p>In the name of the Swiss churches, three propositions were also presented, which frightened them in this matter of concord. First, that you would incur the suspicion of inconsistency among the common people. But Luther compels no one to swear to certain prescribed words, he only wants to know what we think of Christ's institution, in whatever words we may express it. Second, that you would incur some kind of impanation or union, either real or natural or personal, or some local inclusion of the body with the bread. Third, that you would incur the establishment of a presence of Christ in the supper that conflicts with the truth of humanity. These were clearly explained to Luther through Bucer in the name of all. When it was about you and your churches, I need not say with what diligence this was done. But now, unless I am entirely stone-hearted, I could not understand Luther or those with whom we had dealings to wish for such a thing.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he wants everything to be done internally in the supper by the power of Christ, whatever is done externally by the minister at the command of Christ, namely, that just as the bread is given, distributed, received, and eaten, so the mind of Christ is to give and distribute his very own body to all the guests in the supper, that they may receive and eat. And because of this sacramental union, which no one denies, it is said that the body is handed over to the hands, etc., it is said that the minister gives the body, we are said to see Christ, the bread is said to be the body. And although he wants these things to be said by reason of the sacramental union, he compels no one to these forms of speaking. He only wanted to find out whether we truly or falsely believe in the distribution and gift of the body of Christ in the supper.</p>
      <p>Then he does not want this supper to be estimated by the mind of the minister or the guests, but by the institution of Christ. For if it is to be estimated by the minister or the guests, then either nausea or vain glory will easily arise. However, if we speak of the fruit of the eating, certainly this feast is to be estimated by the faith of the recipient.</p>
      <p>Regarding the eating of the impious, it has been obtained from Luther to deny that they eat the body or anything other than bread. The impious are here understood as those who are outside the church, believing nothing about Christ or his institutions. But those who are of the church and sit at the Lord's supper, to all of them Christ is said to give and distribute his body equally. For this reason, he instituted the supper, that it might be a communication of his body. Since there are both good and evil in the church and thus also at the Lord's table, all are equally said to receive the gift of the body of Christ, as far as you regard Christ's benevolence and institution. However, they are not said to eat equally. The wicked and hypocrites, bringing nothing but dead faith to the supper, are said to eat Christ only sacramentally and not truly. The good, however, eat truly not only the bread but with the bread (that is, in that action of Christ) also the body. This matter, in my judgment, is indeed clear, as testified also by Augustine and after him by our Oecolampadius.</p>
      <p>When the presence of the body of Christ was disputed, "Christ acts in the supper and in his own, therefore he is present," said Philipp. But I heard nothing about the presence of the physical body, and the local presence and every other presence that is not consistent with the fact that Christ is in one place in heaven circumscriptively, and finally every presence that might seem contrary to the truth of humanity, is constantly denied. Moreover, every impanation, every transubstantiation, every local inclusion, every union except the sacramental one, which itself is nothing outside the use of the supper, is excluded. These are about the article of the supper.</p>
      <p>The article on baptism is darker in terms of the letter. Regarding the faith of infants in it, nothing else is sought than what Calvin has. As for the necessity of baptizing children, everything is to be referred to the institution of Christ and that against the despisers of this sacred washing, not to the salvation of the children.</p>
      <p>The article on absolution or examination would be tolerable if our age would bear these novelties. However, no enumeration of sins is required. Luther only hates the neglect of youth and consciences and asks that the promises of the Gospel be treated not only publicly but also privately and seriously. In this matter, we easily agree, even if we do not agree in every way about the manner.</p>
      <p>When I had written these things, behold, I am called by the legates of Basel to the inn, who made me certain about the departure of Grynaeus and Myconius to you, also about Vadian, as if he too were called to you. Hence I began to blame myself for being very slow in writing. For although it is not my custom to urge anyone to do anything, yet I would have wished you to have had the summary of the matter from me. I excused the delay at the beginning of the letter. What more can I say? I am not entirely my own master, nor is it always free for me to do what I would wish and desire.</p>
      <p>Regarding the disposition of the church of Constance, I still have nothing certain. It is customary for our people to deliberate for a very long time on more serious matters. Outside of that discussion of the articles, I have nothing to write to you. Pellicanus heard everything in Strasbourg; besides, Mangold has left. Therefore, farewell, most delightful brothers, and do not cease to love me and to pray to the Lord for our church.</p>
      <p>Greet for me most diligently Theodor, Stainer, Uttinger, and any good people.</p>
      <p>In Constance, August 19, 1536.</p>
      <p>In every way your brother</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>I wish your families, wives, and children to be safe.</p>
      <p>Forgive the blots; I have not reread it.</p>
