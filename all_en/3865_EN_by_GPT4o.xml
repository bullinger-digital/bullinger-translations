      <p> My friendly greetings and all the best to you, dear Mr. Heinrich, I want to let you know that we are doing quite well, praise be to God; likewise, I would gladly hear the same from you all. Further, dear sir, I sent you a letter on St. Paul's Day from Chur and have not received a reply from you, nor have I heard from my sons Hector and Josue, which surprises me, wondering how they are doing. Therefore, my request to you is to write to me about how they are doing and also how they are behaving, and I entrust them to you sincerely, that you treat them like a father, as I have no doubt you do. And if anything is lacking, let me know through young master Lorenz Limaga from Plurs, the bearer of this letter, as much as I can provide, and he will also speak on my behalf: believe him, as I do, and write to me everything about how the children Hector and Josue are doing, and that they are being taught discipline and learning, grammar, and what you think is good. I intend to leave Hector with you for several years, indeed if you wish, and when he leaves you, that he knows something.</p>
      <p> Therefore, guide him as you see fit, so that he does not waste his time, as I trust you and have no doubt you will do. With that, may God be with you.</p>
      <p> My wife and my son Friedrich, the commissioner in Cleven, and other good friends and supporters send you and your dear wife and all your children warm greetings, and to all who are dear to you. I await a reply from you in writing.</p>
      <p> Dated in Promontogno, the 19th of February 1559. Your willing and true supporter Rudolf von Salis.</p>
