      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, my lord and reverend father, written on the eleventh of April amidst your great occupations, on the 27th of the same month through Peter Lombard. I would not have responded now, which I do briefly, because I am soon, with God's favor, about to set out for the baths of Baden or Pfeffers (for I am still uncertain to which), and I hoped that I could then speak with you more conveniently and consult you about my affairs, which I also have in mind. But when the most distinguished doctor of theology, Baptista Rotanus, visited me several times in recent days and we often spoke of you, he was burning with the greatest desire to make a journey there to greet you, I told him how easy the access to you was and with what great kindness you are accustomed to address and receive all strangers, which he had also heard.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, for the sake of our relationship, he asked me to give him a letter to you, so that he would not seem to approach you without cause, which I could not deny to an old friend.</p>
      <p>He is indeed a young man educated beyond mediocrity, who has always esteemed you and the people of Z端rich (not undeservedly) highly and continues to do so. I give you immense thanks for the weight my letter had with you, so that Colladon, whom he wished, was recommended to the English bishops. The death of my very dear relative, Mr. Pontisell, has greatly afflicted me and added not a little strength to my illness; but since it seemed so to the Lord, it must be endured. I am still unable to walk without a staff; such is the numbness of my legs and the weakness of my nerves, from which I hope to be freed after I have bathed. I write nothing of new matters to you, since you will learn everything from the lord doctor Rotanus himself, if we have anything that has not reached you.</p>
      <p>Mr. Zwinger and Stupanus greet you by name, whom you may also soon see passing through there. In my name, I wish you to greet my compatriot Mr. Lavater, Mr. Johann Rudolf, Veritas, and Dorothea, and your whole family.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my lord and reverend father. May God, the best and greatest, wish to preserve you safe for a long time for His church.</p>
      <p>Basel, 2nd of May, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johann Baptist M端ller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and exceptional servant of Christ, lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the church of Z端rich, lord and father to be eternally revered. Z端rich.</p>
