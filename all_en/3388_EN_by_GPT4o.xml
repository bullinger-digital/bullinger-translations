      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings beforehand.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, dear special one, a few weeks ago we received a letter from you through our servant Hans Heinrich Lochmann, along with a sent printed booklet, whose author, in our opinion, has changed his name and content. However, since it is a very small print and the years are rising high upon us, which makes our eyesight diminish more and more, making it difficult to read small writings, and since we are truly burdened with many other matters in these times, which makes us quite tired and weary and leaves us very little time to read or write anything else, as far as this matter and the contentious points of the Holy Communion are concerned, what we have written and sent to you about it has only happened because we would like to see unity in the church. However, since it is lacking and failing in some respects, and we are not among the learned, we wish to entrust it rightly to the almighty, eternal God.</p>
      <p>May He give His blessing and prosperity, so that unity among His believers may be established and maintained. In His protection and care, we commend you.</p>
      <p>Dated Horburg the [...] of November in the year etc. 57. G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, our dear special Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the church in Zürich.</p>
