    <p xml:id="regest1">Excuses his long silence with business and his caution towards unconfirmed good news. Defeat of King Ferdinand I's army. The fugitives praise the mercy of the victors Philip of Hesse and Ulrich of Württemberg and criticize the weakness of the king. Letter from Montbéliard: It is advised against renewing the Swiss confederation with the Five Cantons, as they wish, because the Protestant army leadership is planning something against the Catholics; soon more princes will be in the field, including the Swabian cities, if the Emperor sends Spanish troops to Germany; the Five Cantons and Valais have formed an alliance with Savoy, and the Bishop of Sion, Adrian I of Riedmatten, is preparing for war, perhaps against Bern. So can one trust the Five Cantons! The people of Zurich have responded correctly to the French envoy Guillaume du Bellay. Truly: what can be mended in such a torn matter? Unnecessary concessions would promote evil. Therefore, he considers Erasmus's mediating stance towards Papism to be wrong. Thanks for Vadian's letter. He will soon inform about the decision made in Basel regarding Karlstadt. Greetings to Heinrich Utinger and all brothers.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I attribute my long silence to business matters and the uncertainty of events. I do not like to indulge in joys that are later tainted with sorrow when things turn out differently. The defeat of Ferdinand's forces has been consistently reported from last Saturday until now. Some return from the neighboring territories of the House of Austria, some naked, some wounded.</p>
      <p>All commend the mercy of the princes: "They could have killed us," they say, "but they did not want to." On the other hand, they criticize the king as poor and needy. This is an old song about the Roman kings. We have sent a messenger about these matters. He has not yet returned. After he returns, we will understand what it is. Besides these, the following has been written to me from Montbéliard: it is certain that the Cantons are attempting a new alliance, indeed to renew the old one in this time, from which we are strongly dissuaded by the one who commands the army there. For something is to happen against the impious, which is not to be revealed now. Then within 14 days, southern princes and lords will be in the field, whom no one would have expected. Wilhelm, Duke of Bavaria, together with Christoph, the younger Duke of Württemberg, will invade the enemy with a large army on Pentecost Monday, and the cities of Swabia, Augsburg, Ulm, Nuremberg are preparing soldiers and arms, in case the Emperor sends Spaniards to Germany, to meet them. Moreover, about the Cantons and their allies, hear what is true: They have made a new alliance with Savoy, which was confirmed in recent days in the valley of the Sedunenses. A Valaisian said: "Ah, thank God, that our hoof has increased again, so that we can better resist the Lutherans!" The Bishop of Valais is hastily preparing boards and what they call sulfur powder, perhaps against the Bernese. Consider the Cantons, are they not what we once said? Meanwhile, we foolishly sit idle. They reproach us with alliances, they themselves strike. Let them go, and may all who trust them perish badly.</p>
      <p>You responded well to the royal envoy. What could be mended in such a torn matter? One must not engage with the dragon otherwise than to kill it completely. If handled more mildly, it is to be feared that it would destroy with poison. What would now be conceded of those things that should not be, what else but the beginning of new impieties? This is the reason why I could never agree with Erasmus's opinion, which thinks that Papism should be helped with remedies, not destroyed, as if the foundation were good. You know what these mediators will accomplish in this matter: what mediators have done in warlike times: we are oppressed, the enemies rejoice. From that time, I cannot love such people. They are truly horrifying whenever I think of them.</p>
      <p>I thank you for the excellent letters of our Vadian, the honor of our homeland. It is amazing how much whatever that man writes refreshes me.</p>
      <p>Regarding Karlstadt, it has been dealt with here, but what the response is, has not yet been entrusted to me to convey. I will soon inform you.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord with all the brothers, especially Utinger. More soon.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 20, 1534.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To his lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the people of Zurich.</p>
