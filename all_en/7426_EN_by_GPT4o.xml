      <p>Greetings. I received the present letter from Geneva a few days ago, and I regret that I could not send it to you sooner.</p>
      <p>I sought someone who might go to Königsfeld; but I could not find anyone; therefore, if there is any fault in the delay, attribute it only to the fact that I could not do otherwise. Beza sent me his letters unsealed, so that I might share them with you; therefore, I sealed them with my own seal. I cannot add much to these, except that since the time I received them, many reports have come from everywhere, even from Geneva, about the peace made, and that it is such that the Papists are greatly saddened by it. But we have nothing certain about this matter yet from the couriers, as they call them.</p>
      <p>Some things have been brought from Strasbourg, which, however, contain nothing special, except about the success of Condé, how great his forces are, who leads each wing, how they have been superior in many skirmishes, that he now holds almost half of France, and things of that sort, how miserably the Italians are treated by both sides; yet they are scarcely treated as they deserve. May the Lord grant that we hear better news soon. What has been done in Neuchâtel, you have learned from the lord consul. I am very sorry that I could not speak with him that night he was here; for he kept himself so that I knew of his departure before his arrival. If it happens, I ask that you excuse me to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you; may yours also be well. Bern, March 28, 1568.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
