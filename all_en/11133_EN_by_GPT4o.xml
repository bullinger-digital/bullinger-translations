    <p xml:id="regest1">Is, as before, ready to convey Bullinger's advice regarding the desired recall of Sebastian [Meyer] from Bern to members of the Strasbourg council. After the attack [by Wilhelm Arsent] on French [students in Basel], the people of Zurich noticeably hesitated at the assembly in Baden to support Basel; Meyer suspects an unauthorized action by the envoys [Johannes Haab and Hans Edlibach] and considers Baden an unsuitable place for negotiations because the bailiff [Andreas Schmid from Zurich] is a brother-in-law of Arsent. Since Meyer wants to avoid discord between Zurich and Basel, he secretly inquires about the background. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Many good years with rich blessings of Christ, our dear Lord, in all things.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, honorable, dear lord and brother, regarding our mutual correspondence concerning the division of the brothers in Bern, I have been and still am of the opinion that, if the restless affairs we have did not hinder me, I would, with your advice, write to certain individual members of the council in Strasbourg about the appropriate ways and means by which Doctor Sebastian might be recalled, since it is believed that his departure might bring the church in Bern to peace and unity, to which I, God knows, would like to help with all earnestness and loyalty. If you would let me know your will in this matter, I would spare no effort, etc.</p>
      <p>In your last letter, you wrote to me about the received affront that happened to my lords from the righteous Frenchmen, how the wicked murderous act is truly regretted by your lords, and that we should be nothing but brave and manly, etc., which, however, was shown differently by your envoys on the recent day in Baden; for no place resolved so fearfully as your envoys. Many righteous people are greatly astonished at what attitude your lords have taken against us, considering what we have suffered on their behalf. However, I believe that the envoys have contributed too much to this. It seems to me that a praiseworthy city like Zurich would not invest much in these envoys, and yet no others can be sent than these. Moreover, the day in Baden was not well-suited for us in this matter, considering that the bailiff Wilhelm Arsent's brother-in-law, to whom all council decisions are revealed; therefore, it is no wonder that the matter does not proceed as it rightfully should. I write this to you in high secrecy; not that I desire any disparagement to grow upon the envoys, but that the long-proven love between us and your lords might not be extinguished, which would truly grieve me, for we have enough enemies otherwise. I would like to know the reasons, but no more than you are willing to disclose.</p>
      <p>Entrusting you to the grace of God. Greet Lord Lavater, Pellican, and Master Leo for me; wish them many good years in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, the 10th of January, in the year 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Jacob Meyer.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my dear lord and friend.</p>
