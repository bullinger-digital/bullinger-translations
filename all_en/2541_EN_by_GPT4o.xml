      <p>February 1, 1555.</p>
      <p>The Bernese and Fribourgers have bought the County of Gruyères, as I understand, for 80,000 * and several hundred, the sum from Bern amounts to 15,000; because the part that was allocated to them had already been somewhat used, therefore their sum brings out less to give; because both cities had previously marked half of the lands, and the larger part goes to those from Fribourg. To those from Bern, Saanen, Oesch, and Rotschmund are allocated, which are 3 banners; they have 5 church districts, 3 German and 2 French. The envoys from Bern have now been away for about 3 [weeks?]; there is talk that those from Saanen are refusing to swear, complaining about accepting the religion, having some other agreements elsewhere, etc., for which reason Bern secretly made a move last week. What would happen if one came into unrest because of the goods, where one does not want to come into a parish because of Christ's ways? However, one will soon hear whether they want to swear or not.</p>
      <p>A warning has come to those from Bern regarding the Prince of Savoy, and that the king's constable is with the bishop in Arras at Calais and is negotiating a peace between the king and the emperor; because they are tired of the war. If they agree, we have the unrest at our necks. There is concern that if the Reichstag in Augsburg takes place, the matter has already been practiced beforehand, that it is understood to drive out the word of God from Germany as from England.</p>
      <p>I have heard that the daughter-in-law of the bailiff Näginli, the one from Mülinen, said that she heard someone who saw the monks in France stuck on stakes, 24 of them (as has long been said) in Clermont in Auvergne, who were supposed to have been treated so badly that it is said to be true and the king himself confirmed the judgments.</p>
      <p>These days a messenger from there told me, who went to Fribourg, how the devil slept with a girl in the form of a nobleman, after which she became foul and stank, so that no one could endure being near her, also said that the rumor goes she is from Zurich and is called the Grüterin.</p>
      <p>Again, the French Zebedee and Angelus have stirred up a tragedy; they called Calvin a heretic. Therefore, they were summoned here; they acted impetuously, condemned Calvin's doctrine of providence. In short, whatever they could bring forth in hatred of the Genevan church, they brought forth and agitated the council in a remarkable way, asserting that the French Genevans [and] Geneva call Jerusalem, Bern Samaria, the Bernese to be stoners and sabbatarians, because they use stone baptisteries and have more festivals than the Sabbath. They brought a new interpretation of the article "descended into hell"; they criticized Calvin's interpretation: "was heard for reverence" in Hebrews. However, the Lord gave grace that we composed them, broke whatever they had devised for the subversion of peace, etc.</p>
