    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] A Württemberg captain [Michel Berchtold von Nellingen?] reported in Konstanz that [imperial] captains had met for a consultation, and from his conversations with them, he got the impression that they were planning an attack against the Confederates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] A cattle dealer from Ulm also said, when asked about rumors, that he heard the Emperor intended to take action against Konstanz and the Confederates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The grain merchants from Konstanz also encountered a Milanese [...] in Allensbach on their return journey from Radolfzell, whom they questioned about [Italy]. He reported that the Five Places were hiring mercenaries there. Bullinger should know this! Likewise, guild master Peter Labhart heard that they wanted to incite the Confederates against each other, that Italian mercenaries were being brought to the Five Places, and that the Confederation would be attacked from the Etsch or in Basel.</p>

      <p>A Württemberg captain made it known here that some of the captains had been together and various things had been discussed. He could not assume otherwise than that these were plans to also bring the Confederates into obedience.</p>

      <p>A cattle dealer from Ulm was here this week and said, when asked what the rumor was: They want to make those from Konstanz obedient and also give the Confederates a blow to make them submit.</p>

      <p>It is certain and has been reported by our grain merchants (as they have now come from Radolfzell and stayed in Allensbach) that they found someone from Milan in Allensbach and asked him what the rumor was. He answered: Nothing special, except that he heard how Italians were being hired by the Five Places, etc. I did not want to withhold this from you, because our pious guild master Peter Labhart carries this good knowledge (he also reported it), and that they want to make them (the Confederates) disunited and send Italian troops to the Five Places or attack them through the Etsch or at Basel.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable friend and brother, in Zurich.</p>
