    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Vadian entrusted his previous letter [No. 3012] to the bookseller Antonius, who will have reliably delivered it. Yesterday, Alexius [Knoblauch] urged Vadian to send a letter to Bullinger with him, so this present dispatch arose more out of duty than urgent necessity, although it is also appropriate in these troubled times to inform a friend about the current situation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] A good acquaintance [...] from Lindau conveyed news to an honorable citizen [...] in St. Gallen, who in turn asked Vadian to transcribe it for Bullinger. He encloses it here.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It is constantly claimed that the Spaniards are doing everything they can to simultaneously curb the Confederates in the wake of their success. This seems all the more credible as Emperor Charles V (as far as Vadian knows) has still not demanded anything from the cities on Lake Constance in favor of his troops, as if he intends to use them for the stationing of garrisons and to employ them as sentinels. Additionally, the [southern German] population harbors a strange hatred against the Confederates due to the many and great battles imposed on them by the Confederates. Like dogs, they do not forget the suffering endured. Ultimately, Bullinger also knows how the very word "Swiss" has long been detested by the House of Austria! Even though alliances were made in the past and all sorts of things were feigned under the guise of friendship, they did not remain loyal to each other. Meanwhile, the Emperor promises his friendship to the Confederates. Yet it is telling that Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, has never made such a promise. He has probably decided to defend the reputation of his homeland, to deprive the Confederates of their dearly won freedom, and to avenge the Austrian blood spilled in so many places.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is considered certain that high-ranking members of the court believe that the peace achieved by the Emperor in Germany and Italy has no future as long as the Confederates (who allow themselves many liberties in their freedom) are not reined in. All in all, Vadian can expect nothing good from such people!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I entrusted my previous letter to our bookseller Antonius to deliver to you, and I have no doubt it was faithfully delivered. However, when Alexius approached me yesterday, I could not let him leave without a letter for you. Therefore, I wrote this more out of duty than any urgent cause, unless it is indeed a just cause to inform a friend in these troubled times.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>A good acquaintance from Lindau wrote to an honorable citizen of ours, whose letter contained certain things that I had transcribed for you, so that I might send them to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>There is a persistent rumor that the Spaniards are leaving no stone unturned to press the Swiss Confederates and bring them into line amidst their great success. This suspicion is heightened by the fact that Emperor Charles V, as far as I know, has not yet demanded anything from the cities around Lake Constance in the name of garrisons, sparing them as if he intends to impose garrisons and sentinels upon them soon. Furthermore, there is a strange hatred of this nation towards ours due to the many and great defeats our people have inflicted upon them. They say that, like dogs, they have a remarkable memory for injuries if you have inflicted any upon them. Moreover, you know how the very name "Swiss" has been odious to the House of Austria for many years, even though alliances have been made and everything has been feigned under the guise of friendship, with no true faith given or held on either side. Meanwhile, the Emperor promises to be our friend; Granvelle makes no such promise, who perhaps has resolved to vindicate the name of his homeland, to submit our hard-won freedom to a yoke, and to avenge the Austrian blood drawn in so many places by dire means.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is taken as certain: courtiers of high rank openly suggest that the peace secured by the Emperor in Germany and Italy will not last unless he finally puts a bridle on our jaws and oppresses us with servitude, as we abuse our freedom in so many ways. All these things disturb me so much that I can promise little happiness or auspiciousness from this kind of people.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, the twentieth day of September, in the year of our Lord 1547.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
