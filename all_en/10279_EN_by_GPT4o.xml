      <p>Grace and peace from God, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, I ask you not to take offense at my writing to you about Anna Schmidlin, especially since I have previously written to Master LÃ¶we about her, and the honorable gentlemen of the marriage court have written back to me about her, saying they will not burden themselves with her case, as she is outside the jurisdiction of their lords of Zurich, and they request you; for I have been so earnestly asked and urged by them that I could not refuse, and they desire nothing else than that she, through your request, help, and counsel, as a sinner and guilty person, which she fully acknowledges and laments, may be pardoned by her gracious lords. Therefore, dear, kind lord and brother, since Christ, the true shepherd of our souls, commands us to correct the sinner with kindness and friendship and to draw them to us, and the apostle Paul commands the Corinthians to take back the excluded fornicator into their community, I think I am not to be blamed if I have once again acted according to their wishes, now troubling you with my writing on her behalf. I therefore ask and urge you most earnestly to request and admonish our gracious lords on her behalf (if it is possible for them) to pardon her again and forgive her past misdeeds, which she most humbly requests from her lords and ears. I am of good hope (and she likewise) that the disgrace, shame, poverty, and misery that has befallen her will not easily fall upon her again, and she will conduct herself in such a way that she will not be caught in similar actions again, and that you and I, for having prayed for her, and my gracious lords, for having pardoned her, will not regret it.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given on the fifth day of August, 1533.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted,</p>
      <p>Theodorichus Hasenstain, Minister of the Word in Rheinau.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastical leader in Zurich, his most beloved brother in Christ.</p>
