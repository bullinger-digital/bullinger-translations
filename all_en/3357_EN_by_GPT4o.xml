      <p>Greetings. After you outlined the subject of the letter written to me by our Friderych, I diligently searched through my archives and found the letter written to me on the first of September about his mission to Venice; then I also found another written on the 8th of September, so I now believe that none have been lost. However, since you wrote that he sent me letters last week, I doubted the reliability of the messenger. I give great thanks for the letter he wrote to you and now return it.</p>
      <p>I also thank you for what you shared from the letters received from Basel. As for me, apart from what I recently wrote, I have nothing new, except that it is written from the Bernese region that the Bernese are going to draft 15,000 men, not to give soldiers to anyone, but to organize matters for the defense of the homeland, so that they do not appear to have neglected anything. - We hear nothing more about the colloquy, except that the participants are said to be disputing about its manner. - From France, it is written that the king is preparing a huge army to oppose King Philip, who is otherwise making not unsuccessful advances.</p>
      <p>From Germany, it is written that Bollwyler, with his army, is hastening to Burgundy after destroying two small towns in Lorraine, to join his forces with others also hastening to Burgundy, to besiege Dijon (Dysion in Upper Burgundy) and distract the forces of the King of France. It is reported by Italians passing through here that all the forces of Italy, which the Florentine, Parmese, Pisan, and Albanian have gathered, are to be sent to Piedmont. The day after tomorrow, the envoy Mr. Johannes Aescherus will leave for Bern; in Bern, the envoys of the evangelical cities will join him, who will proceed directly to the king to again plead for the safety of the faithful. For because of the gospel of Christ, many are thrown into prisons throughout France, and in Paris, it is said that there are about 200 prisoners. May the Lord bless this mission and soften the heart of Pharaoh, etc. Since I am currently unable to write privately to Mr. Friderych von Salis due to business, I beg you to communicate this to him, so that my efforts are spared and, as the saying goes, one faithful servant can whitewash two walls. His son Johannes is in good health, except that he is troubled by a rash, which is common for his age. Recently, many ulcers also erupted on his stomach; but with the care and medicine of my wife, they have subsided and are now almost healed. There is an old saying: "Rough and unclean in youth, clean and pure in old age." Therefore, I did not want the parent to be worried.</p>
      <p>"Father, I am well, and I greet you and mother very warmly, etc." I wanted his son to insert this in his own hand, so the father could see that all is well. Farewell, dear brother and godfather.</p>
      <p>Commend me to the honorable consuls and brothers and fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Greetings to Mr. Friderych with his father-in-law and the whole household, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 8th October 1557.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, his esteemed and beloved godfather. To the pastor at St. Martin's in Chur.</p>
