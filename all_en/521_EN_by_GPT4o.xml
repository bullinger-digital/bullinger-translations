      <p>With all my prayers, I wish health to your lordship from the most good and great God, and I offer all my efforts as dutifully as I can.</p>
      <p>I came to Straßburg on the sixth day of May, quite unwell. Lord Jakob Sturm immediately met with me and presented letters from two cardinals, the most illustrious princes of Ferrara and Paris. From this, Lord Sturm became more familiar with me. Soon, many letters and much news were brought to me, from which I decided to write some things to you briefly. It is said that Charles V is secretly enlisting cavalry in three places; his son is now being inaugurated into the principality in Flanders and other parts of Lower Germany. The feigned illness of Charles will bring some great evil to Germany; for he wishes to convene a diet at Erfurt, if Straßburg remains quiet, which has not yet accepted the Interim.</p>
      <p>I greatly fear for the maritime cities; for they are not united by any treaty among themselves. Regarding the sons of the Duke of Saxony and the response and steadfastness concerning the Interim, I think you have heard; if not, I will write the whole matter to you, whenever you wish. Certain conditions were offered to the captured Prince of Saxony, which he refused to accept.</p>
      <p>The island of Cephalonia, which is opposite Spain and Portugal and whose friendship those people cannot do without because of navigation, has been captured. The kingdom of Trasimene has been occupied by a tyrant, fortified with 50,000 men; he is very hostile to the Spaniards; finally, the king of the island himself was slain. The Spaniards are greatly terrified, and Charles is also disturbed; he intends to send many banners of German infantry there.</p>
      <p>The conditions that Charles now presented through his legation to the Roman antichrist are these: he wishes to restore Piacenza to him, provided he retains the fortress, and then the matter will proceed by law; to whom Piacenza should yield. He also offered the county near Genoa to the pope's nephew, which he accepted, to him (or: he?), who had stirred up the tumult in Genoa, under these conditions, that the pope pays him three hundred thousand crowns, and furthermore, that he completely renounces the alliances and friendship of the French and that the marriage, which intervened between the pope's nephew and the daughter of the King of France, Henry, be dissolved. See, most illustrious man, how the slave colludes with his scarlet whore and how cunningly everything is done.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand, the brother of Charles, for a long time requested a very fortified castle from a certain noble and primate of Hungary; this year he granted it to him. The king sent Spanish soldiers there to receive and preserve the castle. When half of the soldiers had arrived there, there were 800, the noble dismissed the war instruments; the Spaniards, terrified, sought a conference, and were admitted. The Spaniards said they had a mandate from the king to receive the castle from him and preserve it. The noble replied that he had occupied the castle by hereditary right handed down from his ancestors and that it had nothing to do with the king. Thus, the Spaniards departed with the matter unresolved to the nearest place.</p>
      <p>However, that noble, having gathered his forces, pursued them, and about 400 were slain. Now Ferdinand is furious and is already trying to occupy the castle by force, with the noble defending himself.</p>
      <p>In England, the mass has been abolished, the article of justification is purely preached; the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are very few. However, as I have heard, many ceremonies have been retained, about which I am very grieved, such as vestments, candles, the memory of the dead; all things of the antichrist should rather have been removed. Through the intercession of Lord John a Lasco, even with some primates resisting, two separate churches have been permitted, one in London for the Germans, the other near London for the French; this will greatly contribute to the course of the gospel.</p>
      <p>The war between the French and the English seems to be rekindling; for the French recently tried to storm the fort before Boulogne with great force; three times they departed with the matter unresolved. But the French have also decided to defend Scotland. I was recently informed that the English brought a large supply to a certain city in Scotland captured by them; when the Scots and French learned of this, they tried to occupy the roads. The English were led to fight; they clashed, and as I have heard, 300 Scots were slain, and about 800 were captured. It is miserable to see these two princes mutually destroying each other while a third, who plots against their liberty, watches.</p>
      <p>These are the things I thought should be written to you immediately; soon more and more secret things, provided our letters are not open to all. However, you will share these with Lords Gualter, Gesner, and other saints.</p>
      <p>Regarding the affairs of Poland, I can write nothing certain until I receive my letters. I have a very close friendship with Lord Jakob Sturm, with whom I have discussed many things seriously and steadfastly. I refuted his arguments, adding that the truth of God should be asserted with blood and substance. I expect from you abundant letters about everything that is happening there, whether the Swiss have also entered into a firm alliance among themselves. I send you the Psalter, I have also added harmonies, and Dionysius on the geography of the world in Greek, not because I judged it a worthy gift for you, but because I had nothing better at the moment. I pray you consider it a sign of my goodwill towards you. I will soon send Eusebius in Greek, Tertullian from the latest edition, and Athanasius. I also sent Lord Rodolph Gualter Dionysius of Halicarnassus in Greek, which I found here among my books. Then to the excellent Gesner, Dionysius on the geography of the world. I pray and beseech you to be of the same mind towards me as you have been hitherto. As for me, you should be persuaded that I hold nothing more important, nothing more ancient than your friendship; for the efforts and benefits you have bestowed upon me are constantly before my eyes.</p>
      <p>And because I greatly dread the crime of ingratitude, I can never be unmindful of the benefits received, whence I will strive to deserve you with all services.</p>
      <p>I would write more, but neither time nor health allowed it. If you send me any letters, which I earnestly ask you to do frequently, you will send them to Münster, not to anyone else, he will ensure they are delivered to me. I send these letters with books to my most esteemed teacher. Greet all the saints in my name, Father Pellican, Gesner, whom I wish you to commend diligently. Farewell again and again. May the Lord God and our prince Christ, the best and greatest, preserve you safe for us for a long time! I commend myself to your holy prayers. I convey my services to your most holy wife and daughters; as soon as I can obtain skins, I will send them to your wife.</p>
      <p>Straßburg, 13 May 1549.</p>
      <p>Your servant Florian Susliga from Warsaw, Pole, by my hand.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful doctor of the Church of Christ among the Zürichers, lord... and most esteemed friend. Zürich</p>
