      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
      <p>In my recent letters to you, and also to friends, I have used the same excuse, but now more justly. They themselves, either because they felt that the recommendation, with which I recently commended our young Wolfgang to your kindness, was beneficial to him, or because they believed me to be more suitable for writing due to the relationship I have with you and other brothers in your community, have more insistently demanded that, if I could not write myself, I should at least delegate the task of writing in my name to someone else. However, I have never refused my honest and at least fruitful service to anyone throughout the course of my life, and I have judged it inappropriate not to provide this to my friends now. I do not undertake this task because I have any doubt about your kindness and faith, excellent Bullinger, to whom I commended the young man, which I have found to be outstandingly sincere even beyond friendship, but to comply with the unrelenting requests of friends. For I know how prompt and diligent you are in obliging friends. The young man's fine character also adds to this, which, if I am not mistaken, will make anyone who sees him embrace him more for this reason than for any serious recommendations. But I do not wish to recount these things, lest I seem to diminish your effort, which is certainly most faithful and tireless; indeed, I am much more grateful, both in my own name, to whom you have shown great and frequent signs of your love, and in the name of all the young man's friends, if indeed having gratitude, when you cannot repay it, is truly said to be no small part of gratitude; but we also offer our dedication and service in return. We further ask that the praise for the entire benefit be attributed to you alone, and that you act with your son-in-law, Mr. Huldrych, a man very similar to his father, so that since the father, evidently moved by the young man's good character and diligent progress in good arts, has decided to keep him in Zurich, as he has piously and carefully done so far, he may take care of him until the day of Saint Paul and consider these 25 Rhenish florins favorably for the present. For then (God willing) the father himself will come, who will fully satisfy him in all matters. Therefore, farewell, most kind Bullinger, and consider me your old Travers.</p>
      <p>Given in Zuoz, Engadin, on the 19th of November in the year 1555. From affection, most devoted to you, Johannes Travers.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a learned and pious man, ecclesiastical leader among the people of Zurich, a friend and brother to be respected.</p>
