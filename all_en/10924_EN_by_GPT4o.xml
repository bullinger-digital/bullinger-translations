    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the friendly response from July 1st to his letter from the previous year [No. 636] and sends as a pledge of the begun friendship Vadian's [Aphorismorum libri sex] "De consideratione eucharistiae". The doctrine of the sacraments contained therein will also satisfy Luther. Bucer and [Johannes] Zwick have reported on the understanding of the presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper as represented by the [Wittenbergers]; since the latter also reject the views opposed by the [Swiss], there is now agreement.</p>

      <p>Last year, I wrote to you, most learned Philipp, a letter in which I sought your friendship. I had added our commentaries on several of Paul's epistles, so that you might see in them our opinion on the common religion, lest perhaps, influenced by the unfavorable rumors of some, you might consider me unworthy of your friendship. Indeed, my effort was not without successful outcome. For you wrote a most gratifying letter on the first of July, in which you, with your humanity, bound yourself to me entirely with the bonds of friendship. I give you the greatest thanks for your most ready spirit towards me, and in return, I want you to promise me what a brother would from a most loving brother. Now, however, to strengthen the friendship that has begun, I send you here the books of the most learned Doctor Vadian on the consideration of the Eucharist, a literary gift and a pledge of the friendship begun. For I have no doubt that the opinion conceived about us, that we recognize only bare signs in the sacraments, has alienated the minds of many from us. However, you will see in these books how sacredly and religiously we speak of the sacraments. I think even Doctor Luther, who has deserved well of letters and piety, will desire nothing more. I have no doubt about your learning and modesty. Bucer and Zwick, dearest brothers in the Lord, have explained to us in many ways what your opinion is in this matter and how eloquently you exclude the local presence of the body of Christ, and finally all that which is not safe, because Christ is in one place in heaven circumscriptively, or which might seem contrary to the truth of Christ's humanity, again how frankly you admit that there is no union of the body of Christ with the bread here, but only a mystical one, nor is there any local inclusion or transubstantiation or carnal presence. For these are the things we have hitherto opposed, those we thought you defended; we have never denied the true presence of Christ. But if you read this book, I think you will say that we agree. Therefore, nothing else remains but that we all give thanks to the Lord and bring all the gifts of the mind here, so that the kingdom of Christ, our Lord, may be propagated as widely as possible, that we diligently cultivate the old friendship, that flesh and blood are truly eaten and drunk by a faithful mind, and that not only carnally, but spiritually, that is, that we are more and more united in the true spirit, in true mind and soul.</p>
