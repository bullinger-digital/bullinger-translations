    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer hopes that Bullinger has received the two letters [No. 2690 and No. 2698] sent to Attikon via his brother-in-law Gregor von Ulm at [Castle] Wellenberg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He has nothing new to report otherwise. According to a doubtful rumor, Count [Wilhelm] of Nassau is said to have taken the [County] of Katzenelnbogen, which belongs to the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Allegedly, the Elector Palatine [Friedrich II.] is with Emperor [Charles V.]. This does not promise anything good.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] A nobleman from Württemberg [...] has told Blarer that Duke [Ulrich of Württemberg] wants to reconcile with the Emperor if he may keep his faith. It is hoped that this is not true, although there are many indications that it is.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In Bavarian Munich, about 1000 Neapolitan riders have arrived for the Emperor. It is said that just as many will come again. The Emperor is strengthening himself and is raising new troops.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Enclosed is a letter from [Georg] Frölich with a request for return. He may have written something similar to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Oh, how dangerous the situation is, especially for Konstanz and many other cities! God has shown what consequences arise when one places hope and trust in the princes: Then nothing is achieved, but only greater danger is conjured up! People are slowly becoming anxious. Therefore, there is a greater willingness among them to improve their lives and to count on God's help.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger surely knows that Nördlingen has surrendered to the Emperor without resistance. From there, he can easily pursue the [Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The council of Konstanz has imposed a one percent tax on immovable and movable property and taxed each received florin with a kreuzer on wages. Those who have nothing must give two batzen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Greetings, also from [Thomas Blarer] and K[onrad] Z[wick]. Greetings also to the councilors and friends.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother, I have now sent you two letters through my dear brother-in-law Gregor von Ulm to Wellenberg in Attikon. I hope you have received them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have nothing new to write to you, other than what you already know. It is written here that Count of Nassau is said to have taken Katzenelnbogen from the Landgrave, but there is still some doubt about it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It is also said that the Elector Palatine is with the Emperor. This is not considered good.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>A nobleman from Württemberg has informed me that he is reliably informed that the Duke wants to reconcile with the Emperor if he can remain in his faith. We hope, however, that it is not true, although there are some suspicions based on reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In Munich, Bavaria, over 1000 Neapolitan riders have arrived for the Emperor. And just as many are said to come. He is also strengthening himself elsewhere, and people are concerned because he wants to raise fresh troops.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I am sending you herewith the letter from Lęti. Please send it back to me. Perhaps he has written everything to you himself.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Oh, my dear lord and brother, how dangerous the situation is! We and many cities are truly sitting in a great fire, and the danger is great. God has indeed shown us that too much trust has been placed in princes and great power, which is why nothing has been achieved, but instead, we have put ourselves in even greater danger. However, I can now rely much more on the faithful help and mighty hand of God. For people are beginning to feel the pressure, and more seriousness is being felt than before. When it is realized that all human help is lost, people will trust in God's help all the more and call upon Him with earnestness and a better life.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>You know well that the Emperor has taken Nördlingen. It surrendered without any resistance. From there, he can easily pursue us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The common penny has been imposed by us at 1 florin per hundred of capital, whether immovable or movable, household goods, small items, etc., and on wages, 1 kreuzer per florin. Those who have nothing give 2 batzen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>God be with you! Heartily praying for us. My dear brother, also cousin C[onrad] Z[wick] sends you friendly greetings. Dated in haste, December 8th. Greet all good lords and friends.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich, his greatest friend.</p>
