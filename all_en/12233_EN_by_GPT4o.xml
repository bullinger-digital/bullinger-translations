    <p xml:id="regest1">Welser thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received]. A German and Latin refutation of the [Louvain] articles by Bullinger will certainly be beneficial to the Church of Christ and reveal to all how the Antichrist collaborates with Satan. - [Charles V] wants to recognize the Council of Trent as a legitimate council in Worms, even though the [Papal] would be both judges and parties at the same time. The University of [Louvain] has already taken a position on this. - In contrast, the [Protestant] estates are holding firm, so that in the long run it could lead to disaster and war. May God prevent this and protect Bullinger and his followers.</p>

      <p>[M]y friendly, Christian service and all goodwill I send to you, dear Mr. Bullinger, in advance.</p>
      <p>I have received your letter with thanks, and I have no doubt that you will present the articles that have been issued against the Church of Jesus Christ with a German and Latin refutation from the Holy Scriptures, so that everyone can see how the Antichrist wants to maintain his realm against the truth of Jesus Christ with force in this world and thus increase and protect Satan's realm. May Almighty God grant His grace that these plans come to nothing, preserve His small flock, and that the congregation is daily increased.</p>
      <p>His Majesty wants to recognize the papal council in Trent, where 3 cardinals and 24 bishops are sent, as the legitimate council in Worms, even though they are both judges and parties. The University of Louvain has already made public what their decision will be.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the Christian estates are bravely standing firm. There is concern that this might still lead to disaster and war. May the Almighty prevent this, and protect you and your entire household in His grace from suffering and evil, and keep us all in faith in His Son Jesus Christ until the end, granting us eternal life. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given on June 20, in Augsburg, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Welser.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader in the word of Jesus Christ in Zurich, my beloved lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
