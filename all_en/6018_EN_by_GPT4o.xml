      <p>God with us, along with greetings to you, your and my old humble, yet willing service. I have nothing special to write to you.</p>
      <p>My gracious lord has kept his steward in Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>The cities of Nuremberg, Bamberg, Würzburg are supposed to take a nobleman, who has harmed Würzburg, into his castle, against which perhaps Saxony is preparing to oppose, in case the elector might be taken back, etc. Therefore, I cannot keep it from you in silence, that when I was greeted by you, I heard from Doctor Hans zum Bock, from Sultzer, and also from Doctor Martin Peyer, that many are asking whether some princes, Palatinate, Saxony, Württemberg, Hesse, and then 4 cities might want to enter into a peace with you, much is being said about whether this should be considered in advance.</p>
      <p>I have orally instructed my son to report to you at length, as you see fit, you will inform me. I will hurry back to you.</p>
      <p>Satan does not rest.</p>
      <p>With greetings from the housemother and everyone.</p>
      <p>Done on the 17th of January in the year 1564. Your entirely willing Johann Vogler.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger etc. to his own hands.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
