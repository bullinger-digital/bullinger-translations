      <p>Well-educated, pious and wise, especially gracious, dear sir, my willing service and all good things are prepared for you in advance. Therefore, I thank you most highly for your great and honorable gift, which you have given me through your dear son Christoph, with the offer to be indebted to you and yours according to my ability. And as I understood in your writing, how you desire to come into acquaintance with me, which greatly delights me, I kindly ask you to persist in such desire, offering myself to show you and yours love and service in all that is possible. I also most highly ask you to continue, as you have done so far, to help that the word and honor of God are promoted, especially now in this dangerous time, so that those are not pushed into the devil's jaws, as unfortunately some seem to do. May Almighty God, through His mercy, prevent such and grant us all grace, understanding, and power to overcome such until the end. We have no other news, except that the defeat of King Philip at Tripoli is confirmed. France is said to be negotiating peace with Scotland and is almost concluded.</p>
      <p>Several leaders and noblemen from Savoy have been captured by the Turks not far from Villefranche, for whose release he is said to have paid 12,000. Some places of the Confederation are said to ride into Valais to hinder their intentions.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God arrange everything for the best. May He keep you in grace.</p>
      <p>Dated Bern, June 27, 1560. To show you love and service, Hans Steiger.</p>
      <p>To the well-educated, pious, honorable, and wise lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the word of God of the church in Zurich, my gracious lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
      <p>Treasurer Steiger in Bern.</p>
