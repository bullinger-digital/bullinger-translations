    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the service rendered to his cousin [...]. Myconius has a very peculiar manner, but he has always been well-disposed towards Blarer; Bullinger will nevertheless defend Blarer as requested. Emperor [Charles V] is striving to expand the war against France; he wants to wrest Gelderland from Duke [William V] of Jülich[-Berg-Kleve] and likely aims to expel [Christian III] from Denmark and extend the war to evangelical cities and princes, while danger [from the Turks] looms; a plea for divine assistance. Bullinger would like to spare himself, but his numerous duties in the service of the Lord and the Church do not allow this. The Schwenckfeldian song [“A beautiful new song about the divinity and glory of our Lord Jesus Christ”] misinterprets the corporeality of Christ in a blasphemous manner; he will let Vadian know that, according to Blarer, this stupidity should not be answered, he himself has exposed some fallacies of Schwenckfeld in his [commentary] on John. Greetings; Gwalther has written himself and sent his [“Arguments of all chapters of both the Old and New Testaments”]. Thanks for the forwarded letter. Bullinger also groans under the burden of letter writing, but he always enjoys writing to Blarer. Best wishes. Theodor [Bibliander] cannot marvel enough at Schwenckfeld's blasphemy.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I thank you, brother in the Lord, esteemed and beloved, for the service rendered to your cousin. There is no reason for complaint. You have done enough for him. I require nothing more. May the Lord be your reward. If you have spent anything for his sake, I will repay it in good faith.</p>
      <p>Brother Myconius, venerable and dearest in the Lord, who writes to me very frequently, is accustomed to speak in such a way and has from his nature and old age a certain amount of peevishness, but to those who know him and to friends, it is not peevishness, but rather a peculiar manner of speaking. Otherwise, I certainly know that he has always held you in high regard and loved you not in a common way, nor has he ever had any sinister suspicion about you. Nevertheless, I will carry out what you have enjoined upon me with utmost faith, and that as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The news you have written to me is quite unfortunate. The Emperor, with his forces, strives to both pursue and renew the war against France, by which he will at the same time stir up many enemies against himself. He seeks to wrest the Duchy of Gelderland from Duke Wilhelm V of Jülich-Berg-Kleve, so that at some opportune moment he may also expel Christian III from the kingdom and bring war upon the evangelical cities and princes of Lower Germany; for he contemplates a monarchy, and indeed the French, German, and Spanish manners deserve a bloody war. The frog and the mouse fight vigorously, so that in the end they may become prey to the kite, according to the fable, and the Assyrian and Babylonian servant of the Lord threatens our necks. May the Lord deliver those who call upon His name with Lot from this fire. Amen.</p>
      <p>I would gladly take care of my health, my dearest brother Ambrosius, I would gladly spare myself, if only the times, the business, and the people would spare me.</p>
      <p>A burden has been placed on my shoulders to be borne until I collapse under it. Nor can I expect or hope for anything else, and indeed I would gladly fall for the name of my Lord and in the holy affairs of the church, if the Lord wills it, to whom I have offered my whole self.</p>
      <p>The Schwenckfeldian song and the name of the author and the author himself clearly reflect. A certain envy has erupted, by which he is plainly inflamed against the ministers.</p>
      <p>To this most foolish man, Christ according to the flesh is God, because he was conceived by the Spirit, from which only spirit can be born; to him, the flesh of Christ is far different from ours. May the Lord restrain the blasphemous mouth. I will send to Dr. Vadian, but I will add what you have deemed, that efforts should be placed on more useful things and that a fool should not be answered according to his folly. A few days and months ago, I dissolved his sophistical syllogisms in the first chapter of John and the third.</p>
      <p>All the brothers commend themselves to you, Megander, Pellicanus, Erasmus, Bibliander; Gwalther himself has written and sent you the Arguments of the Bible. I thank you for the letters of that friend and brother of yours; I return them. May the Lord grant us His peace.</p>
      <p>As for your complaint about the heavy burden of writing innumerable letters, I complain of the same; but I never write to you reluctantly, the easiest and most desired friend among mortals. I also know your fairness and humanity, and that you take all my things, even those overflowing with solecisms and poorly painted, in good part.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus preserve you and your family forever. In Zurich, on the penultimate day of February in the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Dr. Theodor could not sufficiently marvel at the extreme and extremely blasphemous madness of Schwenckfeld. For when he had read the song, he said, "Hardly anyone would have persuaded me that this man had reached such foolish reasoning, unless I had read it myself." May the Lord have mercy on him.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Ambrosius Blarer, the most vigilant bishop of the holy church of Constance, his incomparable friend and brother in the Lord.</p>
