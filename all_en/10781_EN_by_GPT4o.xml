    <p xml:id="regest1">Regarding the meeting of evangelical places of the Swiss Confederation held in Basel with a view to a concord of the churches of Germany, the people of St. Gallen can report more details. The people of Appenzell, as well as those from Glarus and Thurgau, were not invited due to the confessional stance of their authorities. In order to also reach an agreement with the Lutherans, the assembled theologians, at the request of the Strasbourg [Capito and Bucer], described in their [confession] articles, without deviating from the previous doctrine, baptism as the bath of regeneration and the sacrament of the meal as the body and blood of Christ using biblical words. They ask the people of Appenzell to support the concord and thereby contribute to the victory over the papacy.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace through Christ.</p>
      <p>Dearest brothers, we did not want to keep you unaware of the meeting that we had planned some time ago and have now finally celebrated in these days. We gathered around the thirtieth of January from the Swiss cities, which by God's grace and help still support the gospel even after the most severe defeat, in Basel. We discussed matters pertaining to the glory of the Lord and the common concord of the churches of Germany so pleasantly and unanimously, and brought them to a successful conclusion, as is hoped, that no one could fail to see that God was present among those who were gathered in His name. You can learn what these matters are and their nature from the brothers in St. Gallen. The time was too short to send you transcripts now.</p>
      <p>The reason we did not summon you, dearest brothers in the Lord, is solely due to your magistrate. For although he has not yet acted against the evangelical truth, he has acted too tepidly for us to dare to invite him to us as we did the leaders of the other cities. Certainly, if this had not been an obstacle, we are not so forgetful of you that we would have passed you by. For the same reason, we did not invite the people of Glarus or Thurgau, whom we nevertheless love sincerely in the Lord.</p>
      <p>However, so that you do not think anything here is feigned or pretended, receive in brief the account of the meeting and the whole matter. Concord among us first, and then also towards the so-called Lutherans, convened the synod. We would wish, as is fitting, that the minds of all, as evangelical instruction commands, agree in the Lord, if it can be done in any way, so that the name of God may be rightly glorified among us. Therefore, during the proceedings, we aimed at this one thing, that our doctrine be preserved in the same truth of the Lord with Luther and his associates. Hence, the matter was brought to this point, that with the articles set forth, not deviating even a little from the formula of teaching so far, we would use moderate words at the request of the people of Strasbourg in favor of Luther and his followers. This was not burdensome, because both Christ and Paul used the same, and we, when it happened so, never avoided it.</p>
      <p>These are, however, that we call baptism the bath of regeneration, and the sacrament of the meal the body and blood of Christ. Yet this is only with the declaration that we have used up to now.</p>
      <p>After it was requested by the brothers from Strasbourg, it was not permissible to refuse unless we would have had to retract what we have taught so far, we complied. This will be clearly understood from the articles seen and well considered.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dearest brothers, we earnestly urge, if it should ever happen that the matter of concord is pursued and brought to you as well, that you pursue that which is primarily for God, and then also for ecclesiastical concord, so that ultimately this may also follow, that the wicked and harmful papal worship with Satan may be forced to retreat and go into the eternal abyss to the glory of God and our Lord Jesus and the salvation of souls.</p>
      <p>Farewell always through Christ and pray for us mutually.</p>
      <p>Basel, 5th February 1536.</p>
      <p>The brothers of the Basel assembly, yours.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious ministers of Christ in Appenzell, dearest brothers in the Lord.</p>
