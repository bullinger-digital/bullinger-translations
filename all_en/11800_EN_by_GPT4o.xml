    <p xml:id="regest1">Wigand [Happel] has recommended himself beyond Bullinger's recommendation through his manners and talents; Blarer would have liked to devote himself more to him, but the arrival of messengers forced him - as often before - to write urgent letters; Bullinger should apologize to Happel on his behalf. As previously noted [No. 1748], Bucer's engagement [in the Archbishopric of Cologne] is to be appreciated in view of the situation there; sends the second part of his writing ["What in the name of the holy gospel... is taught and preached in Bonn..."]; is looking forward to Bullinger's [commentary on] John, which he cannot reciprocate with something similar. Sends letters from Augsburg, otherwise there is no news; the rumor of the Emperor's death turned out to be false. Greetings. Inquires whether Bullinger can recommend a successor for Bonifacius [Wolfhart] to Augsburg.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Wigand [Happel] has recommended himself to us beyond your recommendation through his own manners and talents, and I wish I could have been present for his desires! Certainly, I would not have allowed him to lack anything in our service.</p>
      <p>But, as is my misfortune, I am repeatedly distracted by such affairs that, having no regard for me, cannot be postponed to another time for their completion, but as soon as I am free, they press me urgently. I mean this writing of letters, which, as soon as the messengers arrive - and they do so often and at inconvenient times - pulls me away, however much I am intent on other things, so that I can be neither my own nor of others who are present. Therefore, friends and brothers who arrive always have something to forgive me for in my not fully performed duty. Wigand, this very excellent young man, will also forgive, and is clearly worthy of being treated most kindly by all good and learned men; he will do this more willingly if you have advocated for me here.</p>
      <p>Regarding Bucer, I write the same as before, that he could have handled many things differently and should have, if we consider the matter itself, but given the situation of the place where he acts and the people, whom you know, it should be considered favorably what he wrote, since it is certain that he seeks the glory of the Lord with all his heart and is far from all malice. I send the latter part of that booklet, which you will also return when it is convenient. We eagerly await what you promise concerning John. Meanwhile, it greatly pains us that we, miserable and barren, have nothing with which we can reciprocate to you, and may the Lord soon provide us with some opportunity to do so!</p>
      <p>Nothing is indeed more desired by us, who are already bound to you by so many names. May the Lord himself be your great reward in heaven.</p>
      <p>I send the letters I recently received from Augsburg; besides that, there is nothing now that greatly concerns you to know. Everything is quite peaceful with us.</p>
      <p>It is now certain to us that the rumor of the Emperor's death was false. My brother and Zwik and the rest of our friends and ministers in the Lord send you many greetings and commend themselves to you. May the Lord and our common Savior Christ keep you and all yours safe, strong in faith and fervent in spirit for a very long time. Amen. Greet on my behalf the best brothers Pellican, Gwalther, Theodor, Megander, and Fabricius, whose most pious prayers I wholeheartedly wish to be aided by before the Lord. Farewell, my heart and soul in the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, June 15, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>If by chance you know any good and learned man who could be appointed in the place of the excellent Bonifacius, do not conceal it from me; for in every way I desire to consult for the church of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and truly greatest friend. In Zurich.</p>
