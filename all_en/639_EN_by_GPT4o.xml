      <p>Greetings. The guest in Balstall, if I remember correctly, fed two for about ten days. They were dressed in the woolen silk in the manner of Italians and Spaniards. Afterwards, they set out together towards Baden; they spent the night in a certain village not far from Aarau. They agreed that they would set out at the third hour in the morning, so that the heat would not trouble them.</p>
      <p>Thus it happened. After they had set out for a while, those two stabbed the guest with a dagger, taking from him money, a horse, and whatever else they could carry. There was a fisherman on the Aare, who, when he heard the groans and wailing, at first thought it was the voice of some ghost; but finally, having brought his boat closer, he discovered that a robbery had been committed; however, the robbers had fled. It is said that a few days before, they had passed through here on horses.</p>
      <p>Like for like. They seem to be preludes, as you divine, of future evils. May the Lord, whom we confess, be with us.</p>
      <p>The Emperor wanted the Belgians to swear allegiance to his son; when they refused, he found this: the oath should not be valid until after his death, and thus he persuaded them. The reason seems to many to be that the son is foolish, and the father feared they would not fulfill the oath if he himself died. He will return again to Brussels to seek the Bayeux Tapestry. Thus the consul of Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>The people of Strasbourg, who delay whatever needs to be done with the bishop, almost fear that the Emperor will come to them at some point.</p>
      <p>Therefore, many good men are thinking of migrating, some of whom have also spoken with me.</p>
      <p>I asked the courier about the Grisons drowned in Lake Zurich; he replied that he had not heard a single word. I was surprised; then he said: "I will not argue; for I am rarely at home; meanwhile, many things happen that do not reach me." There is nothing more.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all your family and brothers. In Basel, hastily, August 19, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
