    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] There is no news except the death of the English King Henry VIII on January 28, the proclamation of his son Edward VI as king on the following Monday [January 31], and the coronation planned for the past Sunday [February 20].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] One or two weeks before Henry's death, he allegedly ordered (in his will) the arrest of the Duke of Norfolk [Thomas Howard] and his son [Henry Howard], Earl of Surrey. It is said to be certain that both were beheaded.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] According to Henry's will and the corresponding decision of Parliament, the country is to be governed by 16 lords (including eight bishops) until Edward comes of age. The most important figure among them is [Edward Seymour], Earl of Hertford, the brother of Edward's mother [Jane Seymour]. He was appointed Lord Protector and is a declared enemy of the priests and the Pope [Paul III] in Rome.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It was written to Hilles from Erfurt that Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, after unsuccessfully besieging Leipzig with 30,000 soldiers, withdrew from there and set up his camp five miles away, less than four miles from the camp of Duke Maurice of Saxony, on whose side King Ferdinand I and Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach stand. The Elector is supported by King Christian of Denmark and the Saxon cities of Bremen, Hamburg, Braunschweig, and others, so that both parties seem to be equally strong, and a massacre is to be feared if no agreement is reached.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It was also reported from Erfurt that envoys of Henry VIII and Francis I of France have been negotiating with the councilors of the Elector and the Saxon cities in Hamburg since Christmas, and even the Danish king has participated. The results of the negotiations are not yet known.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Blessings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [P.S.:] Hilles would have written earlier about the verified news from England if his business had allowed it. Even if Bullinger has already been informed in the meantime, Hilles encloses a copy of a letter [from England] addressed to a compatriot [John Hooper], which Hilles forwarded to Basel, as that compatriot no longer resides in Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings to the brothers in faith, to Bullinger's wife Anna, née Adlischwyler, and to John Burcher's wife [Adelheit, née Knüpli]. Bullinger should inform the latter that Burcher recently wrote from Cologne that he had arrived there well with his goods and would travel on to Dutch Dordrecht within ten days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings.</p>

      <p>There is no news to write to you about, except that it is true that our king in England died on the 28th day of January, and on the following Monday his only son was proclaimed and accepted as king in the land, as was proper, and he was publicly crowned this past Sunday, as I have been reliably informed from England. This young king is now called Edward the Sixth by name.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>About a week or two before the aforementioned King Henry died, he (through his will, some say) ordered the arrest of a duke, who is called the Duke of Norfolk in the land, and his only son with him, who was named the Earl of Surrey in England. The duke and his son are both said to have been beheaded for certain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The governance of England is, according to the king's will and subsequently confirmed by parliament or diet, now in the power of sixteen lords in the land (until the young king comes of age). It is said that eight of them should be bishops. The foremost lord among them all is not a bishop, but the young king's uncle or mother's brother. He has been appointed as the chief protector or governor of the king, his nephew, and of the whole land; and this tutor of the young king is called the Earl of Hertford and is not very favorable to the priests, but rather a great enemy of the Pope in Rome.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Now, if I knew that you were not already aware of it, I would also write to you now what was written to me on the 15th of this month from Erfurt, namely that the Elector of Saxony, after having besieged Leipzig with thirty thousand men on horseback and on foot for three weeks and not being able to take the city (although he had shot at it badly and damaged many houses), has withdrawn from there with all his forces and is now camped five miles away from Leipzig, and Duke Maurice is camped with his forces not four miles away from him, and with him are King Ferdinand and the Margrave of Kulmbach. But with the Duke of Saxony are the King of Denmark and the Saxon cities such as Bremen, Hamburg, Brunswick, and some others, so that it is thought that they are a party almost as strong as the others, and if they do not make peace soon (as some hope they will), there will be a battle.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It was further written to me from Erfurt that the envoys of the King of England and the King of France have been together since Christmas in Hamburg with the Elector of Saxony and the aforementioned Saxon cities, and that the King of Denmark himself was also personally present with them. But what they have done or decided among themselves, time will reveal.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>With this, I commend you to God Almighty. May He finally grant us a good and lasting peace everywhere. Amen. Your willing servant Richard Hilles from England.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord Jesus, our Savior and hope! Regarding the news, which I have recently received here from England as most certain, my most esteemed lord, I would have written to you now with my own letters, had I not been so occupied with other business, as often happens. In the meantime, however, so that you may not learn nothing from me, about which I think you have already been informed by others a few days ago, I send to your piety a copy of some letters, which I recently sent from Strasbourg to a compatriot of mine now residing in Basel.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Give my most affectionate regards to all your brothers, colleagues in the Lord, and to your most pious wife, and to the wife of John Burcher, and tell her that I recently received letters from Cologne, by which I was informed that he had arrived there safely with all his goods and had set sail from there towards Dordrecht in Holland with the same goods ten days ago.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Given on the 25th day of February 1547. By your Ri. H.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished and highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, my kind friend, the foremost preacher in Zurich.</p>
