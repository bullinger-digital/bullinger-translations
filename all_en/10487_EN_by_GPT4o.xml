    <p xml:id="regest1">Helped the recommended ones. Holds Bullinger in high esteem. The Duke Ulrich will certainly read Bullinger's letters, as he thinks well of Bullinger. Philipp Melanchthon has not yet arrived. Osiander is staying in Stuttgart and is pleased with Bullinger's agreement with Bucer. Contrary to rumors, Blarer does not arrange anything that is not proper. Agrees with Bullinger's doctrine of the Lord's Supper. He will return to the reference to faithful preachers later. Some from the Confederation have been admitted. Thanks for a second letter and a booklet. Johannes Wagner will report news from Württemberg. Duke Ulrich is in Wildbad. The people are joining the Gospel. The theologians of the university, except for Balthasar Käufelin, are fighting against the truth. Blarer's retraction in the doctrine of the Lord's Supper is a lie of the opponents. He refrains from a public justification to avoid further conflict. Rejoices that Bullinger and Leo Jud are appeased regarding the Württemberg Concord.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Those whom you so earnestly recommended to me in your letters, dearest Bullinger, esteemed brother in Christ, I have assisted with whatever counsel I could. And would that I could have helped them in reality as much as I wished! The good men would have clearly understood how much Bullinger's recommendation means to me. Indeed, my brother, I hold you in the highest regard, or rather, I hold the Lord and His excellent gifts in you, which you so beneficially provide to the churches, and I pray greatly that you may grow daily even greater with the increase of His heavenly spirit.</p>
      <p>Regarding your recent letters to the prince, I have nothing to write. He was certainly occupied with countless affairs when I delivered them to him, so that he did not even have time to read them. However, I do not doubt that he has read them since. I will find out on some occasion whether they pleased him. He thought well of your intellect and your learning and sound faith in Christ, and now even better, after I informed him of all your matters. Philipp Melanchthon has not yet arrived, but Osiander recently came to Stuttgart, where I think he will stay for a while until the prince returns. He is now of a more modest spirit than he was at one time. He recently wrote to Bucer among other things: "I hear from others too that Bullinger subscribes to your opinion. If this is without deceit, I am even more pleased."</p>
      <p>What you urge, that I should not design anything beyond Christian decorum for the favor of men, you do rightly, and so my mind is set, whatever the most vain rumors of the most vain men may spread about me. I have previously written to you how much I like your confession on the matter of the Lord's Supper. Some would have wished that you had taken as much effort to show that the body of Christ is also exhibited here, as you took to prove that the bread is not the body, which no one affirms. What you indicate, that there are some faithful ministers of the word there, is good. For they will be useful to us in due time. For now, more are flocking than can be provided for, and it is still uncertain who and how many are ready to be sent. In the meantime, however, one or two from the Swiss Confederation have been received, so that they may not falsely accuse us of not accepting any of them.</p>
      <p>But now to your other letter, where first I give you the greatest thanks I can for sending me a part of your booklet, which I have not been able to examine thoroughly due to my occupations, but I judge it to be pious and learned as all your works, with the greatest pleasure.</p>
      <p>What is happening with us, Johannes Wagner will faithfully report to you here. The prince is still at Wildbad. The people here are joining the Gospel of Christ in considerable numbers. Among the theologians, there is only one, Balthasar Käufelin, with whom I agree. The rest, all together, attack the truth and, as much as they can, fight against it. And you can easily imagine, my brother, in what a filthy stable I am involved and that I have to clean out the Augean stable, where not just one Hercules is needed, although Christ daily adds enough courage and strength to me, and the success of my efforts is not unfortunate. Thanks be to Christ, who always triumphs through us. Intercede for me diligently with your church in pious prayers, that we may always advance better in the good things begun, even to the end.</p>
      <p>Regarding my alleged retraction, I write nothing else except that it is most impudently fabricated by the enemies of the truth, as many other things are. I would publicly clear myself, except that such deeds would then worsen again. You well understand the first principle of our concord, which I indeed greatly rejoiced that it does not displease you, a man of great judgment. I also greatly rejoice, as you write, that Leo Jud is now appeased. Greet him, Pellican, and the other fellow ministers, especially Theodor, lovingly and in a Christian manner in my name, and commend me to them most carefully.</p>
      <p>Farewell, always to be respected and revered Bullinger, and love me constantly and uniquely, as you do.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, October 5.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and incomparable man in learning, Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
