      <p>To the most illustrious prince and lord, Lord Heinrich von Bourbon, Prince of Cond√©, my most gracious lord.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus, our only savior, bless you, most illustrious prince and most gracious lord, and keep you and yours from all evil. The most honorable man and lord, to be honored with perpetual respect, the noble Lord of Beauvais, has faithfully and diligently conveyed to me the commands of your grace with that integrity of his, along with the letters of your grace to me, and for these and the prompt willingness of your grace's spirit, I give the greatest thanks I can, ready in all things and in all duties to show myself grateful to your grace. However, I would not want your grace to doubt my zeal in aiding and promoting the welfare of the French churches and all of yours, as far as my limited ability allows. Certainly, among our people, I will not neglect any opportunity to press the holy cause, as your grace requests, and what I promised to Lord of Beauvais, I will also write to Bern, Glarus, Schaffhausen, and Chur in Rhaetia to my individual friends, men of authority, urging them not to fail in their duty in restoring holy peace, etc. I also beseech your grace through Christ the Lord, who singularly commended peace and love to us, to continue doing what your grace is doing and not to be swayed by the suggestions of those advising otherwise, but rather to prefer seeking peace than to try the matter by arms. For I do not doubt that military men prefer war to peace, as they seek more from war than the safety of the kingdom and religion. For many of them, having been despoiled of their possessions, aspire to despoil their enemies in turn and thus restore themselves to wholeness, uncertain in the meantime whether things will turn out for them as they think and desire, nor considering here how much harm to innocent people this might cause. Indeed, it is to be feared that soldiers of our side, corrupted by prolonged war, have devised and still devise many things unworthy of our profession, by which they have provoked and daily provoke the indignation of God, the just avenger of crimes, who may deliver them and us together with them into the hands of the enemy. Truly memorable is the sentence of Achior, the leader of the Ammonites, in the book of Judith, saying to Holofernes, the chief of the royal army: "Inquire whether there is any iniquity against God in this people; if there is, we will conquer them without difficulty; but if there is no offense of this people against their God, we will not be able to resist them. For their God will defend them, and we will be a reproach to the whole earth."</p>
      <p>Therefore, it does not seem to be the part of prudent men to entrust the safety of the country and the preservation of pure religion to impure men and those who do not value religion highly.</p>
      <p>But experience itself has taught us over the course of 50 whole years that wars undertaken under the pretext of religion, although there have been not a few good men in the camps, have not turned out very successfully. For no one is ignorant of what followed from the peasant war that arose in almost all of Germany. What benefit the Swiss civil war brought us, in which so many excellent men fell and religion also suffered not a little in many places, good men still feel and lament. The Protestant war in Germany raised the crests of the adversaries and strengthened the idols and brought not a few evils into the church. Furthermore, what has been accomplished by those civil wars in your France, grief forbids to recount. Hence it seems (thus the matter being moderated by the Lord himself) that experience itself teaches us to seek peace rather than war. What is more, we see the affairs of the once most flourishing kingdom of France brought to such a state by those long and very serious civil wars, that if we continue to restore or continue the war, we will soon see the country utterly ruined. And even then the churches will not be helped, nor will the miserable be relieved, who otherwise, having been too much afflicted and broken hitherto, will collapse completely with little impulse.</p>
      <p>If this happens, what then will we answer to our Lord God, who entrusts to us the most careful care of the church, and not to disturb it anywhere, and who requires of us to help the miserable, widows, orphans, and the afflicted?</p>
      <p>However, if a faithful and diligent pursuit of peace and a serious request for peace have achieved nothing with the king or his counselors, there is no doubt that the minds of all the best people must be moved to compassion for the peacemakers, whom our Lord calls the children of God, and to indignation against the children of the devil who reject peace and conspire for slaughter and arson. But the true and just Lord, who promised help to the afflicted peacemakers and has never failed the afflicted, will then inspire a wise counsel, whether it is to be decided by the sword or by some other wise counsel to help in desperate matters, etc.</p>
      <p>Above all, however, it seems that then, as always, the Lord must be earnestly and continually prayed to, that, just as he once kindly inclined the mind of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, to the requests of Nehemiah and Ezra, so now also he may soften the minds of the king of France and his counselors to grant a place for peace and true religion. For I do not judge any peace to be accepted that excludes and condemns true religion.</p>
      <p>I pray to our Lord God, the prince of peace, that he may grant peace to France and use you, most illustrious prince, as a vessel of mercy to obtain, restore, and preserve it, and that he may bless you eternally and keep and preserve you in the observance of true religion. I also ask that your grace forgive me for daring to trouble your grace with a somewhat lengthy letter, being otherwise entirely at your grace's service, if I can serve your grace in any way, to whom I commend myself.</p>
      <p>My colleague and relative, the beloved Lord Rudolf Gwalther, also commends himself to your grace and offers all his services to your grace, as do my other co-ministers and brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 8, in the year of our Lord 1575.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your grace, Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich.</p>
