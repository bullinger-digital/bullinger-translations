    <p xml:id="regest1">The Bible gifted by Bullinger has greatly pleased him, and Bullinger's [not received] response to his question [regarding ghost apparitions, No. 1868], in which he cites scripture passages as well as Chrysostom and other Church Fathers, is helpful to him; he will show his gratitude according to his modest means. As Bullinger knows from Comander's letter [No. 1880], Veit [Kappeler the Younger] is being dismissed from the teaching service due to drinking and other bad habits; Travers requests help in finding a successor. He recommends the school administrator [Monastery Bailiff Hans Tscharner], who is delivering this letter; he will pay the printer [Christoph Froschauer] for the [ordered by Travers] commentaries on Matthew and John [Bullinger's - HBBibl I 144 and 153f]. He asks to encourage his son [Johannes Travers] to continue his diligent studies.</p>

      <p> Greetings. Upon receiving and reading the richly printed booklet of Holy Scripture from you, most vigilant man, it would be exceedingly difficult to express how much my spirit was refreshed. Equally pleasing was your resolution on the presented question, whose orthodox writings and the cited passages of the Church Fathers, Chrysostom and others, I found to fit perfectly. I will not neglect to present it to those who hold contrary opinions. May you not be burdened by any tedium for the sake of aiding our reading. Even if the due compensation for your labors, expended in the extinguishing of our desires, does not follow, I will ensure that you cannot accuse me entirely of ingratitude. Meanwhile, I offer you, most pious Bullinger, immortal thanks, for you consider me, a crawling worm, of such importance, from whom you can expect nothing but a grateful and ever-loving spirit towards you. - Furthermore, regarding the administration of our school, as our dearest brother Comander has indicated in his letters, I beg you to exert your efforts so that this most holy endeavor, which is more than necessary for the republic, does not yield to the wishes of adversaries. However, that Vitus, whose services we have used for some time thanks to you, is often overwhelmed by wine and displays very disordered manners, which are extremely harmful to the growing youth, as Comander has thoroughly informed you. Moved by these issues, we have dismissed Vitus from the teaching position; therefore, we are in need of a good successor. Help, as you always do. The bearer of this letter, the administrator of our school, will release your commentaries on John and Matthew from the printer, whom I commend to you from the heart. Farewell. Continue to encourage my son with good exhortations to pursue his studies diligently, as is your custom. Farewell again. From Zuoz, April 20, 1544. </p>
      <p> How small I am, yet entirely yours, Johannes Travers the Elder. </p>
      <p> To the most vigilant Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zurich church, a man learned and pious alike, and a most beloved brother. </p>
