      <p>S. J. D. I promised in my last letter, most distinguished man, that if I received any news from our Oporinus, I would gladly share it with you. However, just as he returned to us empty of money (due to the wickedness of the fairs), he also returned completely devoid of any new matters, as did all the other printers. Nevertheless, he brought the terms of the peace made between the Emperor and the Margrave of Brandenburg, of which I have briefly extracted the main points for you, to fulfill my promise. I am also sending a poem written by a certain supporter of the Emperor, in which the Emperor laments the calamity of these times and explains the reasons for the war he undertook through Germany, though not without great pretense. Many come daily, who had previously served under the Emperor, yet they proclaim various things inconsistently; for some say that money is lacking, others that a plague is raging more than enough in the Emperor's camps, some that the soldiers cannot endure the harshness of winter, some that the siege of Metz was attempted once and again in vain, yet not without great slaughter of the Emperor's forces, while others claim that the entire siege has been lifted (which I certainly do not doubt to be false). We have heard nothing from Austria for a long time, but we expect letters from Wolfgang Lazius any day now. I have not left my house for almost three weeks due to bodily infirmity. As a result, I have nothing else that I consider worth writing. Farewell, most illustrious man, and continue to love your Lycosthenes, whom you once accepted into the company of friends. Given in Basel on the 14th day before the calends of January in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] sincerely, Konrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich and most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
