      <p> S. D. Our Gregory Mangold today reported to me that you, dearest brother in the Lord, are struggling with a very dangerous illness. This has made me very concerned, not because I begrudge you that blessed tranquility, but because I believe it would be more beneficial for the church if you recover from the illness and serve the Lord longer in the holy ministry of the church. Therefore, I pray to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He may restore you to us as soon as possible and equip your mind with such abilities that you may benefit many greatly. Within not so many years, excellent minds have departed from here, and I do not know what kind have succeeded them. Pride and ambition lead many astray; the pursuit of contention suppresses great talents in many, and the pursuit of pleasure undermines not a few. Therefore, we see the church involved in dissensions, and everyone, without careful selection, blurts out what they want. </p>
      <p> If we had moderate minds that aimed at the glory of God and the edification of the churches, there would be far fewer contentions. Hence, I cannot help but grieve from the heart whenever I see agreeable minds departing and irritable ones, desiring nothing more than quarrels, taking their place. We truly live in a very corrupt age. If only we would earnestly pray to the Lord to relieve the weary matters. </p>
      <p> You would do me a great favor if you would inform me that you have recovered through the power of Almighty God. May He bless you, restore you to us, and keep you. I do not wish to trouble you with a lengthy letter, as you are already quite ill. You belong to the Lord, look to the Lord in all things; the Lord has delivered you, He will also save you. In this, farewell eternally along with your entire household. May the brothers be safe, especially Mr. Consul Vulpius. I pray that you never forget the brother of my wife, the scribe from Rinfeld; for there is such an abundance of scribes here that he has no hope left. </p>
      <p> Zurich, December 3, 1555. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. </p>
      <p> I commend to you this Mr. Francis, a Greek man from Corfu and of great renown among the Poles. He wishes to speak with you and become acquainted; he is a pious and humane man. </p>
      <p> He can report more and certain things about Polish affairs. I love him for his sincerity; he lived with us for several months. Farewell again. </p>
      <p> To the most honorable Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, the most faithful pastor of the church in Biel/Bienne, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Biel/Bienne. </p>
