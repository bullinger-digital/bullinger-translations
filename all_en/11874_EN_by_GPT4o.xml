    <p xml:id="regest1">It is written that in Speyer, accommodations for Emperor [Charles V] and the [envoys] from Strasbourg are already prepared, but the Imperial Diet will probably not be opened before Epiphany; perhaps it is not just a rumor that the French Queen [Claude] and [Crown Prince Henry] also intend to come there; the Gospel is in great danger, but Christ will support the Church if we remain faithful to Him. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. A certain person writes about the Imperial Diet, stating that the Emperor indeed has prepared accommodations for himself and his entourage in Speyer, and the same has been done by the people of Strasbourg. However, it does not seem to him that the Diet will convene before Epiphany; perhaps it will appear then with more certainty. There is a rumor that the Queen of France, along with her other son, intends to come to the Diet. If this happens, divine providence knows what might become of the Gospel. Hence, there are those who believe nothing less than it being a mere rumor. The evil one (the devil) rages against the Gospel, and his members rage much more cruelly; ἀκηδία (spiritual sloth) has very disgracefully taken hold of us, for which reason I expect nothing but evil. In the meantime, I know that the Church of Christ will not be abandoned, but the body must suffer once. Therefore, we need certainty in our doctrine and much strength of spirit, so that we can endure in temptations. Therefore, the people must be urged to be diligent and laborious in amending their lives, and to be studious and faithfully constant in imploring the Lord continuously; for if this is not done, we will all perish.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord with your family and Theodor. Basel, December 16, before dawn, in the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
