      <p>Greetings. I had written a letter to you, most kind Mr. Bullinger, and when I thought you had received it, it was returned to me. I do not know whether the messenger forgot it at the inn or if the innkeeper did not give it to him. However, it contained nothing else except that I was informing you with great sorrow that the faithful servant of Christ, Mr. Simpert, passed away on September 16th early in the morning around the second hour in my presence. But I can neither write nor do I want to write more about his death; for I do not doubt that it has long been reported to you. What inconvenience will return to our church from this (unless the Lord graciously averts all evils), we can easily conjecture. Some not insignificant men have so far tried to impose on our church men, our citizens, who are indeed sufficiently learned, but do not agree with us on the matter of the Eucharist; but they could achieve nothing. Meanwhile, the elders of our church are accused of not being able to bear learned men, not adding those who disagree with the church and its ministers. Now they have changed their opinion; they pretend or rather simulate to agree with us; therefore, the first almost of our city will perhaps try to summon them at some time. But the Lord knows what will happen.</p>
      <p>Grübelius and I approached our magistrate, offered ourselves to act in Simpert's place for a year on the condition that the designated stipend goes to the widow and orphans left behind, of whom there are 7. We obtained this; thus, in the span of a year, there is nothing to fear (with God's help) for our church. What kind of intrigues and machinations (unless the Lord has scattered the plans of some who have a taste for Lutheranism) will arise, the elapsed year will indicate, and whoever lives will see wonders. May the Lord protect His church from all the snares of the wicked, who hope to act in such a way that some faithful ministers are driven out. I ask you, with all pious and learned men, to have our quite desolate church (which you have done so far) diligently commended to you. The Lord will be the rewarder.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write except what is already well known to you, about the death of the Bishop of Constance, the presence of Bolviler, and that the Council of Trent is not proceeding, which a certain count recited while passing through here. Farewell in the Lord with yours.</p>
      <p>Greet on my behalf Mr. Gwalther, Wolf, your sons-in-law, and sons, etc. If you have anything and it is convenient, nevertheless write to me.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, September 21, 1561.</p>
      <p>Devoted to your kindness, Jakob Rüeger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious, most learned, and most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich and a vigorous servant of the Lord, his much esteemed brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich.</p>
