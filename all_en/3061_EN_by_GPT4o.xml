      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I have nothing to write at the moment. We are reading your sermons on the Apocalypse, and we are very pleased with this work of yours. As much as it is within our power, we will not fail to have it printed here. However, we are waiting for the preface and your letters to the school authorities. A joint consultation will be held in their presence, and then you will also receive a response. I also received the booklet you sent and thank you for it. I see what the people of Basel dare to do, even though the printer has not added his name, and the author's name is also fictitious. In the meantime, we are surprised that Ochino's booklet on purgatory in German was suppressed by the people of Zurich because of a few words.</p>
      <p>However, it is true that the Latin words offend less than the German ones, as they are not understood by everyone, nor do I think that Froschauer fears our local people as much as the loss he could incur in Frankfurt if it were published under his name.</p>
      <p>We have no news of any new developments. This week, several Swiss cohorts passed through here; it is surprising if more do not perish from the cold, as most are so poorly clothed and have neither food nor money. I hear that new troops will soon be arriving. May the Lord do with them what seems good to Him.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Musculus, my mother, and my wife send their greetings to you; may all your family be well.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 13, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful of the Zurich church, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>December 13, 1556.</p>
