    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's greeting and all his good deeds. The authorities of Solothurn are forcing the Reformers to attend Mass, which they refuse. Therefore, they are prohibited from pursuing their livelihood. Requests to keep a copy of the commentary on Peter's letters. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace from God through Christ Jesus. Amen. Along with my humble, always willing service to you, as always, dear godfather and beloved teacher.</p>
      <p>I humbly thank you for the friendly greeting with the token (sign), which is a Venetian one, and also for all other good deeds shown to me by God through you, etc.</p>
      <p>I truly let you know that the authorities in Solothurn have demanded and commanded the Christian people residing there to receive the sacrament like the Papists, etc., which they absolutely refuse to do, even if it means suffering death for it. Therefore, they are prohibited from all gain and trade and thus brought down. This happened in the week before Palm Sunday, etc.</p>
      <p>You also want to keep a copy of Peter's letters for me. I will fetch it in May, God willing. Greet your household and all the brothers for me.</p>
      <p>Given on the eve of Palm Sunday in the year, etc. 34.</p>
      <p>Georg Distel, your most obedient.</p>
      <p>To the faithful and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, etc.</p>
