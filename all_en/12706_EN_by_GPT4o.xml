    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Sebastian Schertlin, captain of the city of Augsburg, returned to Augsburg on October 13 on the orders of his lords, facing great danger from the [Schmalkaldic] main army. Since then, he has launched many attacks on the roaming enemies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] On October 18, he stole eight supply wagons and five carts of provisions from the Emperor [Charles V.] and brought them to Augsburg. The drivers were released, the horses sold, and the loot distributed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] On October 20, Schertlin ventured as far as Rain [am Lech] in Bavaria, where he ambushed and defeated 200 imperial [cavalry] on a looting expedition. He captured several horses and men and brought them to Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] On October 21, he confiscated two supply wagons.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Augsburg authorities erected a gallows at the fish market, where anyone spreading frightening rumors, inciting mutiny, or acting dishonestly shall be hanged. The council and citizens are becoming braver and want nothing to do with the Pope [Paul III.].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] When some [Schmalkaldic] cavalry rode out from the main camp [near Giengen an der Brenz] with the storm flag for feeding, they were attacked by 2000 imperial forces and driven back to the camp. Despite several dead and captured, no great damage was done. The enemy [Italian] and German mercenaries captured the flag and tore it to pieces in a dispute. However, in the immediate rescue operation [by the Schmalkaldic forces], the imperial forces suffered considerable losses.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] After the great skirmish on the 16th [and 17th] of October, a merchant was sent to the imperial camp to scout the situation. He learned that the Emperor lost four of his best men, namely [Gian Giacomo de' Medici, Castellan of] Musso, a Count of Bremen, [Vladislaus] von Bernstein, and the old [Hans Gaudenz von] Madruzzo. When the landgrave's troops fiercely attacked the imperial forces, fearing defeat, Madruzzo rushed to their aid with 17 companies. He was shot and died. The bodies of the four mentioned gentlemen were brought to Dillingen with 200 horses and buried there. To avoid panic in the camp, the Emperor spread the rumor that he had sent them to Dillingen for [medical treatment] and rest. Of the 12,000 Italians, not much more than 4,000 are said to remain in the camp; some have deserted, the majority have fallen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Allegedly, the Bohemians want to invade the land of the Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony, which is why Duke Maurice of Saxony wants to take it himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The Elector [of Saxony] and Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] wrote the following from the field camp near Giengen to Ulm on October 31: When they sent out several cavalry squadrons against the enemies the day before, the enemies did not show themselves, so [the Schmalkaldic forces] turned back. But later in the afternoon, the enemies emerged and drove away the [Schmalkaldic] sentries. The Landgrave then sent out three chamberlains, while Field Marshal Wilhelm von Schachten and his lieutenant, Georg von der Malsburg, with about 20 horsemen, pushed the enemy back again. But when the opponent noticed the small number [of Schmalkaldic forces], he attacked again, but [Count Arnold von] Eisenberg-[Grenzau?] and Daniel Scheuerschloss were able to repel him again with a few horsemen. The enemies then brought about 300 horsemen for reinforcement, but the [Schmalkaldic forces] deployed an additional 20 arquebusiers and drove them away despite being outnumbered, even before a [further Schmalkaldic] reinforcement arrived. Such a serious battle has rarely occurred in the war so far. The enemies suffered great losses, including high-ranking [military officers], of whom three nobly dressed remained on the battlefield, while several others could be recovered by the enemies. The [Schmalkaldic forces] suffered only minor damages; Konrad von Rheden, who wore no armor, and the Field Marshal's best horse were lost.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The Konstanz [council] reported on November 3 based on a [copy of a] letter from Ulm dated November 1, that on the morning of October 31, the Emperor set out from his camp [near Sontheim an der Brenz] in dense fog with an unspecified destination. He had his large artillery transported on the Danube to Ingolstadt and Regensburg. The numerically superior [Schmalkaldic forces] are following him and hope to inflict great damage on him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Yesterday afternoon, it was reported from Konstanz that the Emperor had withdrawn and left many sick and wounded mercenaries in his camp. The Landgrave inspected the camp to ensure that they were not facing a new trick by the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] About 2000 [cavalry], including [Albrecht von] Rosenberg, are supposed to undertake raids in the territory of the imperial cities this winter. It is suspected that Rosenberg will move to Regensburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Allegedly, Duke Maurice is supposed to take the territory of his relative [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] for himself and be a deceiver, which greatly surprises Bullinger. We shall see.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] The Zürich council is convening assemblies in the city and countryside, where the population is informed about the state of the war and the meeting with Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, etc. It is also to be determined whether the communities in the countryside can be relied upon. In the city, the guilds unanimously spoke out for the Gospel and announced their full support to the Zürich council and the [four Protestant] cities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Greetings, also to Dryander [Francisco de Enzinas], [Johannes] Gast, and the other friends.</p>
