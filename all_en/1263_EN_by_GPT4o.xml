      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, here is Massarius for you, who had written a letter to you, whom I hold most dear. Receive him, brother, and support him as much as you can, along with his companion, likewise a pious man and a refugee for the sake of the gospel. Farewell and expect me soon and pray for me to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. I greet the church and the school.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, April 30, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
