    <p xml:id="regest1">An agreement [with the Roman Church] is only possible on a biblical basis and according to the model of the early Church. Such a scriptural concord is desirable, any other kind would be doomed to failure. In the Scriptures and in the example of the Apostles, the standard for the order of Christian life is to be found; God stands by those who orient themselves to it. On this basis, a concord must be established and everything ordered. With God's help, this is possible: Just as the Apostles converted the world, this also happens today, namely through the preaching of the Word, obedience, and striving for scriptural unity within the framework of a synod. Regarding justification, faith, forgiveness of sins, and good works, what Paul writes in the letters to the Romans and Galatians applies. He deals with the sacrifice, the priesthood, and the mediatorship of Christ in the letter to the Hebrews. The cult of saints is against the commandment of Scripture. The veneration of images was already rejected by Lactantius, Athanasius, and Jerome. The sacraments are to be restored to their original simplicity. The Anabaptists are rightly condemned. In the Eucharist, the body of Christ is enjoyed in faith. The Mass is to be replaced by the form of the meal instituted by Christ. Confession and absolution are meaningful only as comfort through the Gospel. Paul writes about the [free] enjoyment of food in the letter to the Romans, about the office in the letters to Titus and Timothy. Kings are obliged to justice, believers to obedience. [Konrad] Pellikan writes more about the monasteries and other matters. On this basis, the preachers in Switzerland are ready for a concord.</p>

      <p>I see, my dear Chelius, that no concord can exist that is not drawn from the purest sources of Scripture and shaped according to the apostolic example and the sincerity of the primitive Church.</p>
      <p>I do not disapprove of the minds of pious men on this matter. All the pious aspire to concord, but a holy, pure, and lasting one. If today a concord is patched up that is not solid and not aligned in every way with the prescription of Scripture, tomorrow it will be dissolved by an inevitable offense as greater discord grows. The word of the Lord remains forever [Isaiah 40:8; 1 Peter 1:25]. All flesh and all human counsels perish like the flower of the field. Therefore, those who desire a solidly established concord in the Church should recall all matters of the Church to the original and apostolic example, to the testimony of sacred Scripture.</p>
      <p>For whatever is established beyond the authority of Scripture cannot be firm nor can it please all, especially the pious. They will perpetually oppose it. However, what is necessary for Christian life and discipline is abundantly handed down in the sacred writings and apostolic examples. To depart from them is impious, to meditate on better things is foolish, not to obey is treacherous.</p>
      <p>Those who seek God and truth from the heart, seek in the Scriptures and according to the Scriptures. God is with them, He imbues, animates, and directs them with His Spirit. Those who, having deserted them, follow human things, continually stumble and remain perplexed, with cunning driving out and supplanting cunning. We therefore advise in every way that concord should be patched up as the Lord Himself willed it to be patched up by the word of truth, and that all our matters should also be arranged and composed according to the Scriptures and the examples of the apostles or the old Church.</p>
      <p>But indeed, to many, this seems impossible. Yet all things are possible with God [Matthew 19:26], who does not forsake those who seek Him in truth. Nor are we dealing with a matter of one day or a few years. What seemed more impossible than that the world, immersed in idolatry and superstition, would be converted by the very few apostles of Christ? Yet we have seen it converted, although with effort and time. The present age is also entirely enveloped in errors, but let no one despair. For we have seen in a few years some remarkable cities and countless peoples wonderfully changed. Indeed, we owe our effort to God, but the effort He Himself demanded, the preaching of the word and obedience.</p>
      <p>If there is discord in doctrines or rites, let concord be sought in a prosynod or synod from Scripture, so that we may agree and establish what Scripture reveals.</p>
      <p>Regarding justification, faith, the remission of sins, and good works, the apostle has wisely disputed in all his epistles, especially in those addressed to the Romans and Galatians. In these, he asserts that faith is righteousness, which cleanses us from sins through the blood of Christ and makes us fit for good works, which God has commanded.</p>
      <p>Regarding the sacrifice, priesthood, and mediation of Christ, who is the one and only eternal sacrifice for all the faithful, the apostle to the Hebrews has most wisely and piously demonstrated concord.</p>
      <p>Regarding the worship of saints, Scripture commands nothing except what pertains to example and imitation. For the faithful, Christ is sufficient, who sits at the right hand of the Father and intercedes for us as often and as much as necessary. The worship of Christians is in spirit and faith. This they owe to God alone.</p>
      <p>To imagine that saints intercede for us and are distracted by cares for our sake is not revealed in the Scriptures, and thus even Saint Aurelius Augustine miserably tormented himself on this matter in his book "On the Care to be Taken for the Dead." Christians walk simply in certain faith, which attributes all things to Christ alone.</p>
      <p>To prostitute and have statues of either God or saints for worship is against the commandment of God and against the rite of the old Church. This is evident from the writings of Lactantius, the books of Athanasius, and the testimony of Saint Jerome. For he, translating a certain letter of Epiphanius to John, Bishop of Jerusalem, left an elegant example of this matter.</p>
      <p>As for the sacraments, which Scripture mentions, the apostles wrote that they should be simply administered. They should not be varied in any way, and all our matters should be reformed to these. Regarding baptism, it has been disputed in good faith until now. The Anabaptists are rightly condemned. Regarding the Eucharist, about which the apostle writes in 1 Corinthians 11[17-34], no one can now be ignorant of what we think. We assert in faith that the body of Christ is eaten and the blood is drunk, as the Lord Himself taught in John 6[30-63]. Therefore, in the supper, we do not assert bare signs, as many inquire about us; we acknowledge the mystery.</p>
      <p>The Mass cannot be accepted or approved due to many abuses. However, the mode of the supper instituted by Christ and handed down to us by the apostles is to be approved with all heart and mind.</p>
      <p>And who would not acknowledge the confession made to God? Who would not approve the confession made to learned men in the law of God, that is, counsel or consultation? But Scripture knows no other absolution than the consolation of the spirit and faith. Augustine himself also considered the keys to be the Gospel.</p>
      <p>Regarding the selection of foods, no one finds better moderation than Paul in Romans 14 [1-15,6].</p>
      <p>Who would not accept the ministry of the word such as Christ instituted and the apostle Paul described in his letters to Titus and Timothy? But to those who wish to dominate under the pretext of faith, the Lord said: "But you are not to be like that" [Luke 22:26].</p>
      <p>Kings ought to rule and administer kingdoms in justice and equity, to whom the saints rightly obey and pay tribute.</p>
      <p>Monasteries or coenobiums were once the dwellings of students and hospices for the poor. About these and other matters, Pellikanus has written more.</p>
      <p>We, who preach Christ in Switzerland, seek nothing but the glory of Christ, the salvation of the Church, and the happiness of the republic. Whatever can be established in holy concord with truth, with these things safe, we promise mutual effort. For nothing do we desire as much as concord in Christ with all.</p>
      <p>You have, most learned Chelius, what our opinion is, hastily gathered. Farewell.</p>
      <p>January 17, 1535.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, Minister of the Word in the Church of ZÃ¼rich. Berchtold Haller, preacher of sacred sermons among the Bernese, subscribes to all these things.</p>
