    <p xml:id="regest1">Curione apologizes for the late response to Bullinger's letter [not received] and takes the opportunity to entrust his reply to a Zurich resident currently staying with [Jean] Ribit, who is traveling to Zurich. - Curione thanks for the sent "Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio," whose acumen and restraint he can only praise, even though some influential people criticize the writing and disapprove of Curione, who defends (and will continue to defend) the latter. - Curione would have long since acquired Zwingli's works if they were available in Lausanne or Geneva. However, no [new] theological books are currently offered there, and Curione already possesses almost all of Bullinger's writings. - Curione encloses [a copy] of a letter from Bucer to Calvin, from which Bullinger can learn how [Charles V.] is dealing with [Hermann von Wied], the [Arch]bishop of Cologne. Should Bullinger know more about it, he should share it. - From Camillo [Renato] from Caspano (in Valtellina), Curione has learned that some Italians are staying in Zurich. Bullinger should report on this or ask them to make themselves known to Curione. Curione further asks Bullinger or Pellikan to forward the letters he received from Agostino Mainardi and Camillo [Renato] to those Italians. Curione would also gladly assist the Zurich residents, especially Bullinger, to whom he owes so much. - Greetings from Mrs. [Margarita Bianca, née Isacchi] and children to [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and the children. Greetings also to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Konrad] Gessner, [Rudolf] Gwalther, and [Johannes] Fries. [Béat] Comte (who has resigned from the pastorate), [Pierre] Viret, and Ribit (who has certainly written to Gessner) send their regards.</p>

      <p>Celio Secondo Curione sends many greetings through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>For not responding sooner to your letter, most holy and learned Bullinger, you will grant me pardon. For while we awaited some certain news, time slipped away, and meanwhile, one thing after another so impeded us that it seemed scarcely any space for breathing was left to us. Now indeed, when our Ribitus informed us that a certain person from Zürich was with him, who would proceed directly to you, I did not want to miss such an opportunity to at least now release myself from such a bond.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I give you the greatest thanks I can for the pious and holy gift you sent to me. While I praise your moderation in it (since you ask for my opinion on it), I greatly approve the singular clarity and candor of your response. And although there are (not many, however) in these churches who criticize your divine response, it remains unshaken, firm, and inviolate. But these are moved more by human envy and partisanship than by truth, yet we have not hesitated to resist them (even if they wield great authority), nor shall we hesitate in the future, if ever they take the liberty to speak against your religion and doctrine in our presence, even if we thereby arouse considerable envy against ourselves.</p>
      <p>Therefore, continue to defend the sincerity of Christian doctrine (as you have begun) and do not await the approval of men or fear the bites of the envious, since this matter is conducted with the approval of God the Father and Christ, His Son, and with the agreement of better minds. But enough of this for now.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you wrote to me about Zwingli's books, I have understood; if they were found here or in Geneva, I would have already acquired them for myself. But they have not yet been seen in our cities. If ever they are, I will not allow myself to be without them for long; for today there are no theological books that I desire and covet so much because of the excellent doctrine (which is in them), for I have almost all of yours.</p>
      <p>What has been done by the emperor with the Bishop of Cologne, I think you have received. However, since we have a copy of Bucer's letter to Calvin, it seemed right to send it to you, as it seems to contain the matter briefly and clearly. But if you have other or more extensive or different information about this matter or others, I ask you to send it to us.</p>
      <p>From my brother Camillo, who is in Val Bregaglia at Caspan, I have heard that some Italian brothers are there with you. I ask, if this is so, that you inform me or have them write to me who they are. And because those brothers, who are in Val Bregaglia, Augustinus Maynardus and Camillo, have written to me to send their letters to you or to Mr. Pellicanus, asking you to ensure they are faithfully delivered, I ask that you diligently accomplish this as soon as possible. If I can do anything in return for your sake, command me; for nothing could happen to me more pleasing or desirable than to gratify you all and especially you, dearest brother, since I confess that I owe everything to you forever.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name and that of my wife and children your most holy wife and sweetest children. Farewell through Christ Jesus and greet for me those most learned brothers Mr. Pellicanus, Bibliander, Gesner, Gwalther, Phrysius, and others in the Lord. Count, who has resigned from the ministry, and Viretus, and Ribitus, who I do not doubt has written to Gesner, greet you. Again, farewell, my heart, and pray to God for us. Given at Lausanne, 1545, on the seventh day before the Ides of October.</p>
      <p>Celio S. C., always and everywhere yours.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most renowned for both learning and piety, Antistes of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
