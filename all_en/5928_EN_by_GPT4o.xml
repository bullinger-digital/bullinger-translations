      <p>Grace and peace to you from our Lord Jesus Christ, reverend father in Christ. The reason I have written to you less frequently until now is partly due to the weariness, which almost stupefies me, when I see matters pertaining to the glory of God being handled with no other zeal and diligence, and you would be astonished yourself if you were present, not as an actor, but merely as a spectator. It is also partly due to the diligence of Erastus, my dearest brother and friend, upon whose diligence I have relied, making me more remiss in my duty. And indeed, I had certainly persuaded myself that you were fully aware of the state of our affairs, but I have been informed otherwise by your latest letters. Therefore, I will mention some things that are very pleasant, and some that are somewhat sad. The pleasant things are that the ecclesiastical economy or agenda, drawn up with the common counsel of all the superintendents and approved by the prince and his council, is now being printed with the prince's preface. You might think it is the old leather garment, which was full of Lutheran holes in the sacraments, which we have now mended. It is not so; for firstly, it was not deemed advisable to correct or mutilate the writings of others (for the previous ordinance had been received from others), in which case they could have accused us of falsehood; secondly, the most excellent and holy prince desired that the practice should conform as closely as possible to the method and purity of the catechism, which could hardly have been done in mending the former; thirdly, it is not worthy of the former confession to present even the slightest appearance of limping in such a theater, in which we must fight for God and the holy angels and the world, to give any sign of tergiversation. We began in the Spirit; certainly, it was not fitting to perfect in the flesh, although we also had Galatians among us who desired that perfection. But experience teaches me that the Lord is the president of these actions. Add to this that, since we can explain matters better for edification than they were explained in the previous ordinance, certainly those to whom the edification, not just the mending of the building, is entrusted, ought not to omit or bury this, unless they wish to incur the indignation of the supreme architect, Christ. Finally, it would have been easier to stop all the holes in a sieve than to correct all the errors there. Therefore, I will soon send the economy pure, as much as we could judge by the unanimous consent through the grace of God. The administration of baptism and the supper was more prolix, but it was contracted by the colleagues; perhaps you will still say it is prolix enough. But listen, why are the true churches of Christ today being criticized and slandered? Is it not because of this sacramental cause? Therefore, it was necessary not to apply too much brevity, which would be joined with obscurity. Certainly, this agenda, as they call it, or economy, must be preached in many places in Germany. Moreover, the ministers are not bound to certain words, but for the edification of the church, they may condense into summaries what is proposed more copiously; yet that moderation is preserved which seemed to our people and churches to be fitting. Furthermore, the sad things are that we are gravely afflicted by the plague, and one of our colleagues, Master Peter, with his pregnant wife and many children, who is a faithful servant of Christ and very dear to the people, is gravely ill. I commend him and our church to your prayers. The nobles, the rich, and most of the learned have fled from here, not without offense to the weak, who had previously been greatly moved to pure doctrine by their diligence and assiduity in sermons. There are those who excuse, indeed praise the deed; I do not severely criticize, nor do I excuse it. Truly, the weakness of the lords is miserable; may the Lord strengthen us. The Lord had begun to visit my family for the third time with this plague; having shown the rod for a few days, He turned it away. I confess I still desire to live, to help the fallen matters according to the measure of the gift of God towards me, a wretched sinner; yet if God wishes to free me from many cares and troubles against my will, pray that He may never leave me without the consolation of His Holy Spirit, as He promised: The Comforter will remain with you forever. One thing I forgot: our Ursinus has almost completed a German writing (indeed the German is completed, but he is working on the Latin, in which he is still engaged; it will have at least thirty gatherings), in which he has undertaken the defense of the whole sacramental cause from the sources, although he keeps silent about the names of the adversaries. I have read part of it; it is a learned writing. Help the best brother and παραστατΗς with your prayers. I am thinking of publishing some sermons by the will of the prince, in which I have tried to satisfy not so much the acumen of the learned as the rustic simplicity. I write more than I had intended. Brunner is also about to publish a good book on the ascension of Christ. Besides the sermons, I have a more extensive catechism in hand, keeping the same method as in the smaller one. In it, I had decided to treat clearly the marrow of the principal doctrines. Help me with your prayers, as you also help with books. The paper does not bear more. Therefore, I commend you and your excellent colleagues, whom I wish to be greeted by name in my name, and I commend myself to their prayers, the afflicted church, and our excellent prince, to the most faithful Lord Jesus, whose servant you are. Farewell, venerable old man and servant of Christ, and never cease to love me in the Lord. Given at Heidelberg, October 25, 1563. Yours sincerely, Kaspar Olevianus. Last Sunday, the supper was administered purely from a pure formula with great attention and frequency. May the Lord be blessed. My remaining colleagues greet you.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ the Savior, Master Heinrich Bullinger, etc., in Zurich.</p>
