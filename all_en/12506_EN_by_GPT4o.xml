    <p xml:id="regest1">Simler is doing well; hopefully, Bullinger and his family are too. In a letter to [Johannes] Gast [not received], Bullinger's annoyance is expressed due to the lack of letters from Simler and [Huldrych Zwingli the Younger]. However, the two are not lazy in writing but are fully dedicated to their studies, and Simler also wanted to consider Bullinger's heavy workload. After receiving Bullinger's letter [not received], he reported [with HBBW XVI, No. 2412] about the [Basel] lectures they attended. Neither were Bullinger's admonitions in vain, nor could Simler forget the support he received from Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Simler admits that he neglected his studies for a while. However, he has improved. Since the time for his studies abroad is limited, he wants to make good use of it. He should not be accused of wishing for a longer study abroad but not even knowing how to use the short [stay in Basel] profitably.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Since Bullinger is surprised by the lack of letters, perhaps he did not receive Simler's letter at all. Therefore, here is some information about their studies again. They attend [Martin] Borrhaus' lectures on [the book of] Exodus (although they missed the interpretation of the first two chapters because it took place before their arrival in Basel). Johannes Hospinian teaches rhetoric and reads about Cicero's works "De inventione" and "Pro Milone." In mathematics, Veit Ardüser will soon finish his teaching on arithmetic and then begin with [the doctrine of] the sphere. Ulrich Hugwald reads in Latin about Aristotelian ethics. [Sebastian] Münster is on a trip to Austria. His stepson Samuel Petri teaches Hebrew grammar. Markus Hopper was almost at the end of his [lecture on] dialectics, so participation in it would not have been worthwhile. However, they soon want to attend his [course on the dialectics of Johannes] Caesarius. They strive to meet the demands of these many lessons to the best of their ability.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The election of Martin Borrhaus as rector was not unanimous. It is well known that he has many enemies because he lacks a doctorate and refused a corresponding offer. Meanwhile, as everywhere, there are many doctors in Basel who are anything but learned or of no use to the community. The new dean [of the Faculty of Arts] is Johannes Hospinian.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Simler sends along a new comedy [“Philargirus” by Heinrich Pantaleon], which is to be performed in honor of the new rector these days. The date of the performance given in print is incorrect due to a postponement of the rector's banquet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- On June 6, the citizens of Basel performed [the play] “Tragicocomoedia Sant Pauls bekerung” by Valentin Boltz, whom Bullinger knows well, with great effort. In addition to new costumes, there was even an army of foot soldiers and horsemen. It was a splendid spectacle, but the [religious] content was lacking, and then there was a celebration for days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Bullinger already knows that the [house]master [Konrad Wolfhart] is friendly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Simler would like to continue studying abroad; preferably with Philipp [Melanchthon] in Wittenberg and, if that is not possible, in Strasbourg or Heidelberg. Bullinger should decide whether Simler should stay [in Basel] or leave at the time of the Frankfurt [autumn] fair.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- If the “Cosmographia” by [Johannes] Honter is available in print, Simler would like to receive it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Simler apologizes for his late writing. He does not doubt Bullinger's affection.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler], to the brother [Johannes Reinhart], to the maid [Brida Schmid], and to the children. Greetings from [Konrad Wolfhart] and [Huldrych] Zwingli [the Younger].</p>

      <p>If you and your family are well, there is reason for me to rejoice; for I too am enjoying good health. You are surprised and upset, as I learned from your letters to [Johannes] Gast, that you have not received any letters from us both so far, which might lead you to conclude that we are negligent. However, I am very sorry that such a suspicion has arisen about us; for we indeed strive to engage in liberal studies to the best of our abilities, and we do not wish you to think otherwise of us. Therefore, I ask you, dearest father, to accept my delay as I have done. It is not out of negligence, much less out of forgetfulness (for what could arise in this life so terrible that it would cause me to forget you?) that I write to you less frequently. However, knowing that you are burdened with many affairs from all sides, I did not want to disturb you with my letters, especially since I have nothing worthy of writing. I have already informed you in my last letters (if they have been delivered) about the lectures I am attending, after your letter full of all humanity and love was delivered to me. Therefore, I ask you not to think that your exhortations have fallen on deaf ears. I am mindful of your advice. Your words are firmly fixed in my mind, so they cannot easily be removed. With God's help, I strive diligently to satisfy these and to respond to your love and will. Do not think that you have raised a wolf's cub, as the proverb goes, and that I am so ungrateful that, having been removed from your sight, I have also forgotten your benefits. Far be it from me, I say, far be it from me, this crime hated by all with good reason. For, to use words: Before the light deer graze in the sky, And the seas leave the fish naked on the shore, Before the wolves snatch the kids, the calves before the lions, The dolphins flee the fish, the eagles before the doves, And the discord of things turned backward grows, Than your face slips from our heart Or your care emigrates from our marrow.</p>

      <p>I confess that I have sometimes been negligent both in studies and in other matters, but now I trust that everything is changing for the better day by day. One must forgive him who confesses his errors and, fleeing from them, follows better things. I do not consider it so disgraceful to have erred as to persist in error. I know that a short time is granted to man by nature, and the time given for traveling is shorter than my wishes. Therefore, it will be necessary to strive, as you have diligently admonished, that it does not go to waste, but that when I return, I return pious and learned, so that it cannot be said of me that I wished for a long journey but did not even know how to use this short one profitably. These are the things I am trying to do, and I want you to feel that I am diligently engaged in them.</p>

      <p>Although I recently informed you of the nature of my lectures, since there is doubt whether you have received my writings, as you are surprised that I write nothing at all, I will briefly recount them now. We attend the theological lecture of Mr. Cellarius. He is currently lecturing on Exodus. We heard from the third chapter, as he began it when we arrived in Basel. We hear rhetoric from Mr. Johannes Hospinian. He lectures on Cicero's books "De Inventione" and the "Pro Milone" speech. In mathematics, we learn from Mr. Vito Ardiseo. He has almost finished arithmetic and is about to begin the sphere. We hear Mr. Ulricus Hugwaldus lecturing in Latin on Aristotle's ethics. Mr. Munster has gone on a journey to Austria, and his stepson, Samuel Petri, is lecturing on Hebrew grammar. He is a young man from the class of bachelors. Under him, we are happily learning Hebrew. But you may ask why we neglect the dialectic lecture, which is most necessary. Know then that Mr. Marcus Hopper, the dialectic lecturer, has almost finished dialectics. We thought we would spend much labor and time in vain if we only heard the end, omitting the beginning and middle. However, within a few days, he will begin Caesarius, which we intend to hear, God willing. And these are our lectures; indeed many, but we must strive all the more vigorously to satisfy them all, so that time is not spent in vain on these.</p>

      <p>Mr. Martinus Cellarius has been elected the new rector of the University of Basel, a learned and humane man. However, it is known that this was not done with everyone's consent. Many hold him in contempt for no other reason than that he lacks the degree or honor of a doctorate, as they call it, and once refused an offer of it, although we see daily, as elsewhere, so also here, many doctors who are neither learned nor useful to the republic due to a life either proud or drunken, of which there are unfortunately too many to be seen here. However, bear it, do not blame it, for what cannot be changed, as he says. I do not write this now to judge them, nor to disparage them less than many others (for I know how disgraceful it is to secretly or openly slander others!), but to show you that this academy is not immune to the vices that reign in most academies. We have a new dean, Mr. Johannes Hospinian.</p>

      <p>I am sending you here a new comedy, which will be performed these days in honor of the new rector. Although the title indicates it has been performed, because the rector did not hold his banquet at that time, the performance of the comedy was also postponed. On the sixth day of June, the citizens of Basel performed the "Conversion of Saint Paul" with great pomp and expense. Many made new clothes in various forms. There was also an army of foot soldiers and horsemen present, so that here one could see a most splendid spectacle of pride rather than of any other thing; for the matter itself did not seem to have been treated with sufficient dignity. Nevertheless, the expense did not seem too small, as there was feasting for three days following. The actor of the comedy was that Valentin Bolz, well known to you.</p>

      <p>I would inform you more about the kindness of our master, if I did not know that he is already well known to you.</p>

      <p>Although I know that you faithfully consult for the benefit of both of us, I do not think you will be displeased if I also express my opinion to you about traveling. Whether I should stay here or travel further at the Frankfurt fair, I leave to your will. However, I wanted you to know that my mind indeed desires a longer journey, and I especially wish to go to Wittenberg, where I may hear Philipp [Melanchthon]. But if that is not possible, at least to Strasbourg or, if not even that, only to Heidelberg. However, do what seems best to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>If the "Cosmographia" by Honter is printed, I would like it to be sent to me.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>But now I must stop. I would like you to excuse me for not writing until now, and also to commend me, as I do not doubt your love. May the Lord preserve you safe for as long as possible. You will convey my many greetings to your wife, who has deserved so well of me, to your brother, to the maid, and to all the children. Our master and Zwingli send you and all yours many greetings.</p>

      <p>Given in Basel, in the year of salvation 1546, on the third of the Ides of June. Always most devoted to you,</p>
