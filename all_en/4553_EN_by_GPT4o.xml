      <p>S. D. Iungius, my singular friend and faithful brother, wrote to me about the same matter weeks ago, but not as extensively as to you. Therefore, dearest brother, I give you the greatest thanks and pray to the Lord that He may arrange the affairs of that church in such a way that no disturbance arises, but that the truth is taught sincerely and the cunning are made simple to the glory of God and the salvation of souls. The Pope commands prayers to be made everywhere in his kingdom, evidently so that the enemies of the Roman Church may be successfully oppressed, to which the counsels of all princes and bishops are directed. May the Lord of Hosts be present with His church! I would gladly hear who that bishop is, who is said to be very liberal in Konstanz; this kind of people knows how to win over and deceive the masses if feasts are held, etc. I certainly know that Hosius, the Bishop of Warmia, a Pole, has come from Rome to the Emperor in Vienna, I think it is he whose writings against us on the unwritten word of God are extant; thus I suspected that he himself was sent to Konstanz. If it is the Bishop of Laibach, I have long heard that he is not ignorant of the truth; however, he is all the more pestilent; you will easily persuade me that everything done by bishops is feigned and simulated, as I know them all to be hypocrites and those sharp eyes, of which Daniel speaks. May the Lord protect those who call upon His name!</p>
      <p>I also have a dispute with our paper supplier; I complain about the Zürich paper, as you do; but the paper supplier is a barrel, not a man. However, through quarrels, I finally extorted this paper, which you see, not bad otherwise, from him, after I had sent him bundles once and again. I continually advise the elder, at whose expense the paper is made, not to allow a useful trade to be defamed, etc. Regarding Brunner's dealings, it is fundamentally like this: As he preached heatedly against the five places, which he named from the pulpit, the congregation appointed two messengers after the sermon eight days ago to send to the authorities and report their preacher's incompetence to prevent greater disorder, and they reported how he had shamefully attacked the five places (though two from Zug were present at the sermon), and among other things said they were scoundrels and villains, much more shameful than the irrational cattle, etc.</p>
      <p>Since then the whole congregation has reported decently, he has been summoned, put in the tower, and questioned; he confessed that he was incited and had named the five places in a fervor, etc.; however, he neither called them scoundrels nor villains, etc. My lords have inquired thoroughly, also taken testimony and found many who unanimously said that and some more, so my lords must fear that the five places, knowing it, will bring it to court, so that if it happens, they will be forced to impose harsher sentences according to the law, and therefore have released him and ordered him to leave their city and land within eight days, until they summon him again, etc. I also do not doubt, indeed I know, that the five places are arming themselves day by day and, when the court is held, will not rest and will not cease to worry until it comes to war again; for no one will be able to endure it. But how should one act in this case? My lords have kept no one in Baden but Bern and the Grisons, who have the command and power to admonish in Baden; it concerns everyone. Should my lords hesitate, what happens, our people will also say: what was intended, if we were not warned beforehand, that I cannot think that my lords will start the game and lie about the pretext. How dangerous it is to let others have the pretext, even a child can notice; yet it seems to me that nothing will be started unless one must defend oneself; then it can be seen whether one will be honest enough.</p>
      <p>But that depends on God, who gives and takes the heart; may He help and advise us! For the matter is dangerous. I know of no other cause than that they claim Glarus broke the alliance in the refusal of provisions in 1531, upon which they made a peace, in which they promised to restore the mass and all religion in four churches; they have not done that; therefore they are no longer bound by the agreement, and they are still breaking the alliance, they are not obliged to hold them according to the law of the alliances (which are broken), they do not want to consider them as confederates anymore and have nothing to do with them. In summary: it is nothing but hatred of the gospel and that they want to eradicate it here and elsewhere. The Pope and his legate are pushing for this.</p>
      <p>A few oligarchic pensioners are plotting this, they have soldiers adhering to them. The pious Zwingli would have liked to slip the yoke under them; it went as you know, and little good is spoken of him, as you know; so we must be struck under the eyes. May God open our eyes and grant us grace! For it is a difficult matter, but one which the Lord foretold, where presence of mind and constancy are needed.</p>
      <p>I write this to you, as you requested, confidentially. There is a countryman in Glarus, a double-dealer, but more papist, who ran out of Glarus by night to Schwanden and there shouted: "Murder, flight! The enemies are in Glarus, have killed everyone." The good people have gone out with the banner to comfort themselves, intending to resist the enemy; they understood that the man had come, deceived, etc. And when he was captured, he behaved nicely, so they released him from the chains, some went to him; he wounded three of them, among them is a countryman Hässy.</p>
      <p>In Neuburg in Saxony, a princely day is to be held: 1. to sign the Augsburg Confession anew, since most of those who did it initially are dead; 2. to discuss the council, which the Pope, the Emperor, the French, and the Spanish are planning. The Elector of Saxony did not want to agree unless there was talk of no new alliance and a cessation of condemnation, upon which some pressed so hard for a time, etc. Whether it will proceed, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Some princes, also Württemberg, were together in Heidelberg around the beginning of November.</p>
      <p>The Württemberg theologians have a dispute about the ubiquity of the body of Christ, Brentius and Matthäus Alber. The prince is vehement, entirely Brentian; I do not know what will come of these matters; I fear a very great punishment. May God be gracious to us!</p>
      <p>Do not mind the bad writing; for I am in a great hurry; yet there is so much writing and work that it is no wonder if one becomes dead or sick over it and remains so. May God grant His grace and comfort all believers in their distress.</p>
      <p>The legate of the King of France writes to me from Paterniaco on November 13: "Navarre has come to the court; immediately his brother, who came with him, Prince of Condé, was captured; the nobles of Orléans (for the court is now in Orléans) were captured; a serious and diligent investigation is being conducted. I cannot say more now, as I am involved here in a dispute over usury," etc.</p>
      <p>Hence I conclude that the Guise are triumphing and destruction is being prepared for the pious sheep. We must pray to our Lord God to deliver us from evil.</p>
      <p>I would have more of this kind to write, but I am forced to finish.</p>
      <p>May our Matthias be safe, with whom you will share this. Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. November 23, very quickly, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
