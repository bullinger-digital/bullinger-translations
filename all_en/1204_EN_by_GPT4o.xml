      <p>S. P. I recently wrote to you through a certain student from Basel and I believe my letters have been delivered to you, so I should expect a response from you rather than writing something again. However, since our people were about to depart for the spring fair in Frankfurt and would find your citizens and certain messengers there, I could not refrain from writing something, however small, out of my respect for you, whether about our public or private affairs. Therefore, know that our churches and republics are still in expectation and indeed in danger, as things stand now, not least because of the neighboring war and the siege of Magdeburg, but much more because of that Interim and the so-called imperial conclusion and the continuation of the Council of Trent, as they say, about which Julius III has publicly testified about himself and his followers with such a bull that there is absolutely no hope, as far as he and those who will listen to him are concerned, for our churches and schools, which have scarcely been freed from superstition and darkness more than Egyptian and from tyranny and servitude through Christ.</p>
      <p>To these evils is added even more, that certain people, driven by I don't know what furies, have forgotten all love and brotherly affection, and are daily stirring up new and unnecessary dissensions and scandals among brothers. I recently sent you some disputations of Osiander with a threatening and very arrogant preface, and I also sent some writings of the Bishop of Naumburg. And I am eager to hear your response about all these and similar matters.</p>
      <p>Recently, our bishops were together in Merseburg with Sidonius, now the Bishop of Merseburg, Julius Pflug of Naumburg, and Christoph von Carlowitz of Meissen. And although the Bishop of Merseburg, with the public and solemn protestation of the Prince of Anhalt, George, also a canon of Merseburg, and before him, as long as Duke Augustus of Saxony was the governor of Merseburg, and with the consent of all the states and orders of the nobility and cities, they wanted to accept him as bishop on this one condition and no other, that he would only retain the religion they now have and can and should have no other. For this was publicly proposed and often solemnly repeated before all the states and orders, before they would accept him and give their pledge, as is customary, with him responding ambiguously and very obscurely that he did not know what or what kind of religion they had, but if he found it to be true in all respects and catholic, which word he repeatedly used, he would not change anything.</p>
      <p>The matter itself will now testify and undoubtedly become clearer over time. And he himself, when recently admonished and reminded by the Anhaltine and of the oath he swore with prescribed words and formula to the chapter, as they call it, and of the aforementioned protestation, openly responded that he did not come here to abandon his religion in any way or to assume another, and in words and deeds he clearly shows what he will be like at the first opportunity. For he recently performed the chrismation, as they call it, in a papist manner and confirmed and ordained in his usual way without acknowledging or correcting any abuse, but, as they now do, excusing, disguising, and allowing it in any way. For now, the greatest and highest wisdom is to sophisticate and slander about everything, and there is nothing so absurd and diabolical that they do not have ready wise remedies, colors, and cavils most shamelessly devised and fabricated for this very purpose. I suppose you have seen Groper's institutions, isagoges, etc., and also Soto's Ayala, etc., the most trifling trifles, with which they try to lead souls back to acorns from fruits, indeed from God to the devil, from Christ to the antichrist. And what we have to expect from the Council of Trent is easy to conjecture. However, our people, among whom is Philipp Melanchthon, etc., will not refuse to meet face to face, and it is said that all the princes of the empire have agreed that each should send certain representatives there. This matter was recently discussed with Philipp and others, so that he prepares himself and writes something about this whole business. I am eager to hear what you and others, including our Calvin, whether you will come to Trent or send someone, or what you will do at all concerning this matter. It is said, however, that a good part of your people and, if I am not mistaken, five principal cantons are still entirely submerged in papism and old superstition, which will give you enough trouble. What is the situation with this and what hope is there for your churches and schools, I would be grateful if you would inform me in more detail in return. For we cannot help but be concerned for our brothers, especially all of Germanic and Christian blood. The care for letters and humanity for posterity touches us not lightly, lest, with the light of sacred letters being snatched away, the chosen religion and superstition and barbarism of the more learned and inner letters and languages, which God avert, should creep in again somewhere in time. But let us pray to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He Himself may do it, that He may take care of His vineyard in all things and manage it, and that, as much as He gives, each of us may perform his duty strenuously and most steadfastly in his station. For what are we or how long will we take care of these things? Therefore, as it befits the true and sincere brothers of Christ, let us always be of the mind among ourselves that we ought to be. And if some will not cease to think for themselves and stir up scandals against brotherly love, you, who are endowed with the spirit of Christ and so many and such great gifts, please continue in virtue and in mutual love and candor, so that you may never allow anything to be omitted or persuaded otherwise by anyone. There is no one in these our schools and churches now among the more learned and modest and those cultivated in our letters, languages, and arts and some humanity, who, in my hearing or presence, has ever made mention of you except in the most honorable manner.</p>
      <p>Let us not care a whit for certain semi-pagans, misomuses, and misoglots, most barbarous and inhuman. Laelius Socinus, our own, also feels and speaks the same way very freely even in our court, not only here and in Wittenberg, most famous both for his homeland and his own virtue and learning. Since you have commended him to me in this way, I carry him entirely in my eyes, and if he wishes to stay with us, I will take care that he can be in the most honorable position either in our court or in our schools. Would that you would send and commend many such to us. Not a day passes, indeed not a lunch or dinner at all, in which he does not extol your learning, candor, and piety to the heavens, with us gladly and wholeheartedly supporting and applauding and adding our white stones of approval. He has instructed me to greet you very reverently and will also write himself, unless I am mistaken. Likewise, others greet you, as I said, countless and most devoted to you. Joachim Rheticus, as you know, is entirely yours, and he also writes to Gessner, at least to our own, but he wishes all of you and each one of you to be always safe and sound and as flourishing as possible with us. More also to our Bibliander, that most friendly of common friends, to whom I have also fully opened myself, and also to the venerable elder Pelican, and to Gessner as well, which you can share among yourselves and command me in whatever you wish, by word and even by nod, for your authority with me and our mutual respect and highest veneration for you. Please write back certainly, what you have published or are about to publish, so that through our booksellers we can take care and diligently make efforts to inquire in Frankfurt among your people and bring them to us; for rarely do they bring anything to us unless it is specifically enjoined and given into their hands. You can inform your Froschauer about this matter, who can conveniently take care of it in Frankfurt. Farewell always most happily and prosperously, most learned and humane man, and love us in return, as you do, and unless it is troublesome, write back. Given most quickly and more than in time. Leipzig, March 7, 1551.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Valentin Paceus, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, teaching Christ in ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Valentin Paceus</p>
