      <p>Greetings. In these two months, I have received three letters from you, distinguished man and venerable brother. In the first, you wrote that D. Peter Martyr and D. Gualther would come here, but that you were hindered by ill health. You mentioned that there was little hope for the success of a private conference, as Brentius, a stubborn man excessively devoted to his gross delusions, holds the lead everywhere. Although I have also repeatedly expressed how much such meetings are to be feared, I would not want to avoid them in such a way that our adversaries would triumph over our lack of confidence. However, since our good brothers Farell and Beza have informed me that if an opportunity for a conference arises, you are inclined to embrace it willingly, I will refrain from a longer discourse: except that I would earnestly ask you to urge your most illustrious council to encourage our neighbors. For the will of the Prince, whom we thought to be alienated from us, should not be rejected, and there is a need for haste so that he may soon understand that our wishes align with his counsel. Since this entire burden is to be borne by you, unless you hasten and press vigorously, there is a fear that others may eagerly let the time pass in silence. Now, since it is expedient, indeed almost necessary, to send a suitable witness to call upon the Württemberg prince regarding his promise, consider whether our Beza should be sent with another or more.</p>
      <p>However, if you see any business, I would not want even the slightest scruple to be raised: because there will be more than enough delay from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>What I wanted to freely express to you, which would have come to your mind spontaneously, is only for you to consider. No mention of the confession will be made at this time, if you trust me. For if access were difficult, this would be a convenient way to insinuate. Now, if any troublemaker wishes to oppose the action, they will object that before the conference has taken place, we are prescribing laws: and there is no use in the meantime, since the Prince himself has anticipated. Indeed, nothing will help our cause more than if we assume as a given that we have the same doctrine, and that we agree on everything except one point. However, a confession on a certain and clear matter would raise controversy. I have not told Vergerio what I intend to do. I will write, when the opportunity arises, to D. Johannes a Lasco not to press too harshly and drive the Waldensian brothers from our flock. I will do nothing, however, without your knowledge. I only told him that the excellent man D. a Lasco sometimes tends to be stern: but since this matter is not yet known to me, I do not pronounce: that the Waldensians, 16 years ago, when I was still in Strasbourg, sent a confession which was approved by the excellent Bucer and me at that time: but later a certain copy was shown to me, in which there are some things I dislike and would not want to admit. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother, to be esteemed by me from the heart, together with D. Martyr and all colleagues. My fellow ministers respectfully greet you all.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect you, sustain you, and enrich you with every blessing. Geneva, 30th of May, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Calvin, truly yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and excellent servant of Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor and esteemed fellow of the Zürich church.</p>
