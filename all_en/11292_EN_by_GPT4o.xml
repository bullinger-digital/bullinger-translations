    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices over the letter delivered by Christoph [Froschauer] and over Bullinger's book ["De origine erroris"]. Melander was denounced as a fanatic to Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse], but through cautious actions, he was able to dispel further accusations and advance church reform; the Landgrave promotes the true doctrine and defends the churches and pastors of Upper Germany and Switzerland. After eight weeks of negotiations in Frankfurt, they hope to be able to depart soon, once the Landgrave is healthy again; the opponents [of the Schmalkaldic League] demand a renunciation of the admission of new members, but these cannot be left alone in religious disputes. Bullinger's book was praised by Melanchthon. Melanchthon, Friedrich Myconius, and Melander, on behalf of [Johann Friedrich of] Saxony and Philipp of Hesse, together with Bucer and Peter Geltner as representatives of the cities, have given their judgment on the further course of action [in view of the opponents' demands]. Must close, as he is called to preach, recommends himself and sends greetings to Bullinger's colleagues, especially Theodor Bibliander.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ. Your letter, which our Christoph [Froschauer] delivered, most learned and dearest Bullinger, I read with the greatest pleasure, and it was most welcome for many reasons. First, because I understood that you, along with the church and brothers, are well in the Lord; then, because you greeted and advised Melander, who is always most devoted to you, so kindly and honored him with a book most useful in these turbulent times. I will make an effort that, whatever this duty is, if the opportunity is given, it may be compensated by me at some time. May Christ our Lord satisfy you for what I am not able to provide. You will have me, and you have always had me, most obedient.</p>
      <p>As for why I have written to you less frequently, I do not doubt you have long since understood it kindly. For after I devoted myself to the most illustrious prince, there were no lack of informers whispering into the prince's ears that I am, as they call it, a fanatic (ein Schw√§rmer), also excessively Zwinglian, and that my freedom of speech is by no means to be tolerated. Moreover, many were greatly displeased that I was called by the prince to the office of teaching. Therefore, I resolved to refrain from writing and, as much as was in me, to avoid every opportunity for slander, meanwhile teaching those things which contribute to edification, omitting vain disputes. And thanks be to God, it succeeded well. For by God's goodness, our church is reformed and marvelously progresses, and our prince judges rightly about ecclesiastical doctrines, does not quench the spirit, and respects and defends the churches and ministers of Upper Germany and Switzerland. He deserves, for this reason alone, that his highness be commended to Christ by your prayers, so that what has begun in an excellent prince may be completed.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in Frankfurt, where I have strengthened my old church as much as the Lord has given, it is now the eighth week of the council. Our prince, due to adverse health, was not able to be in the open. However, he is now beginning to be better, and we hope to depart soon. What has been concluded is uncertain. But it is most certain that our adversaries do not seek us, but our cause. For they desire that we no longer admit anyone into our league. This they would easily obtain from some of ours; but if any have joined our religion, we will not be able to abandon them as our brothers in the cause of religion, should anything happen. The Lord is our helper, and we will not fear what men can do to us.</p>
      <p>I presented your book, given as a gift, to Philipp Melanchthon to read, who, with his sharp judgment and utmost candor, approved it and said it is worthy to be read in this age.</p>
      <p>Thus far I have waited to see if anything would occur that I might write to you. But I see that everything is disturbed by false and vain rumors, so that I hardly know what to write. Eight days ago, in the name of the Saxon, Philipp and Friedrich Myconius, on behalf of our prince, and indeed Bucer and Peter Geltner on behalf of the cities, it was entrusted to me to meet and respond to what could be done with a good conscience.</p>
      <p>And we did so, and we offered our opinion in writing, which they also approved. But what has been done since then, I hope, will soon be proven by the outcome. May the Lord be with us by His spirit.</p>
      <p>There is no time now to write more; for I am called to the sermon. Farewell, therefore, venerable Bullinger, in Christ, and keep me as commended as you have so far; for you are most commended to me. Commend me with our prince to Christ, to your prayers, and to the church. Greet most dutifully in my name your most distinguished colleagues and the dearest Theodor Bibliander, once my host. Again and again, farewell.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Frankfurt, April 4, 1539. Your Dionysius Melander, if anyone is yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his brother in the Lord, venerable.</p>
      <p>To his hands.</p>
