      <p>S. Most esteemed father, I would gladly not burden your reverence with our most troublesome disputes, if not the harsh fate of this church somewhat compelled me to involve you. We recently brought the matter, as you had most wisely advised, before the senate of citizens and proved with the clearest arguments how ungrateful and unjust Gantner was to us, who, after the public action, now finally does not blush to condemn us for the injustice allegedly done to him. We urged the magistrate to finally find an end to this most troublesome case: we do not envy Gantner his homeland, provided he acknowledges his errors, or at least that it be so manifestly revealed by the care and authority of the lords, that anyone can know who should be avoided or who has taught correctly and truthfully or not. By the immortal God, he had the greater part of the senate of 70 supporting him, whom he so deluded with the most foolish words and the most deceitful lies, that almost all now believe that the greatest injustice has been done to Gantner. It cannot be said how much that most audacious man has brazened his face. He wanted to publicly prove with a lengthy speech that a notable injustice had been done to him, that he had never harbored or attempted to spread any error or poison to others; that he had been oppressed in the synod by force, deceit, treachery, and all sorts of arts; that I had attracted Campell, whom all now reject, to this church, disregarding the citizens and pastors; that he had not been given the opportunity to defend his cause or prove his innocence, that he had never been given the power to excuse himself even among the Rhaetians, and to sum it up: condemning the entire Rhaetian republic and the entire synod of all sorts of wickedness and perversity, he exonerates himself from all blame and so cunningly transfers all blame to the brothers and especially to us, that few in this city are found who do not believe this deceitful man and persecute us with all their might, so that, exhausted, we finally abandon the cause of Christ and the defense of truth, and the factious man himself, occupying our positions with his Merius, reduces the torn church to Swenkfeldian errors and insane sophistries, with which many are infected. Gantner's madness and seduction have grown in this factious time, in which we have so far been able to resist these seducers only a little.</p>
      <p>With plausible reasons, he promises obedience, that he will subscribe to the Zurich confession under the oath of allegiance; meanwhile, he stubbornly denies that he ever erred, nor does he want to confess that he sinned against that confession, so that he involves this whole case in new suspicions and, exonerating himself from all blame, all malevolence is directed against us. Having learned the questions and arguments of both parties, the lords confirmed this limping advice of Pontisella, that Gantner should subscribe to the Zurich confession and, having done this, be justified and considered among the number of good and honest citizens. Meanwhile, they leave their care and power to the synod intact regarding the external ministry and other matters dealt with in the synod. A strange and supernatural decree of the senate: they decree that Gantner should not touch any ministry except by the decision of the synod; meanwhile, they are not ignorant of what he attempts daily, nor do they note or punish it with their observation. They say, nevertheless, that the letters of the lords, in which that case is contained and which are sealed with the seal of this city in the name of the Three Leagues, are valid, even if Gantner is not compelled to subscribe to them, which, however, was also established in the synod by the same lords in previous years. The Latin speech, which I delivered in that synod and which summarily encompasses everything that Gantner had done and taught, was confirmed by the most splendid testimony by the consul Willius and Pontisella as being entirely consistent with the truth; now, when they think it sufficient to subscribe to the Zurich confession and that Gantner did not err lightly, but he himself contends that he did not err in the least, who does not see that all blame is directed at us, that letters and diplomas are rescinded, testimonies given are accused of falsehood, and a very wide window is opened to all heresies? For never, even when caught in madness and theft, does Gantner want to appear to have committed anything against the Zurich confession. But what? Why does he have so many dealings with Frell, a manifest heretic, who is now favored in this city and even secretly defended by many superiors?</p>
      <p>Why does he cultivate Gabriel Kröttli from Aargau, the leader of the Swenkfeldians, with the highest reverence and observation? Ask Mr. Achilles Kerer what he discovered in previous years about Gantner and that Kröttli when he was lodging at the inn of the Golden Lion: you will hear insults hurled at paedobaptism and the external ministry of the word. The most honorable consul Willius defends this cause with all his might on our side, but he suffers from the greatest hatred from those chained ones because of us, so that he has completely despaired regarding this cause at this time.</p>
      <p>Pontisella has completely defected to Gantner and values that arrogant reviler more than our entire church and the truth itself, to which he bore such evident testimony in previous years. If they do this knowingly, what will they do unknowingly?</p>
      <p>However, the most honorable consul marvels and cannot sufficiently wonder what causes Pontisella to act so coldly now, who could have been an occasion for more prudent action on many occasions.</p>
      <p>But time will soon reveal something. If he was the first to give this advice, as indeed they think, namely that it is sufficient if he subscribes to the Zurich confession, by which subscription Gantner would recall all his errors, what does he respond to this, that Gantner always contends that he has been free from all errors? But if he attributes this to the time and persons as well as to this place, where tyranny and lawlessness (proh deum immortalem) most impudently (may envy be absent from these words) reign, what will he answer when he soon realizes that this indulgence has made it so that all, both the republic and the church, are seething with heresies and have perished utterly? Will that indulgence of his repair this loss in the future, when that unfortunate darnel has received untamed strength and taken such deep roots, that we must necessarily allow the tares to luxuriate in such great danger to the true wheat? But what danger is impending, I ask further (if indeed I have certainly impudently decided to burden you with these most odious rumors, indeed more than true matters) with your permission, pay attention: on January 11, when our dispute arose on Friday before in the court before 70 men with Gantner, who hurled nothing but the most false accusations against us, I gave a sermon in the morning, from which occasion of the song of Zechariah, who, after he had regained the use of his tongue and had accepted the promise of God with faith, was also adorned with greater gifts and the gift of prophecy, I taught that it is the custom of God to receive those who repent into grace, as Peter and Paul once experienced.</p>
      <p>From here I moved on to that often inculcated cause and among other things I clearly said: "If those who have long been convicted have been wronged by us, it must follow that you yourselves, namely the magistrates, have borne false witness; for you have confirmed our accusation against such men with open testimony."</p>
      <p>Gantner, who had hitherto abstained from gatherings, but was then present at the sermon standing in a new place, whom I had not seen, rose at these words and loudly enough admonished those next to him to remember that I had said these things, he also noted some things in a booklet, which he would certainly erase by right, if he could. After the sermon was finished, he approached the consuls and, raising a great clamor, filled everything with his cries: that he did not want to endure these things, that he wanted to respond to everything, that he wanted the community and the tribes to be convened, before whom he would clear himself; that he would rather consume all his fortunes in lawsuits and controversies than bear the suspicion of even the slightest fault.</p>
      <p>Many also from the senators, whose help he has hitherto used, shouted: "We no longer want to endure that he preaches about these things." They also promised Gantner their help against me in convening the tribes, to whom this cause should be referred." For the community, for the community! Out, out with the priest! Would he not tolerate our citizen?" But who urges that it not be endured? No one. We urge that he satisfy the decree, subscribe and expunge the error along with the scandal made by him. This they do not want to admit, and they will rather refute us all or even close our mouths to all, so that Gantner alone may speak lies and errors.</p>
      <p>Now truly persecution is imminent, which I feared in previous years, and I know that I have no place left in this church. Now the pastor is rejected by his sheep, who has now served them faithfully for seven years. All shout: "We want to have a citizen."</p>
      <p>Would that they had never called a foreign man! Gantner has gathered the greatest favor for himself with flattery, lies, feasts, and drinking bouts, and because he was not forced to rebuke anyone for a long time, he has subtly and in the manner of false prophets influenced the minds of men. He uses the greatest patronage and help of the Planta family, against whom the safety of the church and this republic vehemently demanded resistance last year. In sum: the most talkative man has omitted nothing that could arouse envy and hatred against us; he has almost all the leading men as his dearest friends, who, because of their evil deeds, do not want to endure the splendor of light and the sharpness of salt in any way. Truly now it is heard: "Tell us pleasing things;" truly now black is turned into white and white is called black. But what, most reverend father? The twelfth year is now being completed, since I have served the Rhaetian churches, and that with the greatest labors, incessant cares without any private gain or profit of wealth, nor would I regret having spent everything and made a loss of my possessions, provided I knew that I was staying here with some fruit. But behold the fruit for you, when, with the true pastors driven out, they try with all their might to retain and defend heretics, Anabaptists, and seducers. I beg you, have mercy on us at last, most indulgent fathers, and do not allow me, miserable and tossed by various waves, to be submerged. A corner of your land is enough for me, where I may live ingloriously and above all for Christ and my children, with whom I am continually increased. You will not receive an ungrateful man, not a striker, not a contentious one, not a rigid one, but one so worn out by various misfortunes that he cannot harm anyone, even if he wanted to. I have already learned to put off affections, I have learned to be humble with Paul and great in the Lord. Do not allow these six hundred grievances and most impudent injuries to devour and completely corrode my most afflicted heart. It will not be honorable for you to reject such a little servant, who, serving under your command and nod among foreigners for now fourteen years, has always experienced the most severe fortune. Therefore, awaiting the most merciful response and comfort from you, I commend myself entirely to your paternity.</p>
      <p>Flavius Garganus, a doctor, who was detained here in Chur in prison in previous years on suspicion and charge of treason, escaped under the pretense of illness; in recent days, he suddenly died in the Mesolcina Valley, shot through with two bullets; it is believed he was removed so that he would not reveal anything of the treason, of which he is believed to be both the master and the agent. Now assemblies are being held, but they have not yet convened; I will write about the proceedings another time. 1573. January 13, Chur.</p>
      <p>I would like these to be shown to Mr. Haller, my brother-in-law. The consul and my colleague Mr. Campell send their greetings. I humbly ask you to forgive me this prolixity.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted little servant, Tobias Iconius.</p>
      <p>The peasants have not yet responded regarding Othmar, which is the fault of Gantner, who, seeing the change in fortune, leads and holds these peasants like a rope and looks out for himself and his own. However, as soon as they respond, which could easily happen at these assemblies, I will write to you.</p>
      <p>Lucius Nierius, whom your beneficence has hitherto supported, has entered the primary priesthood in Davos and has allowed 80 florins, which they had added to me, to be taken away; he did this beyond, indeed against my advice. There are many mercenaries; thus conditions become cheap.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, primary superintendent of the Zurich church, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>The renewed matter of Mr. Gantner in Chur and Mr. Tobias unwilling. January 1573.</p>
