      <p>Illustrious Sir, I have absolutely nothing from Italy; however, since I am now writing there, I will not forget about the bull (papal decree). What I finally received from France (and that was little) I explained yesterday to Mr. Philipp Valentin, so that he too might explain it at the appropriate time, as I hope he has already done or will do shortly.</p>
      <p>To your Excellence, whom I wish to be in good health. These are the messages.</p>
      <p>The boy who delivered this was followed by another, who brought that other note in the name of Doctor Philipp.</p>
