    <p xml:id="regest1">Have read his book ["On the Councils and the Church"] and acknowledge its value, but are concerned that he associates Zwingli with the Nestorians. Not only do the jointly signed Marburg Articles speak of the undivided person of Christ, but in his ["Fidei ratio"], Zwingli also professed the doctrine of Scripture, the Fathers, and especially Athanasius; even today, the people of Zurich teach nothing else, as is evident from the [First Helvetic] Confession approved by Luther. They therefore ask not to bring Zwingli into disrepute undeservedly and remind that in the letter [of the Reformed cities] from May 1538, they offered brotherly understanding regarding mutual complaints.</p>

      <p>To the most illustrious man, Doctor Martin Luther, most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>We have read what you wrote, most learned Luther, about the councils and the Fathers, a book plainly necessary and suitable for our age, our customs, and our people. May the Lord strengthen you to continue to attack and destroy the kingdom of the Antichrist with iron constancy and invincible courage. However, it is regrettable that in it you have made mention of the most excellent and learned man Huldrych Zwingli of blessed memory, our teacher, in a manner not entirely honorable, as if he had at some time followed the doctrine of Nestorius or certainly taught things differing little from the Nestorians, when, however, from him himself at the Marburg Colloquy, if you remember well, you learned something entirely different. For those articles, which were signed by both, are in everyone's hands, testifying and confessing that the person of Jesus Christ is indivisible. And certainly, he always and everywhere confessed the Catholic faith concerning the unity of the person of Christ and the property of the natures in the manner that the canonical scripture prescribed and taught it to be confessed, and finally the faith of the ancient councils and the ancient Fathers, especially that of Saint Athanasius. This can be seen in that confession of his faith, which he wrote to Emperor Charles at the Diet of Augsburg, not to mention his other books; he published it in the last years of his life. Nor do we ourselves teach anything else even today than what he handed down on this matter and what we expressed in that confession written in Basel and presented to you through Dr. Capito and Bucer. Moreover, that did not displease you; therefore, let it not displease you that it does not vary from that; indeed, we urge you, most excellent Luther, in your integrity, not to render the faith of our Zwingli suspect of Nestorian heresy among the churches. For Zwingli had nothing in common with Nestorius, but was a pious and orthodox man, most loving of Catholic truth and holy justice, who, if he had been rightly known to you, that harmful contention would undoubtedly not have arisen between you. But since the opposite happened and the dissension could not be entirely quelled while he was alive, we at least desire that, with the faith of this most pious man more rightly considered and known, the altercation may cease even after death and the sparks of the old dissension may finally be completely extinguished. And we write this to you, dearest Luther, especially since in those last letters written to you from the Zurich Synod in May 1538, we promised to indicate to you in a brotherly manner if we desired anything in you, so that peace between us might be firmly established. Therefore, with a friendly spirit, we seek these things from you and indicate them to your modesty through charity, praying that if you desire anything in us as well, you may kindly indicate it to us as brothers, and in the meantime, you may wish to promise better things about our Zwingli to your mind and to consider these things, which have proceeded from a friendly spirit, in a good light.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 30, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Leo Jud, Caspar Megander, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Heinrich Bullinger, ministers of the church of the city of Zurich.</p>
