      <p>Greetings. Today I received your second letter through Paul Knibbe, the Fleming, sent together with those excerpts you made from Ochino's Dialogues.</p>
      <p>I now return the same to you through this fellow countryman and I believe that with my previous letters, which you will receive in the meantime, I have satisfied you.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to add to them now.</p>
      <p>Bernhardinus should be an example to all of us, so that we may beware of such minds, of which there are too many, that envy the peace our churches enjoy and wish everything to be turned upside down, so that they themselves might be held in greater esteem.</p>
      <p>I think he will go to Poland, to establish a church there according to his own judgment.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I pity his old age and his children.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant him a sound mind! I have not seen the Dialogues themselves; but I heard from Zerchinte, our chief scribe, who saw them in Basel, that they contain some disgraceful things about the conception of the Lord; I do not know if you have observed this.</p>
      <p>It would be well for him if he, along with his interpreter, would depart to the Lord; but let what is seen fit by the Lord be done.</p>
      <p>I expect you to respond diligently to my letter from yesterday.</p>
      <p>For these things you have shared with me, I give you great thanks and pray to the Lord to protect and preserve you, yours, and your entire church.</p>
      <p>The brothers and all friends greet you, especially Steiger, who thanks you for the letters sent to him and asks you to forgive him for writing to you less frequently due to excessive occupations; likewise, Diesbach, Grafenried, Haller, Hagius, the father-in-law, Zehender, and many others send you their earnest greetings.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 16, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
