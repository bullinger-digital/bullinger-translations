    <p xml:id="regest1">The Zurich authorities have established two colleges where poor and talented students are trained, who will later serve in church and school offices for the benefit of the state. Johannes Wolf, Johann [Jakob] Wick, and Johannes Haller, the bearers of this letter, to whom Rudolf Gwalther will later join, are being sent to Tübingen for further studies to gain experience abroad; they were instructed to listen daily for an hour each to the Holy Scripture, a suitable Greek author, dialectics, and rhetoric, to also practice a bit in mathematics, and to conduct themselves well. Please support them and supervise their conduct and studies, as well as manage their scholarship funds; Zurich expects that the students will not suffer any disadvantages because of their faith or origin, and will reciprocate with Württemberg students.</p>

      <p>Highly learned, pious, and especially trusted, dear lords and good friends. Our friendly greetings with the offering of all honors and services be to you beforehand.</p>
      <p>Our gracious lords, the mayor and council of the city of Zürich, have, out of a special heart that they bear for divine evangelical teaching and for true, good arts (sciences), established two colleges in their city, one at the Grossmünster, the other at the Fraumünster, in place of the provostry and abbey that were formerly in Zürich. They have taken in poor boys who have good talents and are children of upright (honorable) people, with the intention of raising them in decency (propriety), discipline, and honor for teaching and good arts, so that in time they may be called and appointed to the preaching, lecturing, schools, and church offices in their city and territory, to further the honor of God, faithfully proclaim (announce) and maintain the Christian teaching, and rightly and faithfully oversee the churches of God with sound teaching and good example, so that our city and land may stand in prosperity (well-being), fear of God, and in the grace of God, etc.</p>
      <p>The bearers of this letter are Johannes Wolf, Johannes Wick, and Johannes Haller, to whom also (as we consider) Rudolf Gwalther from Savoy is to come, from the number of young men who are being maintained at the aforementioned two foundations. We have sent these to you in Tübingen, to study with you and to learn good manners, discipline, and honor, also to get to know the foreign (to become acquainted with) and thus to begin their journey. They have good beginnings in the Latin and Greek languages. Nevertheless, our lords have found it good to send them to the foreign, so that they may also be trained, practiced (exercised), and experienced. They have been commanded to hear sacred scriptures for an hour each day, a suitable Greek author that is being read, and an hour in dialectics, rhetoric, and the art of speaking. In addition, they should also try mathematics and in all ways (always) conduct themselves in a godly, pious, disciplined, and unoffensive manner, also being serviceable (helpful).</p>
      <p>We have especially sent these to your reverence out of special good trust that our lords and we have in you, and trusting in our good hope in you, that you will, for the sake of God, the church, and our lords, take them into your fatherly care and faithful protection, treat them as your own and teach, discipline, correct, assist, and advise them in good trust, and if they should be insolent (which we do not trust them to be) and disobedient or do what is not proper, to write to us and inform us in time and faithfully (reliably); for the boys (as also mentioned before) are poor and have little or nothing of their own, but are otherwise children of pious honorable people and citizens.</p>
      <p>And each of our lords gives them no more than 34 guilders a year; they are now bringing half of it with them, 17 guilders; they should leave it with you to keep, and when they need money, receive it from you. We also earnestly (emphatically) ask that you accept it from them and burden yourself with the trouble and give them from the money they have left with you when they show reason. You see well, therefore, that they cannot buy a rich and costly table from this, but a modest one for necessity; for over the 34 guilders, they will not be given more in a year, as our lords otherwise have great expenses with many other young men and must give to these so that they may also be maintained.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is our earnest, friendly request that you help them find accommodation with pious, honorable, upright people, who will take them in together (jointly) and provide them with decent lodging and food while they are with you in Tübingen. Further, we ask that you faithfully observe how they study and conduct themselves, no less than if they were your own; for if we did not have this trust in you, we would not have sent them to Tübingen.</p>
      <p>Although we have no doubt that they will suffer no disgrace or disadvantage concerning their faith or origin under the dominion (territory) of our gracious prince and lord of Württemberg; for if anyone from you were to come to us, they would, God willing, also be shown and proven all honor and good. You should also trust in our lords and us. If we can also serve and please you, we will not hesitate and offer (propose) ourselves to earn your service. May God faithfully protect you.</p>
      <p>Given in Zürich, 18th of March in the year etc. 1540. Concluded with the seal of the honorable etc. Master Jörg Müller, chief guild master and appointed over the college at the Fraumünster, in the name of us all.</p>
      <p>The appointed of the council, preachers, learned, and caretakers over the colleges of the city of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, venerable, and wise Doctor Paul Phrygio and Doctor Melchior Volmar, lecturers in Tübingen, their beloved, gracious lords.</p>
