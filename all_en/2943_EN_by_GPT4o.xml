      <p>We have recommended the matter of the most distinguished man, S. Muralti, to the heads of the city, who have kindly promised their favor, but what the senate, which is deciding on it at this hour, will determine, you will learn from the response.</p>
      <p>The cause of these exiles of Christ ought to be most commendable to all. Regarding the expedition of Ferdinand, we receive only this at present, that having left Verda on the Danube, he is heading towards Austria. Meanwhile, the princes are vigilant, who have ordered their men to be ready for any necessity, although it seems unlikely to many that these forces are now indeed being armed against the evangelical estates of the empire, especially since the plans have once been revealed, and unless they are gathered for the purpose of fortifying Vienna and against the Turk, danger threatens the Austrians, Carinthians, and Styrians because of religion, although there are those who affirm that Ferdinand, having been broken by their firm and full demand with much liberty, has finally agreed. Furthermore, I heard the day before yesterday from the most illustrious baron that the Bohemians also have a controversy with the same King Ferdinand, who also promised to share with me a very copious writing about it, which he has in his possession. The offense remains with them because of the ministers expelled the previous year, and this is the plan of the sons of Maximilian and the younger Ferdinand, although he was forced to carry out his father's decision even unwillingly. There are also some other things (they say) that the Bohemians urge, so perhaps for that very reason he is raising an army. We cannot doubt the hostile will and bloody endeavors of all the followers of the antichrist against the professors of true piety, whom it is certain are constantly plotting schemes for the destruction of the saints. But the Lord, who sits above the heavens and who made heaven and earth, is powerful to scatter the plans of the wicked and to preserve the church, provided that we strive to glorify the name of Christ, which we profess with our mouth, with the light of life and just zeal. I received with great pleasure the news of the assembly of the Polish churches and the safety of the most illustrious man, Lysmanini; however, it pains me that the poison of the Servetus heresy is also spreading there, which I had already heard was very widespread in Italy. Therefore, the zeal of the churches seeking remedies in a timely manner is to be greatly approved.</p>
      <p>I have letters prepared for Lysmanini, but I will delay sending them until the arrival of Stanislaus. Margrave Charles of Baden has finally begun the reformation, having called for this work two from Jena in Saxony, one from the Palatinate, and one from the Duchy of Württemberg, Jacob Fabricius, under whose auspices most of the churches in the lower margraviate have now been established. They are now expected in the upper territories as well. They affirm that the form of reformation is entirely similar to that of Württemberg, to which the Saxons have also consented, perhaps at the instigation of Philip, whose counsel the prince has used. May Christ Jesus grant that these things also lead to the abundant glorification of His name. The pope's nephew is going to France and is received everywhere more than royally by the king's command; they think he will secure peace among the monarchs. The Duke of Savoy is staying at the court of the same French king, perhaps to recover his ancestral domain through marriage with the king's sister. If this happens, my Bernese will have a matter to deal with, as I hear they and the Genevans have not yet been able to agree to the extent that they could reunite in the former and mutually beneficial right of the city for both republics. But it is bad if too much is given to the passions of the flesh on both sides, which are unadvised and pernicious, nor are there lacking those who pour cold water on it. Certainly, Geneva owes much to Bern, its liberator, but at the same time, Bern owes nothing to it for the common Savior Christ, whose grace it sees such splendid traces in it, and if it desires anything (as happens in human affairs), it should determine that it will be a great glory if it bears with holy equanimity the foolishness of the foolish and the weakness of the weak. Often, when I was there, I admonished them both publicly and privately for my smallness, and I trust that there are still advisors; but the god of this world is powerful, the father of all [Greek] and of enmities, whom the Lord may confound and grant the spirit of peace and sincere unanimity. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 6, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>I assume that you have long seen the acts and determination of the Munich meeting between the nobles and Prince Albert, otherwise I would have sent them; but if you require, I will also share them at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
