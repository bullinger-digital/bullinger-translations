      <p>Greetings. I have written to you extensively through the Frankfurt merchants about the state of our church, so I do not wish to repeat anything here, especially since you can learn everything exactly through our Jacob, who is delivering this letter. Satan attacks us continually and secretly through his bishops, but so far he has been able to accomplish nothing, and rather, God has kindly turned all his malicious efforts into the strengthening of our church. In the latest parliament, I hear that nothing was discussed regarding the matter of religion. Dr. Hooper, the Bishop of Worcester, diligently performs his duty and surpasses all the other bishops in diligence and piety. If you were to occasionally spur him on through your letters, you would be doing a most useful service to the church. We easily grow weary in the service of our crucified Lord, especially if the burdens of wealth and honors are placed upon us. Such thorns, which prick and wound those running in the way of the Lord, are as harmful as they are. I read from time to time the chapters of your sermons on the books of Samuel, which convey the mind of Scripture most fully with delightful brevity, and therefore, if I thought my prayers could avail anything with you, I would not cease to ask that you publish the collected chapters of your sermons on the books of Kings, the prophets, the evangelists, and the apostles. If you were to do this, in my judgment, more substance could be drawn from them than from the large commentaries of many, who often, leaving the mind of Scripture and the explanation of the text, only wander widely in certain commonplaces. I beseech you to consider the church of Christ here and not to defraud it of such a talent deposited with you. I read in the last two Decades the form of the oath of bishops, which they take to the Pope; but it is not noted where this form can be found described in the pontifical books.</p>
      <p>There is a certain form of the oath of bishops in book 2 of the Decretals, on the oath, title 24, chapter 4: I, N., but it does not fully correspond to the form you have written. I therefore ask you, if the oath of bishops can be found elsewhere in the form as you have written it, to kindly indicate it. Farewell, my esteemed lord, and kindly consider my freedom.</p>
      <p>Be pleased to convey my greetings to my venerable teachers Dr. Pellican, Dr. Bibliander, and Dr. Gesner. London, April 14, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, as much as I am, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>Johannes Utenhovius, yours, as much as he is, asking the same as Dr. Martin from you, commending himself to your piety from the heart and awaiting your letters.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant bishop of the ZÃ¼rich church, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord.</p>
