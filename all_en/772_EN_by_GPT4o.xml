      <p>The reason I write less frequently is due to the couriers, and I have no other excuse, as I have received letters from those who did not wish to return to Zürich. I received money for the books purchased along with three letters. Therefore, I am sending two books by Agricola; the rest are not available in our bookstores. You will find a book on handling horses by Xenophon. Perhaps you are thinking of aspiring to the papal indignity in Rome; you are greatly mistaken. They would poison those whom you have so far exposed to ridicule by the whole world, and you should have little or nothing to do with horses unless you wish to neglect the sacred books and ride like bishops, putting the horses of the word of God aside. You will soon have a useful and diligent book on monetary matters by Agricola, which is already under the Froben press, in which you will find the opinions and views of all who have written so far. If you desire the book by Paul Ebner, I will ensure you receive it after the Frankfurt fair, if you indicate with a single word. Oporinus will publish the works of Nazianzen in Greek and Latin at his press at the expense of Hervagius, a work worthy of being read by all theologians. I am glad to hear that the plague has ceased to rage among you; it is a sure sign that God's wrath has been mitigated and that He does not wish to extinguish or afflict the church, which spreads the word of His Son Christ without any trepidation, with greater sorrow. We are all subject to death; however, those who praise God with heart and deeds should live a long time to attract and lead others to the proclamation of God. We hear little about the pope, although Mr. Paulus Vergerius expects letters at any moment.</p>
      <p>Italy is in turmoil, and there are great seditions in Rome; the cardinals are contending for the papacy, and the devil is pouring cold water to prevent his kingdom from perishing. I believe the priests have taken back Strasbourg, as someone wrote to me ten days ago, more terrified by the fear of the Emperor than by anything else. We will soon see wonders with those Ballites, whom the Lord will destroy with a miraculous extermination, just as He destroyed the Templars; otherwise, there will never be peace in religion, nor will they cease to shed blood unless their blood is shed first. King Ferdinand has instituted a new levy in Hungary and Alsace Brisgau; they are compelled to give 32,000 florins for the dowry of a daughter to be married to an Italian duke. The Emperor has extracted a larger sum of money from those who are subject to the mandate, that is, those who belong to the under the jurisdiction of Hagnau. Furthermore, you hear astonishing things about the kingdom of Poland.</p>
      <p>In Krakow, a diet was held; the majority of the princes, along with the bishops, asked the king to dismiss his wife (you undoubtedly know what kind of wife the king took and for what reasons).</p>
      <p>He replied that he did not want to do this, as it was against God's justice, and he would rather lose the Polish kingdom. The princes are contending over creating a new king. Lesser Poland adheres to the king and has promised to willingly expose their bodies and external goods for the king and to punish the disobedient. The Muscovites have promised aid to the king.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand does not rest, wanting to intrude his son into the Polish kingdom. See the satanic cunning. He sent an envoy to the opposing princes with a large booklet, offering his son to be created king with very great promises and help; they are golden mountains that he promises. He has tried to excuse his tyranny in Bohemia in the book. A prince stood up while the book was being read, tore the book from the hands of the Ferdinandian and tore it up in the presence of the envoys and all the princes, saying: Pure lies are contained in this book, there are many noble exiles as witnesses. Thus, the envoy was forced to leave with the matter unresolved; for among many, the mention of a new king of Spanish blood was an insolent word.</p>
      <p>Duke Albert, Lord of Prussia, has allowed about 300 exiles from Bohemia to settle in Prussia; they are from noble families, excellent men who flee the tyranny of Ferdinand. He gave them four small towns where they can comfortably live with their families. They are said to be excellent men and very devoted to religion.</p>
      <p>The plague is raging very fiercely in Prussia. Königsberg, where the duke's seat is, is almost deserted. The duke fled to Lithuania with his court.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand taxes the whole of Bohemia, caring nothing for the obedient and disobedient; whatever one has to consume outside his goods, he must give half to him this year, the other half the next year. Thus I understand: if I had 100 florins in rent on another, I would have to give 50 florins this year and also 50 florins the next year. Then the poor are compelled to spend something every day or on Sundays for this levy, and to gain some favor with the people, he has again allowed them to carry and buy arms. He fears the Turkish savagery raging more than anything else.</p>
      <p>In Brno in Bohemia or rather in Moravia, two noblemen and a knight have quarreled with each other. A nobleman said to the lord, he holds no justice for anyone, everything goes according to favor. The other denied it, asked for testimony; the matter is reported to the king. The nobleman was summoned, who replied to the king, the cry is in the whole of Bohemia, showed some examples, and requested to testify with his hand. This proved the matter; a single combat was instituted. The nobleman knocked the other off his horse with his lance in the first course, then opened his side with a sword, but the king's men defended the judge, and thus the matter was settled in the presence of the king.</p>
      <p>The Ferdinandians rest after capturing fortresses in Hungary; the robbers were taken to Vienna, where they are compelled to work in public works, almost in the manner of the Turks, although these robbers deserve a heavier punishment. They burned a baker's servant who had thrown the sacrament to the ground and trampled it on the day of our Lord, about which you may have heard before; they first cut off both his hands, then his tongue, and thirdly burned the man most miserably.</p>
      <p>Soon more about these matters; for I have gathered these from the Bruttenians who are with us. Have I not compensated for my long silence? I have written more in this single letter than you in three. Farewell and greet Mr. Theodor, Pellican, and the others, especially our Frisius, in my name.</p>
      <p>On St. Stephen's Day 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Mr. Paulus Vergerius will come to you shortly, who sends his regards to you and the other brothers, having had no leisure to write back. Who is this John Burcher, the Englishman, to whom I should give your consent in the matter of the Eucharist? I do not know the man; if you do not indicate where he lives or with whom, I will return the writing.</p>
      <p>Also greet Mr. Lelio in my name.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and learned pastor Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest in the Lord. Zürich.</p>
