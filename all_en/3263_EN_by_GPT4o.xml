      <p>Greetings. While I am occupied in the defense of our common doctrine and laboring strenuously, our friend here will narrate to you what unjust reward the neighbors repay, because I am unable due to grief. And our good brothers, who daily discuss the communion of saints from the pulpit, are not moved by such danger. If no concern for this city touches them, how do they watch the church being destroyed from their quiet? I will not speak hyperbolically. Unless help is provided promptly, know that the fortunes of all our exiles are given as prey to the citizens, and all are thrown into custody so that no one dares to leave.</p>
      <p>This indignity, although covered by the silence of men, ought to shake the very stones. I hope, however, that as soon as the matter is exposed, there will be a timely remedy.</p>
      <p>Among your people, indeed, neither your faith, I know, nor your diligence will be lacking. How skillfully I have conducted myself against the Saxons, you will judge.</p>
      <p>For I preferred to send the book not yet completed, rather than keep you in suspense with expectation. Since I know I am incurring the hatred of all, it will be no small consolation to me if at least my duty pleases you. Certainly, because I trust it is pleasing to God, I have not hesitated to provoke the rage of those beasts against me boldly and cheerfully. In Beza's confession, because there is no underlying danger, I easily excuse that he, in favor of the brothers, with moderation applied, sought to appease the fierce men: especially since he had previously explained all his views distinctly. That he concealed it from you upon return, be assured it was done out of mere thoughtlessness.</p>
      <p>For I would not have known unless Valerand had spread his poison here as well, whose ambition or rashness at Frankfurt forced the French and English guests to subscribe to the Augsburg Confession, with the exception, however, interposed concerning the word substantially.</p>
      <p>It was decreed that henceforth the German preachers should not be troublesome to them, until the principal ones from both sides meet. Would that the obstinacy of your men did not hinder what we greatly desired, for what reason it was rejected I do not know. Farewell, most distinguished man and esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>I wish D. Peter Martyr much health, D. Gwalther and the remaining colleagues.</p>
      <p>All friends greet you reverently.</p>
      <p>Geneva, August 7, 1557.</p>
      <p>To D. Martyr.</p>
      <p>Count Martinengo is still bedridden, but without danger.</p>
      <p>We despaired of his life for four or five whole days. Now only weakness from the illness keeps the man in bed.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, D. Heinrich Bullinger, brother and esteemed colleague.</p>
