      <p>I am sending what I know will be most pleasing to you, namely the deliberation of those who were recently at the Saxon synod; but on the condition that you ensure two copies are made, one to be sent to Bassafontanum and the other to Baionensem. I would have taken care of it here, but there was no leisure; for the messenger, who came to Schaffhausen, is pressing and gives me no more than an hour's time. In other matters, there is nothing new.</p>
      <p>The prince was here for three days with two other princes, Wolfgang of the Palatinate and the Margrave of Baden, along with their wives.</p>
      <p>I have done much with him, who indeed is fervent in the gospel; this you should certainly know. I hope that a certain friend will send to you within a few days about fifty crowns, which belong to me; you will keep them for me until I write to whom they should be given; I know with whom I will deposit them. Farewell, my dearest Bullinger, dearest of all, I say. May the Lord increase heavenly gifts to you and your family and the church and the school through Christ our Lord. I bid all greetings from God.</p>
      <p>TÃ¼bingen, July 10, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
