      <p>S. After a long delay, I wrote to you a few days ago about certain matters, to which I now add these things that we have received in the meantime: From Montbéliard, June 16. The old queen has declared herself the regent of all of France and has appointed the Cardinal of Lorraine as the governor of Paris, who has already taken office. Montgomery has been taken to Paris, where, as it is believed, he has already been executed and beheaded. (Here it is said that he was beheaded in another place and only the head was sent to Paris).</p>
      <p>The Duke of Alençon and the King of Navarre are no longer to be guarded as before, but are to be brought into the Bastille in Paris and guarded with 500 Swiss and 500 French marksmen. It is uncertain about Montmorency and Marshal de Cossé whether they have been beheaded, as some claim.</p>
      <p>From Balsthal, June 11. The commander of the marksmen, who owns both houses Türgkenstein and Châtillon, called the Lord of Manducage, who previously defeated Emps with his force, attacked Châtillon last Sunday, Count Palatine George Hans as the protector of the lordship, with about 600 or 700 marksmen and 60 or 70 horses at Türgkenstein. Their main activity is to raid almost every day on the territory of the Abbey of Metz, saying they have nothing to do with anyone but the priests. Last Saturday, they fell with 300 marksmen and 50 horses into the nearest villages near Baccarat and drove away about 200 head of cattle. The day before yesterday, they strongly attacked La Garde or Freiburg, which also belongs to the Abbey. The Lord of Thon is at Baccarat; the day before yesterday, 100 marksmen came to him to occupy the houses. A leader under Manducage, who committed treachery, was executed (that is, tied to a tree and shot by marksmen).</p>
      <p>From Antwerp, June 5.</p>
      <p>Our armada departed from here on Thursday before Pentecost with 22 warships. The Spaniards and the sailors could not agree. On Pentecost, the Geuzen came after them and captured 14 of them, hanged and drowned everything that was on them, and captured our admiral. Three ships returned here; four ran aground not far from here, pursued by the Geuzen and burned, which lay there for a day and a half so that they could be seen from here. There was a great commotion among the Spaniards, who went out, but were received in such a way that many of them remained behind.</p>
      <p>From another letter.</p>
      <p>Count Peter of Mansfeld declared against Mainz that his captains, including Margrave Christoph of Baden, Count of Neuenahr, the one from Ossa, Bernhard of Schadtitz, Statius of Münchhausen, Balthasar of Bruchhausen, and Johann of Wilfersdorf, and their recruited riders are required to take action and have been ordered to take their passage according to the imperial order. The one from Neuenahr has already crossed the Rhine to Mainz with 50 horses and, together with the one from Heideck, moved to Luxembourg; Schadtitz, Ossa, and others arrived three days ago around and in the Wederow with several hundred horses. These things were communicated to me by Steiger, and I wanted to share them with you as well: He greets you. May all yours be safe.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 21, 1574.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To my most beloved lord and godfather, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
