      <p>S. D. Regarding my calling, dearest lord Bullinger, nothing has been done yet. The presence of Haller was desired. He returned on the first of this month.</p>
      <p>After his return, I do not see what else could delay matters, unless perhaps they are waiting for the delegates they sent to the Baden assembly. I do not mind these delays because of the upcoming synod, and Haller believes that the presence of the treasurer Haller will not be disadvantageous to my affairs. Meanwhile, I am treated quite kindly by the brothers. I see that this church is not yet at peace, not only in the city but also in the countryside, especially in the French-speaking area; therefore, it will be absolutely necessary that, even if I remain here, Haller should also be retained, as his gentleness and moderation can correct many things, and the people of this city have an extraordinary desire for his teaching, so it is clear that he cannot be removed from this church without great detriment and distraction of the listeners. When I speak to him about this matter, he says that he will refer whatever happens to the power of your council. Therefore, it will be your task to inform your lords there about these matters. Indeed, Christ is served there as well; however, since the necessity is greater here, your church must be left, and this one must be helped, which otherwise lies miserably torn apart. But you know these things better yourself and undoubtedly consider them carefully.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding the stipend, as I hear from the brothers here, there is a risk that it may not be sufficient for the needs of my large family.</p>
      <p>Each preacher is paid one hundred florins and 10 jugs of wine, as it grows in the vicinity, and 24 bushels of grain, so that the total stipend is 150 florins, which you can well imagine how it might suffice for me and mine.</p>
      <p>It is indeed sufficient for the others, Dr. Jodocus and Weber; but the former has only one son, the latter only one daughter. I beseech you, if in the meantime, while I am stuck here, you can achieve something in this matter, that you do so. Farewell very well, most esteemed man. Greetings to your entire household, to the other lords and all my brothers, and to Gervasius.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 5, 1549.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian M. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, lord and dearest brother in Christ. To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
