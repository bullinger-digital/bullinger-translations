      <p>Greetings. The one who delivered this, dearest compater in the Lord, has indicated that he will go to Zürich; if I wanted to write anything there, he is prepared to perform this duty, whatever it may be, to deliver the letters. Although there is nothing that I necessarily need to write, I did not want to neglect the opportunity to receive letters from you conveniently, if there is anything you wish to write. I pray, however, that if you have received anything from Augsburg, you will let me know in a few words. Today, my son reported to me that certain letters addressed to my name are being held in Basel at the office of Episcopius by a certain printer, who received them to be delivered to me in Augsburg. If, when they are brought, I discover anything in them worthy of your knowledge, I will ensure that you know. Otherwise, everything at my home is peaceful so far, except that my wife is strangely sad and anxious because we are spending here what she thought should be saved for the children and herself. But what should I do?</p>
      <p>I promise her that the Lord will eventually remove even this inconvenience; but I make little progress, which does not lightly tire me. Pray to the Lord that He may deign to consider the situation of a weak vessel. Greet in the name of all of us your most honorable wife along with the children, also all the lords and brothers, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Theodor Bibliander, and Mr. Rudolf, and our friend Mr. Butler. Bern, the last day of September 1550.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musc[ulus], your compater in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, dearest lord and compater.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
