    <p xml:id="regest1">Meyer received Bullinger's letter [not preserved] on July 22nd along with a letter from [Adam Bartholomäus]. He is pleased about the well-being of Bullinger, his homeland, and its church, while he himself [like John once in exile] sighs on "Patmos." - He has not seen [Josua], the son of Bullinger's brother [Johannes]. Josua came to Neuburg [on the Danube], where according to Bartholomäus' letter, he found a teacher but left him due to his violence and moved on to Rain [on the Lech] in the dominion of Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria, where he now works. In an emergency, Meyer would assist [Josua] with advice and support. - Meyer conveys two letters to Bullinger [addressed to him]: one from an unknown person [...], another from Bartholomäus [above No. 2218]. Unfortunately, due to the unexpected haste of the messenger [...], he cannot write more extensively; however, he may soon respond through his wife [Regula]. - He preaches the Crucified, with many people listening, the council sleeping, and the [ducal caretaker?] absent. Meyer is considered a Zwinglian, which suits him. The Papists, frightened by the voice of Balaam's donkey, are shattered. - On August 12th, "Tyros" [Pope Paul III.?] deployed his soldiers, and the "Wolf" [Bishop Otto Truchsess of Waldburg?] displayed the insignia of his vanity in Dillingen. The "red Wolf" [Cardinal Alessandro Farnese?] has Sodom at the [imperial] court at his disposal. Where has the integrity of old Germany gone? - Whether there are honest church servants in "Patmos," Meyer does not know. The dogs are mute; they do not dare to tell "Pentheus" the truth and drink through the night, while the [traitors], like Sinon back then, bring in the Trojan Horse. Almost nothing is safe anymore. Recently, some of the [Protestants] defected to the [Catholics]. There is no news from the court. - If only there were calming news to report! But [the prophet] Micah prophesies nothing good. Who can possibly untie this Gordian knot? - Meyer can hardly endure his surroundings anymore. There is a constant rumor that the Emperor intends to wage war against the [Confederates]. - Greetings to Mayor [Hans Rudolf] Lavater, the other [Zurich] city fathers, Bullinger's family, his wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler], and his brother [Johannes Bullinger]. Bullinger may recall Meyer to "Ephesus" after the death of "Domitian." - The absent Kastner [Hans Ulrich Zeißler] has not given Meyer anything [to convey to Bullinger]; however, he would thank for Bullinger's greetings. One hopes for Bullinger's commentary on Mark soon and also the one on Luke. - In the name of [Regula], greetings to [Anna] and to the friendly colleagues.</p>

      <p>Grace and steadfastness through Christ.</p>
      <p>Your letter, dearest Bullinger, I received on July 22nd along with the letter from the licentiate, in which I learned that both you and the church and homeland are safe in the harbor. I congratulate you on your happiness; meanwhile, I sigh in Patmos.</p>
      <p>I have not seen the boy of the excellent man Johannes, your brother, my very dear friend. He reached Neuburg, whether by foot or by boat, I do not know; but from there the licentiate wrote to me that he found a master of his craft there. But he left recently for this reason: The tender age of the boy could not bear the notable impiety of his master, such as blasphemies, daily quarrels and fights with his wife, and other such monstrosities of impiety. He bid farewell to the licentiate and went to the town of Rain, which is under the rule of Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria, and there he now lives and works, as I have learned from the licentiate's letters. I am always ready, if I can do anything for the young man, whether it be advice, money, or other benefits of sincere humanity.</p>
      <p>Now, in a few words, understand what I want: I am sending you letters from an unknown man to me. I have added those of the licentiate. You will understand what they want. You asked that I wash away my long silence, during which I have been almost like the frogs of Seriphos, with a sufficiently long letter. Certainly, I lack neither spirit nor zeal; however, the immature and least expected haste of the messenger is now an obstacle for me. Perhaps I will respond shortly through my wife.</p>
      <p>But now take this very briefly: I have preached the Crucified so far and not without a cross; the common people prick up their ears, the council sleeps, the head of the household is absent, the servants do what they have always done. I hang between heaven and earth. I am ill-spoken of because of Zwingli. I rejoice. I have testified that Zwingli was a man both upright and steadfast, most loving of religion and homeland; now I am a Zwinglian. It pleases me! I prefer to be a Zwinglian than a straw Lutheran!</p>
      <p>The people adorn the sermons with the most numerous crown, but ships without oars, a body without a head. O mandrake sleep! The Papists have fallen, certainly deterred by the voice of Balaam's donkey; the prayer of the pious has cut off the beast's heads; the hand of the Lord has not yet been rendered powerless. On August 12th, Tyros led out his peppercorn soldiers; and the wolf in Dillingen on the same day vomited papal horns and bloody hats and the insignia of his vanity with equal childishness. The honor of integrity is almost none, hypocrisy reigns, virtue lies in bed, flattery has occupied everything. What should I do in Rome? I do not know how to lie. A strange thing: That red wolf has Sodom in the court, that is, Italians from Italy, few Germans from Germany. An Italian is in the court. O the gravity and integrity of old Germany! Quintilius Varus, give back the legions! Where? O morals, o times!</p>
      <p>Whether Pathmos has ministers of the word like you (o happy homeland!), I do not know, one or two. The dogs are mute. They do not dare to say: Pentheus, ruler of Thebes, drinking into the long night, they lead out the Trojan horse pregnant with crimes, acting as Sinon! Almost nothing is left safe with them. What should I say about blasphemies? They overflow and float. Some have recently left us, loving the meager kitchen of the antichrist more than the most abundant pastures of Christ. I can write nothing certain to you about the court; for I have nothing certain, nor do those who are involved in it.</p>
      <p>Tell us pleasing things! Micah brings nothing good, the iron horns have turned into feathers, the rock into sand, and hope, sitting on a bubble, where will it fall? Who can untie this Gordian knot?</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell in Christ with the church, the most illustrious and prudent council, the best brothers, the most humane citizens, either you will have me shortly or both my wife and me. We can no longer endure the customs of this people. Look after your affairs; there is a constant rumor that the emperor is planning a destined war against the homeland, even if he now least wants to be considered or seen as such. You will greet in my name the most prudent and wise consul Lavater and all the other best fathers of the homeland, the pillars of the churches, your family, especially your fruitful wife, chaste and endowed with the most holy morals, your brother Johannes, etc. I commend myself to you; be mindful of me.</p>
      <p>With Domitian dead, you may perhaps soon recall me to Ephesus, etc. Castner, hindered by many affairs and not at home now, has entrusted nothing to me; but I, in the name of the man, give thanks for your greeting, which you sent. Those who are of Christ expect from you soon a commentary on Mark, supported by the best hope that they will soon also have one on Luke. Be strong in Christ. Farewell again, my lord and brother, with my sweetest homeland and all my sweetest friends.</p>
      <p>Gundelfingen, the last of August in the year 1545. In the name of my wife, you will greet yours and our common friends of the Levitical order, etc.</p>
      <p>Lorenz, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most prudent herald of evangelical truth of the church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and brother, etc.</p>
