      <p>Although I had many things to write to you, most honorable man, I could not, as I most wished, recount and express my opinion on many and serious matters. For the messenger, having met me in the street, was just about to leave. I will write at the first opportunity presented to me in great detail.</p>
      <p>The King of the French laid great foundations for victory in Brabant, but he did not complete the matter, which was happily begun, very prudently and in every respect. Yesterday around the 6th hour in the afternoon, two Spaniards on swift horses hurried from Italy to the Emperor, boasting more gloriously that the army of Strozzi, that is, the French, was scattered, cut down, and overthrown, and that they would bring the Emperor the most joyful news of the victorious standards. If this is so, it would have been better not to engage the standards than to disgracefully abandon them with danger. Our Lutherans have nothing on their lips but the Schwärmer; for now, a certain Peter is openly dealing with the sacramental matter.</p>
      <p>I expect Dr. Gesner's book daily, so that, having it, I may obtain a privilege. I sincerely wish for him, along with the other pillars of your church and school, to be safe and sound.</p>
      <p>I have taken Maximilian back again, although I had a good and learned man, whom the people of Strasbourg sent; I will take care to provide for him under another condition. Maximilian has committed his service for two years; for it would be difficult to make such great and costly changes every year. Farewell, my Bullinger, and love Gereon, who is devoted to you in all things. If anything worthy of reading has been published among you, I ask that it be sent to me at my expense. In Augsburg, most swiftly, August 8th, in the year 54.</p>
      <p>Your Gereon.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and learned man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the church of Zürich, most respected lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
