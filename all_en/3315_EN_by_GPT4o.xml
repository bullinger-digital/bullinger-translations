      <p>Greetings. To you and Gesner, my most sincere friends, I give eternal thanks for your merits towards me. You continually send books, and I give nothing in return.</p>
      <p>The spirit is not lacking, but the opportunity to deserve well has not yet been offered; if it is given, I will diligently ensure that you do not bestow your benefits in vain and to an ungrateful person. Here, everything is full of turmoil.</p>
      <p>For those who have deposited large and great weights of gold with the King of England, that victory is sweeter than Hyblaean honey; conversely, for those who have entrusted their wealth to the French, everything is adverse, everything seems to threaten ruin.</p>
      <p>You would see the Eucliones very sad and reduced to black bile, running here and there to watch over the hidden pot and to guard it so that it is not entirely lost. But those free from passions and not so eager for these interests think this disaster will lead to the glory of Christ and a more abundant propagation of the word, partly out of hatred for the pope, partly because neither king dares to exercise so many and such great tyrannies on their subjects for religion. A castle in the Netherlands is being besieged by the English; but they think all is done in vain.</p>
      <p>They believe the King of France will revive and regain strength, indeed many proclaim it as certain. The Swiss, wise as ever, are said to learn from the danger of others, so I would like to advise you to consider well, with united forces, what pertains to all and each individually. If the king goes to ruin entirely, the Roman Empire will be reduced under foreign power and Swiss liberty will be endangered. However, the superiors will strive to ensure that the handle does not fall from their hand.</p>
      <p>Bolviler has made a selection of soldiers and has at least 8000 of the most select; he promised his men that within eight days he would allow them to plunder the enemy's goods. He wanted to burden the Duchy of Württemberg with the recruitment of soldiers; but the excellent prince, having often written letters to King Ferdinand about this matter, strongly opposed it and achieved so much that he completely freed his people from that burden. They say that Metz has fallen into the power of the enemy due to the citizens' dissension against the French.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my excellent Bullinger, and keep Geryon, who is devoted to you in all things, commended. Augsburg, September 16, in the year 57.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Gesner, Mr. Gwalther, and Mr. Occhino.</p>
      <p>Your G[eryon] S[ailer].</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, distinguished in theological learning and piety, and my most sincere friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
