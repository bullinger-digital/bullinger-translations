      <p>[...] Fragment transcribed from a letter of Mr. Théodore de Bèze dated to me on June 8, which I received on June 16. What now... - I will recount. Indeed, my dear Bullinger, I have not received any letters from Théodore from you recently, which I did not want you to be unaware of, in case you have entrusted them to someone, so that you know they have not been delivered to me, but if not, I ask you earnestly to send them to me to read.</p>
      <p>What is now being reported to us is not very joyful, namely that the Parisians continue in their most furious rages and that many other cities follow their stubbornness, and consequently our brothers are not admitted in most places under any condition.</p>
      <p>Amiral, in whom alone there is more spirit and counsel than in all the others, remains at home protected by his own against their violence and plots, who say that Guise was killed by his counsel and deceit and therefore threaten to repay in kind; but in truth, these things are pretended by those who cannot bear the light of the gospel, which they hope to extinguish by removing the best and bravest man.</p>
      <p>In Orléans, with the introduction of the Swiss garrison, they are now beginning to be treated most unjustly by the governor of the province; the same seems to be being prepared in Lyon.</p>
      <p>The Queen acts in her usual manner and advises the king and the kingdom very poorly in that she flatters those whom it is certain can be restrained by no other means than the utmost and extreme severity.</p>
      <p>What our prince is thinking in the meantime, I do not know; but time will tell.</p>
      <p>You see, therefore, that the quiver of divine wrath conceived for most just reasons against that kingdom is not yet exhausted.</p>
      <p>A great storm also seems to be threatening our necks, whether the Bernese restore the dominion to the Savoyard or decide to retain it by arms. But however it may be, we are masters, and even if heaven and earth are mixed and even if we must die, we will hope in Him who is our strength, both living and dead.</p>
      <p>What moves me more is that I see the strength of our Calvin not only afflicted as before but almost even prostrated; but I do not want to predict what would be far more bitter to me than any death.</p>
      <p>Let us only proceed bravely until the goal is reached, and let us mutually strengthen each other with constant prayers; for certainly our God lives and will soon grant us complete victory. (He also adds:) Because I do not doubt that our brothers in Zürich have shared with you not only those things which I have written here from time to time from France when it was possible, but also those letters which I recently gave to them, I think it is not necessary to recount the same stories repeatedly.</p>
