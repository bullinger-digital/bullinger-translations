    <p xml:id="regest1">Has seen Luther's furious booklet ["Kurtz bekentnis"]; what kind of spirit [is at work there]! The Confederates had acknowledged in Marburg [1529] that in the symbols [of the Lord's Supper] there was more than just [bread and wine], whereas the [Bernese] Disputation [of 1528] and Bucer's commentary on Matthew [of 1527] prove the opposite! The whole book should be divided into parts, and for each part, a moderate but bold defense of the truth should be written with reference to the Bernese Disputation (which was itself won from the Word of God) and with a reproduction of Luther's writing, so that everyone can recognize Luther's audacity. [The opponents] want to eliminate Luther's book; [the Bernese] already possessed it, secretly borrowed it [among themselves], and now claim to be shocked by Luther's coarseness. The [Bernese] situation would have become dire if the holding of a [new] disputation had not been prohibited; Sulzer and Beat [Gering] remain true to themselves; Erasmus [Ritter] and Johannes Wäber wanted to know from them whether they actually intended to obey the council's decision [of December 5, 1544]; Rümlang dissuaded them and advised them to rather demand a revision of the [Bernese] catechism in accordance with the [Bernese] Disputation and the [“Cancell unnd Agend büchly” of 1541], in which the ratified council decision would also be included; their deceit will then become apparent, as Rümlang hardly believes that such can be obtained from them. [Luther] proves himself [in his booklet] disarmed; [the Zurichers] however should fight lawfully and worthily and send everything they develop [to the Bernese]. The [Bernese] court clerk [Hans von Rütte] requests the binding of a large German Bible; he and his wife [Barbara Flühmann] feel obliged to Bullinger. Wishes [Hans Rudolf] Lavater all the best for his office. Would like to receive longer letters from Bullinger. The bear has absorbed nothing good from its own; the secret [of their doctrine] was worked out in Wittenberg; this is even indicated on the title pages of their writings, as Rümlang could deduce from a document. Greetings to the brothers in Winterthur, whom Bullinger should exhort to take care of Rümlang's old uncle [...]. Rümlang hopes to visit Zurich soon.</p>

      <p>Greetings, distinguished and most honorable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I have seen Luther's furious and mad booklet, which I believe is driven by furies and rampant with rage. From what spirit, do you think, do these curses proceed, from whose mouth is full of execration? How shamelessly he judges! How wickedly he lies!</p>
      <p>Like all the desperate, he slanders! How he twists the passage from Luke about the light of the body! What do the words of the Savior about faith mean to Luther, if it exists like a grain of mustard seed? How he boasts that in Marburg it was conceded that our symbols are not bare, while our Disputation, held before the Marburg colloquy, contains otherwise, and Bucer reported much differently in Matthew! Indeed, in my opinion, the entire book should be carefully resolved into sections (in parts) and, for the sake of vindicating the truth, a moderate but manly and intrepid, yet not lacking, refutation should be applied to each, so that posterity may judge, whatever may happen now. Leave nothing untouched and by no means remain silent, as some have urged us to agree. Freely name and refer to our Disputation, the divine truth, I say, won here from His word, and ensure that Luther's entire booklet is printed alongside, so that everyone may know his impudence.</p>
      <p>As far as I understand, they want the book suppressed; for even our adversaries have had this rabid booklet, but they only shared it among themselves in corners; and now we experience this when we bring forth our own. They pretend to be horrified by these coarse words of Luther; but God knows the hearts.</p>
      <p>Our affairs here among the leaders would be more turbulent if the holding of a disputation had not been prohibited. Sulzer and Battius - not Beatus to us - will remain true to themselves, if only the opportunity is given to them. Erasmus and Johannes Weber wanted to know from them whether they intended to obey the senate's decree and abstain from their usual forms and innovations or how they would comply with our disputation in the future; from which I myself dissuaded them and advised them to demand, according to the bare sentence and words of the decree, that our catechism be corrected to the form of the Disputation and the booklet called "Agens," and that it be established that this is written and sealed in the mandate. For then it will be well understood what lies hidden in their deceitful hearts, for I am convinced that they will not so easily admit it - although it ought to be done -, and at the same time they will achieve that no importunity is imposed on us. Ensure that Luther's booklet is attached to your response, so that everyone may experience that you want the adversaries' thunderbolts to be known to all. He feels disarmed, therefore he falls into effeminate lamentation (complaint) and insults. Nothing, however, should be concealed. Strive lawfully, you who are deemed worthy of the contest. You will not be deprived of the due crown. May the Lord deign to be with you to promote His truth. Whatever you work on, I ask, send it to us voluntarily.</p>
      <p>The scribe of our court requests that a large German Bible be bound and sent, if you have a messenger. He will ensure it is brought if he understands it is bound. The treasurer thanks you for the sent booklet and he and his wife offer themselves in your service.</p>
      <p>I pray for a successful beginning for Lavater's office, to whom you will commend me and all the learned.</p>
      <p>I attribute to your occupations that you respond to me briefly. I take in good part whatever proceeds from you, although, if it were allowed, I would ask for more.</p>
      <p>The bear has absorbed nothing good from its own. The mystery of this saliva is cultivated in Wittenberg, so that they even place it on the frontispiece of their booklets. Here I understand the enigma in the document.</p>
      <p>I pray, when you have the opportunity, that you may deign to greet the brothers in Winterthur in my name, and to exhort them to console my now decrepit and therefore weak uncle, and to kindly make up for my absence in my name.</p>
      <p>I trust I will soon come to you, where I will be refreshed and cheered by your presence. May the Lord protect you.</p>
      <p>Written hastily late at night on the Feast of the Holy Innocents at the end of the year 1544.</p>
      <p>Entirely and wholly yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful and vigilant Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of Zurich, his ever-to-be-respected patron.</p>
