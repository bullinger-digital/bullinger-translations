      <p>S. D. My dearest compater in the Lord, Haller and I have received your common letter along with the gift you sent to Johann Heinrich, our mutual godson in Christ, for the auspicious beginning of the upcoming fifty-first year, for which we thank you on his behalf. I pray to the Lord that he grants him both peace and longevity, so that you may one day see him in person, instruct him, and he may respond to your kindness with a grateful heart according to his ability.</p>
      <p>You fear that the future council of the Antichristians may particularly endanger Switzerland. I have long spoken here about this very matter with those I could; but it is the middle of the night, and all are asleep. I urge that the evangelicals of Zürich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and the other allies, so to speak, unite their spirits in time. For unless this is done, I do not see how hands can be joined firmly and effectively when it will be necessary to confront the enemy.</p>
      <p>You retain the memory of ancient discord very diligently, which you do not even dare to disapprove or criticize in words. Besides the fact that this matter is entirely at odds with the profession of the Gospel of Christ, it also has the evil effect of greatly hindering the solid concord of minds, which is now most necessary. This evil troubles me greatly; but what can I do? I cry out to the Lord to take care of his churches and not allow them to be endangered concerning the truth of his Gospel because of the foolishness of some imprudent men. If this council proceeds, we will see the great wickedness of the Antichristians; but I hope the Lord will scatter the plans of the princes.</p>
      <p>It will be very difficult for the Emperor and the Pope to convene a council from Germany, France, England, Denmark, and Poland, although Spain and Italy may not refuse. Would that our people be vigilant and wise. Farewell very well, dearest compater.</p>
      <p>My house is now peaceful; thanks be to the Lord. Greetings to all yours and the brothers. Bern, December 16, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Musculus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, his dearest compater in Christ.</p>
