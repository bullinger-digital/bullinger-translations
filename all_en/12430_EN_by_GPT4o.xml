    <p xml:id="regest1">Jakob [Metzler?] has delivered Blarer's letter [No. 2381], the enclosed documents of which, read in haste, Bullinger hereby returns. He is very pleased that the spokesperson for the Protestants [Martin Bucer] wants to take the Holy Scripture as the standard, even if nothing can be achieved in this way, especially since the [Catholics] will reject such an approach.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- From the Emperor [Charles V], Bullinger expects nothing different than from [the cruel rulers] Pharaoh, Sennacherib, Domitian, and Diocletian. One must prepare for severe persecutions, in which the Lord will nevertheless not abandon his Church. If the Emperor first occupies Cologne, this will become a great evil for all of Germany, because then Cologne would become his refuge, where he could retreat after the destruction of many regions (not by a legitimate army, but by marauding bands). If the [Protestants] wanted to prevent this, they would have to incur great costs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger's writing [„De sacramentis“] should now be read more thoroughly by Blarer, and Bullinger should be informed whether he advises its printing or not.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- From France, it is heard that King [Francis I] is sending an army into Piedmont, and that [Antoine] Morelet [du Museau] will come to Solothurn with money.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Jacob here delivered your letter, most esteemed brother in the Lord. I return the enclosed documents with thanks. I was only able to skim through them due to various engagements. What pleased me most was that the spokesperson for the Protestants wants everything to be judged according to the Holy Scriptures, which fully contain all things pertaining to our salvation. But if our side persists in this, there will be no hope of progress; for the adversaries will never concede this. Thus, once again, time and expenses are wasted in vain. May the Lord turn it to good.</p>

      <p>Regarding the Emperor, I expect nothing different than from Pharaoh, Sennacherib, Domitian, and Diocletian. It is necessary, therefore, that we prepare ourselves for severe persecutions, in which, however, the Lord will certainly not abandon His Church.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>If the Emperor first occupies the city of Cologne, you will see this happen to the great detriment of all of Germany. It will be a safe haven for him, where he can retreat after ravaging many regions (not with a legitimate army, but with marauding and predatory bands) with fire and sword. If we do not wish to besiege such a great city, it will not happen without great danger to us. But the Lord, blessed forever, teaches the hands of His people for battle and their fingers for war. We must pray to Him, that He, having mercy on us, may deliver us from the mouth of the lion.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I did not send you my book on the sacraments so that you might skim through it, but rather to read it more diligently, so that you might give me your advice on whether I should have it printed or not. Since you have read it, I ask you to give me your judgment in a few words, and this through the next messenger. If there is anything in the whole book that displeases you, please, do your duty as a brother and freely indicate what you think; otherwise, I will never cease to urge you. I require from you here the duty of a brother.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor from France that the king is sending a cavalry expedition into Piedmont, and that Morellus will come to Solothurn with money. How true this is, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Farewell and write back. March 18, 1546. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, bishop of the Church of Constance, his incomparable lord and brother.</p>
