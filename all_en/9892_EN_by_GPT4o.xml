      <p>While I was signing my name to the letter, behold, a maid from the inn brought your letters, in which you commend to me the envoy of Prince Cond√©. It was evening twilight.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I immediately showed your letters to the most illustrious Dr. Meyer, the treasurer of our republic, who, upon approaching Consul Ringk, promised the utmost both to your kindness and to me. Therefore, you will not doubt our, that is, all the people of Schaffhausen's willingness in this cause you are pursuing.</p>
      <p>On the morrow, when I am to deliver a sermon, if he receives me kindly, I will leave no stone unturned so that the envoy may achieve his desire.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus. February 9, 1575.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
