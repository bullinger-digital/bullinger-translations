  <input>Gratiam et pacem a domino.

Effari non potest, quantum me tua delectarit epistola, partim quod a parente profecta, partim quod paterni tui in me animi plurimam spiraret benevolentiam. Hac tantum parte durior videbatur, qua tu patribus spiritum ita tribuis, ut nihil fere reliqui facias deploratissimis nostri aevi hominibus. Sic enim intonas haud verisimile esse patres et vetustate et sanctitate celebres caruisse spiritu, quo indice etiam heccine potuissent depraehendere placita, quae nunc quasi e tripode pronuncientur. Ito ergo, si ignoras, ad ipsum Augustinum ac percontare, num antiquitas an sanctorum sanctitas graviorem reddat doctrinam!

Docebit is nimirum in epistola ad Hieronymum fere postrema istaec conferre nihil, imo id, quod ex scripturis authoritatem non habet, execrandum esse, cui et Ciprianus in epistolis subscribit. Ut nunc non referam, quod nolit sibi fidem adhiberi Augustinus, nisi scripturis sua muniat, utpote qui non uno loco errarit; testimonia sunt in praefatione 3. lib. «De trinitate», Ad Casulanum, Fortunatum et Vincentium. Igiturne patribus alligatus erit spiritussanctus et uno tempore omnibus omnia revelanda? Ergo quo torquebimus Christi verba: «Ero vobiscum usque ad consumationem seculi» [Mt 28,20]? Cur non statim ad primam promissionem orbi terrarum illuxit Christus? Iniquus sane deus, qui filios Izraelitarum ab Aegyptiaca reduxit captivitate, patres vero non reduxit. An hoc propterea factum, quod tenor divini oraculi, divinae voluntatis testimonium sic disposuerit? Cur ergo non videmus et nostram captivitatem iuxta prophetarum, Christi et apostolorum vaticinia talem esse oportere, qualem, proh dolor, conspeximus mortales omnium deploratissimi sub impiissimo Antichristi regno? Imo, cum Moses ac Paulus prophetiam omnibus relinquant liberam, quis adeo omnem pudorem abstersit, ut prophetare quemquam inhibeat? Interim probandos quoque spiritus censemus iubente Ioanne et Paulo et hic adeo certum scimus esse verbum dei lidium nostrum lapidem, ut nihil nos per deum fugere possit, est enim pedum nostrorum lucerna ac argentum septies defecatum, infallibilis et aeterna regula. Unde non est, quod verearis, ne sub larva pietatis se sceleratissimus ille hominum hostis ingerat nobisque imponat. «Unctio docebit omnia» [1 Joh 2,27], fides et charitas iudicabunt singula. Tu vide Augusti[num] «In Ioannem tracta[tus]» 16 et 18, ac Tertullianum in «Praescriptione hereticorum».

Iam quod paulo incivilius Erasmi libellum, cui tit[ulus]: «De libero arbitrio collatio», tractaverim, mirum est, quam egre feras; verum nos propterea palinodiam non canimus, quinimo ne lato quidem cedimus culmo. Est enim nedum impius, verum blasphemus etiam libellus, omnibus fere scriptis Erasmicis contrarius, ut nunc non referam quam ineptus, impotens, flaccidus, in quo praeter artifitium nemo pius nihil laudavit unquam. At in tanta contraversia [!] theologum non rhetorculum prestitisset; quid enim pietati cum epichirematis Erasmi? Quid cum infinitis sinistre tractatis locis? Parum interest inter eum, qui nihil e scripturis profert, et eum, qui profert, at ita profert, ut magis de numero quam enargia curet. Ubi vero Gordii se aliquis offert nodus, deus bone, quam misere se misellus torquet Erasmiolus, quam belle Protheum induit, quam infantiliter omnia figit et refigit! An non et ipsi Origenis ac aliorum succinentium idem epiphonima excussimus sententiam? Ergo non patrum dictis placitisque, sed collatione scripturarum locus Roma. 9 [9] rumpendus erat. Christiani sumus, scripturis pugnamus, non patrum placitis. Neque infitias eo; adducit ille locos nonnullos, sed omnes eiusdem farinae. Sophysta quispiam petitionem principii reiiceret, et nos in re tam gravi coccicem [!] audiemus? Breviter: si providentia est, liberum arbitrium non est; alias enim providentia non esset providentia. Si porro liberum arbitrium, iam non est providentia; alias enim liberum arbitrium non erit liberum arbitrium. Torqueat se hic Augustinus et Boetius, quamquam ille sua posterioribus libris retractarit, hic tamen istaec non nisi ad graecas calendas dissipabit.

Tu haec nostra boni consule, zelus enim pro lege dei in hunc fervorem me excitat. Nam dici non potest, quantum divinae naturae ac energiae detrahat impium de libero arbitrio sentimentum. Erasmum alias ut patrem patriae, eloquentiae principem, bonarum litterarum patronum, humanitatis fontem linguarumque post Reuchlinum instauratorem veneror, suspitio, adoro, at in divinis litteris sapientem mundi iudico. Ii quid de religione vera sentiant, docuit «doctor gentium» [1 Tim 2,7] et «vas electionis» [Apg 9,15] Paulus in eius epistolae frontispitio, quam dedicavit Corinthiorum ecclesie. Quid, si Erasmus ille tuus alter Demosthenes argentagina [!] non secus laboraret in patrocinio veritatis atque ille olim, cum adversus Milesiorum legatos pro Atheniensi republica dicendum erat? Nec mirum, cum per os prophetae praedixerit spiritussanctus corda sapientum excecari muneribus.</input>
  <output>Peace and grace from the Lord.

It is impossible to say how much your letter has delighted me, partly because it comes from a parent, and partly because it reveals your great benevolence towards me. That part of it was only made harder, in which you give such credit to the fathers, that you almost leave nothing to the most deplorable men of our age. For thus you are ringing it out, that it is not likely that those famous fathers for antiquity and sanctity, were void of that spirit, by which they could apprehend those opinions, which are now almost pronounced from a tripod. Go then, if you are ignorant, to Augustine himself and ask whether antiquity or sanctity of the saints renders the doctrine heavier.

He will certainly teach you, in his last epistle to Jerome, that these things have nothing to do with one another, but that even that which has no authority from the Scripture is to be execrated, to which also Cyprian subscribes in his epistles. But not to mention now, that Augustine himself would not have us believe him, except he fortified his writings with Scripture, as he hath erred more than once; there are testimonies in his preface to the third book of his treatise on the Trinity, to Casulan, Fortunate, and Vincent. Shall then the Spirit of God be bound to the Fathers, and have all things revealed to them at once? How shall we then twist Christ's words: "I am with you even unto the consummation of the world?" [Mt 28:20] Why did not Christ shine forth immediately at the first promise made to the world? It would be an unjust God, who should bring back the children of the Israelites from the Egyptian captivity, but not bring back the fathers. Was this done for this cause, that the tenor of the divine oracle, and the testimony of the divine will was so disposed? Why then do we not see our captivity to be as the prophets, Christ, and the Apostles foretold, such as, alas, we have seen miserable mortals, under the most impious reign of Antichrist? Nay, since Moses and Paul leave the prophecy free to all, who is so void of all modesty that he should forbid any man to prophesy? In the mean time, we must try the spirits, according to the commandment of John and Paul, and herein we know that the word of God is our surest stone, so that nothing can escape us by God; for it is a lantern to our feet, and silver tried seven times, an infallible and everlasting rule. Wherefore there is no cause to fear, lest under the disguise of piety, the worst of enemies should creep in upon us, and impose upon us. "The anointing shall teach you all things" [1 Jn 2:27], faith and charity shall judge of every single thing. See Augustine in his treatise on John, treatises 16 and 18, and Tertullian in his prescription against heretics.

Now as to my treating with a little incivility Erasmus's book, to which the title is "A comparison of free will," it is wonderful how much you take it to heart; yet neither do we sing a palinode, nor do we yield so much as a hair's breadth. For it is not only impious, but blasphemous also, contrary to almost all Erasmus's writings, not to mention now how weak, impotent, and languid it is, wherein, besides artifice, nobody that is pious ever applauded any thing. But in so great a controversy, a theologian, not a rhetorician, should have been set forward; for what hath piety to do with Erasmus's epigrams? What with his infinite trifling places? It is but a small matter between him who brings nothing out of the Scripture, and him who brings something out, but so as to mind rather number than illustration. But when a man offers himself to untie the Gordian knot, O good God, how miserably doth the poor Erasmian twist himself, how prettily doth he put on Proteus, how childishly doth he fasten and refasten all things! Do we not also reject the sense of Origen and the rest that follow him? Wherefore the place should not be broken up by the dictates and opinions of the Fathers, but by the comparison of the Scriptures only. We are Christians, we fight with Scripture, not with the opinions of the Fathers; nor can I deny it; he brings some places, but all of one grain. Would not a sophister reject the begging of a question, and shall we hear a cockerel in a matter so grave? In short, if there be providence, there is no free will; for else there would be no providence. And if there be free will, then there is no providence; for else there would be no free will. Let Augustine and Boethius wrangle here, though the latter hath retracted his opinions in his later books, yet in this he will disperse it to the Greek Kalends.

Consider these things of ours for the best, for the zeal for the law of God hath raised me to this fervor. For it is impossible to express how much the impious opinion of free will takes away from the divine nature and energy. I honor, revere, and adore Erasmus otherwise as the father of his country, the prince of eloquence, the patron of good literature, the fountain of humanity, and the restorer of languages after Reuchlin; but in divine literature I judge him to be the wise man of the world. What they think of true religion, the "doctor of the Gentiles" [1 Tim 2:7] and "vessel of election" [Acts 9:15] Paul hath taught in the frontispiece of his epistle, which he dedicated to the church of the Corinthians. What if Erasmus thy other Demosthenes should have been exercised in the patronage of truth, as he once was, when he had to make a defense for the Athenian republic against the ambassadors of the Milesians? Nor is it to be wondered at, since the Spirit of God had foretold by the mouth of the prophet, that the hearts of the wise should be blinded with gifts.</output>
