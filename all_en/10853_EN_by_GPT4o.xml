    <p xml:id="regest1">[The Zurich theologians] have recognized before the council the Confessio Tetrapolitana as being in agreement with [the First Helvetic Confession]; a letter sent to Aarau yesterday [No. 813] contains more on this. Bullinger advocates for the exiled people of Solothurn, but his influence is limited. About a madman.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>The Confession of the Four Cities is not very much against us, nor do we find anything in it that displeases us. Therefore, we have accepted it as not being against ours and have openly testified to this before the council. However, we have written more about this matter to Aarau.</p>
      <p>Believe me, the cause of the exiles from Solothurn is as dear to me as it can be. I will leave no stone unturned, but what I can achieve, the Lord knows. Certainly, many of our people do not please me and do not heed my advice.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>On the first of May in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>There was madness here today. Suggestor. Let them all be hanged. Thus Utinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Oswald Myconius, dearest brother.</p>
