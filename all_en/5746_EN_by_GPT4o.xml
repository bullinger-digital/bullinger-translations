      <p>S. Your esteemed lordship, my dear godfather, your Joshua has delivered your letter to me, to whom I would have gladly provided whatever assistance I could. He will tell you himself what he has accomplished. The letters you wrote to Calvin, I sent on the same day I received them, through the Geneva courier who happened to be here at that time. As for Brentius, let him write or send whatever he wishes; however, I do not believe that his doctrine will be accepted by the French; it is indeed absurd, so much so that even the papists cannot accept it. I hope the Landgrave is more upright than to allow himself to be led away from the truth, and may the Lord open the eyes of the Duke of Württemberg through him, so that he may recognize the truth! We hear that the superintendents of Hesse are about to hold a convention in Marburg; however, we do not know for what purpose or what they are planning. Without a doubt, this matter will also be discussed. Hyperius seems likely to accept a calling, if only one comes his way; there is not yet the same purity there as in Heidelberg. Regarding our affairs in Savoy, I see from your envoy that you have understood their situation; I have written more extensively about these matters to my brother. Many seem to have great hope for peace, and most think that the Duke will accept the conditions proposed by the Swiss. I do not know what our people will do. Many lean towards peace; however, these conditions, unless they are better explained and more rightly established, I cannot see how they can or should be accepted. The first and foremost issue is religion; I would like it to be expressed not only that it should be free, but that those who are to be restored retain the reformation they now have, and that security for the ministers is also provided in all respects, and that the condition is added that our people are obliged to protect and defend them (if anyone should do them harm). For if things are simply arranged so that religion is free, it seems to me to be a deception and nothing but a trick, so that they want to lead our people astray and blind them, so that they bring them to restore the part promised to the Duke. The second issue is that the matter with Geneva is not yet completely resolved or concluded; for the Duke's legitimate claim to the city of Geneva is reserved, so that he must first seek justice, whether they have the power and authority to make a citizenship agreement with my lords. This must also be arranged beforehand, so that the citizenship agreement remains in force; for if not, the citizenship agreement will be nullified and the people of Geneva will be completely oppressed. It also follows that if they themselves did not have the power to make an alliance with us, then the cause of our war was unjust; if unjust, then it will be justly returned to the Duke, what was taken from him. It seems to me that much depends on this middle ground. Thirdly, one should also provide security for the poor people who are to be returned immediately, also concerning our matters, so that they are not oppressed and harassed as he deals with his other subjects. Otherwise, I do not care if we have less land. I hope, however, that these points will be of such weight that, unless they are better explained, our people will not accept the proposed conditions. I wish to hear your advice on these matters and ask you to share it with me. As for the people of Basel, I do not know how one could oppose them. This spirit is very slippery and constantly eludes. Moreover, they have many supporters, and the magistrates do not seriously care about such matters. Therefore, we must be vigilant, wherever an opportunity presents itself, to apprehend them, and we must pray to the Lord to offer it and to free our churches from this plague. Not very favorable news comes from France. They say that at Orléans, the papists and evangelicals clashed again, as the papists were reintroducing the mass and priests and behaving more insolently. They also say that many on both sides were lost, but that our people nevertheless won the victory. It is also said that three Swiss banners were present, many of whom were slaughtered while defending the papist side. I hear nothing about Paris and the English at the moment. Some speak ill of Condé; however, I do not know if these things are true. Admiral Coligny wanted to approach the court with an entourage, but when he was ordered to bring fewer people, he refused to come and withdrew to safer places. The people of Lyon are behaving bravely and do not want to accept the mass, priests, or any governor unless he is of their religion. They say Viret will return there shortly. Otherwise, I have nothing of importance at the moment. I am very pleased for my godfather Josias about the succession of Peter Martyr; may the Lord make him an Elisha after such an Elijah! You will greet him and your wife and the rest of his sons, sons-in-law, and daughters in my name. All of ours greet you, especially Diesbach, Haller, Steiger, Graferiet, my father-in-law, and others. Musculus will descend to Zofingen these days to visit his sons. You will think about how and when, as I have often asked now, you will come to us; if you came, perhaps a plan could be found on how to deal with the people of Basel. Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 28, 1563.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
