    <p xml:id="regest1">Veit Dietrich already responded five months ago to Erb's letter addressed to him [from November 8, 1545], but this response only arrived on May 8. It was enclosed with a letter from Dietrich to [Johannes] Ulstetter (Ulstetter had received a position in Nuremberg thanks to Dietrich, but the people of Riquewihr recently called him back). In the present letter, Erb includes Dietrich's letter, which was quite damaged during transmission, along with a shortened copy of his own letter to Dietrich [from November 8].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- In his response, Dietrich vehemently defended his use of the word "Schwärmer" (fanatic). However, he remained silent on the worship of Christ in the [elements] of the sacrament. Perhaps he intends to respond to this later, possibly even with a thick book! Nevertheless, in his letter to Ulstetter in April, he sent Erb friendly greetings. Bullinger should indicate whether Dietrich's writings should be answered. If so, Bullinger and [Rudolf] Gwalther should do it due to their greater experience. However, if they believe Erb should respond himself, they should at least provide him with a framework for argumentation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Erb just received a letter from Gwalther dated March 30, thanking him on behalf of the [Meyer von Knonau family] for his efforts in the education of Gerold [Meyer von Knonau the Younger]. Erb hopes that Gerold can return to [Zurich] with good results. He is obedient to his employer [Oswald Fürstenlob], and unlike [Hans] Vogler the Younger, he stays away from court life.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- It is astonishing that learned men like Justus Jonas and [Michael] Caelius reported on Luther's death in such a childish manner! The people of Strasbourg have now reprinted this report [“Doctor Martin Luther's Christian Departure and Death”], even though Count [Georg of Württemberg], who had previously received the writing from [Kaspar] Hedio, advised against it. Jonas's vain self-presentation with the mention of his doctorate greatly displeased the Count.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- He is currently staying at the Zeller Bath.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [Elector Frederick II of the] Palatinate is orienting his [Reformation of the Electoral Palatinate] on the example of Nuremberg, so contrary to Erb's recently submitted report [in No. 2441], he has not completely abolished the mass.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Money is again being collected for the war against the Turks, but some imperial cities refuse to contribute because they fear it might be used against them. Recently, five hundred Spaniards crossed the Rhine. They are on their way to Hungary to defend Vienna. In neighboring areas of Bohemia, [the Turks] are said to have plundered, killed, and taken prisoners.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings to Bullinger's family, to [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Konrad] Pellikan, and Theodor [Bibliander]. added.</p>

      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you. Theodor Vitus responded to me almost five months ago, before he went to the Regensburg colloquy, through someone else's letter. He wrote to Ulstetter, for whom he had obtained a benefice among his Noric people, whom we recently recalled and now support with a more generous stipend. The letter was returned to me half-torn, as you see, on the 8th of May, before it reached Ulstetter's hands. I am sending this to you along with a copy of the letter I wrote to him, although it is perhaps shorter and more restrained, so that you may understand how appropriately he responded.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>He defended the term "Schwärmer" (fanatic) quite vigorously, but made no mention of the adoration of Christ under the sacrament, perhaps postponing it to a more opportune time or planning to respond to me with a large book. Recently, in April, he wrote to Ulstetter and at the end of the letter, he greeted me honorably. Please let me know whether a response should be made to him or if his writings should be passed over in silence. I entrust this matter to you and Gwalther, who are endowed with great gifts. For I am a small muscle compared to this elephant, although I wish to defend the glory of God and the truth of Jesus Christ. However, we cannot all do everything, nor does everyone have the opportunity to sail to Corinth. I wrote to him, as you see in the copy, but how wisely, the Lord knows, etc. If you decide that I should respond, let it be done, but on the condition that you, who are more experienced, prescribe some arguments. For I would not seek my own glory (even if I adorned myself with borrowed feathers), but would defend the glory of Him to whom all honor is due. For the glory of this world is fragile, fleeting, indeed superficial, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>While I write this, a letter from the most pious man Gwalther, written on the 30th of March, is delivered to me, in which he expresses his eternal gratitude for the admonition on behalf of the relatives. I will certainly do my utmost to ensure that Gerold, if he listens to my good advice, returns to you more learned and with a good character. He is obedient to his master, possesses good morals, is devoted to religion, and there is no fear that he will be corrupted by the courtly manners he himself abhors. For he is focused on his duties and has no dealings with them, just as the younger Vogler did, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We are also astonished that very learned men described Dr. Luther's death so childishly. Before it was printed, it was sent to our prince by Hedio, who immediately advised Hedio not to publish it. However, it was published by his people. The ambition and petulance of Justus Jonas displeased him greatly when he mentions himself: "and I, Doctor Jonas and Master Caelius." Yes, says Doctor Dreck, one would not otherwise know that he was a doctor if he did not testify to it himself, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The prince is now bathing in the Zeller baths.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Palatinate continues. Recently, as I wrote to you, they told me that the mass was completely abolished. But now I hear differently from those who are eyewitnesses. They follow the reformation and customs of the Noric people, and it is half dog, half leash. God help us for the best. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Money is again being demanded from the cities of the empire for the Turkish expedition; but some refuse to give, lest they be strangled by their own expenses. Recently, five hundred Spaniards crossed the Rhine, heading to Hungary to defend Vienna in Austria. They say that the neighboring Bohemians have been plundered, many killed, and taken as prey, etc. I hope that God will soon grant the churches of Christ in Germany peace, provided they are willing and propagate the glory of God. Amen, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell, excellent Bullinger, with your whole house, and the brothers and the church. Greet in my name the whole choir of the pious and learned, especially Gwalther, Pellican, Theodor, etc.</p>
      <p>In haste, Riquewihr, 22nd of May 1546. Yours sincerely, Erb.</p>
      <p>To the truly learned and pious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief theologian of the church of Zurich, my esteemed patron.</p>
