      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Your letter has been delivered to me.</p>
      <p>I will be brief; for I am miserably tormented by my domestic enemy, a very severe headache, which afflicts me almost every month.</p>
      <p>There is no need for you to be concerned about Bernardinus; yesterday he departed for Basel; if he is not received there, he might perhaps travel to his associates in Poland; for I do not know where else he could go.</p>
      <p>You will understand the whole matter from what I have enclosed; but please return them.</p>
      <p>He left before the set time for departure, being aware of his own wrongdoing; he feared the criticism of his book.</p>
      <p>The two dialogues on the Trinity that he wrote are most pestilent and should be utterly trampled underfoot.</p>
      <p>Do not worry about the Rhaetian wine; as much as I need it for my dear guests, Hans WÃ¤gman will provide for me in due time.</p>
      <p>Stoker has returned from Lyon and reported to me that everything in France is now peaceful; regarding the true religion, things are going very well and there is great hope; the king is also very hopeful.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the Swiss legion has been dismissed; those who remain are all returning. The authorities are selling the church properties, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>I cannot say more.</p>
      <p>Greet the consuls, Gallicius, Pontisella, and the other brothers, especially my most esteemed Martinengo; you can share the main action with Bernardinus with him; I also recently informed him of some of it. December 3, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
