      <p>Greetings. The news you write about the danger to the Genoese and the destroyed or overwhelmed forces of Hannibal is not very favorable; if the Turk has gained a port in Italy or Corsica, we will experience God's wrath upon us.</p>
      <p>But let His will be done.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we will not cease to cry out: Lord, be merciful to our sins and have mercy on us. The Bernese accepted the mediation on July 18th in Neuchâtel with great contention and sent their response to Chambéry on July 25th. On the same day, a messenger arrived from the Duke, announcing that Lord de la Croix was on the road, bringing the response. Thus, he arrived, and they intended to hear him on July 31st.</p>
      <p>This was written to me from Bern on July 30th, and that the Bernese (perhaps) will be further urged to renew the old alliance with the Duke, therefore they might still hesitate a bit.</p>
      <p>May God grant that it ends well.</p>
      <p>I have now received a letter from Tübingen; they are now dealing with the ubiquity, which they are trying to instill in the people.</p>
      <p>They say it is ineffable, yet they do not stop talking about it; they do not understand what they say, and they cannot express what they feel, yet they want to speak. Misery.</p>
      <p>I have just received a letter from Heidelberg, dated July 29th. The prince is upright and honest; the study progresses.</p>
      <p>However, the plague is starting again.</p>
      <p>May God have mercy on them and on us; for they are diligently spreading everywhere. The way is to life.</p>
      <p>Beza complains bitterly that the Bernese are placing themselves in the midst of the enemies; Bern believes they have made an honest, fair peace for them, etc.</p>
      <p>I write this hastily now.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well together with all the pious.</p>
      <p>From France, nothing except what I recently reported. All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 4, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
