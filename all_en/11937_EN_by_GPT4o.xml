    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter from March 16 on April 9, along with two copies of his writing against Cochl채us for [Peter] Fuchs and himself; he will investigate the third copy, which may have been sent directly from Bern to Geneva; Fuchs will write to Bullinger himself; they do not possess [Bullinger's] book "De scripturae sanctae authoritate." The war rumors are uncertain; after consultation with the bailiffs, the Bernese refuse passage to the mercenaries [heading to France] and threaten subjects who go to war with the death penalty; the public survey held on this and the passage prohibition displeases the [Inner Swiss] cantons, who might force their way through; the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] has probably already united his troops with those of the French [King Francis I], while Emperor [Charles V] is supposed to bring in an English army; Duke [Ulrich] of W체rttemberg is marrying his son [Christoph] [to Anna Maria of Brandenburg-Ansbach]; further news is probably already known to Bullinger. Celio Secondo [Curione] attacks Luther, Bucer, and Melanchthon in his newly revised Pasquill; Frey is curious about Bucer's reaction; Calvin writes [in his "Supplex exhortatio"] to Emperor [Charles V] about the sacrament in a manner as unclear as Bucer, but otherwise quite skillfully. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>The letter you sent me on March 16, most esteemed father, I finally received on April 9, along with two, not more, copies of Cochl채us's writings, one of which you sent as a gift to Lord Fuchs and the other to me. I believe the third copy you mentioned is either lost or was sent directly from Bern to Geneva. I will diligently inquire about what happened to it. Fuchs himself will surely write to you. I certainly thank you greatly for your gift, which I deeply appreciate, and I would reciprocate if I could. We do not have the book "De scripturae sanctae authoritate."</p>
      <p>Regarding the war rumors, I would say various things if everything were certain. The Bernese have certainly denied passage to the royal bandits, more accurately than soldiers, after consulting with all their bailiffs on this matter. A capital punishment has been declared for their subjects who will henceforth go into military service. They then sent messengers to all their communities and had them informed. Both actions displease the Inner Swiss cantons; therefore, as I hear, they are preparing to force their way through the Bernese territory. I fear what will happen. We are all convinced that the Turk has long since arrived and joined forces with the French. The Emperor is also said to be leading an English army against us. Meanwhile, the Duke of W체rttemberg is proceeding with the marriage of his son with great pomp. Whether he is doing this to disguise something else, I do not know. The matter is in the Lord's hands; I pray that He may aid the most afflicted affairs of the church. The rest, which you wish to know, I believe has been made clear from the letters recently sent to you.</p>
      <p>Celio Secondo has recently published a pasquinade, which at first glance seems to be the one you read long ago, but it surpasses the former in many respects. He specifically attacks Luther, Bucer, and Melanchthon for appearing to abandon the cause they had taken up. I am amazed at the man's remarkable freedom, and I wonder what Master Bucer will say about it, that one of these bad jests comes from his Bernese. Meanwhile, Calvin writes to the Emperor about the sacrament in a manner as ambiguous as Bucer speaks, but otherwise, as far as I have read, quite skillfully and elegantly.</p>
      <p>Those whom you instructed to greet you send their regards. Greet in my name those whom you know to be most dear to me. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Biel/Bienne, April 10, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed father. In Zurich.</p>
