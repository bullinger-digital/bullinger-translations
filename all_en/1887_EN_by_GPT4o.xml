      <p>Greetings. I have read your letter, my dear brother, and from my affection towards my daughters, I can easily judge your feelings, how you bear that abduction, I almost said. I also know and acknowledge that you bear certain things not only as a father but also as a pastor with more indignation. But what can you do in this matter? Will you add evil to evil and add sorrow to sorrow? The greatest happiness is to stumble nowhere, the next is, if you have stumbled, to heal the wound received promptly and with as little pain as possible, as far as it can be done. You should not be anxious about the lost first happiness; for in vain do we weary our minds over things lost and never to be recovered. If you do not think diligently about obtaining and preserving the latter happiness, I fear you will suffer a more serious loss.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it seems to me: first, consider that the deed itself is not to be condemned; for marriage is sacred.</p>
      <p>The manner in which it was joined is illegitimate, where there is sin, and indeed the son-in-law sinned, you did not sin. But see that you do not sin if you continue to be irreconcilable.</p>
      <p>Then consider what benefit either you or your daughter will gain if you continue to be irreconcilable. You are troublesome to yourself, exacerbating and doubling the pain and wound; the daughter will be more ungrateful to her husband or, to speak more purely, more ungrateful. "But in this way," you say, "I will be avenged." But see, my brother, whether you ought to seek that revenge, which at the same time diminishes the conjugal love so commanded and thus also disturbs the divine order? Finally, you will have to return to grace or endure being counted in that foul Roman catalog, which exists in Romans 1, where the irreconcilable are mentioned. However, acknowledge frankly that not every injury is to be forgiven immediately, especially if you incur the charge of levity from it. There is, however, a measure in things, there are certain limits, beyond which right cannot stand. You recognize the pagan sentiment, but advising and pronouncing as a Christian. Therefore, I would bear the injury inflicted moderately, say nothing more serious, not use curses and devotions: If ever I receive them back into grace, may great Jupiter destroy me, or something similar. Meanwhile, if after some time they should ask to be received back into grace, I would not entirely refuse them, but with some condition, I would say more kindly: "If I see you sincerely acknowledging the error committed in a good matter and grieving over the clear injury inflicted on me, I will acknowledge you as mine. But even after some time, again asking for pardon, I would receive them and instruct them paternally, henceforth not even with a single word would I cause them any trouble. You have in that your case my serious advice, not undeservedly.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that you do what is best. Furthermore, you mention a new and hitherto unheard matter, recounting the Campodunum vocation. I fear you have admitted emotion into your counsel; for since that injury was inflicted on you there, you prepare to leave as if to avenge yourself. But it is common that nothing should be believed by a grieving mind; it is also common: Do not act overcome by a disturbed mind, which you may later regret and which you cannot accomplish without your greatest inconvenience. And indeed you will not be able to return to Swabia without great expenses; scarcely will you have settled there, you will be forced to pack your bags. I am very surprised you have come to the point of deciding to return there, where you previously saw how good men are treated. But not to mention bodily inconveniences, do you think, my dear brother Gervasius, that the people of Campodunum will not adhere to the Augsburg Confession?</p>
      <p>They will adhere, and indeed stubbornly, for if they do not do this, they will be deserted equally by all other orders or at least they will fear being deserted themselves. Now you know that in its Apology the bodily presence in the supper is established, and indeed such as the Roman church holds. I do not mention how sharp the Lutherans are now and how they are tumultuous everywhere in the matter of the supper. If you had recently heard the best men from Swabia brought here, how insolent the Lutheran teachers are, you would certainly prefer to dwell here in a humble house than there in a royal court. I could recount many other things to you here; but let this be the end of my prattling. I wish you a prudent mind and that you and yours may be well. All of ours greet you and yours. ZÃ¼rich, June 3, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
