      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>I am truly glad that the day has dawned for me to once again come into acquaintance with you. I would say that I deserve sharp criticism if it were my fault that this acquaintance, almost a whole decade interrupted, has fallen into oblivion. After I left Zurich, I was tossed about miserably for several years here and there throughout Germany, because I was unwilling to accept any position unless it was worthy of my conscience. Therefore, while awaiting better fortune, I lived partly in academies to attain the highest degree in the arts from my own resources, and partly from typographic work.</p>
      <p>Finally, I came to Augsburg, but I do not know by what fate this happened to me, unless I might conjecture that it shone upon me [or fled from me?], just as a similar fate once led me to Zurich to you to imbibe the life-giving doctrine of Christ, now it has also led me to Augsburg to obtain a livelihood. Although I have not decided to stay here, because I do not have a certain position nor do I hope to have one. For our theologians (I meant to say theologians) admit no one unless he is of their party.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, by divine grace, I have made friends here, by whose advice and help I can emerge elsewhere if I am expelled from here. May God grant those furious and rabid Saxons a better mind. Amen.</p>
      <p>Four years ago, I wrote these and similar things to Master Raphael Seyler, now a doctor of law, the son of Gerion, a doctor of medicine, who was going to France to Master Rodolphus Gwalther, at the same time expressing my eternal gratitude for the many benefits bestowed upon me by him and others. When he did not respond to me, I thought to myself that he was not only burdened with more serious matters but also had no time left to respond to all kinds of people from various nations, who surpass me in nobility, virtue, learning, and other dignities, so much so that I would not consider myself worthy of their shadow, and therefore he rightly disregarded my unpolished and utterly crude letters, not to mention my humanity. To avoid the same happening to me with other learned men, I had resolved to crawl on the ground with those like myself. However, you must affirm this about me: I have always and will forever hold a grateful heart towards all the Swiss, whose genuine candor and pious establishment of the church and republic I have always praised and adorned among all with whom I have lived. But the fact that you voluntarily judge me worthy of your letters has left me almost in a stupor, so that I do not know with what reverence I should kiss them. The shortness of time and reverence towards you do not allow me to be more lengthy; for at almost the same hour that your son Christophorus delivered your letters to me, he requested them back.</p>
      <p>I am eagerly expecting your other son, N., who is in Vienna, every hour; if he comes, I will communicate with him what I wish to be conveyed to you from me. Your other son, Christophorus, is adorned with such manners and virtues as a noble young man ought to have. I could hardly persuade, indeed compel him to visit me at my home even once; such is his modesty; but once he crossed the threshold, he was so pleased with me that now he voluntarily comes whenever leisure permits. I will make sure that this is not unhelpful to him and not ungrateful to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell most excellently in Christ, who wishes to preserve you for the salvation of his church for a long time. Given at Augsburg from the house of Haugian on the 25th of November in the year of salvation 1557.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Engelbert Milander Hadamarius. To the reverend man, excellent in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the city of Zurich, his most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
