      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, I sincerely wish to your kindness, etc. I know, most learned and pious man, that many are deterred from writing, either because they are unknown to those to whom they write or because they are not connected by any duties. However, I judge that there is a very great reason for all faithful brothers in Christ to write to each other, even if no other reasons intervene, because they are so united in Christ that they are the body of one head, and among themselves, members, each in their own place, yet all embedded in the body. Since we, in the lands of the Ruthenians, almost judged by all to be barbaric and more suited to military than religious matters, have obtained by divine grace that even among us the visible face of the church exists, and since we have agreed with your Swiss church in the same doctrine, profession of faith, and rites, I could not be deterred from sending my letters to you, the ornament of the church, and testifying my faith and that of a large part of Russia to your kindness, and for that connection which we have with you and other members of Christ, I implore your help and advice. There is no need to teach that the greatest strength and support of the church is in a well-established school, so that if anyone imagines the church to exist without a school, it would be as if they thought a man could live without a soul. There is already a not insignificant assembly of learners among us; but we lack teachers who would teach both the liberal arts soberly and profess the sacred languages and theology purely. When writing this, I wish it to be understood that we do not care for Platos and Aristotles, but for those who would impart sincere philosophy to our people according to their not sharp wits, and who know how to rightly divide the word of truth. We will be content with these moderate means, and I have heard that there is an abundance of them among you, partly domestic and partly exiles. Therefore, for the sake of Christian piety and connection, you will give this effort to our church, to send us one or two men who will lead the school and teach sacred letters in it. We have entrusted the task of bringing these men to us to our faithful brother in Christ and well-deserving of our church, Sebastian Pechius, a bookseller of Lesser Poland, who carries these my letters to your kindness, whom I ask again and again in the name of our church to be willing to assist with help and advice in this ecclesiastical matter. Indeed, our church wishes to owe you, if only because you can judge better than others about learned teachers and sincere professors, and therefore, because it is your study of the church, you may be more willing to share with us. May your kindness fare well and feel good success in governing the church.</p>
      <p>Given in Bychow on June 21, in the year of our Lord 1560. Your most devoted brother in Christ, Stanislaus Wardesius, superintendent of the Reformed Churches of Russia, minister of Bychow, in the name of other elders and brothers.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, outstanding in learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, always most observant lord and brother in Christ Jesus.</p>
