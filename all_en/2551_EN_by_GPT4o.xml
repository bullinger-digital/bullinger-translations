      <p>Greetings. I am very grateful to you, my dear Bullinger, for the history you wrote to me about the brothers from Locarno, from whose equanimity and constancy all the pious rightly derive pleasure, and it is fitting to celebrate the holy name of the Lord, who has worked these things in His own and will mercifully govern them further and avenge the groans of the innocent, whose tears He collects in a bottle. We are acting both privately and publicly so that the magnitude of the offense is understood and that those who either by dissimulation or consent betray the cause of the saints, which is Christ's, know that they are not free from guilt, if they act more ardently in the future, since what has been done once cannot be undone. Ferdinand has entered Augsburg with full authority to act, which the Emperor has now conferred upon him, as he himself cannot attend the diet, and I do not expect more favorable outcomes from him than from his brother, since recently the most learned and innocent man, Mr. Brusch, the poet, was beheaded in Innsbruck for professing the gospel, with the king, of course, consenting and perhaps even ordering it. Thus, tyrants remain similar to themselves once they have stained their hands with the blood of martyrs. I wish well and predict good for the Grisons for receiving the most pious exiles of Christ, surely to receive abundant blessing for this act of piety, and they have indeed immediately experienced the sign of God's effective grace from the diet, where these matters concerning the exiles were discussed, when they were freed from a hypocritical prince by the hand of the Lord, who was removed when he was leading a Roman inquisitor monk by the bishop's order, which you surely knew long ago. But farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours. I will immediately ensure that what you sent in Calvin's name is delivered to the brothers in MÃ¼lhausen, from whom we have received nothing. Basel, February 12, in the year 55.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
