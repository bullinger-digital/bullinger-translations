      <p>Greetings. I have previously sent you long letters, but now they are shorter, and even more so because you write that you are in less than firm health.</p>
      <p>I will omit the civil and almost courtly manner of giving thanks because you are sick or certainly in poor health and yet you wrote to me. In very few words, know this: your letters were most welcome to me (most kind and esteemed) not only because you seem to agree with me fully, but also because of the described beginnings, progress, and order now observed among you, all of which I was exceedingly eager to know. Regarding your Schmutz with the Duke, my lord, I have dealt with him, who promises to be very benevolent for your sake and to contribute to him as he did before to Johann von Ulm. It will be necessary for you to remind his lordship of this sometime, because I am shortly departing and moving out of his residence, having been summoned by the royal majesty to undertake a certain office in the republic, although not so ample for private convenience and profit, yet in which I resolve to promote the gospel (to the best of my ability). I say this so that when you write about Alexander Schmutz, you do not write to the Duke as if I were present, but as if I were absent, because that is my intention. Although I cannot entirely separate from his lordship, and always; yet for the most part, it will be when I can first settle the debt contracted and to be contracted for the payment of the first year's fruits. But it has seemed good to God to bring it about that his lordship embraces me in such a way, and I in turn observe and love the same lordship, so that I cannot separate myself, without visiting sometimes. However, you yourself can write more fully about Schmutz or someone similar, whom you wish to commend to his lordship, because you think I am not present. And there is no doubt that his excellence (because he is especially humane to those like you) will take it in good part. I commend your health and your whole self to God. I would gladly encourage you to take care of it as you can and know you ought to. Please greet Mr. Bibliander in my name very warmly. May God be with you by His spirit, and with your ministry.</p>
      <p>Yours devotedly, James Haddon.</p>
