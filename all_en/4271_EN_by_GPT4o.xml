      <p>Greetings. I explained to the reverend man and our dearest brother, Mr. Calvin, why I have delayed my response for so long.</p>
      <p>But I beg you, esteemed lord and dearest brother in Christ, not to take it badly that I have not sent you any letters until now. In the meantime, nothing has diminished in my zeal and love for you.</p>
      <p>You explain copiously and elegantly in your letters what you did in Heidelberg and what a certain pious man discussed with you about the matter of concord, at whose instigation you wrote a treatise on the sacramental matter, which you are sending to me.</p>
      <p>For that communication and for the treatise, I give you the greatest thanks. I have not returned nor am I returning the treatise; for I believe you have another copy; certainly, you leave it with me not without gratitude. The elegant and clear order of that treatise pleases me; you seem to explain the proposed questions learnedly and piously. However, what you write from the beginning about our union with Christ, about the incomprehensible manner and substantial presence, I fear, if we grant them in this way, may give rise to new conflicts; I also fear that the interpretations you offer will not be accepted by our antagonists. For I believe you have sensed that our adversaries are so rigid that we can expect nothing fair from them. They will simply demand from us that we approve and accept their opinion and condemn Zwinglianism, etc., which we neither want nor can do.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>April 28, 1560.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
