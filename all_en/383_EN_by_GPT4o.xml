      <p>Grace be with you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, learned sir and dear brother Master Heinrich Bullinger. Last year I received a letter from you, which my son Jonas brought to me, and although this letter shows your good will towards me and my son, it shows much more richly towards my son himself. Indeed, I cannot say enough how much good you have offered and shown him, and would have done even more if he had sought and desired it from you, for which I thank you most highly. And if it were possible for me, according to my small ability, I would earnestly strive to deserve it; but since it cannot be, may He who gives you grace and ability repay you, so that you may serve me and others, indeed the whole church of Christ, faithfully with teaching, life, and writing. I also always bear a special love for you because of the gifts with which you are endowed by God, which the faithful servant of the church in Bern, Master Berchtold Haller of blessed memory, well knew, who loved you especially as you did him, writing much to him, and he did not let any letter pass without giving it to me to read, also some which he showed to no other person, such as an opened one from C. M., in which there was a note, an expostulation after the Kappel War, etc. He gave me your little book and manuscript "De formatione studii" to copy, and on his deathbed he gave me the "exceptas annotationes in lectione Bibliandri in all prophets," a great treasure which I still use daily, which you had left with him and paid much for. I mention this so that you may recognize his love for me as for his son and be willing to let me and my son be recommended for his sake.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear sir and brother, I ask you for a great service, which is also the reason for this my writing; otherwise, I would have left you (who undoubtedly have much more necessary things to do in this dangerous, adverse time) untroubled with my chatter. Namely, as my son was in Zurich, he saw a daughter there whom he desires to take as a wife, which is exceedingly against my wishes, because I do not know who she is, and he, however (praise be to God), could well be provided for by honorable, well-to-do people. But whatever I undertake or break off with him is all in vain. I do not like to force him to take one who is against him. Therefore, I ask you most earnestly, after you have understood from him who she is, if it seems to you that it is not suitable and fitting for him, that you dissuade him from her, for he must follow you or lose my favor. But if you might think that he would be well provided for with her (for you know best what kind of person is suitable for a preacher), if it seems appropriate to you, please speak a good word for him. I am also not at all concerned that she has much wealth, but that she belongs to honorable people, of good reputation and name, and of honorable conduct. Whatever else may be necessary, the Lord will also provide. As for my person, it is not possible for me to be with him, for many reasons. But whatever you, my dear sir and brother, would command and make the son do, will also be well done by me, etc. I have had to trouble you so much, I ask you to forgive me. May God the Lord grant you His grace and spirit, that you may continue to serve His church faithfully as you have done so far, which the devil earnestly desires to destroy.</p>
      <p>May the Lord break his plans, convert us to Him, that we may not be Christians in name only, but also in deed, so that He may withdraw His angry hand, which He has stretched out to punish us, and graciously preserve us by His word and light. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given at Belp in the Bernese territory at the village on the last day of December in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Christian Danmatter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man, outstanding in learning and virtue, Master Heinrich Bullinger, teaching the gospel of Christ in the church of God in the city of Zurich, his dearest friend and brother.</p>
