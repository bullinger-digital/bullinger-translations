    <p xml:id="regest1">From Pastor Thomas Gaßner in Lindau, who read the farewell from the last day of the Swabian League in Augsburg at the city clerk Anton Schmölz's, he learned that the League - despite the vigorous efforts of the Augsburg Bishop and imperial commissioner Christoph von Stadion - failed on the Württemberg question and has dissolved. Count Palatine Ottheinrich then plundered the wealthy Kaisheim Monastery near Donauwörth. It is feared that this will happen to other monasteries as well. Greetings. Words of comfort for the sick Kaspar Nasal.</p>

      <p>In haste, dear lord and brother. No special news, only that Thoman, the preacher from Lindau, writes to me about the opinion, etc., how your city clerk in Lindau sent the last farewell of the Swabian League to Augsburg on Shrove Tuesday, which he read. The league is dissolved by the grace of God, and the Bishop of Augsburg, both royal and imperial commissioner, has made a commendable effort to keep them in the league for a little while longer, during which he would bring all their grievances and excuses before the emperor. But it was refused. He then requested the estates, according to an article of the previous league, to come back to Augsburg on May 25 to negotiate with him. They have also delayed very little. Then he protested highly in the name of the Roman royal majesty, that his royal majesty is not to blame, neither in the dealings with Duke Christoph of Württemberg, that it has failed, etc., for he wanted to do more than he was obliged to. Also, he did not neglect anything in the execution of the league that could have served peace. In this, he wants to be justified and without blame, should unrest and disorder arise in the Roman Empire, etc. Now, from the moment the league ended, Duke Ottheinrich, Count Palatine, fell upon the imperial monastery called Kaisheim, near Donauwörth, took it and plundered it. The abbot barely escaped to Donauwörth. The wise believe that many more monasteries will go the same way.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household for me. May the Lord comfort you, etc., Leon, Karlstadt, and all preachers along with dear brothers.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, --- [day after] Shrove Tuesday in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>[Master] Nasal, I understand, is somewhat ill. [I ask] you to visit him for me, lamenting, as my loyalty.</p>
      <p>Y[our] w[illing] Hans Vogler, now in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>To my especially dear lord and friend, M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city parish in Zurich, to his hands.</p>
