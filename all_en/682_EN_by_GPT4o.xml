      <p>In the year 49, on the 21st of September, in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Most distinguished Mr. Bullinger, I have received your two letters, one of which I sent to England, and I also delivered yours to Florian; however, he left without greeting me, which many regret; if he comes to us, I will remind him in your name. We are saddened that others have entered into an alliance with the French. Our most reverend one perseveres in that constancy; we pray to God that he may persevere until the end. I would ask your lordship to write to him and that by God's grace he may remain in the opinion he holds. Mr. Caesarius sends his greetings to you, sir. I request your assistance with the English Bible. Greet all the pious men. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Your obedient Johann Birckmann wrote.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed lord. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
