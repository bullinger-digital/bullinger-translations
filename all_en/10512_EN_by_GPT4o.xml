    <p xml:id="regest1">The confession of the Zurichers was carefully examined by the pastors of the city and countryside of Bern. They also desire unity, but on the other hand, they do not want to give up the already clearly expressed and known truth. If the external signs and the content of the Lord's Supper are mixed and something is attributed to the external eating and drinking that belongs to the inner enjoyment of the Lord's Supper, it leads the common people astray and gives Catholics and Lutherans cause for triumph and ridicule. The Lutherans are hardly as Bucer believes. Why should one be pressured into a new confession? The Zurichers claim that their doctrine has not changed, but that is not the case: Zwingli abhorred ambiguities. You surely remember what Zwingli or the Zurich Council wrote about the concord negotiations during the Diet of Augsburg [1530]. Why does Bullinger deviate from his view of the Lord's Supper expressed in the commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians? Haller has always relied on Bullinger's and Bucer's opinion; however, he does not know Bucer's last letter to the Zurichers. In Kassel, Bucer will negotiate with Melanchthon. The Bernese must apparently be the last to make the true confession and take the anathema upon themselves if the Zurichers and Baselers agree with the others. To truly be considered Zwingli's successor, Bullinger must consider that one must not deviate from the recognized truth, otherwise new disputes will harm the church more than the dispute with the Lutherans. Haller writes without the knowledge of the Bern Council and asks for confidentiality. If the Zurichers wanted to revise this confession - which it would also need due to internal contradictions - this should be done openly and in a timely manner. Their personal friendship should not change. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocent life from God our Father.</p>
      <p>We have carefully examined your confession along with the explanation, which is quite learned, according to the limits of our judgment, together with our brothers from the Bernese countryside. The desire for unity presses us more than I can easily write, to which our brother Bucer has devoted labor and expenses to achieve, on one hand, and on the other hand, the truth itself, so clear and open, so happily proclaimed and confessed by all of you, especially the leaders, to the entire world. No one, except those who have no regard for the churches or posterity, will try to persuade us to confess the truth more obscurely. If we confuse the internal eating of the body and blood with the external eating of the symbols and thus attribute to the external eating what belongs to the internal, and vice versa, how many errors do we involve the simple common people in, how many opportunities do we provide for the papists and Lutherans, the malevolent ones I mean, who have nothing but "sacramentarians" and "enthusiasts" on their lips, to rant, tear apart, and slander! Simplicity is not pious everywhere. As they perceive the utmost simplicity in Bucer's plan, they will more easily impose on both him and us. This is what I suspect not without reason, especially since we have never seen any letters from any Lutheran so far, in which even one would declare himself to be such towards us as Bucer persuades himself all of them to be. Therefore, I do not see by what reason we are urged to confessions. Scripture certainly has a sacramental allegory in many places. Among the fathers, nothing is more frequent. But while we consider our times, our dangers, as you have considered us to be far more perceptive in many things so far, there is a need for such circumspection that we speak and say and confess everything, not indeed what we could also say with truth to pious interpreters, but what serves the edification of the churches. You write - let it remain buried with you, since there is nothing that I have not safely entrusted to you so far - that you have so far maintained this manner of speaking and teaching in your churches. However, I would hardly think this was done in Zwingli's times, who abhorred nothing more than verbal ambiguities, as all his writings testify and our Leo does not ignore. Indeed, for the same concord to be restored, Bucer was working with Philipp at the Diet of Augsburg, and Capito, Oecolampadius, Zwingli, and Megander had gathered in Zurich for that reason. Then, on the same occasion in Basel, Bucer, Oecolampadius, Megander, and, if I am not mistaken, Leo himself had gathered and were considering the Saxon confession, as well as that of the four cities, Strasbourg, Constance, etc., it is not unknown to you what your senate wrote there through Zwingli. We have a copy of all these. I return to you, dearest Heinrich. How piously, learnedly, clearly, and happily you explained the whole matter in 1 Corinthians. Why do you depart from all these? Certainly, I have never been tempted more by friends than by Bucer and you. If I were ever to do anything for the favor of any mortal, it would be for you, for whom I would even expend my spirit. Last year Bucer discussed many things with us in the synod about this matter together with Bartholomew of Venice, yet he distinguished everything in such a way and attributed to both symbols and things their own, that they were received with great applause by many. What he has now written to you, I do not know. At this hour I receive from Capito that Bucer will meet Philipp of Hesse in Kassel. If this is the case, I see that we will be the last and alone, who, although unlearned, must confess the truth and solidly with the anathema of our name, since you and the Baselers agree with all the others.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dearest Heinrich, consider your plans in such a way that we do not depart from the open truth and our publicly confessed disputation, lest a contention of words also arise among us and, having arisen, bring greater scandal to the church than the Lutheran one, lest also the truth and posterity be exposed to the extreme ridicule of the whole world, I do not mention the slanders and injuries that the papists with the Lutherans would pour out on us, and have the whole matter so commended to you that you may be considered the true successor of Zwingli. Furthermore, what we have written to you, let it remain buried with you in the same faith with which we have sent these things to you at your request. For whatever we have done so far, we have done without the knowledge of our senate, since it did not seem worth the effort, as we have not subscribed to you in all things. Therefore, do not neglect us in this matter. I would like it to be understood, not to be believed by either the Lutherans or the printers. But if you yourselves wish to declare otherwise or make your confession clearer, since the explanation seems to be at odds both with the confession and with itself, do this freely and in time, lest we be forced to do anything secretly either from the senate or from the colleagues. This is what we are least likely to do. You have everything that occurred to be written now.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Consider everything well. May the unblemished, constant, and perpetual friendship always remain between us. I wish all the colleagues well, especially Pellican and Leo, who are more dear to me than the others.</p>
      <p>November 17, 1534.</p>
      <p>Yours, as little as I am, Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, his always dearest brother.</p>
