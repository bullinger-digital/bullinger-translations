      <p>Greetings. There is absolutely nothing (reverend father in Christ) that I can write, and yet I send these empty words, so that I do not send the honorable consul to you without my message.</p>
      <p>You have here certain men, through whom, if you wish to write anything to Bern, Geneva, or Lyon, you can do so most conveniently and correctly. Accompanying the honorable consul, along with the distinguished Pellizari family, is the illustrious man, Mr. Guiziardus, who once provided hospitality to Mr. Gesner and me in Telii; therefore, Mr. Gesner seems to be reminded of his arrival.</p>
      <p>You will hear from the consul about the state of our affairs. I have not yet received any of your letters because our merchants return to Zürich through Feldkirch (where there is a market); we believe this is the cause of the delay.</p>
      <p>The envoy of Mr. de Bellievre recently wrote that there is great hope that the Glarus matter will be resolved.</p>
      <p>Would that it may happen sometime! But the ferocity of those people is great, and I doubt whether it can be restrained, given the current manners of people.</p>
      <p>There is no need to commend the honorable consul, as he is already commended to you otherwise. If anything happens that you should know, I will not fail in my duty.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 26, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zürich.</p>
