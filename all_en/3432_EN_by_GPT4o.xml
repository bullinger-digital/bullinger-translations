      <p>Greetings and blessings. Reverend man and dearest brother. I am sending this letter with this Englishman, who came to me in Thurgau, as we were returning to the Elbe. I wrote it to inform you that the longer letter, which I hear you gave to the physician from Jülich, was not delivered to me. I know that many are plotting against our letters and that they are being spread, whether true or fabricated, in the name of Calvin, yours, and mine. Therefore, I would like you, if you are going to send anything, to entrust it to known men whose trustworthiness you have proven. I see that I am returning to great dangers. But after the death of my wife, it is necessary for me to settle some domestic affairs. I commend myself and the church to God. Farewell. On the day of Bruma. In Thurgau.</p>
      <p>Philipp.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man, distinguished in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother. In Zürich.</p>
