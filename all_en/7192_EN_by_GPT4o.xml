      <p>Greetings through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Revered and gracious lord, my willing service is always at your disposal. I have received your letter dated June 28th well on July 12th. From it, I have learned various news, firstly that some princes have united in matters of religion, intending to instruct their preachers to refrain from all hateful writings and preachings; it would be desirable for such an agreement to hold.</p>
      <p>However, our preachers here pay little heed to this, but rather rage and storm more and more, also inciting the authorities not to tolerate or suffer the enthusiasts and sacramentarians (as they are accustomed to call them). Therefore, a council here, along with some Netherlanders who have fled here from their homeland due to persecution for their faith, has sent me and let it be known that they have learned that we engage in disputations of faith, which they do not approve of. They wanted to warn us to refrain from this, and if they learn more, they would be compelled to deal with us in another way, which we would not like. To this, I replied that I could not recall in what manner I had engaged in disputation, nor do I consider myself a disputant, but I desire to learn. However, it was no less that I had perhaps spoken with all reverence about the word of God with some Christian opinion, not knowing if they wanted to consider this a disputation. To this, they said they had been thoroughly informed that I had said in the public market that I did not believe a priest could bind or absolve my sins.</p>
      <p>To this, I replied that such words were spoken conditionally, in that they still had auricular confession here as in the papacy, and also that some ministers were involved in public vices, such as fornication and other shames, making them unfit for such an office, so that they were not governed by the spirit of God, therefore I did not believe they could bind or absolve me. But I held it to be true that if I were involved in vices and desired to abstain from them, the Christian church, by the command of Christ, could forgive my sins through the proclamation of the word of God as an instrument, so that God in heaven would ratify what the same says to me by the command of God's word, and not because of his office or person. In conclusion, I was told it was not the command of an honorable council to inquire into my faith, but I should refrain from disputation. Thus, it is to be considered that my adversaries are intent on, if they learn further that I speak of the word of God, I cannot say I was punished for religion, but for disobedience. Therefore, I request from your honor, according to your situation, advice on how I should conduct myself in good conscience in such matters. Furthermore, I have learned from your letter how the Bernese have reconciled with the Savoyard, it is to be considered that the Genevans will not like this, as they are now in the midst of enemies.</p>
      <p>Many suspect there is a trick behind this treaty, and it is only aimed at Geneva. There is also talk here that the Spaniards have arrived in Lorraine, and since they are somewhat close to Strasbourg, they have sent to the camp of the Duke of Albi, and are said to be arming themselves. Some say the King of Spain wants to execute the next appearing council and start with the French. Thus, there is much talk, with a request that if you have any news, you share it with me.</p>
      <p>In Amberg, the community is very rebellious. In short, they do not want to tolerate or suffer the Zwinglians or Calvinists (as they call them); it is to be feared that if God does not hold the reins, they will deal tyrannically enough with the poor people, so that the Christian church is persecuted everywhere. May God have mercy on them, turn His wrath from us, and receive us into His grace.</p>
      <p>Herewith a letter to Tretius, coming from the land of Poland. You should deliver it to him, and if he has already traveled to Frankfurt, arrange for it to be sent there if you have the opportunity; if not, send it back here, or wherever you think he might be found. Please greet him very kindly for me. I was also pleased to hear that you returned home fresh and healthy from the Girenbaadt. Your cousin Heinrich Hedinger is well and sends you diligent greetings, likewise, please also be greeted by me, and let me be commended to your prayers. With whatever is dear and serviceable to you at any time, I commend you to the protection and care of the Most High.</p>
      <p>Dated August 12, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, G. S.</p>
      <p>To the revered and highly learned Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my gracious lord in Zurich.</p>
