    <p xml:id="regest1">Requests him to advocate for the son of Alexander Rischacher [Martin?] to receive accommodation and a share of the alms in Zurich; Myconius himself has hosted him temporarily and is convinced that he will not be a burden to anyone; the people of Basel would rather take something away from their pastors than support their children. He has forwarded the letter to Bucer [No. 1797]. It is said that Emperor [Charles V] is besieging two French cities with a large army reinforced by English troops. Has not yet heard anything about the assembly of the Schmalkaldic League; one should not underestimate the Emperor, to whom even some Protestants are exceedingly loyal. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Alexander Rischacher, the deacon of St. Mark's, a good man, is with us. He has a son who is troubled by his stepmother and therefore also burdensome to his father. He has learned that it is possible to find a citizen among you who, for eight or ten gold coins, could provide for a young man of the age of Alexander's son for a year, provided that bread is given from public alms as usual. He has therefore asked me not only to learn this from you but also, if what he has understood is true, to urge you to assist him as much as you can. We do not impose the task on you to find such a citizen, but to ask others in your name to find and persuade such a person to perform the duty of a good man.</p>
      <p>Although this cannot be done without your effort and work, namely to receive bread from alms, we beseech you, once a citizen is found, to intercede with the almoners with a single word. The young man is good and studious.</p>
      <p>I do not believe it will be troublesome to anyone, for I also had him with me for free for some time four years ago; he was anything but troublesome.</p>
      <p>The plague drove him out of my house, otherwise, I would have kept him longer. And to anticipate what you ask in your mind: We who preside over the word are so loved here that they would much rather take away what we have than provide for our children. This is for your discretion. If you achieve anything here, you will greatly gratify Lord Rischacher; for I have no doubt that he himself will be ready to pay the money. If there is any hope, let us know as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>I have sent your letters to Bucer immediately. Great things are said about the Emperor without measure; they say he is besieging two of the most famous French cities, each with thirty thousand foot soldiers and two thousand horsemen. In the midst of the besiegers, there are again thirty thousand arranged to support the army that will need it; meanwhile, the English have sent ten thousand.</p>
      <p>This is from someone from Ensheim.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received anything about the legates of the Schmalkaldic League. Another from Ensheim said within eight days: "Let those gathered in that league act cautiously.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is not a foolish man; if they err, he will not err." There are even some among the evangelicals who hold him in high regard as if he were a god.</p>
      <p>I indeed commend my part to the Lord; may He keep you and yours. Farewell. Hastily, Basel, October 20, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
