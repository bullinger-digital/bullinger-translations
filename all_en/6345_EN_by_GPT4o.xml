      <p>Greetings. I gladly read the letter from your Stucki, a truly elegant and learned man, though I was very reluctant about those verses on the death of Adrien Turnèbe, whom I had as a teacher and friend for many years.</p>
      <p>The death of such a great man cannot but be bitter for France and all good people. You may rightly consider him to have been either the Pliny or rather the Varro of this age; there was nothing pretentious, nothing artificial in that man.</p>
      <p>It is remarkable, however, how great a man he was in a small matter, having achieved an extraordinary mastery of all good arts with a certain admirable felicity of genius.</p>
      <p>I agree with your Stucki about Salignac; do not think that France nurtures a more excellent man. I am glad when I hear that our affairs are in a good state; may God grant that these joys be solid and everlasting for us! I am returning the letter and the epitaphs; now I have nothing to send you in return, except my own spirit (which I wish you to be fully convinced of) as most eager, for which I pray to God to bless you and your most holy labors. I have been most annoyingly busy all day; but still, unless I am being too rustic, I invite you to dinner at this late hour, your presence would be most pleasing to me. Certainly, I am reserving tomorrow for you.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, P[omponne] Bellièvre.</p>
