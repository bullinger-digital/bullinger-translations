      <p> Greetings. I believe that the letters exchanged between us have now been delivered, since I understand that you have received those which I sent through the boy of that treasurer, an excellent man, along with your notes on the Emperor's decree. There is no reason for you to doubt the people of Lindau; they are so confirmed in the Lord in spirit, and even more so because they understand how much inconvenience they would suffer without the present counsel of their chief scribe, and they fear being deceived by the cunning of certain foxes. We must pray to the Lord that their faith does not fail amidst so many severe trials. That chief scribe of the Lord will await a calling, since he can no longer be of service to the people of Lindau. Musculus returned here four days ago to await the response of your council; it is possible that he may be called by the people of Lindau, although I think our people would gladly include such a man in the number of church ministers, if it seemed right to them to summon anyone to share in our common and present danger. As for myself, I would certainly rejoice in such a fellow minister both for myself and for our entire church; the man's learning and piety, which I have long observed, are greatly approved by me. </p>
      <p> There is no need for me to commend our Gervasius to you, lest I seem to neglect the duties of the old friendship and Christian fellowship which you have long had with him, which you are accustomed to extend even to those little known to you. </p>
      <p> You will console the man, who seems quite afflicted, so that he may await the Lord's will with unbroken spirit. I have prudently concealed some things which I seemed to have discovered in him, as there was no opportunity to reveal and heal this pain as I wished; these matters will be deferred until his return to us. May the Lord preserve him whole and firm for His church for as long as possible! </p>
      <p> You would have already obtained those two things you asked of me, if circumstances allowed. I will send the recess of the assembly (as they call it) once it has been printed; in the meantime, you will find the main points diligently extracted by my Conrad Zwicker with Marcellus Theodoricus. You have enough of that extract. Yesterday I wrote to my brother to send me the Latin and German copies of that decree; as soon as I receive them, I will ensure you have them. The return of our envoys (whatever it may be) will be announced to you in due time. </p>
      <p> The rest will be conveyed by our Gervasius. Farewell to you and yours, and with the greatest constancy of faith you can muster, diligently intercede with Christ the Savior for us. Our people greet you, especially my wife and Conrad Zwicker. August 3, 1548. </p>
      <p> I send here what I received three days ago from my relative Peter Sch√§r, neither vain nor of doubtful faith; for he very solemnly affirms that the moon was seen marked with certain good men and women. What these things truly portend for us, you can easily conjecture according to the judgment of your spirit. Let me know about the eagle's nest found among you, how the matter stands. Would that those most rapacious and ominous birds never nest among you. </p>
      <p> Yours, Ambrosius Blarer. </p>
      <p> To his Bullinger. </p>
