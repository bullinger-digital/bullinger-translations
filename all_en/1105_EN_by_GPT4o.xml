      <p>Favorable, dear sir, after our farewell, you should know that Magdeburg is still standing and in its current state, and that some, hoping for improvement, may harm and disadvantage themselves by sparing it. Ultimately, the imperial majesty wants them to be overrun by the empire with 8,000 foot soldiers and 1,000 horsemen along with other assistance. However, I think there has been a withdrawal from Magdeburg, about which news should soon come. Sir Hans von Heideck was not present during their misfortune, but since then, along with others, has entered with up to 300 horses. Much has been tried with them to persuade them to goodwill; finally, some nobility has shot out and dealt with them in this way: they were of the same faith, also their opinion, finally to persist with the gospel, against which no council could act.</p>
      <p>The matter should be given rest and obedience to the authorities in the meantime. To which they always answered: regarding obedience to their authorities, they wanted and should, as Christians, neither negotiate nor allow themselves to be disputed with them, desiring to give everyone unbidden and unforced compliance, speech, answer, and unrefusable decision; but primarily they wanted to know whether they would be allowed to remain in their Christian religion or not; for if this most important article were not assured and resolved, they would remain with Christ in life and death and adhere to nothing else.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is demanded that Magdeburg should surrender in grace and disgrace, give up their freedoms, answer for 24 pieces of artillery along with 200,000 guilders, lay down everyone's damage, whoever has a claim against them, etc.</p>
      <p>The same situation, though not so rough, has also happened to Bremen and Brunswick, so that it seems like a great uprising everywhere; yet it is truly to be feared that the fox will leave the pears on the tree, while they do not want to fall, endure patience, and then be caught with all convenience, etc.</p>
      <p>A nobleman was supposed to come here; he was shot by a cupbearer, hopes to be healed soon; he will come.</p>
      <p>A good-hearted, excellent, and well-traveled man writes from France that out of despair, his king has so far relied on good flattering words and waited for the emperor's death and watched so long that the opposition has taken over far and that there is reason to watch him as he has done to others. However, the emperor is said to be seriously ill; otherwise, the war would be in progress with you, and good unity among the Confederates would have been separated.</p>
      <p>On the 12th of the past month, the proposal was in Spain that Archduke Maximilian should take up residence in Barcelona, travel to Genoa, and bring 500,000 crowns.</p>
      <p>The king and the prince are supposed to be united in all things regarding succession.</p>
      <p>Octavio is to be forgiven in Parma, and the Consaga is in progress in Milan to take Parma.</p>
      <p>Duke Heinrich of Brunswick has left Augsburg, and it is said he is to lead some cavalry. His cousin Duke Eric of Brunswick has also hurriedly ridden out of Augsburg, having let it be known that he will be overrun in the country.</p>
      <p>The Turks are said to have daily dealings in Hungary. Show this letter to Putler and do not report me otherwise. Dated Zurich, December 10, 1550.</p>
      <p>Duke Christoph of Württemberg has, from the moment of his father's passing, informed the imperial and royal majesty, taken over the land, and requested the fiefdom and acted with reasonable propriety.</p>
      <p>The imperial majesty has revealed his gracious will through the council, also promising to do the utmost for the sake of justification in a complete action.</p>
      <p>The royal majesty has also shown graciousness, but with the addition: the initiated justification not to be infringed, and that her majesty will not let the least of it fall away.</p>
      <p>Despite good words, the raiders, who have ruined the whole region, are now coming, settling in the Metzingen valley in Württemberg, where the good wine grows, and it is to be feared that more troops will come to Württemberg.</p>
      <p>To my favorable, trusted, dear lord and friend Master Heinrich Bullinger, to be delivered personally.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
