      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Your brother came to me and read the letter you wrote on June 9th, which greatly cheered me up, as it contained joyful news about the Valais expedition and the goodwill of your citizens towards the good cause. Our people would also have well-disposed minds, if only the sluggishness of the more powerful, or should I say their malice and fear, did not disturb everything. It is because of them that I have less hope in good matters and more sorrow and grief. For this calamity is greater than I can express in words. I feel the hand of the Lord afflicting us because of our ingratitude and wicked life. Therefore, I pray to the Lord to have mercy on us. For you know what it means if the powerful are weak, and even more so if they are malicious. Until now, all good people have been exercised by that most unworthy cause of the people of Glarus. We are bound to them by treaty. We owe them support against force and injustice, and indeed oppression. But what could have been extorted from our people so far? Who seriously helped the cause of the allies? We either love or fear the adversaries and those who bring force upon us so much that, if we did not fear the people, we would almost approach the adversaries. For there are those who hate the evangelical people of Glarus in a remarkable way. If they were to concede to the five places, they would be received with the greatest pleasure and not the slightest thing would be held against them. Therefore, although we know this concerns our religion, nothing moves our people; I wish they were not more unjust for this reason! (It has never been possible to speak bravely with the five places, that one could not endure it properly, etc.; there is nothing but fear that one might anger the people, etc.) And since we are like this towards our own and our allies, how do you think we are towards the faithful French adherents of Cond√©, especially when they see seven cantons about to march against them? This alone, if there were any integrity left in the heart, would stir us to cheerfulness and to favor those who love our religion, since they are so ready to help the adversarial and worst cause. Therefore, charity has cooled, iniquity overflows. Hence, hope is in God alone, who will not forsake His church, even if it is forsaken by hypocrites and the most corrupt and unjust men.</p>
      <p>I could no longer contain myself from pouring out the great sorrow of my soul into your bosom. Tear up the letter, and pray to the Lord for us. Farewell.</p>
