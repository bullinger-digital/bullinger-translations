      <p>Greetings. Three days ago, I wrote extensively to your kindness, most illustrious man, through Ransperg, your fellow countryman. However, since this particular friend of ours was about to set out to you, I wanted to give him this letter, in which I remind you, if by chance you have the time to respond to mine. What a friend wrote to me about the people of Magdeburg, the people of WÃ¼rttemberg, and some others, this same Buttler of ours can read and recite to you. Farewell. The booklets of Mr. Theodor have not yet been published; as soon as they are published, you will have them from me. Zurich, 16th of December, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I commend Buttler to your kindness.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed master. St. Gallen.</p>
