      <p>Joy, grace, and mercy from God, the Father, through Jesus Christ, our Savior, etc., along with all the honor and goodness I can offer, dear godfather and lord.</p>
      <p>I thank you always for all the good, etc., and let you know that I am fresh and healthy along with my household. I also heard from the heart about you and your household.</p>
      <p>When I arrived in Entringen, my Salome died, and I have little appetite, and the benefices are not yet settled (legally valid). Yet, I must endure for the sake of the word. Indeed, my people are entirely rebellious, especially the mayor in the village and the judges, also the wealthiest who might form factions and reject the works, loans, and help of the common, pious people, those who adhere to the gospel, persecuted in court with the dew, and we, as if our part were well justified, to complain before the prince or his government. Indeed, they defecated behind the altar (high altar) on the pulpit, also painted gallows on the panels behind the altar et reliqua etc. Therefore, I had about 20 articles against them, which I endure through God's word of reformation. Therefore, I am justified in punishing their mischief and withdrawing the ground rents according to my office's duty and obligation, through which I am accused of falling into violence, which is not the truth, but rather meant for the pious to punish better. I also do this, with kindness, admonish them and go to them for advice, which happened about four times, admonishing them according to the scripture to desist, then earnestly and bravely on the pulpit, as one who is concerned with his office and managing the city. I ask you and all our brothers to pray to God for me and for what is entrusted to me by the Lord, for improvement. One hardly hears of a place as this, which for many years in the papacy, errant priests have never left in peace, etc. God have mercy on us all. Conradus Schlupfindheck, pastor in Seeberg, will inform you well about other matters. Nothing more, then God be with you and all your household.</p>
      <p>Greet all brothers and good lords, etc.</p>
      <p>Given in Entringen, etc. 35., on John the Baptist's day.</p>
      <p>JÃ¶rg Distel, pastor in Entringen, etc.</p>
      <p>Out of great haste, I could not write to you in Latin, therefore do not be angry. It goes for other preachers almost all like me, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful and learned M. Heinrich Bullinger, churchman in Zurich, his dearest godfather and teacher, etc. Zurich.</p>
