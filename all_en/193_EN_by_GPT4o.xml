      <p>Heinrich Pantaleon to the most beloved Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Z端richers.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Although a certain singular benevolence and humanity seem to be equally innate to all the people of Z端rich, yours, venerable prelate, leaves all others far behind, and the more so, as your learning, morals, and condition of life surpass them all. Since I have recently experienced this more than my humble position deserves, I could not refrain from also sending my letters to you (although I might be accused of being a newcomer), in order to express my greatest thanks for your humanity and to reveal my readiness towards you and yours in all things that a friend can or wants to ask from a friend, I say. Therefore, I proclaim, commend, and repeatedly emphasize the virtues and humanity of Bullinger to everyone, and I assert that they are greater than any fame has ever extolled, nor is there any reason for anyone to accuse me of flattery; the matter speaks for itself, and you will understand it from others at some point, etc. Alas, too many new things are being reported here, and I wish there would finally be an end to them. Mr. Musculus came to Basel today, the day I am writing, shortly before noon. They say that Brentius has also fled and was barely received into a certain fortress by a good man; whether this deed is to be praised, I leave to you and those like you to judge.</p>
      <p>May the Lord strengthen His ministers with the spirit, so that they may persevere to the end in the confession of the truth. Augsburg, Worms, Ulm, Heidelberg, etc., have agreed to the Interim. The same was recently sent by the Emperor to the Duke of W端rttemberg; the Duke convened the preachers and officials, and requested a relaxation from the Emperor, to the great astonishment of the Emperor. He instructed the envoys to return immediately if they see the Emperor offended, intending to deliberate further. Some say the people of Strasbourg have rejected the Interim, others deny the same. It is certain that almost all citizens are seething with anger, yet hardly dare to speak out due to fear; for as the body reflects the Swabian, so they have a spirit more timid than a hare. Then they say that Wittenberg has defected from Maurice; whether this is certain, I hardly dare to promise (as with the previous matters) in these times.</p>
      <p>As for us, by the grace of God, we all firmly adhere to the Gospel, magistrates, preachers, and citizens; may the same be true if our roofs should happen to catch fire. This is what I had to say. I pray finally, most distinguished man, that you may bring your chronology, a work as useful as it is most honorable, to completion more swiftly, so that all may see that not only in our time, but also in the past, the pious have always been despised and not few in number; yet the dark gate of Dis (the underworld) stands open day and night, etc. For I have almost begun to regret my own labor, after I sensed that you have laid your hand on this tablet.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and continue to defend Christ. Greet Mr. Ammianus, Gwalther, Phrysius, Bibliander, and all the faithful in the vineyard of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel on the third day before the Ides of July in the year 1548. On the feast of St. Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in morals and letters, Mr. Master Heinrich Bullinger, prelate of the Church of Z端rich, his most revered father in Christ, etc.</p>
