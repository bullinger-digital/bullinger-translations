      <p>Pious, honorable, prudent, esteemed, and wise Mr. Meier, mayor and council of Biel, gracious dear sirs, my willing service and all good things be always ready for you from me. I have received your friendly letter and request with delay and have well understood its content. And indeed, from the beginning, when I heard of the passing of Mr. Jacob F端nckel, my dear fellow brother, I was deeply saddened. Especially since many well-endowed servants of God of this time have passed away in many places far and wide, not without lament and harm to the church. May God always provide His church again with faithful, capable, and God-fearing servants for His praise and the salvation of many souls.</p>
      <p>As for how your church might again be provided with another pious, learned, honorable, and modest pastor, I have, upon receiving your letter, made inquiries today and found some indications that I am of good hope. If you would write or send a message to my gracious lords, the mayor and council of the city of Z端rich, they would without delay assist your church according to the custom and order of our church, to provide for your church with honor and all necessity, which they would also do very willingly. As for me, you can confidently assure yourself that I am wholeheartedly ready to serve you. And indeed, it would please me if I could serve your city and church, for you, along with the entire church, have always and from the beginning conducted yourselves very faithfully, honorably, and well in Christian religion. May the Lord Jesus Christ always keep you and the entire church in His grace. Dated Z端rich, the 6th of February in the year of our Lord 1566.</p>
      <p>Your entirely willing servant Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, servant of the church in Z端rich.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, esteemed, and wise Mr. Meier, mayor and council of the city of Biel, my gracious, dear sirs.</p>
