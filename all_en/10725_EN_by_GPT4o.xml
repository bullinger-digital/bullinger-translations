    <p xml:id="regest1">Asks Bullinger to intercede with the Landvogt of Kyburg [Hans Rudolf Lavater] on behalf of the bearer of the letter, a repentant Anabaptist. They debated twice with Martin Lingg, the first time about the oath, the second time primarily about infant baptism; the council now wants to take decisive action against Anabaptism.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter was entangled for some time in the songs of the Anabaptists, but has now somewhat come to his senses and recanted before the church in Laufen. However, he does not have the means to pay the imposed fine, as he possesses nothing at all besides his wife and children. Therefore, he asked that I intercede with you, and you in turn with the Lord of Kyburg, whom we all know holds you dear, so that mercy may be shown to him in this matter, which he greatly needs. Therefore, my brother, let this poor man feel the benefit of your efforts.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we have already conferred twice with Martin Lingg, once about the oath in the presence of certain senators appointed for this purpose, and the second time about vain matters, especially about infant baptism. Although he is a cunning man, an excellent obscurer of the scriptures, and not entirely ignorant of the sophists' subtleties, we nevertheless conferred with him with the greatest praise for the truth and with the greatest benefit for all who were present. For in the second meeting, it was open to all who wished to attend. Moreover, on November 20th, Lingg stood before the imperial court. The court did not want to pass judgment on him unless the judges were first certain of the opinion of the great council and whether they would be willing to help in eradicating this weed. Therefore, the great council was convened yesterday, which promised excellent support and simultaneously decreed that the plague of the Anabaptists should be completely eradicated. Therefore, we hope that the council will take stricter action against the Anabaptists, as leniency does not remove them but rather strengthens them. I fear Lingg will hardly escape with his life.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>November 25, 1535.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and good friend.</p>
