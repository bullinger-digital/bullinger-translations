      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg, and of Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We have received your letter, in which you report on the Saxon confession that was sent back to us and received, as well as on our cousin's confession, and may the Lord grant us all grace, so that the saving word is spread in common, and that misunderstandings, grievances, and weaknesses, especially without disruption, are debated and improved for the edification of the community, which also has the word and desires to seek the honor of Christ, in the unity and fellowship of Christ Jesus, to which all Christians should be inclined, and we cannot understand our cousin otherwise.</p>
      <p>Regarding the printer, you might note to us differently than we mean and have understood your letter; for we also, concerning the common cause, which might touch upon these matters and dealings, also to all those who serve for the salvation of German liberty and the honor of Christ, would therefore much prefer that the matters be arranged in such a way that people, as much as possible, are prepared and certainly provided for, without any, as it seems, failure or lack, and would not less gladly see this promoted than you; therefore, your apology against us was not necessary.</p>
      <p>We thank you graciously for the sent Latin copy of the book now dedicated to us, and since it pleases you so, we will be favorably awaiting the other, also the German copies. We would not withhold our gracious response to your letter and are inclined to your grace. Dated Schaffhausen, the 23rd of March, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
