    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller received a copy of Ambrosius Blarer's letter to Bullinger; he would have preferred to receive it directly from Bullinger. Regarding the war for the reinstatement of Duke Ulrich of WÃ¼rttemberg, Haller received the first true report from Bullinger, but since then also two others. The people of Bern are puzzled by the silence of the people of Zurich; Haller requests news. Alliance of eight cantons with the people of Valais and the Duke of Savoy. Haller requests the sending of Bullinger's commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians. Greetings from Mayor Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl.</p>

      <p>Greetings. This messenger brought us a copy of the letters from Ambrosius Blarer sent to you, which I wish you had sent directly to me, although I hold this very pious man, who is very dear to me, in high regard, whatever service he received from our people. We received the first true report about this war from you. Then the people of Strasbourg wrote. Now we have received a third one. Our people do not cease to marvel at the silence of yours. Some seem to be unfavorably disposed towards this matter. I beg you not to stop writing daily about what you receive. We have been informed that the people of Valais, the Duke of Savoy, and eight others have entered into an alliance. What they are planning, you can easily conjecture, as you have the most thorough understanding of these people's characters. Whether the people of Appenzell or Glarus have joined, we do not know at all, but we are very certain about the rest. This is for you in secret.</p>
      <p>If anything has been printed on the Corinthians, send it as soon as you can.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>30th of May.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>The mayor sends his heartfelt greetings.</p>
      <p>To his Heinrich Bullinger, always dearest brother.</p>
