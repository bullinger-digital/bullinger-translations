    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the letter [No. 1684] and the sent [commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew, the Acts of the Apostles, and the apostolic letters]; however, if he had known that Bullinger would gift him these books, he would have purchased them himself in Frankfurt; he wishes he had asked Bullinger earlier which authors and histories he should read; now he has read Bernardo Giustiniani's "De origine urbis Venetiarum", [Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus'] "Historia ecclesiastica tripartita", Eusebius' "Historia ecclesiastica", "De evangelica praeparatione" and "De evangelica demonstratione", which he regrets because he could have used the time better. Eusebius' "Demonstratio [evangelica]" was quite laborious to read due to the partly awkward exegesis, especially regarding the Logos and the Jews; he lists various points that he agrees with or criticizes; he read these books before his visit to Zurich, as well as Tertullian, whose piety, simplicity, and right judgment regarding the doctrine of the Lord's Supper and other topics struck him more than his difficult style; from both Tertullian and the church histories, he has collected many passages that he can use against his compatriots who hold Epicurean views. He purchased and read Tertullian at the market, which is why he could question Bullinger about it during his visit [in Zurich]; he is also aware that Tertullian's views sometimes need to be contradicted or taken with caution, as in "De praescriptione haereticorum", where he argues, among other things, that one should not dispute with heretics and speaks of ecclesiastical examination of apostolic doctrine. Since his return [from Zurich], he has read Cyprian and Lactantius with great interest, whom he sees as a supporter in the following matter. From the death of Queen Anne [Boleyn, in May 1536] until his departure [1540], he was criticized by some neighbors in London for not giving money for large wax candles, which were lit before the cross and the [Easter] tomb, according to the custom of the community [St Margaret Bridge Street]; he describes his argumentation to the neighbors, who even brought the matter before the diocesan bishop [John Stokesley]; initially, the bishop did nothing in anticipation [of the restoration of Catholicism] and soon died of grief over the accusations from Cromwell and others that he had not supported the king's [Henry VIII's] efforts to abolish the papal primacy and dissolve the monasteries. When his opponents [1538] presented him with a new royal edict that only allowed candles before the crucifix and at Easter before the Holy Sepulchre, he declared that he was not affected by it, as he did not want to remove the candles and the next step would be their abolition anyway; he was then accused of rebellion against the old custom, which even his mother had adhered to for his protection. The day after his departure to Antwerp, [the Bishop of] Winchester [Stephen Gardiner] interrogated some of Hilles' neighbors, but even his worst enemies did not want to denounce him; with this action, the bishop possibly wanted to induce him to flee - Bullinger now sees why he regards Lactantius as his defender. Detailed questions about the understanding of Lactantius' works. Further detailed questions about Cyprian, who sometimes judges too harshly. He wanted to read Origen because of his age but changed his mind after Bullinger did not mention him; instead, he will read Augustine or Jerome on the prophets, unless Bullinger advises against it, as does Capito, who said in a lecture on Isaiah that Jerome is only suitable as a rhetorician. He asks for guidance on how to best retain what he has read in memory; he usually creates [a florilegium], which is quite laborious for him as a slow writer. He requests the sending of Bullinger's "De scripturae sanctae authoritate [...] deque episcoporum [...] institutione et functione" and "De origine erroris", bound as one book, as well as Leo Jud's Bible ["Biblia sacrosancta"], if completed, but Bullinger should first set the price, which Heinrich Falkner will reimburse; greetings to Falkner and Peter Hürtzel [Hirzel]; they should promptly pay their debts, as he has bought English cloth with all his money, which is now blocked in Antwerp due to the war. Greetings and thanks to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] for the kind reception during the Hilles' visit to Zurich; he asks for further explanation about the fabric ordered by Bullinger's or Megander's wife [Regula, née Offenhuser]; greetings; he is entirely devoted to Bullinger but does not want to bother him with letters anymore. He asks to advocate for John Burcher before the Zurich council, which is why [John] Butler recently wrote to Bullinger [No. 1689]. He has not heard any news from England since the Frankfurt fair, but he has informed Bullinger through Peter Hürtzel [Hirzel] that war has broken out on the border between Scotland and England; after the killing of some English soldiers, [Henry VIII] threatened war if [James V of Scotland] did not accept the conditions to recognize [Henry VIII] as head, eliminate the papacy and monks, allow the spread of the [evangelical] faith, and compensate [Henry VIII] for the damage suffered, which [James V] mostly refused; during these negotiations in August and September, preparations for war were simultaneously made; there are only rumors about the losses of the English troops advancing into Scotland; Bullinger will have already heard all this from John Burcher, but Hilles reports to him as promised. He has lost a large sum of money in England; he now wants to give an annual sum for the religious refugees in Strasbourg, so he will not be able to donate as much to the refugees in Zurich in the future, but he is happy to be asked by Bullinger if needed. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I received your books, most esteemed teacher, along with your letter; and I am more grateful to you in my heart than I can express with my pen. However, if I had known that you would gift me those books, I would certainly have purchased such in Frankfurt, and I would not have mentioned them to you at all. Why should I have been a burden to your kindness after such great expenses were made on my behalf? I wish I had consulted you earlier, my lord, about which authors to read and which histories to explore. For I first read Bernardo Giustiniani's "De origine urbis Venetiarum", the "Historia ecclesiastica tripartita", and Eusebius' "Historia ecclesiastica", his "De evangelica praeparatione", and what his "Demonstrationes" are like. I would not regret having read these, except that now I see from your letters that I could have spent the time more usefully than I did in reading them.</p>
      <p>Eusebius' "Demonstrationes" caused me some tedium because the sacred scriptures are explained so insipidly (if I may say so) throughout, especially in the matter of the Word and against the Jews. Furthermore, he seems to have a poor opinion everywhere about free will, the marriage of priests, and the fifth chapter of Matthew. However, I found things in that book that greatly pleased me; for example, about the New Testament, Book I, chapters 5 and 6, and about the seventy weeks of Daniel, Book VIII, chapter 2, his opinion. I went through these books before I came to Zurich, as well as Tertullian: whom I found to be as you recommended him to me. He was not so ungrateful to me because of the difficulty of his style, but because of his outstanding piety, simplicity, and right judgment in the matter of the Eucharist, as in many other articles, he was most pleasing and useful. From him, I collected many things (as from the ecclesiastical histories) with which I can silence many of my compatriots who are always speaking. All things are pure to the pure: God is spirit: He requires only our heart and a mind well imbued with knowledge from us, - and similar Epicurean voices.</p>
      <p>I happened upon this author by chance here in the market, and on that occasion (not without God's providence, I think) I bought and read him. However, because he, scarcely known to me by name before, brought me so much benefit, he provided the first opportunity for me to pour out those questions to you when I was with you. Yet (thank God) I am not ignorant that his opinion is to be rejected everywhere; this has been noted by many, and you know better: but somewhere it is to be read with judgment, even in the little book "De Praescriptione Haereticorum", as when he says that one should not dispute with heretics, nor allow them to have or confer with Catholics the sacred scripture: likewise, what the apostles preached should not be proven otherwise than through the same churches which the apostles themselves founded, etc. Although he speaks of true heretics and of the church of his time, which (as he says) was the same as the holy scripture, which added nothing of its own, so that something contrary to it and found in the scriptures might be remedied by retraction, addition, or change.</p>
      <p>After I finally returned from you, I first read Cyprian, then Lactantius, whose reading I do not regret at all. I have him as a defender against the adversaries of a certain cause of mine, or rather of God, as I think: but him, as you predicted, I have known not without great fruit of piety. From the death of Queen Anne, beheaded among us, until my departure, some of my neighbors in London gravely detracted from my reputation because I refused to give a single coin (in honor of God, as it is said) annually for the custom of the parish, to be affixed before the crucifix and the tomb in the temple. First, they dealt with me kindly through parents and friends (whose advice in this matter seemed to them to prevail greatly with me) and cited the custom of I don't know how many five hundred years, when only a hundred years of custom had the force of law with them. I replied that I did not know a custom against Christ, who says, God is spirit, etc., John 4. They immediately objected, taught by the parson: Do you then deny that God is worshiped with any external things? No: for Christ, who is not custom but truth, says: "Let your light so shine," etc. And therefore I think he added in John 4, "And in truth." I explained this clause to them thus. In truth, that is, truly and according to the word of God; namely, with innocence, piety, mercy, and holiness of life, without which no one will see God. But with external things, invented or devised by men for worship, the divine majesty is not worshiped at all (Matthew 15), which needs nothing, nor is it delighted with those frivolous and corruptible things. Then after a few months (as they had any hope of a change of affairs) they often returned with threats, and threatened to accuse me to the bishop of our diocese unless I repented: which, because I was obstinate, they did. However, the bishop ordered them to be quiet for a while (so it was said to me at least), and finally, everything would succeed according to their mind. For he was expecting a good day to come soon, but he did not survive to see it; for he died miserably, almost consumed by grief, as it seemed, being too much vexed by Lord Cromwell and others about frivolous suspicions, that he did not favor the king's efforts in abolishing the primacy of the pope and the demolition of the monasteries. But I return to the subject.</p>
      <p>In the second year before my departure from England, the king's edicts were publicly sent to the bishops and the lay presidents of all the parishes, that because of the superstition of the people they should not permit any candles to be lit or affixed in the temples before images, except only before the crucifix and at the feast of Easter before the tomb of Christ. The presidents of the parishes immediately summoned me, and in the temple, they asked me whether I still stubbornly remained in my purpose against the injunctions of the royal majesty. I replied that those letters did not concern me, about which they seemed to me to triumph in victory already: for I, I said, am not a bishop nor a president of a parish; nor if I were endowed with such an office, do those edicts command me to support your lights, but not to expel them from the temple, which I do not attempt. Moreover, from those letters, I said, issued by the king, I conceive great hope that after a little time it will not even be free for you to light those candles of yours before the crucifix or the tomb anymore. For whoever from other superstitious lights, the same end is to be expected from that tradition, since it is manifest to all that the same planting was planted by the earthly pope and is to be eradicated by the heavenly Father, as also that which is now being extirpated at the royal command. Then they dismissed me speaking. You say you do not attempt to expel the sacred lights from our temple, yet by your bad example, you try to draw all (especially young people like you and frivolous boys) after you, if they dared; denying to do what your and your wife's parents, grave and wise men, and all honest neighbors do not disdain to do. Which is certainly true: for my mother (as I now hear) paid that coin for me for a year or two, to appease the rabies of the dogs, and lest I (which she feared) fall into greater danger.</p>
      <p>After this, I heard nothing about this matter, except that the day after I left London towards here or at least Antwerp, the king's vicar in ecclesiastical matters of Winchester, then first appointed, to whom perhaps I was known by reputation (for his diocese extended to the middle of London Bridge), publicly attempted to find out something about me from some of my neighbors, captured before my departure. And he said to one of them in the presence of all standing in the palace: And you, foolish man, for what purpose did you admit so many people into your house daily, when you are such a poor and needy craftsman? The accused replied when asked, There was no such frequency of people at my house, especially of the suspect. What, said the bishop, do you limp before the limping (or he had some similar proverb): was not Richard Hilles with you daily, teaching you and those like you? The accused denied it altogether: and my gravest enemies, who were also rich, did not want to come forward publicly willingly, according to the new statutes of the kingdom, and be held before all as informers of their neighbors. The bishop also, perhaps not knowing that I was absent, publicly inquired about me and spoke so that I would flee, and thus no longer poison his rabid sheep with venom. Now you have, my most observant lord, what I meant when I said that I was glad to have Lactantius as a defender of my cause, or at least not to regret that I had read him.</p>
      <p>However, I wondered what he meant by discussing the pollution of demons and their intercourse with women, Book II, chapter 15; about the power of alms, Book VI, chapters 13, 25; about the affection of anger, which he even attributes to God himself, in the same book, chapters 15, 18, 23; about not using flowers or ointments, chapter 32, which he calls the allurements of pleasures and the weapons of the enemy of man: likewise about comparing and weighing good works with evil ones; about the life of the just on earth from the day of judgment with Christ reigning for a thousand years, who during those years will give all nations into the servitude of the elect, Book VII, who will nevertheless later also hide for a while again under the earth because of the fear of the resolved prince of demons, who besieges them, and the multitude of nations, which will rebel against them: and other similar things in his epitome. Cyprian also seems to be too severe in many places, especially in Book IV, Epistle 2, where he deals with late penitents. He also utters wonders about the purification of sins through alms, and about the examination of goods by fire there. Moreover, it can be doubted (at least in my judgment) whether his passages about satisfaction can be reconciled in such a way that he would seem to think piously and purely about the righteousness of Christ, especially in Book I, Epistle 7; Book III, Epistle 14; about the merits of martyrs and the just, Sermon 5; furthermore, what he writes in the epistle to Quirinus, about free will; about the same and about the primacy of Peter, Epistle 3, Book I; about the understanding of this word (water), which everywhere with him signifies baptism in sacred scripture; about the mixture of the sacred chalice with water, which he affirms Christ instituted at the supper, Book II, chapter 3. I have decided to read Origen because of his antiquity (when I next have time), but I have now changed my mind because you made no mention of him in your letters to me. However, I will take up some work of Augustine in his place, or perhaps Jerome on the prophets, unless against your judgment: I once heard Dr. Capito gravely criticizing him in a lecture on Isaiah and saying that Jerome was nothing but a rhetorician; which I had not believed before: however, he seemed to have his reasons why he rightly argued against him. If you will deign to write to me again sometime, please advise me on the most convenient way to retain in memory what I have read. So far, I am accustomed to collecting the heads of several commonplaces and sentences into one book: but this is troublesome for me because I write very slowly. Furthermore, I desire your booklets, my lord, on the authority of scripture, on the office of bishops, and on the origin of error; and if it seems better to you, have them bound together. I beg you to send me also the Bible of D. Leo Jud, if it is completed, or as soon as you have a suitable opportunity. But first set the price, and take it from H. Falkner: otherwise, I will not receive them from anyone. Finally, I beg you as much as possible to greet H. Falkner and Peter Hürtzel in my name, and tell them that the state of Lower Germany is such that I hardly believe any English cloth will come to Frankfurt at the next fair because of the war between the Emperor and the Duke of Guelders. Therefore, I pray both of them to pay the money they owe me (although it is small) to me or my wife (if I should be absent) here in Strasbourg, or have it paid through some citizen of Zurich. For now, I especially need it during Lent, because I have neither cloth nor money here. For I sent all the money I could gather from my own everywhere to England to friends, who spent all that money on cloths, and transported them to Antwerp, where they still are: nor do my friends dare to transfer them to Upper Germany because of the fierce wars, which God Almighty may soon deign to pacify for the sake of Christ our Lord and our hope. Amen. My wife greets you most carefully and your most pious wife, to whom I also give many thanks for her great services to us when we lived with you there. Your or Dr. Megander's wife wrote to my wife about something; and indeed we do not know what it should be. Therefore, I ask that they inform us of what they want, and it will be diligently taken care of by the next fair. I understood that they wanted to buy black linen (Gallers Swelche) here, unless it is much cheaper with you (as everyone says). I commend myself most humbly to Dr. Megander, Dr. Theodor Bibliander, and Dr. Pellican, and do not disdain to greet their wives in our name. Also, have me most officiously commended to Dr. Erasmus and his wife. And if in any matter I can serve you, my dearest lord, in return, command; you will find me most ready. However, I have not decided to write more to your kindness (as you know the reason): but now I am compelled because of your excellent gifts, and therefore I pray you to consider what I babble barbarously and ineptly as good. However, I beseech you for the Lord's sake, as much as is in you, to promote the cause of John Burcher, our brother and compatriot, before your council, about which Butler, my brother and beloved and dear to you, recently wrote from Basel to your piety.</p>
      <p>After the Frankfurt fair, I have not received any news from England. However, at that time (as I asked Peter Hürtzel to report to you) friends wrote to me that a war had suddenly arisen between the Scots and our people, which was said to have begun on the northern borders of England and the southern borders of Scotland; whether by our people or the Scots, it is not certainly known: they excuse and accuse each other. Moreover, it is certain that because of a certain Scottish incursion, in which some of our people were killed, our king threatened to declare war on the Scot shortly. The Scot did not gladly hear this, but sent envoys to England to continue the peace. The king agreed to peace under these conditions (as is said by our people): if the king of Scotland (as was done by some of his predecessors) would in each of our parliaments pay honor to the king and his successors, as to his superior and to a higher potentate: if he would promise to depose the Roman pontiff with his monks as soon as he could, and admit our superstition in other matters (which you know well) into his region: then if he would take care to satisfy our king for the damages received in the northern part of the region, and for the great expenses he then made in preparing soldiers by land and a fleet of ships by sea. For while these things were being negotiated between these monarchs in August and September, everything necessary for war was being prepared by both. In short, the Scot refused almost all those conditions except for a certain sum of money, which he granted to the king of England for renewing peace and for the expenses made. Then the king, trusting more in chariots and horses (as I fear) and in the multitude of men than in the name of God, sent into Scotland more than one hundred and twenty thousand men; which (as I last received by letters from England at the end of November) has returned again from Scotland: but the reason why it returned was then kept so secretly among the nobles that it was not known to the common people among us. Meanwhile, it is reported here by those who trade in France that our people suffered a slaughter of 14,000 men in Scotland. But how truly they say this I am still uncertain, although I suspect something like this happened from conjecture. I know you have heard almost all these things from our John Burcher before: for I informed him of them as they happened. However, lest you think I have consigned your desire to oblivion or negligence, I have thought it worthwhile to write to you about the same things (who have deserved so well of me in many things).</p>
      <p>Recently God took from me through my two or three debtors, who (as I hear from England) have failed, and through another occasion, about 200 florins, perhaps all the sooner because I am not there myself to look after my affairs: but let this be said to the stone. Moreover, I have now promised within a month to give annually (if God does not take everything from me) a certain sum of money to some foreigners, who recently came here, expelled from their homeland for Christ's sake: so that now I cannot spend as much for the poor exiles as I would have gladly done from my heart if you had desired this from me. Nevertheless, do not cease, I pray, to remind me of my duty, and you will find me ready to the best of my ability. For I know you will not ask that I give to the poor out of necessity but out of abundance. And I know what Paul desires from the rich in 1 Timothy 6, and what Christ everywhere. However, the flesh, forgetful of divine and heavenly things, and greedy and tenacious of earthly things, cannot be too much reminded of its duty. Therefore, for me (because this is also useful to others) write whatever you want freely. However, I hope to bear exhortation and admonition as is fitting. Farewell in Christ Jesus, and live happily for God: and love your Richard, as you are accustomed. Strasbourg, December 18, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, R. HILLES, Englishman.</p>
