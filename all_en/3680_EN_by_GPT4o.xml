      <p>Greetings. Your letter, reverend father in Christ, has been faithfully delivered to me.</p>
      <p>It is so far from being necessary for you to excuse yourself to me for the interruption of letters, that I cannot sufficiently marvel that you can be so attentive towards me amidst your many occupations. Certainly, because your health is of great concern to me, I would prefer you to write to me either never or more rarely rather than hear that you are being worn down and weakened by labors. I know what your affairs are, of which I do not bear even a tenth part, and yet I often reluctantly approach writing.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless your labors and lead them to a happy and peaceful harbor someday. I have not heard a word about the Turkish fleet before, nor is it so surprising that the envoy has said nothing about these matters, as the alliance of the Turks with the French has long been suspected by many. When I was writing this, I did not have the opportunity to meet the envoy, not because his doors are not open to me, but because I deliberately refrain from his company as much as I can. There is a man in my vicinity, more learned in Greek than in Latin, who knows the common Greek language as well as his native tongue, if we believe him and others, who has been in the service of his king in those regions for several years. Since he is very courteous and often speaks familiarly among friends about foreign matters he has seen and known, and since he greatly desires the company of learned men, I would visit him more frequently if other more serious reasons did not hold me back. If I can conveniently do so, I will go to him today, and if he has any news, I will not hesitate to inquire from him, as he has already willingly provided us with his assistance in this matter. It is certain that two Christian brothers have been taken away by Spanish rabies; however, the full story has not reached me. I will ensure that we have it from the Italian brothers who preach the gospel in Valtellina. Our other consul, Ambrosius Marti, behaves very badly.</p>
      <p>He has married his daughter to a man of the papal religion, whose brother is a primary enemy of our religion. This is the Thumprabst family of the Salic family.</p>
      <p>The brother of the prelate consul therefore received the daughter of the consul into the prelate's house within the bishop's enclosure. From the time the marriage was celebrated, the consul's daughter has diligently attended all the masses and has never come to the sermon in the meantime. Therefore, the religion she imbibed from her earliest years, she unlearned in one day.</p>
      <p>It is astonishing how much the priests exult in this act, and how much good and pious men are offended in turn. Thus the consul beautifully revealed who he was, although he had been remarkably slippery before, he was never considered sincere in religion, having long had the Tschudis and the abbot of Faveria, to whom he is related by affinity, as his teachers. It is so far from being the case that he and his faction are planning anything against the bishopric, that they most of all wish it to be safe and unharmed; they are maintaining it for the Thumprabst. They will hardly wait for the death of this bishop; but whether it will be advisable for them, God knows well. However, we can no longer remain silent, even if we have to endure the greatest envy.</p>
      <p>May God, whose ministers we are, turn these things to the benefit of His church! He must be depicted in his true colors, lest his hypocrisy, which is remarkable, subvert the whole church; for you already know how great his wealth is, how many clients he has. I experience more and more every day how full of danger and trouble this function is; but the path I have once entered must be completed. Little has been achieved so far with ease and modesty.</p>
      <p>We see that the papists have become stubborn through our indulgence, and our own people somewhat more remiss. Now we must sail with full sails, no longer lingering on the shore.</p>
      <p>One thing especially troubles me, that I am too far from you, in whose faithful and paternal counsel I would often find rest. I inquired about the Turkish fleet from the envoy, who responds as follows: it is true that the Turks have plundered two villages in Calabria and taken away about six thousand people, and indeed they cannot deny that they serve the king (not indeed at his expense); but the king was so aggrieved by this very act that he complained about it to the Turkish emperor through the envoy. For it was agreed between the Turk and the Frenchman that where banners with white crosses were raised, the Turkish fleet would not attack. But the Turkish soldier acted contrary, and since Calabria especially favors the Frenchman and did not prepare against hostile incursions, relying on the promises of the Frenchman that if banners or signs were seen by the Turks, they would be left untouched, it nevertheless suffered great damage. The Turkish fleet intended to call at Marseille, but the king forbade it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it has completely departed (nothing is more certain than this) after first exacting sixty thousand crowns from the Genoese, who were very concerned about the port of Savona. When I shared these things with Mr. Philip, he added that he had heard from Italians passing through here that the Turkish soldier had turned back with great indignation. The envoy said that both armies were not far from each other and that Philip's soldier indeed demanded battle, while the French were waiting, not provoking, because in Philip's camp there is a greater shortage of all things than to be able to wage war, whereas in the French camp there is a great abundance of provisions. Moreover, the French camp lies on the Seine (perhaps he misspoke, it might well be the Somme river) in a great advantage, which he will not easily give up. However, the Frenchman has a new French camp in preparation, about thirty thousand (he is now assembling these forces from the French who serve the Frenchman at his expense), so that, whatever happens, something may be put in the way of the enemy. This is what the envoy said.</p>
      <p>I would write more if I had more paper, etc. Farewell happily, reverend father in Christ, with all yours.</p>
      <p>Chur, 22nd of August, in the year 1558.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his lord and patron, to be greatly honored.</p>
