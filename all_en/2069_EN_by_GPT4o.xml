      <p>S. No friend has yet written to me about what happened with Servetus; however, from other reliable sources, indeed from eyewitnesses, I have learned that on October 27th he suffered the punishment of his blasphemies by fire. He persisted in his errors until death and did not spare the most holy Trinity, but blasphemed it even at the stake, calling it a three-headed beast. Farellus was present at his execution, I do not know if he was summoned for this, whom I hope will soon send me the whole story. If I receive it, I will share it with you as well, although in the meantime I do not doubt at all that the entire action will be published in print.</p>
      <p>Regarding other news, it is reported here that Schertli is in Augsburg and has again received his dominion in Burtenbach intact, thanks to King Ferdinand, whose side he now seems to follow. The same is reported here about the convened assembly as with you. Margrave Albrecht, having made peace with Augustus, is again hostile to the Nurembergers, recovers his territory occupied by them, and they are in greater danger than ever before. It is also reported that all the controversy between Johann Friedrich and Augustus, the Dukes of Saxony, has been settled, and Johann Friedrich has regained all his former possessions, with only the matter of the electorate still pending the judgment of the imperial estates.</p>
      <p>We have nothing from France, nor have any letters reached me that should be forwarded to you. I will take care of yours to Calvin today. I will send our response to you shortly; I will ensure it is copied, as you requested; you, as you promise, also share the Basilians'. Farewell with all yours, whom I wish well, as well as all the lords, brothers, and fellow ministers. Our people also greet you. Today the market is quite busy here, which prevents me from writing more. Given on the day called Martin's Day 1553. In Bern.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his venerable lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
