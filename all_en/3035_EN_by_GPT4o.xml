      <p>Greetings. A courier has arrived here for you, most excellent man, who presented himself to me more eagerly than I had hoped, so that I might inform you about the storms that are newly emerging.</p>
      <p>Our couriers report that the King of France, as soon as he noticed that the Emperor had set sail, indicated through envoys to his son, the Prince of Spain, that he should recall the Duke of Alba, the commander of the war, from Italy and order the troops to be withdrawn from the papal cities.</p>
      <p>And he showed, with as much elegance as he could, how unjustly he had brought war upon the church's parties, when he demonstrated his duty of reverence towards the papal dignity, unless he immediately refrained from such impiety, he would take action from the common alliance; for it pertains to his duty and piety not to allow any harm to be inflicted on the ecclesiastical seat through his negligence, but in every event to expose his life to the utmost danger for the benefit of public utility and worship. But if he does not desist from his unjust undertaking, he will join forces with him with a more willing spirit, as he supports a more just cause, which relies solely on piety. The king's prudence and cunning in delaying this until the Emperor's departure is evident from the fact that he did not want it to be said that he had violated the truce, but preferred to seize the opportunity to attack an unprepared enemy, deprived of paternal strength. For the father often led the princes of the empire into the common risk of war with him, whose power the king never thought should be provoked without reason, but often hired mercenary forces for support. The rest, which may emerge from this, you can easily understand with your wisdom.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and please commend me to Mr. Gesner, my intimate patron, with better knowledge, and excuse the paternal medicines, as we have now been absent from home for more than a full month.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, 12th October 1556.</p>
      <p>Devoted to your kindness in all things, Raphael Sailer.</p>
      <p>If you know of anyone even stern, whom we could appoint to William in France, please let me know soon, I pray.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the sacred ministry, his master and friend, to be honored with perpetual respect. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
