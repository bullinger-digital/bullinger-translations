      <p>S. The bitterness of the grief I felt from the death of the best parent, Mr. Calvin, was such that in my sorrow I could write nothing to you, most illustrious man. For the death of such a great man wounded my spirit so much that it would be unbelievable to me, unless I seriously experienced it, that it could so greatly increase my sadness, when the thought of that man to whom I was entirely bound comes to mind.</p>
      <p>But since it seemed so to our God, it is right that we bear with moderation whatever He has decreed: otherwise, there would be no end or limit to mourning. Moreover, you remember, I think, what I once wrote to you about this man's letters, and what I asked of you. I therefore ask, when it is necessary and I have informed you, that you would deign to help us in this matter.</p>
      <p>For we wish, if it is possible, that whatever letters were written by him be published. For from them the man's genius and learning, and indeed how great he was, will become evident.</p>
      <p>But this will not yet be undertaken.</p>
      <p>As for news, there is nothing else to write except that the king entered Lyon the day before yesterday, and with his arrival, what all the pious feared happened, namely that the public preaching of the gospel, which was flourishing there, was forbidden.</p>
      <p>The queen mother claims the edict by which it is prohibited to hold sacred sermons wherever the king is present. But Mr. Beza will explain everything more fully.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I ask you, most illustrious man, that in your kindness you would have these two boys, born of a pious and noble father and sent there for studies, recommended and kept in discipline.</p>
      <p>Because I hope you will gladly do this, I will not discuss this matter with you further. Farewell, then.</p>
      <p>May the Lord always be with you, guide you with His spirit, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Brother Budaeus and the rest of the friends greet you. Geneva, June 14, 1564.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, your most observant. I am sending you certain letters addressed to you from France, which I received from a certain friend three days ago. If they require any response and you send it to me, I will ensure it is safely delivered.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
