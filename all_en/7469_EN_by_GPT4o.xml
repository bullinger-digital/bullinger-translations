      <p>Greetings. I have added these few things to Mr. Cognetius's letter, by which you will know that, by the grace of God, I am well and wish you very much health. This one new thing is written to me: the Queen of Scotland, with the help of certain nobles, has escaped from the prison where she was detained and fled to a well-fortified town, where she awaits assistance. That Flemish tumult seems to me to have neither head nor tail so far; yet it is hardly likely that such a dark cloud will pass without consequence.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Mr. Gwalter here will know that I wish him very much health. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 27th of May, 1568.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, P[omponne] de Bellièvre.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
