      <p> Greetings. Honorable lord and father, the situation in these lands is such that we are in great need of the lords of the Confederates, and I am exceedingly glad of their presence; for in these developments, many hearts have been revealed, and many and various opinions have been heard. Our lords, the Confederates, have dispatched the captain from Zurich along with the captain from Lucerne with letters to the Engadin, where four companies are to be together. There, they await a response. </p>
      <p> Here in Chur, there is great preparation. </p>
      <p> I believe my lord mayor of Cham will send a copy of the letter to Zurich. Yesterday, a new oath was sworn here. </p>
      <p> May God grant grace and bring everything to a good end. Given in Chur, the 24th of March, in the year of our Lord 1565. </p>
      <p> The lords, the Confederates, are acting with particularly great seriousness, and they hope that the matter will be resolved by rightful means; they expect a reasonable response from the people of the Engadin. </p>
      <p> I always doubt what fairness can be expected from people who are ignorant of law and justice. </p>
