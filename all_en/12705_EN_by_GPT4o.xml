    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger is thanked for his important letter [No. 2653], and in general for his tireless reporting!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Regarding the [book about] the Spanish Inquisition ["New Tidings from the Netherlands"], the people of Basel have not seen more than Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] A relative of [Andreas] Vesalius, [Michael Martin Stella], who stayed for a while with [Johannes] Oporinus, recently wanted to visit his relatives [in "Belgium"]. He came to his brother [Johannes Martin], who, on behalf of Emperor [Charles V], arrested those suspected of Lutheranism and handed them over to the judges. When [Johannes Martin] saw his brother, he asked him what he was doing there, whether he did not know that he [was a heretic], and then disappeared. Then a house servant led [...] [Michael] into a living room, where a letter from their father [Johannes Martin the Elder] lay on the table. [Michael] recognized the handwriting, opened the letter, and read the father's request to [Johannes] to arrest [Michael] and imprison him in a monastery forever, to spare the family the disgrace of a burning! Exactly what Christ predicted, namely that fathers would betray their sons! [Michael] told this twice.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Two merchants from Constance [...] came to Basel on November 1st. One reported to Gregor Mangolt that in a proper battle about 9000 imperial troops had fallen, including [Gian Giacomo de' Medici, Castellan] of Musso, [Eriprando Madruzzo], the brother of the Bishop of Trent [Cristoforo], the younger of Büren [Lamoral of Egmont], and some significant Italian [...]. Additionally, on the Danube, the emperor's ships, bridges, and rafts were successfully destroyed. However, the Basel council could not verify this, so Myconius began to doubt the truth of the news. When later the other merchant was with him and told the same story, Bullinger's letter arrived. It contained nothing of the sort! So Myconius said: That's not true! And all those present immediately demanded the punishment of the braggart.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [Hieronymus] Gunz told the terrible news about the Württemberg traitor [..., postmaster of Ebersbach]. Bullinger will also have heard it from Gunz during his transit in Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Yesterday a Nuremberger [...] reported that the emperor was found dead in his tent one morning. Myconius replied: Yes, indeed! Believe it who will!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] However, the return of the younger Duke [Christoph] of Württemberg from France is confirmed. King [Francis I] is said to be very well-disposed towards Germany. If the "dirty academy" [Sorbonne] would allow it, he would indeed convert to the evangelical faith!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Nüssli from Einsiedeln announced in Basel that he would rather become imperial than adhere to the Four [Protestant] Cantons and their faith. For the Nine Cantons cannot tolerate in the long run that they orient themselves towards the [German Protestants]! Immediately someone [...] rebuked Nüssli for this unpatriotic and unwise statement. But he stuck to it. Myconius suspects the reason for this annoyance. Some money hunters [i.e., Inner Swiss] feel sidelined because the King of France is courting [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse and the German [Protestants]. Therefore, they wish for [financial] support from a new lord. But they will not find such a fool as Francis I again. In their eyes, the Zurichers and their [faith] allies [Basel, Bern, Schaffhausen, and the Protestant allied places] are to blame for everything. Hence their rage and the danger that they could even bring about the downfall of all Helvetia! So they must be closely watched to prevent something bad from happening, as in the last [the Second Kappel] war!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Pope [Paul III] is said to have informed the emperor that he would no longer provide financial assistance because he achieved nothing with the 200,000 guilders lent to him. This was told by a nobleman [...], who attended the wedding of [Ludwig] von Reischach with Myconius yesterday.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Greetings to the family and to [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>

      <p>S. I give thanks to my Lord, who through you ensures that I am not ignorant of those things which are worth knowing. I also give you as much thanks as I can for being so diligent in this ministry! May the Lord Jesus keep you, so that you may continue to do what you do for as long and as happily as possible.</p>

      <p>You have the Spanish Inquisition, just as we have seen it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I believe you do not yet have this: Vesalius has a relative who stayed for a while with Oporinus. In recent months, he wanted to visit his parents, brothers, and sisters to see how they felt about him. He came to his brother, who is one of those whom the emperor has entrusted to arrest and bring before the judges anyone who is or is suspected of being a Lutheran. At first sight, he greeted him thus: "What are you doing here? Do you not know who you are?" and immediately left. He had a servant who led our man into a certain room and pointed out letters placed on the table. When he saw them, he immediately recognized his father's handwriting, opened it, and found it written in this way: "Dear son, you know what your duty is, and therefore, arrest him yourself and send him to the monastery, and order that he be put in eternal imprisonment. It is better that you do this than for another to arrest him and publicly burn him to the disgrace of our family." But the father will hand over the son to death, etc. You see the truth of Christ! He, to whom these things happened, told me twice.</p>

      <p>On the first of November, two merchants from Constance came here, one of whom came to Gregor Mangolt announcing: A just battle was fought and about 9000 of the adversaries were slain, among them the lord of Musso and the brother of the Bishop of Trent and the younger of Büren and a certain great man from Italy. Moreover, the ships, bridges, and rafts made by the imperial forces on the Danube were scattered and destroyed by our forces, and everything was done successfully. The rumor immediately spread throughout the city. The senate investigated and found nothing else. Meanwhile, while certainty was awaited, the rumor vanished. Thus, from great joy to sadness! I could not believe it, for when the other was already with me, I said, indicating, your letters have arrived, which, because they contained nothing of it, I immediately said: "It is nothing!" A great clamor from everyone: "Such a braggart should be punished!"</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Gunz told me terrible things about the Württemberg traitor. Since he passed through your area, there is no doubt that he also told you the same.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Yesterday someone from Nuremberg brought news that the emperor was found dead in his tent one morning. I: Dead indeed! Let him believe it who will! This is also insidious! I write these rumors only so that you may know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The truth: The younger Duke of Württemberg has returned from the French king and announces his good and favorable disposition towards Germany. I fear most that he may eventually become evangelical, provided the muddy academy allows it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Nüssli from Einsiedeln passed through here. And while he was sitting among some good citizens and conversations were being held about the current state of affairs, he spoke thus: "If I wanted to join the four cities and their faith, I would rather become imperial! And they are somewhat involved; the nine places cannot endure it." Someone replied: "These words are not Swiss! It is strange that you speak so imprudently!" But he persisted. In summary: I seem to smell what is troubling them. The money hunters understand that the French king is courting Hesse and other Germans, and they will eventually be rejected. Therefore, they wish to have another lord who would support them as he has done so far. For this reason, they are so tumultuous, and because they think that the cause of the evils they imagine is you and those allied with you. Moved by an emotion that is not good, indeed completely insane, they speak what is not fitting. And it may happen that through madness they may attempt something that would lead to the ruin of all Helvetia. But if I were to guess: They will not find such a fool as the French king has been so far, who would support their leisure and all their petulance. These things will end with the French king! Therefore, their plans must be diligently investigated, lest anything happen, as in the recent war, without consultation. May the Lord provide!</p>

      <p>Yesterday a certain nobleman said to me at the wedding of Lord Rischach: "The pope sent to the emperor: He has sent two hundred thousand crowns so far; henceforth he will send nothing, because nothing has been done by him for so long." Let it be done as it pleases the Lord.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Farewell with your family and Rudolf always. Basel, November 4, 1546. Yours, Os. Myc.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zurichers, my most venerable brother and lord in Christ.</p>
