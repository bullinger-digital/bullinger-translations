      <p>Otthainrich, by the grace of God, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke in Lower and Upper Bavaria, etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings beforehand, highly learned, dear friend. We have received and noted your letter along with two copies of the "Ephome Bibliothecae" and two printed sermons from your brother-in-law Hanns Jacob Adlsweiler from Nollingen.</p>
      <p>As much as it concerns your brother-in-law, we intend, especially at your request, to continue to support him no less than before. We have already made representations on his behalf to the Roman royal majesty so that he may be appeased (although, since their majesty is currently burdened with many other affairs, things are progressing slowly), and we will again solicit and show him our gracious favor.</p>
      <p>Secondly, we thank you not only for the aforementioned sermons you sent, which we intend to read diligently, but also for the two copies sent on behalf of your son-in-law, Mr. Josias Simler (which dedication), and we are particularly pleased with the work itself, very graciously.</p>
      <p>And if Mr. Simler, as we hear, will write to us upon his arrival, we will also graciously thank him and acknowledge this favorably towards you and him. Dated Neuburg, April 1st, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Otthainrich, Count Palatine, has signed.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich.</p>
