    <p xml:id="regest1">Requests to advocate for the stay of [Johannes] Fries in Basel until a replacement can be found for him. Regarding the Concord discussions in Schmalkalden, where the Bundestag clearly condemned the Pope and his council and rejected aid to the Turks, Strasbourg will report; as much as possible, the unity [of the Protestants] must already be improved. Warns, with reference to the events in Bern, against taking a harsh stance against Bucer, as this could endanger the unification. As for Melchior [Wirz], he will report himself.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is very inconvenient to let Fries go now; all of our people singularly and vehemently love the man and greatly benefit from him, nor is there anyone now who can suffice in his place. Therefore, you render all our plans uncertain. If I could achieve anything with you through prayers, I would strongly ask you to assign that task to another, at least for a while, until we find someone else. I would not write this to you unless necessity compelled me. For why should I oppose your affairs, or why should I delay that benefit of yours, which I myself wish to promote to the best of my ability? But the situation with us is such now that I do not think there is anywhere in the world a more excellent use of Fries nor a place more necessary for him to remain. Therefore, I ask you, if you can do anything with them, ensure that he stays.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Schmalkalden assembly and the discussion of our concord, you will soon understand everything in detail; for the council of Strasbourg will write extensively about everything to your council. The demands of the Emperor and the Pope were answered with such great freedom that I do not believe it could have been more severe. The Pope was openly pronounced the Antichrist, and the council he is planning was declared a betrayal and overthrow of the Gospel with the unanimous consent of the entire assembly, and this was done in the presence of the delegation of both parties. Indeed, what we should expect thereafter can be easily conjectured. Aid to the Turks was denied; I think because it seems to be aimed not so much at the Turks as against us, if anything succeeds for those men. Indeed, if there was ever a time full of wondrous events, this is it, I believe. The greatest difficulty still is that we ourselves are not yet sufficiently united. Therefore, I ask you by the faith of Christ and the public interest of the fatherland, to be willing to work on how we might unite in spirit, if not yet in doctrine in all respects.</p>
      <p>If the brothers think anything should be done with Bucer, no one will oppose; let it be done with Christian gentleness and moderation. If that recent fire in Bern had taken its course, I ask, at such an unfavorable time, what harm would it have caused us! For what good man would ever bear us, if, while peace is being negotiated, we would rush to arms even beyond the provocation of law? As I have often written to you and them: Our cause is intact for us, only let us ensure that we do not seem to have failed the church's concord.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, his Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You will learn about Melchior and his affairs from him directly.</p>
