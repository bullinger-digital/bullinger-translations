    <p xml:id="regest1">Still waiting for a response; after learning that the cost of living in T端bingen would exceed his means, he has remained in Basel. Does not understand why he was forbidden to take work from strangers, when he would be more dependent on it than others. Greetings. Bullinger should send the requested [books] with the messenger.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have long been waiting for a response from you, most kind father, so that I may know for certain what should be decided regarding my affairs, although a more extensive response would not be necessary unless I were indeed hindered by other truly arduous and significant causes. For I am by no means unaware of how much duty and obedience I owe to the leaders of our college (especially to you, who have always been like a father to me). But as they say, we do what we can when we cannot do what we want. I am indeed prepared to comply with this calling of yours, by which you proposed the school in T端bingen to me, not so much hindered by the advice of others (to whom, if not much, I certainly owe something) as by my own necessity, I will by no means be able to execute the intended plan. Letters have indeed come to our companions, who live here with me, from T端bingen from Wolphius and others, which do not condemn the manner of the school, but show the cost of living to be intolerable for me. For at the cheapest price at which one can live there, no one can live on less than 26 florins.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, a bed must be rented, as well as accommodation, the total of which will almost reach the sum of 34 florins, as you yourself can judge. Even if the stipend for Pentecost and autumn is sent now, it will nonetheless be impossible for me to live in T端bingen on 17 florins from now until Christmas. Therefore, persuaded by the advice of very learned men, I have decided to remain in Basel, unless it seems otherwise to you; even if it does, it is impossible for me to act otherwise, being surrounded by this lack of money. Therefore, I ask you to write to me through this messenger what you think is best.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I am also quite troubled by what you wrote to Lausanne when I consulted you about the Genevan merchant and printer; you seemed to write back to me in general not to place my work with strangers.</p>
      <p>However, I would like you yourself to consider, and you will find it necessary either to offer my work to strangers or to have a larger stipend or perhaps to beg, which I do not think would please you at all. I will still rely on your advice, as long as I understand that I am of concern to you and that I am not denied what has been granted to all others far wealthier than me.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and mother and the whole family in my name. Farewell, dearest father, and keep me recommended to you.</p>
      <p>Please send through this messenger what I requested in previous letters, if he does not refuse the burden.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 8, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly,</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed father. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
