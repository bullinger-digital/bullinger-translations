    <p xml:id="regest1">Contrary to Bullinger's assurance, a request has also been made in the name of Zurich to Bern and Basel to allow the pursuit of [Hans and Rudolf] Roggenbach in their territory; this has been confirmed by the Basel city clerk [Heinrich Ryhiner] to [Werner] Beyel, and it also emerges from a decision made in Baden, and Bern has informed its people in the city and countryside according to the enclosed copy. Bullinger should, if necessary, prompt the Zurich council to issue a correction. Bern has decided to relieve Geneva with 6000 men, as the Castellan of Musso is reportedly advancing on the city; also [in Aargau], troops have been summoned to Bern for Friday. [Enclosure:] The mayor, councilors, and citizens of Bern remind their people in the city and countryside of the decrees from August 28 and September 5, which apparently have not been adhered to, as Solothurn has complained at the Baden Diet and obtained a letter from the Ten Places demanding the opening of the borders for the pursuers of the [Solothurn "bandits"]. Bern has rejected this and offered justice; the authorities order the preparation of any possible resistance and compliance with the previous letters.</p>

      <p>My friendly, good-willed service at all times beforehand.</p>
      <p>Gracious sir, as you wrote to me recently about the Roggenbach matter, how your lords, our dear confederates from Zurich, never consented to allow the mentioned Roggenbach to be pursued on their territory by the Solothurners or others in their name, likewise, such was not intended for my lords of Bern nor Basel, etc. Now it has happened, as I was in Basel these days, that the city clerk of Basel and I presented all this to your city clerk, Biel of Zurich. To which he earnestly (as you also did to me) excused his lords and claimed it did not happen, as he could still prove with the instruction. To which the city clerk of Basel frankly said, it did happen and they did not return from Baden with any other decision, and his lords of Basel were not a little displeased by such intentions, etc. Now, who and where the fault lies, I cannot know; for such has come to my lords as well as to the Baslers, and also my lords have informed their people in the city and countryside, as you can learn from the following copy, which I send to you with good intentions. Therefore, if it pleases you, consider me kindly, if it did not happen by your lords, that you ensure that they excuse themselves in writing in a friendly manner to my lords. However, whatever you wish in this matter, do so; for I have also opened this to you with good intentions as my particularly good trusted lord and friend. Herewith, may God always protect you.</p>
      <p>Given on Tuesday before St. Sebastian's Day in the year 36.</p>
      <p>Your always good-willed benefactor</p>
      <p>Sulpitius Haller, bailiff of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>Knowing that today a message has come from our gracious lords, who intend to march with 6000 men and immediately proceed to Geneva to relieve it. For certain messages have come to them, how the castellan of Musso is advancing on Geneva. Therefore, today they have also summoned those here to be in Bern by Friday night, etc. May God grant us His grace. Amen, etc.</p>
      <p>The mayor, council, and citizens of Bern. Our greetings beforehand, honorable, dear, faithful ones. You have not forgotten what we wrote to you first on the 28th of this past August, then on the 5th of this month, regarding the Roggenbachs and their accomplices. However, as it seems to us, it will not be followed, as our confederates and fellow citizens of Solothurn have complained at the recently held day in Baden and have called upon our confederates from the Ten Places, namely Zurich, Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug, Glarus, Fribourg, Schaffhausen, and Appenzell, who have now written to us earnestly with a request that we allow, when the mentioned Roggenbach and their accomplices are driven out beyond our territory and retreat to our land, that those who pursue them may capture them on our territory and hand them over to us. Which, for various reasons, especially unrest, we are not willing to allow. And on such, we have written to our confederates from the aforementioned Ten Places, also Solothurn, with the indication that we will leave it entirely to our answers, to days and otherwise; but if anyone is not satisfied with this, we are willing to be legally accountable for it, as we have also offered them. If it should happen that they request us further, not to satisfy the legal dispute, etc., but intend to use force against us, we would have to stand with the help of our own. You should inform our people with you, prepare and hold themselves accordingly, and nevertheless comply with our writing, regarding the Roggenbach matter sent to you.</p>
      <p>Given on the 27th of September in the year etc. 35.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word and the church in the greater Zurich, my trusted lord and particularly good friend.</p>
