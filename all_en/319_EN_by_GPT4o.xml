      <p>In Konstanz, things are getting worse with every passing day, with all sorts of frivolity in gluttony, drinking, gambling, blasphemy, fornication, dancing, in which a large part of the citizens are also involved, and everything is increasing daily, as if one wanted to make up for everything that has been neglected so far through good discipline. To the Lord God in the highest heaven, it is lamented, etc.</p>
      <p>Some citizens are also being recruited as mercenaries; however, those from Switzerland are not to be admitted to this by order of the commander.</p>
      <p>The commander, Niklaus von BÃ¼lach, of noble birth, has a countess as a wife, and he has also been made a baron, having once been French, a very quick-witted man, who has already grasped all the opportunities of the entire city with all its income and expenses from the least to the greatest in his head, and also wonderfully investigates the affairs and conditions of the citizens and individual persons, about which a book could be written. He is almost above Julius Caesar, the dictator, etc., but a grim man; he does not drink any wine, lest he becomes completely unreasonable.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, a council envoy, now a person, namely Hans Mundbrot, will ride to the king, etc., along with a scribe; he is to negotiate for the relaxation of the arrest, for the lifting of the ban, and for the king to represent the city against priests and all who have claims against it, along with some other similar articles. But they do not consider the pious who have left, nor do they desire any preaching or anything concerning religion. Oh God from heaven, what great lamentation! And the common man is prepared, they will be given a preacher, and they have applied for it. This envoy is a completely inexperienced man, who is not at all suitable for such matters, etc. But there is no one at home. The commander could not find anyone in the council whom he could entrust with this, and this one is also not suitable for the matter in any way.</p>
      <p>Oh, how often must this government be ashamed! But so it must and shall go; it is God's just judgment.</p>
      <p>Main points of the oath: to have and recognize the king as a hereditary lord for eternity; to adhere to whatever his majesty undertakes in the old Christian religion; not to make any alliances with anyone; to be obedient to all the king's mandates henceforth; to allow oneself to be used in military campaigns.</p>
      <p>Many nobles and priests have been in the city, inspecting their houses and estates. I know from undertakings among them that they are all very dissatisfied that the city is royal. Some among them say: since those from Konstanz did not know how to harm the priests further, they have become royal; they have made a rod over their own backs and the priests', which they will not rejoice in either part.</p>
      <p>All the goods of those who have left have been seized, inventoried, and everyone has been ordered under oath to report everything. They are taking all sorts of things from their houses, and it is expected that they must come for everything they have in the city and on the other land, and there is no loyalty towards the pious people who have done nothing but what was commanded to them, indeed much less than many others who now have it good. God have mercy on the dear, good people here and eternally!</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
