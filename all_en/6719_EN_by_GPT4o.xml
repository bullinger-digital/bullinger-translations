      <p>Greetings. After it happened by the marvelous providence and singular grace of God that the ministers of all the churches in Switzerland and the Grisons agreed on that confession, which you have seen before and in which you also agreed with us, it seemed good to publish it with a preface set forth in the name of all of us. We pray that this may be happy and prosperous, with our Lord Jesus Christ blessing our labors. You have already understood the response of the people of Basel, whose letters we sent copied to our Mr. Haller. We were ordered to send 12 copies to you, so that you may distribute them among yourselves and among the principal senators. We have done everything with the common counsel of our magistrate, at whose public expense this matter has finally been completed. It remains, most esteemed lords and dearest brothers, that we first give great thanks to our Lord God for this our harmonious agreement, and then that we diligently implore His help, so that He may continue to bless our labors and make our confession bring forth much good fruit.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend men, most esteemed lords, and dearest brothers. Pray for us and let us love one another with sincere charity.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 12, 1566.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger wrote this in the name of all the pastors and ministers of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>We have sent such letters to Bern, Geneva, Biel, and Chur.</p>
