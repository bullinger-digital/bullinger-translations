    <p xml:id="regest1">Explains why he refused the examination to two preachers who wanted to be examined by him on the suggestion of the Abbot [of St. Gallen, Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee] after consulting with the authorities; in the presence of Johannes Kessler, he explained to them that no innovation was desired and that the pastors of the county [Toggenburg] should continue to be examined as before [by the Toggenburg Synod in Lichtensteig?]. A copy of the letter from the Confederates [dated April 29 to the Imperial Estates, RTA JR XV/3 1049-1052, No. 124] has already been sent by the council [to the council of St. Gallen] [on May 1, ZÃ¼rich StA, B IV 15, 71v.]; there are no other news. Apologizes for not being able to properly receive Kessler, who has promising sons. [At Christoph Froschauer's] Zwingli's works are being prepared for printing in four volumes, the German ones in Latin translation by [Rudolf] Gwalther - a highly useful work, but a biography of Zwingli is still missing; urgently requests such a biography from Vadian on behalf of the entire college, intends to provide him with the necessary materials for it and is satisfied if it is completed by Christmas; if desired, it can also be published without the author's name.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God. Highly learned, pious, prudent, and wise, especially trusted, beloved lord and brother, two men from the house of God have come to me and requested to be examined, as the Abbot of St. Gallen has instructed them. And so that you do not think, if it has not happened, that one would not want to do anything for anyone's love and service, etc., I want to inform you how the matter stands. When they asked me for the examination, I replied: we are solely appointed examiners by our G. H. and it is not proper for us to examine strangers behind a mayor; however, I will present the matter to the lord mayor. And when I discussed with the lords, I gave them (the 2 envoys) this answer in the presence of Mr. Hans Kessler: we will not burden ourselves with foreign preachers, not because we do not want to serve other churches, but because we do not want innovations in churches and do not want to assume the power to appoint ministers to other churches. And since preachers have been appointed in the county and there are still preachers there: where they have been examined and appointed so far, we will let it remain so, etc.</p>
      <p>A copy of the Helvetic letter was sent by the senate; for the scribe reported it to me; otherwise, I would have sent it to you through him. We have nothing new otherwise. A most welcome guest, Mr. Johannes Kessler, came to us, embodying humanity and sincerity, to whom I wish it had been possible to provide what his candor and integrity deserved! He has sons who are truly worthy of him, young men of good hope. Otherwise, we have been entangled in countless affairs, so that it was not possible to treat him according to our heart's desire. But you will ask the man to consider our modesty and rusticity favorably. He will be a living letter to you. I could not write more. Farewell. Zurich, May 8, 1544. Your Heinrich Bullinger. All of Zwingli's works are now being prepared here, arranged in 4 volumes. The German ones are being translated into Latin by Mr. Gwalther; the work is becoming most elegant and useful. But one thing is missing for us, which you, most learned Vadian, can provide: the life of Zwingli. We implore you, Vadian, by all that is sacred and our friendship, not to fail us here. You are skilled in style and art. As for the matter and history: we will send you whatever we have about his life, and we do not burden you with an excessive task. If you complete it by Christmas, you have completed it early enough; if you do not want your name to be added, we will not add it. Everything will be done as you wish; just do not fail us, not only for us but for the excellent man now residing in heaven, to whom you owe this very thing by some right. The entire college pleads with you in the same words. Respond, I beseech you, and show yourself obedient to your most sincere friends. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Joachim Vadian, most worthy consul of the people of St. Gallen, his ever-honored lord.</p>
