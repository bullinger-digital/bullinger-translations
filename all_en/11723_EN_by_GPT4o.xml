    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's friendly support and is surprised that the long journey of the messenger [to Memmingen] did not incur higher costs. Will soon report details of the conflict orally; his opponent [Adam Heinricher] has left Bern and may be traveling to Schaffhausen, to Lindau to Benedikt Burgauer, or even to Memmingen, as he has been asked to name witnesses; Ritter awaits his - uncertain - return. Regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>I cannot commend your exceptional faith and utmost sincerity, which you have shown towards me in this severe trial of mine, as they deserve, much less can I offer thanks worthy of them, for you have proven true what is commonly said by everyone: a friend is seen in necessity. But I will not cease to intercede for you with the Lord, who is the rewarder, with constant prayers. Therefore, such a detailed account of expenses would not have been necessary, since I was prepared to spend even more, as I would not have thought that such a long journey could be completed with such a small stipend.</p>
      <p>Moreover, you would certainly like to understand the whole story, what has happened; but it is too lengthy. I intend to come to you soon and faithfully explain everything to you in person. I will only add this: the adversary secretly withdrew from the city, and I am completely unaware of where he has gone. For the Senate and the deacons ordered him to provide the proper names of the witnesses and the places where they lived, whom he intended to bring against me. He confessed that he knew no one. I suspect, therefore, that he has gone to Schaffhausen to inquire whether he can obtain anything about me, and then to Lindau to Benedikt Burgauer, who is conducting this affair, perhaps even to Memmingen. I will therefore await his return, which is uncertain; then I will come to you to narrate everything to you and the complete state of our church.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet all the brothers, especially Gaspar, in my name. October 19, 1542.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and brother.</p>
