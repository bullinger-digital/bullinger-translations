      <p>Greetings. At this hour, I have received this bundle of letters from Geneva through your messenger Knöulius. Beza did not seal his letters to you, so that I could inspect and read them; you will find them now secured with my seal. As for that Gentilis, he has not yet been brought here, nor did I know he had been apprehended before, although I was warned by someone that he had passed through here. I hope our magistrate will do what is appropriate, although not everyone is similarly disposed in such matters, nor do all understand the reality of the situation. Many also suffer from such a hatred of the Calvinist name that they fear it will be very advantageous to them by slandering it. As for us, we will do what befits the servants of Him whose glory he tramples; I know my brothers and fellow ministers will do the same. Since the time was too short for me (for your messenger wishes to depart now after lunch) to describe what is expedient for us, I have retained the confession of Johannes Paulus Alciatus and Valentinus Gentilis; I have also retained the propositions on God and the Trinity by Franciscus Davidis of Cluj and will send them transcribed tomorrow or the day after through my relative Georg Fierz [Fietz?] of Zurich, who is now here with us. Meanwhile, I have also received those which you sent through Mr. Gwalther's son to Solothurn; from there, the royal envoy transmitted them here through his own messenger along with his writings to me. Your cousin's son from Bruges also brought your other letters to me, which we will attend to here as soon as the opportunity and occasion present themselves. Farewell and kindly excuse the brevity, for which this messenger is the cause. I would like you to urge Mr. Steiger, Grafenried, and Mülinen (who will now be in Baden) in that matter of this Gentilis; I will do what I can.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 22, 1566.</p>
      <p>All the brothers greet you. Give my regards to all who are connected with you there. Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I expect to hear from you what the Rhaetians have responded to the proposed articles of peace and how matters stand there. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed and dear lord and compatriot. Zurich.</p>
