      <p>Greetings. I have nothing at present worthy of writing, except that the people of Rouen are competing in audacity and stubbornness with the Parisians.</p>
      <p>Therefore, one of the marshals has been sent to restrain their fury and ensure the safety of our people.</p>
      <p>It would not be difficult to quell all the tumults; indeed, they would subside on their own, if the queen did not secretly support them with her arts.</p>
      <p>She pretends otherwise; yet it is certain that through emissaries she acts in such a way that what has been openly decreed in the king's council is rendered null by the wickedness of worthless men.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the impunity of crimes sufficiently shows that she approves of whatever aims to oppress us.</p>
      <p>What the admiral is thinking, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I received letters from him, in which he only indicates to me and Beza that he will soon send a man on purpose, through whom he will inform us of his plan.</p>
      <p>However, from the letters of Subisius, who was with him, I infer that he is still avoiding the court, partly because he does not want to risk rashly, partly to avoid being compelled to undertake an expedition against the English.</p>
      <p>Count of Sausens, the prefect of Lyon, with whom I had no previous acquaintance, congratulates me on the peaceful state of the city; however, they stubbornly refuse to admit our provincials; they will eventually have to be subdued by arms, and despair drives them headlong.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, my sincerely revered brother. Many greetings to all colleagues, to your wife and the whole family.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you all safe!</p>
      <p>Geneva, July 29, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>Your Ionville respectfully and sincerely greets you.</p>
