    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter and regrets the work and effort it causes him [due to the wedding of Samuel Wyttenbach and Küngold von Schönau]; there is no reason to worry about the article [of the marriage contract] concerning [the inheritance rights] of the sons; the opposition to the wedding was in vain; he will report everything to him when they meet [in Zurich]. The wedding party, which will arrive on Saturday [November 3rd] at night, will consist of Niklaus and Samuel [Wyttenbach], Bendicht and Glado May, Hans Wunderlich, Sulpitius Brüggler, Bendicht and Christoph Wyttenbach, Valerius Göuffi, and possibly two more guests, so about 16 horses are to be expected. Asks Bullinger to make arrangements with Fuchs’ host so that he can recover if he becomes ill. The Emperor [Charles V] is with his troops before [Landrecies] not far from the [French] King [Francis I]; a battle is likely to occur. Greetings. [Niklaus Wyttenbach] would like Bullinger and Mayor [Diethelm] Röist to accompany them [to Biel].</p>

      <p>Joy and grace from God the Father through Christ Jesus be with us all at all times. Furthermore, my willing service and whatever I can offer in honor, love, and goodness, be always ready for you.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, I have received your letter, which you have sent to me several times. It is a great concern to me that you have so much effort and work because of Samuel. May God be your reward. In which I now understand well that perhaps you think, when the honorable relatives come together, perhaps some dispute might arise again concerning the article of the sons. You need not worry about it anymore; for, if God wills, as it has begun, so it will have a continuation, although, as previously written, the devil has struggled fiercely, but achieved nothing, praise be to God. May God send His blessing upon it, so that nothing but happiness and prosperity will be there. There is no need to write much about it. If God allows and we come together, I will report everything about the matter to you in detail.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as you wrote to me to inform you who will be coming with my godfather, I will let you know, although young master Niklaus is not at home. So young master Niklaus, Samuel, young master Bendicht May, the mother's brother, young master Glado May, also your brother, his two sons-in-law Hans Wunderlich and young master Sulpitius Brüggler, the third cannot come, which he deeply regrets, but his cousin Bendicht Wyttenbach and his son Christoph, young master Valerius Göuffi, our mayor, and possibly two more, so that about 16 horses are to be expected. He does not want to trouble many people with him; many would like to come, but it is not necessary. Coming halfway through the day, I think there will be no dispute, I will arrange it well, so that they will be there on Saturday night. As for the rest of the house, they will probably find a place to stay, I will take care of it. Otherwise, I know nothing else, except may God grant happiness and good weather for it. Amen.</p>
      <p>Further, my request to you and to my good lord and brother Rudolf Gwalter, you would do well to speak with my host in the Neustadt above, that he may do his best, so that if I come and become ill with you, I may be his guest once more and recover well; for the best medicine one can have is abstinence. Therefore, take care of it for me in time, I am very concerned about it.</p>
      <p>I have no special news, except that last Monday some messengers came from the headquarters, who say that the Emperor is besieging a city that the King has taken from him, has lost 6 assaults before it, called Noyon, and the King is not far from him with his army; they think it may come to a battle without delay.</p>
      <p>Greet all good lords and brothers for me, my lord mayor and all other good friends. All my household also sends their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Given on Wednesday before Simon and Jude in 1543.</p>
      <p>You should prepare to come, he wants to have it arranged. He would also like to have my lord mayor Röist here, if it were not inconvenient for him. Your always willing brother</p>
      <p>Peter Fuchs, you shall find me.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned and honorable lord Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of God in Zurich, my gracious lord and brother, to his hands.</p>
