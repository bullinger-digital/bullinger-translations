      <p> Understanding that this young man, endowed with remarkable talent, learning, and piety, wished to travel to you, I did not allow him to leave here for you without my letters, by which he would be commended to you under the same terms as he was commended to me by the polymath Scaliger. He will serve as a corrector at Gesner's press, as I hear, in this role temporarily, while no other opportunity arises, which is the calamity of learned men today. He will undoubtedly be more pleasing to Gesner if your commendation is added. </p>
      <p> There is another by the name of Wilhelm Klebitz from Brandenburg, who, due to a dispute with a certain Tilmann, an obstinate defender of the impanate Christ, was temporarily deprived of his ecclesiastical office in Heidelberg, but not of the goodwill of the prince or good men. He is a young man of great and sharp intellect, learned and eloquent, and an enemy of bread-worship. From him, you will hear a remarkable account of the events with that Tilmann, which I believe will be pleasing to you because from it you will understand that the minds of the prince and great men are inclined not a little towards a sounder and better doctrine of the sacraments. Farewell with all the brothers, ministers of the holy gospel. </p>
      <p> Farewell. </p>
      <p> Martin Borrhaus. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of the ZÃ¼rich church, his esteemed friend and brother. </p>
