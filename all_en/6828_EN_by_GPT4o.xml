      <p>With your diligence, most illustrious man, being proven to us in writing; indeed, from those most courteous letters, your incredible love towards us, and your singular care for our church, and your most ardent zeal for concord appear. We sent some questions to your piety, in which the force and, as it were, the hinge of the whole controversy seemed to be placed: to which your piety has responded accurately; however, with your kind permission, we say, we are not satisfied. First, your piety responds that laws regarding vestments can be prescribed to ministers, so that they are distinguished from laypeople by color and form; for it is a civil observation, and the apostle wants the bishop to be κοσμιον (orderly). Since this question is proposed about ecclesiastical men and pertains to ecclesiastical polity, we do not see how the singular and clerical habit of ministers can have a civil rationale. While we admit that a bishop should be κοσμιον (orderly), we refer, with Ambrose, to the adornment of the mind, not to the adornment of the body. And while we require honesty, dignity, and gravity in dress, we deny that decorum is sought from the enemies of our religion.</p>
      <p>Secondly, you respond hypothetically: if a cap and garment not indecorous for a minister, and which are free from superstition, are commanded to be used by ministers, Judaism is not thereby truly recalled. But how can a garment suitable for the simple ministry of Christ, which served the theater and pomp of the papal priesthood, be appropriate? For (as our people persuade your piety) not only the square cap and foreign dress are demanded, but also sacred vestments are used in the temple, the surplice, or the white choir garment, and the cope are recalled, which some papists themselves in their books proclaim to be certain imitations and images of Judaism, and your piety has taught not once from Innocent. We gladly subscribe to the testimony of Dr. Martyr, our most revered teacher. But the examples he brings pertain to decorum and order: these deform the church, disturb εθταχιαν (order), and overturn all decency. Those agree with the light of nature; these are prodigious and monstrous. Those, according to Tertullian's rule, had mere necessities and utilities; these are utterly inept, superfluous, and useless, conducive neither to edification nor to any good use: but rather, (to use the words of the same Martyr,) they splendidly served the worship, which today all the pious execrate. The distinction of ecclesiastical vestments today is received as a papal invention, the papists themselves boast, the constitutions of Otto speak, the pontifical book shows, the eyes and mouths of all approve. The use of temples, stipends, baptism, the symbol, etc., grew by divine institution before the pope was born: and with Augustine, whatever divine and legitimate we find in any heresy, we approve, retain, and do not deny. But this, because it is peculiar to that error and dissension, we truly argue and heal with the same.</p>
      <p>What you add, that the matter of vestments was not abolished from the beginning of the reformation, in this our people have reported untruths. For in many places, during the times of the most serene King Edward VI, the Lord's Supper was celebrated purely without a surplice: and the cope, which was then abolished by law, is now restored by public decree. This is not to uproot papism, but to plant it anew; not to progress in piety, but to regress. You say the priestly vestment is civil: you deny it smells of monasticism, papism, Judaism. What the papists babble about the surplice, how much the habit of clerics is valued among them, and how it is dedicated to religion; we do not doubt your prudence understands from their books. Furthermore, that ambitious and pharisaical prescription of peculiar vestments savors of monachism and papism, to which they today attribute no less than monks once did to their cowls. Nor indeed did the opinion of sanctity and merit break in all at once, but crept in gradually and insensibly. Because we fear this may also happen here, we therefore do not hesitate without reason, and we try to oppose the beginnings. We do not side with Eustathius, who placed religion in dress, but rather oppose those who superstitiously require religious and singular vestments as indicators of their priesthood. The same must be said of the canon of the Council of Gangra and Laodicea and the Sixth Synod. We judge that to depart from the liberty in which we have stood thus far is a certain token of servitude. Nor have we quarreled here, we do not contend hatefully, we always avoid bitter contentions, we seek friendly consultations; we do not yield to wolves, but being forced and driven from our place, we depart unwillingly and lamenting. We allow brothers and bishops to stand and fall to their own master: we most humbly, but in vain, ask for the same equity towards us. In rites, nothing is free: nor has royal majesty been provoked by us to this, but has been induced by the persuasion of others: so that now at last, not what is expedient for the church, but what is in some way permissible, is established; and what is not altogether impious, that is considered sound and healthy, that is held sacred and valid. Ceremonies and vestments of priests, since they are witnesses of religion and marks of profession, are not civil; and being borrowed by mutual consent from enemies, they are not considered decorous; and being marked with divine anathema, and hated by all the pious, and admired by the wicked and weak, without which they believe neither we are ministers nor the sacraments are rightly administered; they can neither be numbered nor ought to be numbered among things indifferent. The ancient fathers had their vestments, but neither proper to all bishops, nor distinct from laypeople. The examples of St. John and Cyprian are singular. Sisinius was a heretic, nor is he proposed as praised or to be imitated by us. The pallium was common to all Christians, as Tertullian relates in that book, and your piety noted elsewhere. Chrysostom mentions the white garment, but incidentally, nor does he commend it, but reproves it; and whether it was of priests or other Greeks, linen or woolen, white or clean, is not yet certain. Certainly, to the people of Antioch, it is opposed by the same and by Jerome to the sordid, and mention is made of the woolen pallium by Blondus. Therefore, nothing can be concluded from ambiguity.</p>
      <p>The prescription of vestments does not agree with Christian liberty, Bucer is a witness; who judged that distinctions of vestments, because of the present abuse in the Anglican churches, for a fuller declaration of the detestation of antichrist, for a fuller profession of Christian liberty, for removing dissensions among brothers, should be entirely abolished: for he used these words in a letter to Mr. a Lasco, who was entirely ours. Therefore, it is manifest that a grave scandal arises from this, and edification is hindered. Indeed, we must yield to the time, but for a time: so that we always progress, never regress. Far be it that we sow schisms in the church by arguing more hatefully, or stir up strife by opposing brothers hostily. Far be it (excellent Bullinger) that we condemn things indifferent by nature as impious: far be it that we cover our affections under the scandal, or make a conscience of ξιλονεικια (contention). This dross and papal leaven (believe us) is the seedbed of all dissension: we wish it to be removed and buried in eternal oblivion, so that no traces of antichristian superstition remain. In the papacy, primacy and arrogance always displeased us: and will tyranny in the free church be pleasing? A free synod among Christians has hitherto solved the knots of controversies: why are all things now referred to the judgment of one or another? Where this freedom of votes and voices reigns, there truth prevails and flourishes.</p>
      <p>Briefly, thus hold, reverend father, that these things chiefly make faith for us, the authority of the scriptures, the simplicity of the ministry of Christ, the purity of the first and best churches, which we refrain from mentioning for brevity's sake. On the other hand, no law, no general decree either of the most good and great God, or of any reformed church, or of a universal council (which is Augustine's rule), has hitherto been our lot to read or hear. Moreover, we have found that these examples brought forward so far are particular and do not confirm universals. To these we establish, not whatever is lawful in any way, should be imposed; but what edifies the church in every way, should be introduced; nor what is lawful for someone, is immediately lawful for all. We have (praise be to God!) pure and uncorrupted doctrine; in worship, a not insignificant part of religion, why will we limp? why do we receive a maimed Christ rather than a whole, pure, and perfect one? Why do we seek examples of reformation from papists, our enemies, and not from you, our brothers? The confession of our churches is the same; the doctrine and reason of faith are the same: why is there such dissimilarity, such diversity in rites and ceremonies? The same is sealed: why do the signs vary so much, that they are dissimilar to yours, similar to papistic ones? The same leader and commander is Christ: why are hostile banners raised in our churches? which if we were men of God, if we were endowed with any zeal, we would have long since detested and demolished. We have always thought well of bishops: we have interpreted their pride candidly: why can they not bear us, who once kissed the cross with them, and now preach the same Christ, bearing the same most sweet yoke together? why do they throw us into prisons? why do they persecute us for a garment? why do they strip us of food and goods? why do they publicly traduce us in books? why do they commend a bad cause to posterity with a published writing? They have also translated into our language some notes of Mr. Bucer, P. Martyr, and now your private letters to us, and have published them against our will and knowledge. Hence, while they pursue their cause, they claim their honor, they consult neither our church, nor their brothers, nor your dignity, nor the next age.</p>
      <p>But so that your paternity may understand, it is not a light or trivial, but a matter of great weight; nor is it contended only about a cap or surplice, but we complain about a very serious matter; we send some straws and trifles of papistic religion, from which, with your prudence, you may easily infer the rest; and with your piety, devise some remedy as soon as possible. We pray to our Lord Jesus Christ, that he may calm these tumults and disturbances, assert his glory, send laborers into the vineyard, so that a joyful and most abundant harvest may come forth. And we pray you, that with paternal counsel, public writing, private letters, you may act, strive, do, and accomplish, that either these evils may be removed, or good men, not yet persuaded, may be tolerated; lest those whom the firmest bond of doctrine has united, a Roman ceremony may separate.</p>
      <p>Greet Gwalter, Simler, Lavater, Wolf, the esteemed lords, with whom if you confer, you will have done something most pleasing to us and to the whole church. May the Lord Jesus bless his little hut, your Zurich! July, in the year 1566.</p>
      <p>These few things, hastily, and not so much for the sake of responding as of admonishing: what could be said in this sense, are infinite. You now pronounce not what is done or can be done, but what ought to be done.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your paternity, Laurence Humphrey, Thomas Sampson.</p>
      <p>The following - truncated...</p>
      <p>Some stains, which still cling to the Anglican church: 1. In public prayers, although nothing impure, there is nevertheless some appearance of papistic superstition. This is seen not only in morning and evening prayers, but also in the holy supper. 2. Besides the broken and exquisite sounds of music, the use of organs in churches is becoming prevalent. 3. In the administration of baptism, the minister addresses the infant: in its name, sponsors, in the absence of the parent, respond about faith, renouncing the world, the flesh, and the devil: the baptized is signed with the cross. 4. Even women are given the power to baptize at home. 5. In the Lord's Supper, sacred vestments, namely the cope and surplice, are used: kneeling is enjoined on communicants: for common bread, unleavened wafers are substituted. 6. Outside the temple, and for ministers in general individually, papistic vestments are prescribed: and bishops wear their linen (called a rochet); and both carry square caps, liripipes, long gowns, borrowed from papists. 7. But what shall we say about the nerve of religion, discipline? There is none, nor does our church have its rod; no censure is exercised. 8. Marriage is not granted and sanctioned to ministers of the church by public laws of the kingdom; but their children are considered illegitimate by some. 9. Solemn betrothal is done in the papistic manner and rite by a ring. 10. Women are still purified with a veil. 11. In ecclesiastical governance, many traces of the antichristian church are preserved. For as once in Rome in the pope's forum everything was for sale: so in the metropolitan's court almost everything is available; pluralities of benefices; license for non-residence, for not being initiated into sacred orders, for eating meat on forbidden days, and in Lent, during which time, unless dispensed and paid, it is a sin to celebrate marriages. 12. The free power of preaching is taken away from the ministers of Christ: those who now wish to preach, must not advise the innovation of rites; but are compelled by subscription to approve all ceremonies. 13. Finally, the article on spiritual eating, which in explicit words opposed and removed the real presence in the Eucharist, and contained the most manifest explanation of the truth, published in the times of Edward VI, is now published among us mutilated and truncated.
