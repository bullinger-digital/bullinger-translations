      <p>Greetings. Although there is nothing specific to write to you about at the moment, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, I thought it necessary to write through such a reliable messenger, so that I may not appear to have neglected my duty to you, to whom I owe my greetings for your remarkable kindness. I have already experienced your unique generosity many times; however, I do not intend to compete with you, knowing that I would be shamefully defeated if I tried. It will be enough for me, since it cannot be otherwise, if you understand my grateful heart (from which you expect nothing) for the many and great benefits you have bestowed upon me, until I can, with the Lord's help, demonstrate in reality that I have not been ungrateful.</p>
      <p>Indeed, you have often heard me singing these praises to you, my sweetest soul, and you will think it well if you do not have to hear me troubling you further with them, which I will ensure does not happen in a more distressing manner.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to report that you do not already know. We hear that the Saxons are acting with great intemperance against the ministers of our churches, whom they believe should be the target of the common Christian weapons rather than the Turks, and they try to persuade everyone of this not only in sermons but also in public writings, which they publish one after another. I know you have seen nothing of this, nor have I, if what these not at all vain men assert is true.</p>
      <p>I hear that in Strasbourg a wonderfully prodigious book of this same most odious argument is now being published. I have not yet heard who the author is; but I am expecting letters from my relative Peter Sch채rer, whom you know, who will faithfully (I do not doubt) write in detail about whatever tragedies have been stirred up by these certain more obstinate than learned and sensible men, although you now know everything more certainly from the great and incomparable theologian Dr. Peter Martyr, whom I am exceedingly glad has become one of yours, or you will soon know. Ah, how some theologians in Strasbourg degenerate from the spirit of the most holy and pious memory of Bucer, who was so constantly engaged in reconciling and establishing the peace of the churches of Christ that he seemed excessive in this matter to many, while in these we are forced to desire even a tenth part of this zeal. May our common Savior Jesus Christ grant that amidst so many fatal movements of the Christian world, truth may lift its head, reign, and triumph, and that we, meditating on serious repentance amidst so many pressures and storms of the world, and urging it strongly in the churches entrusted to our faith, may glorify His name in holiness and justice of truth, whether through life or death.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my sweetest heart, and help us with your constant prayers of the pious before Christ. Our people, especially Funck, Fuchs, Wittenbach, etc., lovingly and respectfully send their greetings to you. May your colleagues and ministers in the work of the Lord, especially our Theodore, Rudolf Gwalther, your son-in-law with Wolf, and Dr. Martyr, if he has already arrived there, be greeted on my behalf through you in the most dutiful manner, a truly candid and sincere witness of Christian truth, whose zeal and work I earnestly and faithfully strive to obtain from the heavenly Father through Christ, so that they may be fruitful and most successful for your school and church. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Biel, July 10, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>The French and the Emperor are said to be at odds again, and the fifty-year peace is already over. The Pope is said to have expelled the Emperor's Cologne supporters and thus declared how imperial he is; but no one departs, etc.</p>
      <p>It is said that Margrave Albrecht and W체rttemberg have made a separate agreement with each other, and Duke Christoph has taken a monastery outside his jurisdiction, where he claims to be the castellan. W체rttemberg, W체rzburg, King Ferdinand, and several others are said to have newly allied themselves.</p>
      <p>The Augsburg Confession is constantly being revised, as they have agreed upon and intend to adhere to it; however, it is being interpreted and explained in several ways in certain articles, excluding all the Swiss churches; against this, everything is said to rise in protest.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is said to have undertaken a voyage to Spain with Queen Maria and one or two young lords of King Ferdinand, and they are still in Brussels...</p>
      <p>But all this is still uncertain with us; we are waiting for letters from Augsburg, also from Strasbourg. Whatever you have certain knowledge of regarding these and other matters, please do not withhold it from me with this reliable messenger.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
