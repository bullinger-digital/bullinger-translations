    <p xml:id="regest1">What Bullinger wrote to him about Luther has already been communicated to him by Capito. He is pleased with Bullinger's letter to Melanchthon [above No. 636], whom he remembers fondly as a former classmate. He wishes Bullinger continued good health. The Bernese envoys were received kindly in Zurich, but they did not receive the desired response. He raises new accusations against [Peter Im Haag]. Megander's exegetical commentaries cannot be compared with those of Bullinger; they suffer from a lack of consideration of other authors. He requests the still missing final part of Bullinger's commentary on four of Paul's letters and news from the Frankfurt Fair. Bern's sympathies for the Solothurn "bandits" are overestimated; no one is interested in a war.</p>

      <p>S. What you write about Luther has already been communicated to me by Capito, who perhaps more easily persuaded me that Luther's attitude towards Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and you is entirely sincere. If he truly wishes to bear witness to the truth, he will be compelled to think rightly of them. But since these matters were acted upon and reported by that physician Gereon from Augsburg, it was surely to move us towards concord - you did well, therefore, to write to Melanchthon. For he, from childhood (while we were under Simler at Phorcae for two years, not only as classmates but also united in the greatest friendship, which he attested with five letters, four from TÃ¼bingen, one from Saxony) gave a specimen of the highest integrity and simplicity, and I do not doubt that he is the same today towards all who are devoted to piety.</p>
      <p>I give thanks to my God daily that you and your family are well, and I pray that He, in His goodness, may preserve you for many years to come as a survivor and in good health for His church.</p>
      <p>From our envoys, I understood nothing of indignation, except that they were treated most kindly by yours, but they did not obtain the response they desired from yours.</p>
      <p>I have depicted the man H. to you in his true colors. I omitted the pretenses, by which he imposes in the least manner on the Christian republic and civil matters, since he is wonderfully persuasive among the diakosios. I fear that whatever those exiles from Solothurn and the miserable Genevans have attempted so far, it was not done without the counsel of private individuals and H. But while we are between a rock and a hard place, those leaders know well how to remain silent, to dissimulate, etc. In sum: "Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain" [Ps 127, 1].</p>
      <p>We all persuade ourselves that you will complete Paul and we eagerly await it. I have read the letter to the Galatians, compared it with Megander's commentaries, but good God, how many should regret their writings, while more complete and learned ones, closest to the apostolic sentiment, are abundantly supplied daily. What he wrote in both letters to Timothy, I have not yet seen. Oporinus in Basel, while correcting in the presence of Sulzer, did not esteem it highly. I would prefer the man to suppress his own longer, but all this comes from the fact that he has long disdained to see others. Now, since he has begun the letter to the Romans for the congregation, he asked me to lend him your and Melanchthon's commentaries, which I did all the more willingly, so that having seen the judgments of others, he may either give better ones someday or remain silent.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Christophorus Froschouer sent your commentaries on 4 letters already completed but not complete. In the letter to the Philippians, I have the first quire marked with the letter B, then nothing. Therefore, I beseech you, when you can conveniently through your scribe, ensure that the messenger brings back the rest. I will not bind them until you have also given the others on the Thessalonians and the rest. If you have received any news from the Frankfurt Fair, share it with me.</p>
      <p>Now farewell and take it in good part, since, lying in bed with my usual illness, I could not give anything else.</p>
      <p>3rd October, year 35.</p>
      <p>We all hope that no war will arise. Ours are not as warlike as one might think, but the instigators make much noise, yet they are not so inclined that we would be unjustly blamed. The 9 men are not as important to us as one might think. The affections, counsels, imprudence, and rashness of private individuals disturb much. Should they be captured by strangers in our territory, not much good would come of it. Before the magistrate learns of it, great damage might occur and a great war might begin. They also do not have the support, as is claimed to you. They sometimes settle on a solitary farm; if they are not given food, they take it themselves and move on. This is only noticed when it has long happened. They also attack my lords' people, asking: "Are you friend or foe?", and threaten my lords' officials. All this makes them hated. Yet we would like to be free from unrest, as our territory borders on that of Solothurn, a city not well with them, as they know their fraudulent dealings. This as an appendix to you alone.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Your least coin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most pious and dearest brother, pastor of the church in Zurich.</p>
