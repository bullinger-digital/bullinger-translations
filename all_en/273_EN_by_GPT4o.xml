      <p>S. D. I received letters from your kindness, the first dated September 4th, the latter on the 13th of the same month. I thank you for your diligent writing; I am very sorry that you are suffering so gravely from the stone, which doubles the burden of old age, not to mention the troubles and calamities of our age. May the Lord preserve you.</p>
      <p>The community in Konstanz is becoming more and more inept. Ambrosius is no longer safe in his life and living. Therefore, an honorable council has sent him away for his safety; he is at Griessenberg, a castle in the Thurgau, belonging to those from Ulm. His sister is there, she is the widow of Junker Heinrich von Ulm, a very respectable woman. On September 7th, Konstanz sent envoys to the council here; they announced that the community wants peace and is willing to accept all articles requested by the emperor at Augsburg; they ask that if this happens, the Confederates will forgive some articles. Foolishness. On September 11th, the answer came from the emperor regarding those from Konstanz, whether the emperor would allow the Confederates to handle it amicably; he answered: no; those from Konstanz are not worthy. He otherwise gives the Confederates many good words and promises them much, etc. Dated at Speyer, August 28th. On September 13th, a council recognized all guilds in Konstanz; on the 14th, the community freely accepted all articles imposed by the emperor, submitting to mercy and lack of mercy, taking on priests, willing to restore them, taking on the captain, whom they will pay 400 guilders annually, giving the artillery to the emperor. They want peace, that and nothing else; they have stood in danger long enough.</p>
      <p>Their preachers have taken leave, but it has not yet been granted to them. Now they are acting through some abbots. No one is allowed to speak freely of God's goods. The gates against Thurgau are well guarded. The pious within, of whom there are many, stand in danger. May God deliver them.</p>
      <p>Thus it happens, my Myconius, when hypocrisy and impiety, long concealed and restrained, finally break out. They will find it so. On September 16th, a council from Konstanz writes to my lords, thanking them for all good, showing how they did not wait for the day in Baden on September 23rd, having accepted all articles, yet intending to report to the Confederates in Baden.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you. September 20th, 1548.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed brother. Basel.</p>
      <p>About Konstanz, about which it is said that there is no people in all of Germany today where there is such agreement between the magistrate, preachers, and the common people: A beast of many heads. The crowd is always unchangeable. At mercy and lack of mercy, indeed. A notable example of hypocrisy and cruelty.</p>
