    <p xml:id="regest1">The people of Zurich send Leo Jud's translation of Ratramnus's writing "De corpore et sanguine domini" and oppose Luther's letter to Duke Albrecht. They present their own view of the Lord's Supper and reject Luther's accusation that the people of Zurich are heretics. Although the people of Zurich acknowledge Luther's merits in the renewal of the Church, they firmly reject his massive accusations. They request Duke Albrecht not to banish any reformed believers.</p>

      <p>To the illustrious, high-born prince and lord, Lord Albrecht, Margrave of Brandenburg, in Prussia, etc., Duke, etc.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father through Jesus Christ our Savior. Illustrious high-born prince, a letter was recently sent to Your Princely Grace from Luther, in which he attempts to persuade Your Princely Grace to expel those who oppose his teaching on the Lord's Supper from the land, claiming that his teaching and articles are clear, pure, and without doubt, and firmly grounded in the Gospel, so that no one can refute them. However, he does not provide any reasons, but instead immediately begins to lamentably and cruelly accuse us innocent ones, claiming that our blood (truly not from an apostolic spirit) is being shed, and he also attempts to incite Your Princely Grace's natural gentleness against those in Your Princely Grace's principality who share our opinion, to rage against them, to outlaw them, and to expel them from the land. And although we have unanimously decided among ourselves not to respond to his book (for it is not worthy of it: it will also sufficiently disgrace and shame itself among all reasonable, right-minded, and good-hearted people), we did not want to remain completely silent, especially towards Your Princely Grace, whom he attempts to embitter with such rough and unskilled writing (if God does not prevent it) and to incite against the pious innocent ones. Therefore, in this preface, we do not respond to Luther (whose mind is hardened and who has committed himself in his confession that if he were to confess otherwise, it should be considered madness, therefore he does not listen to us), but we wish to make a humble, urgent, and heartfelt request to Your Princely Grace, rejecting the disgrace and abusive words that Luther has not only directed at us but also at the truth. Your Princely Grace, however, should graciously allow us to present our defense and patiently hear us, so that we are not condemned and judged as guilty without being heard and without a defense. For it is not fitting that Luther should be both the accuser, the judge, and the witness, as he undertakes in the letter to Your Princely Grace; although in the part where he should provide evidence against us, he presents little foundation and truth, and yet the accusation is sharp and the judgment very cruel against us.</p>
      <p>We, however, have so far spared him in many ways (as all believers know) and have never wanted to refute his outrageous and unreasonable writing with equal measure; and even to this day we desire peace and unity (as far as it may be with God and the truth) with him. But despite all this, he insults, defames, abuses, and slanders us, attacks us with shameful dishonorable names, calls us enthusiasts, sectarians, heretics, devil's children, and other disgraceful words he attributes to us, which he can never prove with the truth (if God wills) to be true for all eternity. It would be fitting, high-born prince and lord, that a teacher of the truth, a servant of God, should undertake, create, and accomplish nothing other than the business of his Lord, who sent him, and that the mouth, which God has prepared and purified to proclaim His truth and word, should not be so stained with bitter false abusive speeches and slanders, not so with unfounded idle and noisy chatter, for such a thing would be unseemly for a messenger of God and the truth.</p>
      <p>We do not know what enthusiasts are, but he cannot truthfully call us sectarians and heretics, for we have always strived for and adhered to the divine scripture, the truth, and the unity of the Church of Christ, have no erroneous or false opinion among us, but the divine word, the foundation of faith and scripture, as well as the understanding of the ancient teachers, who have been approved and accepted by the holy church, whose teaching has never been considered heretical and erroneous (in this article); as Oecolampadius of blessed memory has sufficiently proven and testified, and it will be clearly found in itself.</p>
      <p>Your Princely Grace will also see in this little book, which a pious man named Bertram wrote nearly seven hundred years ago at the request of Emperor Charles, at a time when this dispute over the Lord's Supper also arose, how truly Luther speaks about us, that we have newly invented such an opinion or sucked it from a finger, and how true it is that his opinion has been held by the church for fifteen hundred years. For this Bertram lived in the time of Emperor Lothair, in the year when it was counted eight hundred and forty years, which now almost runs to seven hundred years. Therefore, we cannot be suspected or accused of having invented his book. It was found and printed in Cologne in the year 31 by Johannes Prael, translated by our servant for the pleasure of Your Princely Grace. Forty years ago, Bertram was counted among the distinguished learned men by the highly learned Johannes Trithemius, abbot of Sponheim, and his life was described, so that one does not find that his teaching and opinion about the sacrament were ever rejected or condemned as heretical by the church, but rather accepted and praised by Emperor Charles.</p>
      <p>From which Your Princely Grace learns and clearly sees that Luther's opinion has not lasted as long as he claims and boasts, nor has our true teaching ever been rejected by the church. The opposite is clearly found, that from the time of Jesus Christ and His apostles for many hundreds of years, the Lord's Supper has been held by all believers as we teach; and as often as this unfounded opinion has come to the fore, there have always been pious learned God-fearing men who have opposed it. And Luther cannot show a single proven teacher who was of his opinion, except for Innocent the Pope, the third of the name, who drew such an article from the school of Paris, confirmed it in the Lateran Council. For he was also our master, from whom he, to please his school, introduced such a false erroneous and harmful opinion to the church as an article of faith and caused much damage to the Roman chair; for which all the wealth of kings and princes was not enough. Luther himself has also written that this article is the shaky and powerless foundation of the papacy, which must necessarily fall if it is not founded on Christ the true cornerstone, nor on His teaching. And it is truly ridiculous, also highly to be pitied, that Luther, such a learned man, has come to such a great and heavy headway that he dares to say, if he had nothing else for his opinion, it would be enough for him that the church has held it for so long. Which church, O Luther? The Church of Christ? No, no, that will never be found with the truth. The Pope's church? That does not concern us, O Luther. Seeing, noble prince and lord, should Luther's argument here hold from the length of time, then the papacy would still stand firm, for they always boast of the church and the length of time. But then all of Luther's teachings would be thrown to the ground, for he teaches otherwise than the Roman church has held for so many years. Where does the quarrel lead a person? Luther should consider that the church is founded on God's word, not on the length of time.</p>
      <p>And although he thinks he has clear, pure, and undoubted words, he must also interpret and understand them according to the meaning of the spirit, according to the nature of faith, and the understanding of scripture; otherwise, the Pope would also have clear words of his error, namely: "Upon this rock I will build my church" [Mt 16:18]. But if he does not interpret and understand these clear words according to scripture, he will be found to be dealing unfaithfully with God's word; which also happens to Luther in the clear words of Christ ("This is my body, which is given for you" [Lk 22:19]), which he interprets and understands against the sense of the spirit, against the nature of faith, against scripture. Were not these also clear words when Christ said: "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you" [John 6:53]. Yet some misunderstood and were rebuked by the Lord. Likewise, when Christ said: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" [John 2:19]. These were indeed clear words, but they were thrown up against him and reproached for his life. We are not at odds over the words of the Lord ("This is my body" [Mt 26:26]), but we understand the words of Christ spiritually and as befits faith, not bodily as Luther does, for Christ Himself says, His words are spirit and life. Although Luther has great effort to persuade Your Princely Grace that the sixth chapter of John does not belong to the Lord's Supper, we do not burden ourselves with it here now, but what the ancient teachers write is evident and is against Luther. We are also not so skilled, not so spiritual, that we can or may speak of spiritual eating, as Luther accuses us. But we are willing to bear all disgrace and shame that he attributes to us for the sake of the truth and for the sake of Him who was also reviled for us, and we will not deviate or depart a hair's breadth from the grasped and known truth because of Luther's bitter and poisonous words, no matter how much he babbles, which he attributes to us, and yet he truly does. For what is his speech in the letter to Your Princely Grace other than a haughty pride, contempt, outrage, useless, idle, and unfounded chatter and babbling? But we, who are founded on the truth of God, will not be driven away by babbling, but one must bring scripture and truth. Therefore, we let it all fall and only respond to the fact that we are neither heretics nor sectarians, for we have never been overcome with scripture, nor have we been proven and convinced of error in any way. We also offer ourselves even today, if anyone can inform us better with scripture and divine truth, we are willing to yield, but that has never happened so far. But Luther does not want to fight against us with scripture, but with the sword, calls and cries out to emperors, princes, lords, and cities to outlaw, expel, and kill us; whether that is in accordance with the divine spirit, I leave to all believers to judge.</p>
      <p>Since we are then with the holy church and in agreement with the truth and the true understanding of divine scripture, never accused or refuted by anyone with divine scripture of error, how can we then be condemned as sectarians or heretics? Truly, illustrious prince and lord, Luther does not use any Christian love or compassion with us, which we also find more compassion and sympathy among our enemies. But is it not a cruel thing to give so many churches, in which there are many thousands of pious believers, to the devil and condemn them? Ulm, Memmingen, Esslingen, Augsburg, Constance, Lindau, Zurich, Basel, Bern, Glarus, Solothurn, Schaffhausen, Appenzell, Mulhouse, Biel, all three leagues, St. Gallen, the Rhine Valley, Thurgau, Strasbourg, and many other cities, lands, principalities, which do not adhere to Luther in this article, to condemn and arrogantly reject them all and give them to the devil, does not befit a Christian spirit. And even if we err and go astray in external things, should one therefore immediately give the weak brothers to the devil? Which gospel teaches that? Where has one ever heard such a thing from us against Luther and his followers? Although we have often defended our opinion from God's word, with strong foundations of scripture, against him and still, where it is necessary, will defend it. We can also sufficiently show that his opinion is contrary to scripture, yes, that it is against the nature of faith, an abolition and dissolution of the entire suffering and sacrifice of Christ on the cross. Yet we have never cursed him and his followers with words or hearts, never given them to the devil, never called for their expulsion or death. When the apostles in Jerusalem had a council about circumcision, Peter gave advice that was closer to Christian freedom and truth than the advice of James, yet we do not read that Peter therefore despised or so contemptuously rejected James. Paul, the more perfect one, did not despise the advice of James, who added something to the ceremonies, allowed himself to be circumcised, and set the believers right, so that love would not be disrupted. And this perfect man became all things to all people for Christ's sake. Can we then not be tolerated for the sake of Christian love, for the sake of peace and unity, when we have never been corrected or overcome with scripture?</p>
      <p>But how is the devil our master when we build solely on God's word? We truly fear that Luther is cutting too far beyond the line of Christian moderation, he should rightly remember Paul's saying: "Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall" [1 Cor 10:12], and know that pride is very displeasing to the Lord, whose servants we are. Luther, being also a human and not entirely free from human temptations, can also fall and err. If God has then initially used him as His instrument (which we also acknowledge), he should be all the more humble and thankful, should not therefore so arrogantly and pompously reject us. For if one were to speak of the devil's school, I fear he would have taken a piece from it in his confession; for all the pious well know what kind of book it is, how it agrees with truth and faith. We let it rest here for the sake of decorum along with other heated, wrathful writing that he drives in the letter: as when he so despises the pious Carlstadt that he also judges his heart and conscience. Likewise, when he attacks the dear and pious man Ulrich Zwingli after his death with such blasphemous words, which are not used and are considered shameful even among the heathen. We recognize Andreas Carlstadt as a pious honest man, who is not reprehensible to us in either his teaching or life. We also assume (as far as we can judge externally) that his heart and conscience are joyful (calm, unburdened) in God. We consider Zwingli a pious dear teacher of the truth, not boasting of his name, which is attributed to us as a disgrace, for we boast of no one but Christ. We recognize him as an instrument of God, through whom God has informed us of His truth; in his life, he had great care, toil, and labor, how he planted the truth and honor of God, how he restored the fallen righteousness and piety (uprightness), which had gone to the ground in a Confederation, for which he could endure and do everything. And to accomplish this, he died, and his blood was shed not for any wrongdoing, but so that he might restore God's honor and common righteousness; of which all the pious in the entire Confederation are witnesses. Why then should we not be able to call him a martyr, that is, a witness of the truth, since he confessed and testified to the truth until death, yes, was slain for the sake of truth and righteousness?</p>
      <p>But that the papists have defeated us and killed our people, Luther takes as an argument and proof that our faith is not right. But how this argument of his has a foundation in scripture, I leave to all right-minded people to judge. Was Josiah's faith therefore not right because he perished in war? Did the Turk therefore have the right faith because he killed many Christians and defeated them? Did Nebuchadnezzar have the right faith because he led the Jews captive? Oh, how the man has changed so much? We indeed confess that we are rightly punished for our sins and not because our faith is not right, but because we have not lived according to it. And although such punishment is great, it is still less than our wrongdoing deserves; and it is also not so great, for we still recognize the fatherly rod and hand of God, yes, His fatherly faithfulness towards us, and are increasing and strengthened in His teaching and grace more than ever before. Such a fall should not make us fall away from our Lord and God, to whom we still firmly adhere, as far as Luther's prophecy and signs are true. We do not seek our honor, nor do we want to boast of ourselves here; what we are, we are by God's grace. We also do not desire to diminish or belittle Luther's honor and name, do not despise his teaching, consider him a dear servant of God, acknowledge that God has accomplished much and great benefit through him in all the world. But we want to remind him that he should remember that he is also a human, and that not everything he writes, speaks, and does is spirit; that he can also err, that he should not so completely despise his poor fellow workers in God's work (us). For even Peter erred after receiving the spirit and was rebuked by Paul. We should never sell flesh for spirit. Saul was chosen by God, also erred in many things. Likewise David, a man after God's will, how can he sell his adultery under the spirit? Yet Moses, the faithful servant, failed and stumbled. Therefore, we ask Luther to recognize us as brothers, not to separate from us, not to reject us, we offer all peace and love towards him, only he should not force us away from recognized truth.</p>
      <p>And since Luther compares us to the evildoers who are led to the place of execution for their wrongdoing, our humble request to Your Princely Grace, and to all pious princes and lords, cities, and all estates of the Holy Roman Empire, is that one should not immediately drive an honest man with wife and child into misery based on Luther's writing, who cannot believe what Luther believes. Or where do we have an example of this in the teaching of Christ and the apostles? Your Princely Grace should be much firmer than to allow such a writing of a man to lead them against pious innocent people. Now we also believe that we are Christians, even if we cannot agree with Luther in this article and with the images. Love with the faith of the words of God is our most precious treasure. We hold the faith of scripture dear and high, diligently searching it daily, praying to God to open the scripture to us. When we grasp it, we thank Him and will not be driven away from it, we also do not want to increase or decrease it. We accept the writings of the holy fathers with all decorum and reverence, diligently comparing them with scripture and holding them in the honor in which they desire to be held; what scripture does not reject, we also do not reject; we offer love to all people, and also accept it from others. And even if some err, we do not immediately reject them, are always ready to receive and give instruction in gentleness. We do not say that it is mere bread and wine, nor do we speak contemptuously of it, but call it with Paul the bread of the Lord, the bread of thanksgiving, call it the body and blood of Christ with Christ. But the added words from Luther and others, from which dispute and strife could arise, we consider unnecessary, offensive, and dangerous. We also confess and believe that the body of Christ, which was given for us in death, and His blood, which was shed on the cross for the washing away of our sins, is truly present in the Lord's Supper and is received by the believers; but in the manner that is in accordance with faith and scripture; as it can be understood and received by the believers, and as much as it can be a food for the soul. We desire to speak openly and clearly before our churches about this matter and in such a way that the church understands us. We deal with truth and do not desire to deceive anyone, to lead anyone astray, therefore nothing frightens us away from the light. This is, high-born prince, our brief response to Your Princely Grace and all believers to Luther's accusation, whom we ask for God's sake not to proceed in this matter. Follow the advice of Gamaliel, if our cause is not of God, it cannot stand; if it is of God (of which we have no doubt), no one can uproot or suppress it. Why then should one strive in vain or fight against God?</p>
      <p>The little book of Bertram, which we send to Your Princely Grace, did not come from us to introduce something to confirm our opinion, but so that Your Princely Grace and all people may see that our opinion has also been held by the pious teachers in the past. No one should be offended by some words used by some teachers in this little book, such as consecrate, offer, altar, put water in wine, etc. For they used to speak in good understanding at their time, one should look much more at the purpose for which the pious Bertram always strives: namely, that the body and blood of Christ, which was sacrificed on the cross for us, is not bodily essentially there, but only in faith, in remembrance, in mystery and sacrament. Not by chance, but by divine foresight, this little book has now come to light in our times; for as it was once written to Emperor Charles, so we hope, the imperial majesty will not despise such a little book, but, since the name agrees, will read it diligently and also hold to the opinion.</p>
      <p>We ask, Your Princely Grace will not take offense at our writing, but receive it from us with the intention with which it was done, and hold it in good regard.</p>
      <p>Given on the seventeenth day of the month of June.</p>
      <p>Your Princely Grace's willing servants of the word in Zurich.</p>
