      <p>Around Strasbourg in recent days, there is said to have been a great storm along with an earthquake. These, along with others, are undoubtedly heralds of the soon-coming of that long-desired day. The Saxons, who participated in the Worms colloquy and, because the Zwinglians (as they call them) were not immediately condemned as they requested, have now published an apology for their departure, condemning all others who do not agree with their madness and alienating them from their assembly. It is expected that when offenses are committed, and offenses are defended as right actions.</p>
      <p>It pleased me to add these things to the letters already sealed.</p>
