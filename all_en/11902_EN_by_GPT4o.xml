    <p xml:id="regest1">The student [Kaspar] Schneeberger, without the knowledge of his relatives and Myconius, requested money from someone to learn to play the lute at the house of [Thomas] Platter [the Elder] [with Johannes von Schallen]; a request to comfort the mother; she should entrust her son to Myconius, and the relatives should better arrange his financing; Kaspar, although spoiled, has good potential to become a scholar. News: The Imperial Diet [at Speyer] has begun, and the Protestants, [Elector Johann Friedrich of] Saxony and [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse were the first among the obedient, which the Emperor [Charles V] acknowledges; a lasting peace has also been granted to the Protestants so that they can help against the Turks, from whom Germany is, however, all the safer this year, as they are lying with a huge fleet off Spain; furthermore, a secretary has been arrested at Speyer, but all these are unverified rumors.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I examined Schneeberger, from whom and why he requested so many crowns. He began to cry, not responding, until he stopped crying. Then he said: "Persuaded by my companions, I wanted to learn to play the lute." For Platter has an artist of this kind in his house, from whom almost all his students learn the same. I immediately said: "And why did you not first tell your family or me? This is not fitting for you. Therefore, be careful in the future; for we will not tolerate it." He promised abundantly, while crying, to be more cautious in the future. Therefore, you will console the mother; for as long as her son is with me, I will not allow him to do anything that would harm either his affairs or his reputation. However, it is time that the son is finally entrusted to you; for until now, he has remained silent quite imprudently. This was my custom, as long as I cared for boys or young men, that whatever they needed, they would ask from me or my wife, for buying shoes, paper, ink, etc. Since he has another source from which he requests money, I could easily be deceived without any fault of mine. Let his relatives see to it that the management is properly entrusted. So far, nothing has been done wrong, as far as I know. Let them be cautious in the future. Although the boy has been raised delicately, he does not displease me. Whatever needs to be done, he does it correctly and diligently. He is talented, applies himself to his studies without weariness, and has greatly reduced the frivolity he brought with him, which he himself acknowledges. He is obedient and does not easily offend anyone. I do not doubt that if he persists in his studies, he will become a learned man. These are my thoughts on the boy.</p>
      <p>The Imperial Diet and proceedings are said to have begun. The Protestants, Saxony and Hesse, were the first among the obedient, which they say the Emperor acknowledges. Dr. Sebastian, the physician, says that a perpetual peace has been granted to the Protestants, so that they may be of assistance against the Turks. It seems likely to me, as a great man from France recently narrated, that this year Germany will be safe from the Turks, because they have such a large number of ships gathered against Spain that it can hardly be believed. They also say that some secretary has been captured at Speyer. But all these are rumors, nothing certain. Once I have obtained something, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with your household.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, March 2, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable friend in the Lord.</p>
