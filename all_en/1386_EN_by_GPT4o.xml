      <p> Greetings. I am sending here the small package of Vergerius's books, about which I wrote recently; you know where to send more. The case of Eberhard is becoming more and more serious. It has been decreed by the senate that he should be thrown into prison, not the one where adulterers are usually punished, but the one where other criminals are kept. The prostitute has also been transferred there from the adulterers' prison, undoubtedly to suffer more. As I wrote recently, he himself has fled. May the Lord have mercy on us and remove these scandals. Today, Mr. Benedikt Aretius, the head of our school, a very learned and modest man, is celebrating his wedding. The archbishops of Mainz and Trier are already on their way to Trent; thus the Emperor urges. We must be vigilant and pray. </p>
      <p> A certain Sledanus in Strasbourg is urging Musculus to go to England; but this is far from his mind; he will not easily allow himself to be torn away from here. I hear that Mirandola is already under siege. I am waiting to hear what news you have for us. Farewell to you and all yours, whom my household and Musculus's greet together with you. </p>
      <p> Greet all the brothers in our name. Bern, August 27, 1551. </p>
      <p> Yours in the Lord, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the honorable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my kind, dear lord and godfather. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
