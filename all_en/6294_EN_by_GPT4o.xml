      <p>Greetings, my dearest brother Fabricius, may it be fortunate and auspicious.</p>
      <p>I write these first letters to you, not from death, but in illness, with whose remnants I still struggle with great discomfort and distress.</p>
      <p>And unless the Lord particularly strengthens me, I do not know when I might recover, especially since sorrow follows and envelops sorrow.</p>
      <p>Five weeks ago, the Lord took from me my dearest wife, whom you know what kind of person she was, so that you can easily infer how much pain this calamity could have stirred in me; now indeed, after five weeks, on the same day my wife was buried, my most beloved daughter Margarita, wife of Lavater, is also buried, having succumbed to the plague.</p>
      <p>She had been pregnant; the force of the disease expelled the little child; he was alive and baptized, but died the next day, whom the mother followed the following night, leaving behind 7 orphans and a husband immersed in deep grief.</p>
      <p>I know these things happen by divine counsel.</p>
      <p>Since I neither should nor can disapprove of this, I surrender myself and all mine and all my people to Him, imploring His mercy, and I particularly ask you to commend me and my household, indeed the church, to the Lord in your prayers. Today completes the seventh week since I fell ill, pierced by three nails of the Lord.</p>
      <p>To this very grave illness, other almost intolerable diseases have been added, pain in the right side, badly affected, and in the head, which have not yet subsided.</p>
      <p>There is no strength in the sick body, already exhausted before this illness; therefore, I have not yet fully risen from the bed from which I write this.</p>
      <p>However inconveniently, as you see, I write, I could not remain silent any longer; but I wanted to converse these few things with my brother and dearest friend, whom I commend to God.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently and greet the friends, Mr. Philipp Pontasel, both consuls, Zanchi and the fellow ministers. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
