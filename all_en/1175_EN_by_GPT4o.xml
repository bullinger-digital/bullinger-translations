      <p> Greetings. Although you easily excuse the rarity of my letters, and even, in your fairness, you voluntarily release me from this duty, I am nevertheless ashamed of either my laziness or excessive carelessness, for being less diligent towards you than towards some common friends. The reason for this is that others, by importunately demanding, shake off my lethargy; you, who more liberally indulge, allow me to remain silent. And indeed, I am so fatigued by constant writing that I almost often, broken by weariness, hate the letters themselves. I wish this moderation of yours would prevail among others, so that by writing less, it would be possible to faithfully cultivate friendship. But our Frenchmen, in this respect, urge me more than inconsiderately. Thus, by satisfying the public, I make myself suspect of laziness among my principal friends. Add to this that, unless a certain subject presents itself, I seem to myself to be foolish, while I summon common topics from afar. </p>
      <p> However, regarding what you recall having written long ago, and that no response was given by me, I do not understand what it means, unless I suspect that something was sent by you that did not reach me. If there was such a thing, I will not neglect what is my duty once I am informed. Since some malicious, morose, or sinister people oppose our concord, if it seems good to you, I would wish it to be published. </p>
      <p> I have endured many things calmly, overlooked, swallowed them; but believe me, I have noticed in many ways how much it would displease Satan if the form of Agreement were published. I hope it will be very beneficial to the Saxon churches. However, you, in your wisdom, decide what is better. Although many requested copies, I never allowed myself to be led to give it to the press until it was done with your permission. I had written about this matter before. But from the silence, I inferred that it did not yet seem to you the right time. </p>
      <p> However, I wish you would communicate your judgment to me. You did me a favor with the bull. It would have been more useful if I had received it two days earlier. For the preface, in which I dealt with that subject, had already begun to be printed. Here you have a copy of it, if by chance you have time to read it. I ask, however, that you take care to send Vergerio along with the letters at the first opportunity. The good thing about the bull is that the pope, without any pretense of simulation, breathes pure tyranny. Therefore, as you say, we must resort to prayers. They say that Germany will be free from internal wars this year because the Turk is pressing Ferdinand. </p>
      <p> But since it is the Lord's to calm all the tumult of arms, He must be invoked to restrain the otherwise untamed rage of our enemies. Farewell, distinguished man and brother, especially esteemed by me. Greet your colleagues and family in my name and that of my brothers. May the Lord protect you, be with you, and continue to guide you. Geneva, 13th of the calends of March, 1551. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Calvin. </p>
      <p> To the distinguished minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed colleague, and most upright brother. </p>
