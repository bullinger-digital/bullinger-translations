      <p>Greetings in Christ to you I pray.</p>
      <p>Father and lord to be honored by me, when I first passed through Bretten, the town of my prince, I understood that mine and the W端rttembergian were with Karl of Baden in Maulbronn, to which I went, and I presented what I had from you. However, because I understood that due to the business, which it is of great interest for you to understand, and therefore a certain faithful one from yours is to be called to us, to whom these things are to be explained, I will not write more. I am sending back the articles of pacification with the Bernese, as I promised; for your son granted our men access to them, which he took with him. I hear that the soldier, who was enlisted for the Spaniard in Augsburg, is passing through W端rzburg, Mainz, Trier, and thus into Luxembourg. May the Lord avert all evils from us.</p>
      <p>From yours, who will be sent to us, we will understand where the soldier, who is gathered with you, is to be sent.</p>
      <p>Cirler and Ehemus greet you. Greet your brothers and Mr. de Chum. Tomorrow we return home from here. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Maulbronn, 17th of July, year 67.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Wenzeslav Zuleger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful minister of the Z端rich church. In Z端rich.</p>
