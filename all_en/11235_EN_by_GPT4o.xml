    <p xml:id="regest1">Greets Bullinger and his colleagues. Has received his letter and also learned about his concerns through Hartmann von Hallwyl, but finds it difficult to advise; it would be best if Count [Georg von WÃ¼rttemberg] wrote to Hartmann again, then he could present the letter to the Bernese council and request leave. Urges Bullinger to advocate for maintaining the teachings of the [Bernese] Disputation. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, our heavenly Father, be with you and all those who sincerely strive for God through Christ, our Lord and Savior, etc. Also, my friendly greetings and all good things to you and Mr. Caspar, Mr. Leo, and all those who are prepared as mentioned above, etc. Dear sir and brother in God, I have understood everything from your letter to me regarding Mr. von Hallwyl. Dear sir and friend, I will not withhold from you that young Hartmann himself has informed me of the matter; however, as you are seeking my advice, I do not know well how to advise in these matters, for the world is cunning. Also, our statutes and regulations prohibit such service (when someone wants to renounce his superiors and move with wife and child to another country), and I do not want to be involved in this. However, if one wants to do the right thing, it seems good to me that the Count writes to Mr. von Hallwyl once more himself and approaches him with a friendly letter, and if Mr. von Hallwyl wants to comply, then Hartmann von Hallwyl could take the same letter to him and personally come before my lords, an honorable council in Bern, to request advice or leave. What would then happen to his welfare there, and also the opinion of his honorable friendship, he would well perceive. In this way, no one would be wronged or treated unjustly; this is my advice. Following this, be diligent and sincere in God, so that we are not led astray and may remain with our disputation, etc. etc.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Lafontaine, young Mr. Issen, and in sum all who inquire about me in good faith, as mentioned above.</p>
      <p>Given on the 30th day of October in the year 1538. Your servant,</p>
      <p>Peter Im Haag.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and pious, highly and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of God in Zurich, my dear lord and good friend, etc.</p>
