    <p xml:id="regest1">Konrad Pellikan confirmed in his letter [from August 31, 1538] that Pergener's writing [No. 1111] has arrived; he is pleased with the affection of the people of Zurich. Bullinger receives much approval for the praise of Erasmus in the second book of his "De scripturae sanctae authoritate... libri duo" even from the Catholic side, as many disapprove of him being disparaged by some; he asks Bullinger to continue publishing. He has written further to Pellikan and Christoph Froschauer.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocent life from our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>If the most Christian Mr. Konrad Pellikan had not sent me letters full of piety and faith at the last Frankfurt fair, I would have been greatly affected by sadness; I would have been quite uncertain whether my letters, however unpolished, had reached Zurich. But now I have regained my spirit and am filled with joy that such renowned men also take into account the weaker brothers. We are certain from all your writings, which indicate to us the utmost gentleness, piety, and Christian love, that we are of concern to you.</p>
      <p>I do not want you to be unaware, dearest Bullinger, that you have gained great favor even with those who were enemies of the reborn evangelical truth, because you write that Mr. Erasmus of Rotterdam, who has deserved well of piety and letters, is a man worthy of an immortal laurel; for those words, which you sincerely write about him in the second book "On the Authority of Holy Scripture," etc., I have also transcribed to many of the papal faction. They too praise your modesty everywhere in writing; many were displeased that he was called by some a Lucian, an Epicurean, a skeptic, and other odious names. But you, most sincere brother in Christ, continue to instruct us, who are far distant from you, with your most holy writings. It cannot be said how much those writings, which are sent from Zurich, Basel, or Strasbourg, delight the pious; I could bring forth many witnesses. I have written the rest to Mr. Konrad Pellikan and partly in German to Christoph Froschauer.</p>
      <p>Farewell always in Christ with all your associates and the whole church. Pray to God for us.</p>
      <p>In Zittau, on the 21st day of the month of February in the year 1539. Oswald Pergener, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the man of highest piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the church of Zurich, most esteemed friend and brother.</p>
