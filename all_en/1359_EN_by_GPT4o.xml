      <p>News from Augsburg:</p>
      <p>The Imperial Majesty has moved during this warm season to the house of Jörg Fugger next to St. Ulrich's parish; it has beautiful gardens and stands completely free on all sides, the gardens planted with all kinds of fruits; one can look out over the city walls from there. However, His Majesty has not completely left the Fugger house at the wine market, but keeps everything there as before, etc. There is also no news of any movement of His Majesty; it is believed that he will winter here unless other reasons arise. The Royal Majesty is in Vienna, has taken Siebenbürgen; it is said to be in a very good position, and it is said that His Majesty allows the religion to remain.</p>
      <p>Magdeburg still holds firm, is heavily besieged, and many skirmishes occur; it is believed that by now up to 6000 men have perished, partly in the skirmishes, partly frozen, otherwise died, shot, yet the enemy has always lost six times more than the others, and there is still great mortality, hunger, and no money in the enemy camp.</p>
      <p>There are many Spanish bishops here, waiting to move to the council in Trent in September; but it seems as if it might be delayed for a while.</p>
      <p>The campaign in Italy is progressing vigorously, and although the King of France would now like to make peace, the Imperial Majesty will continue with the Pope; it is believed that the intention is for the Pope and the Emperor to compel the French to approve and accept the council.</p>
      <p>The Imperial Majesty is now well, often goes for walks. There is a very good, healthy air here, which one does not like to change once accustomed to it.</p>
      <p>On July 24th, news came from Antwerp by post that the sweating sickness has broken out violently in England and that over 5000 people have died from it in London in a short time. Some English have also arrived in Antwerp on the 18th of this month, having brought the sweating sickness with them, of whom 2 have died; the others were immediately ordered out of the city in Antwerp.</p>
      <p>From Füssen, ten Fenle mercenaries have been sent to Italy.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, as well as with us, it is said that the Turk is remarkably strong at sea and with his armada has already partly landed in Apulia; God have mercy on the poor!</p>
      <p>On Mary Magdalene's day, an imperial servant was at the sermon at the Holy Cross in the morning; some other Spaniards, having become aware of him, winked him out of the church and immediately took him prisoner, chaining him in three chains; threatening him with all suffering and death, as soon as the Emperor moves.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, sermons are still held in 6 parish churches in Augsburg with the distribution of the sacraments as 10 years ago; the people are always present with great zeal and in remarkable numbers, whereas at the mass there is no one, except those who have always been superstitious. In the chapter and monasteries, things go on as they did 50 years ago.</p>
      <p>A very distinguished, noble Italian quarreled with a monk and among other things said that the Pope should not be a judge in the council; for he is a party. In anger, the monk stabbed him in the hip with a knife, making him very ill. However, he did not want to justify himself against the monk; but beyond that, the monk managed to have him captured while still sick and wounded.</p>
      <p>A preacher from Augsburg also writes to me that an Italian count has escaped from Augsburg, whose servants are entirely Christian and well known to him; the count has left behind a dear wife and 8 children, as well as 10,000 ducats of annual income.</p>
      <p>The French legate in Augsburg is a remarkable, skilled, learned man, highly esteemed by the king, a great enemy of the Pope and his swarm, and it is believed that he will be able to do much good with the king.</p>
      <p>The King of England has a legate in Augsburg, who opened his mouth too wide before the Emperor regarding religion, so that the Emperor complained to the king and requested that he send another legate, which also happened; but the old one still remains there.</p>
