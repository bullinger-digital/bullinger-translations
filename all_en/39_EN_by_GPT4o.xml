    <p xml:id="regest1">The letters that Blarer sent on January 31, 1548 [18020] through Bullinger's nephew Josua Bullinger and the following day [18025] through Gregor Mangolt's son [Hans?] will undoubtedly have been received by Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Of what Blarer writes today, apart from the delay in the reconciliation [of Constance with Emperor Charles V], nothing is certain. And this is a great torment, especially because many are making frightening speculations about the impending plundering of Constance. The city is on the ground, and terrible intrigues [from the Emperor's side] are feared.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Count Friedrich of Fürstenberg-Heiligenberg was at Abbot Georg Tschudi of Kreuzlingen a few days ago, after which he immediately went to Abbot Diethelm Blarer of Wartensee in St. Gallen. Currently, many riding and running messengers are being sent back and forth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[The people of Constance] suspect that Charles V will try to subdue their city. In doing so, he will prevent the Confederates from coming to the aid of the people of Constance. Otherwise, he would also invade their territory. Charles V will delay this as much as possible to maintain his conquests outside the Confederation for longer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[The Imperial forces] also want to prevent the Confederates from assisting the people of Constance with grain deliveries or other aid supplies. Therefore, they will restrict the Confederate grain import [from Württemberg] in such a way that the Confederates can only supply themselves, but not the people of Constance as well. Should this happen, Constance is cornered. Bullinger must be aware that the same threat looms over the Confederates! The Emperor is certain: Should he accept the reconciliation request from Constance, the people of Constance would subsequently not allow him the demanded passage through their territory into the Confederation. If he then forced the people of Constance, the Confederates would come to their aid. However, if he were to conquer Constance by force, he would not yet have shown hostility towards the Confederates. After the conquest of Constance, he could then attack them at will and unhindered.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">But God will thwart the plans of the mighty! Trusting in Him, the people of Constance are safe and superior to all their enemies. Bullinger should never cease to pray for the church of Constance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Bullinger should not forget to procure the book "Onus ecclesiae" [for Blarer].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Greetings from Constance, especially from Thomas Blarer and Konrad Zwick to Bullinger, his family, and his colleagues. Blessings.</p>

      <p>I wrote to you on the day before the calends of February through that young man, your nephew from your brother, and the next day through the boy of our Mangolt. I have no doubt that you have received everything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now there is nothing at all to write, except that the constant delay in our reconciliation greatly torments us, especially since some are continually spreading dreadful rumors about the impending plundering of our city. The city is said to be completely impoverished, and there are fears of terrible intrigues and plots.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Count of Heiligenberg was at the Abbot of Kreuzlingen today, after which the Abbot immediately rode to the Abbot of St. Gallen. There is a great deal of riding and running back and forth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is believed that the Emperor will see how he can have our city entirely to his will. For he will ensure that the Confederates do not intervene, as they would otherwise be in danger of him immediately invading and causing them harm. He will likely delay the war and set it up as he can, so that he can remain outside longer and keep what he has gained in his hands.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There is also hope to prevent the Confederates from being able to supply us with grain or other provisions. For they will be held at the markets in such a way that they can only buy for themselves and let nothing come to us, etc. If this happens, we are, according to human calculation, completely trapped, and you will certainly have to follow us in, etc. Understand me well! The Emperor thinks that if he were to accept us into his grace and then demand passage and opening through us against you, we could not rightly agree to it. If he then forced us to do so, you would all have to join us. Otherwise, if he conquers us now by force, he has not yet let anything be known against you, and he could then act against you through our city as he pleases, once he has complete control over us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>But the Lord is the one who thwarts the plans of princes, etc., to whom we entrust ourselves, and we will be safest and superior to all our enemies. Ah, my brother, never cease to intercede for our church with the heavenly Father through his only Son Jesus Christ, that He may always be gracious and favorable to us in such great dangers of all things, and not give us into the reproach of our enemies for the sake of His holy name, which is invoked over us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Do not forget the book titled "Onus ecclesiae," I implore you greatly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Our people greet you, especially my brother with Zwick. May your household be well, and also all your ministers in the Lord, who love us in the Savior Christ. Farewell, my soul, and love me steadfastly as you do. February 8, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. B.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my especially trusted, dear friend.</p>
