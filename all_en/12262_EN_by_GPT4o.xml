    <p xml:id="regest1">Klarer expresses his gratitude for Bullinger's help, advice, and benevolence, which he extended to him and his sons [Abraham and Lukas]. - Klarer, who had taken Abraham home from school in Zurich because he was causing great concern to everyone, treated him with strictness according to Bullinger's advice. Abraham had to study and also work as a servant in agriculture. These measures had a good effect. - Abraham, who would have liked to resume his studies in Zurich (which was not possible due to the high cost of living), has now been offered the parish position in Herisau. The Herisau preacher Ludwig [Rösch] was called to Sulgen in the bailiwick of Frauenfeld, so the Herisau community, following the advice of the council of Vadian, asked Abraham and Klarer to preach temporarily. Since the community took a liking to Abraham, they offered him the parish position, and Klarer, who lives nearby in Hundwil, is ready to continue supporting his son, but asks for Bullinger's approval. - The wicked monk and current pastor in Appenzell, Jakob Stössel, not only misleads his congregation. He also wanted to preach in Herisau, but no more than 20 people voted for it. Klarer preached on August 9th at the church consecration [in Herisau] and warned against false prophets. Currently, peace and quiet prevail in the churches [of Appenzell]. - Klarer and his sons Abraham and Lukas wish to remain recommended to Bullinger. He should advise Abraham orally and Klarer in writing.</p>

      <p>Grace, peace, and eternal salvation.</p>
      <p>Christian lord and brother, I am always mindful of your exceptional loyalty, help, advice, and kindness, which you have always shown to me and my sons and continue to show daily. For this, I thank you most sincerely and constantly pray to the Lord that He may reward you and the entire honorable city of Zurich well.</p>
      <p>Know, dear lord, that I have had great and heavy sorrow because of Abraham, as he was undoubtedly led astray by bad company and thus became somewhat arrogant, proud, and disobedient, ignoring the warnings of you and other pious, God-fearing, and loyal lords and good benefactors, not realizing or understanding where it would lead and what it meant for you, him, and all of us, indeed for the entire cause of God. However, he now partially recognizes this and will understand and notice it better and better over time. And as I was with you and heard and understood everything, I thought it best to take him home with me and not completely withdraw my hand from him, so that it would not get worse. As I found in your advice, I have done my best, like a father, with teaching, admonishing, punishing, and everything I thought appropriate and useful for the matter, with studying, sometimes with working like another peasant servant, with simple drinking and eating, so that he has greatly humbled himself and become obedient, for which I thank God and am in good hope that everything will now serve for the good.</p>
      <p>He would have liked to study in Zurich for a while longer; but I could not afford it at this time. Thus, God has arranged that Mr. Ludwig, the preacher in Herisau, as you know, has moved and been called to the church named Sulgen (located in the bailiwick of Frauenfeld). Therefore, the honorable captain, council, and entire community of Herisau have asked me and Abraham to help and advise them, to preach one, two, three, four times, etc., and then to look further and act according to what pleases God. On this account, they have appointed Abraham, and I with him, with the advice, favor, and will of our beloved Mr. Doctor Vadianus; the entire community has taken a liking to him and accepted him as their pastor and church servant, although others, older and perhaps more capable and learned, have also been suggested to them. And so, with God's help, I will also do my best, as much as I can and am able; for the church of Hundwil, where I am, and Herisau are close to each other, about an hour apart, etc. I have reserved for myself alone that I will first seek your advice and always act with your favor and will; for all our refuge in all things is always with you, our beloved lord and father. Therefore, I ask you for God's honor's sake, that you continue to do your best for us, help and advise us, as you have always done.</p>
      <p>I hope in God that much good will flourish in our land of Appenzell.</p>
      <p>We will also, with God's help, diligently study, watch, and take good care; for the false prophet, the wicked monk named Brother Jacobus Stössel, now pastor in Appenzell, is becoming more and more shameless and indiscreet. He is not content with misleading his church, but has recently conspired with the papists, under the guise of great holiness, to preach one or two sermons in Herisau, supposedly for the glory of God's word, peace, and unity, etc. It was brought forward, discussed, but, thank God, not more than 20 hands in the entire community supported it. Frustra expansum est rete ante alatas aves. On August 9th, there was a great church consecration from strangers and locals. There I proclaimed the divine word to them, earnestly and faithfully asked and admonished them to the divine word, peace, and unity, and also warned them against the false prophets, whom they can well recognize by their fruits, and thus there is now good peace and quiet in all our churches.</p>
      <p>Finally, I ask you, dear lord and brother, let me, along with Abraham and Lukas, always be recommended to you, all for the sake of God's honor and word, and also for the well-being of His holy church, and whatever your will and opinion may be regarding us with Herisau and all things, let Abraham know orally and me in writing for God's sake, so that we may always act to God's honor and your will.</p>
      <p>With this, God's grace is always well commended. Given at Hundwil in Appenzell, August 16, 1545. Your obedient, willing Walther Klarer.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his beloved lord and brother.</p>
