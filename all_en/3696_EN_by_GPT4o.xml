      <p>Greetings. I received and read your letters with the usual reverence and great joy, my venerable and dearest brother in the Lord. I have begun to hope for better regarding the situation in WÃ¼rttemberg, after learning not long ago from a certain noble Frenchman, who returned to Geneva after successfully completing some business with Count von Rappenstein, that this count firmly and piously asserts that the rumors about that cruel decree are entirely unfounded, although my mind is still troubled by your letters, in which you indicate that you have seen it. However, I think it possible that some forged document was presented to you, which I would wish to be the case as much as I desire the well-being of the Christian prince, who is otherwise commendable in many respects, and the tranquility of the churches. What you write about the Turk is truly dreadful.</p>
      <p>I hear that the King of France has cleverly deceived him and yet complains of being deceived by him; thus, they believe he will be an enemy henceforth, because he neither found a prepared army to meet him nor were the agreed-upon funds paid on time. He had armed a fleet larger than usual, which set sail less than a month ago and attempted nothing, even though the French had hoped that Nice would be theirs at its first landing; but you may already have more certain information about these matters.</p>
      <p>Let us continually implore the Lord that we may escape this ultimate destruction, which we see threatening our Germany, with the few whom the Lord knows. More on other matters later; for I am now so overwhelmed that I can do nothing else.</p>
      <p>I earnestly wish to be commended to our common Savior Christ in your faithful prayers. May your household be well, along with all your dear ones, especially the heads of your congregation and our foremost friends. Our people, whom you know, send you honorable greetings.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Biel/Bienne, September 6, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>I was very sorry that you returned the matrimonial case as I sent it, and I wish you had kept it longer, so that, when you had time, you could read it more carefully and respond solidly to the objections raised. For I cannot be persuaded that you can seriously approve the contract of such a marriage, but rather I think you were in such a hurry that you either did not read it or read it so hastily that you did not sufficiently consider it. I was asking for your judgment, especially regarding a judge of yours, about an old man, not just any old man, but an old eunuch who is emasculated on both sides, wanting to marry a girl.</p>
      <p>Regarding the other old man, I think there is no one who doubts; but here there are many things that seem to prevent this from being a legitimate marriage. A girl marries an old eunuch who is castrated on both sides.</p>
      <p>What else does she do, I ask, but scorn and trample upon the divinely prescribed law for all to live chastely and modestly, who suffer from incontinence, and not only does she reject the remedy of burning, but she also seeks a new fan for her passion from the lustful and indeed monstrous handling of an old eunuch? Therefore, one who willingly wishes to perish should not be indulged, but rather restrained by the bridle of Christian law, lest she hurl herself headlong. If anyone objects that she should first be seriously admonished to prudently deliberate with herself on what she should do, for any future repudiation, if she is led by regret, will be denied, and thus, if she knowingly and prudently persists in her intention, no injury is done to one who is willing and consenting, then indeed by the same argument all who have vowed celibacy, having prudently deliberated long beforehand, will be bound, monks and priests, even with a solemn oath. But from where is Christian liberty vindicated for them, unless because true jurists teach that nothing is more opposed to consent than error? And you know, I am sure, that the Roman praetors of old ordered agreements to be kept with the exception "provided they are not against the laws." What, then, is more contrary to the law of Christian liberty than if a girl imposes such a snare on herself, from which she, who is not yet burning, will later never be able to free herself from the lustful contact of such a man? I beseech you by Christ, my soul, to consider this favorably; for I will not argue contentiously with you here, who know how I have embraced all your matters with the utmost agreement until now; but I will show myself entirely teachable if I hear better from you, which I hope will be the case. I am indeed held here by no light anxieties, nor do I think that in this matter only the girl's interest should be considered, but also the honor of nature, which will openly dictate, as it seems to me, that such marriages cannot be legitimate. And Solomon, calling marriage the covenant of God, commendably recommends its reverence to us with this epithet, so that it may not be profaned beyond the counsel of the author. Moreover, our Christ exempts this kind of eunuch from the laws of marriage, when the disciples said it is better for a man to live without a wife. By the bowels of Jesus, I beseech and implore you to free me here.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and brother, to be honored and cherished above all.</p>
