      <p>Greetings and blessings. We also hear from elsewhere, not without great sorrow of heart, that our faithful brothers in France are enduring the most severe persecution. Therefore, we diligently pray to the Lord and urge everyone to pray, that He may grant them steadfastness in faith and break the fury of their enemies. What the prophets and apostles foretold is now happening, so that this matter may strengthen us in the cause of Christ, even though in the meantime we grieve for the loss of so many excellent people in faith, as far as their bodies are concerned. These events prepare us for the same battle.</p>
      <p>At present, we enjoy some peace: however, I fear the time of testing will come.</p>
      <p>Yet the merciful Lord can overthrow the bloodthirsty plans of His enemies and those who oppose the course of His word. For obtaining this, we will never cease to supplicate the name of our Lord God.</p>
      <p>You indicate that the noble Count of Erbach greatly desires that the princes convene to resolve the disputes. You ask what I think about this matter.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will freely tell you, my esteemed lord and dearest brother, what I think. I desire nothing more and daily ask the Lord in my prayers that those harmful disputes, which I see delaying and overturning the course of God's word among many, may be removed, and that our adversaries may be made more fierce and the weak fatally wounded. However, if the disputes are to be removed through a convention, it must be established legitimately and sincerely, without tricks or practices, and those called to it should be lovers of peace and steadfast in sound doctrine, not invincible wranglers. If you exclude those most obstinate wranglers, whose number is great, not only in Saxony but also in other regions, they will continually protest and have their followers, and the conflict and contention will remain in the midst, perhaps even sharper after the colloquy than before. If you admit them to the colloquy, and they are unwilling to depart even a hair's breadth from their preconceived opinion, which they will certainly do, we will depart with the matter unresolved, and thus provide our enemies with a more plausible argument for boasting about our irreconcilable discord, etc. And indeed, we are continually burdened with a heavy prejudice, preventing us from hoping for any reconciliation. For since the most illustrious princes of Germany once offered their confession, which they call the Augsburg Confession, to the Emperor and all the orders of the Empire, along with the Apology, which they want to be the interpretation of the confession, and which they later approved in so many conventions, indeed professing to retain it exclusively, they now not only impose it on all others but want it to be the rule of religion and the medium of pacification. Those who embrace it are recognized as brothers; those who do not are considered enemies, heretics, schismatics, and seditious people. What that confession is, along with the Apology, I need not often repeat, as I have indicated it many times: namely, that we do not now accept the article on the Lord's Supper and the confession of sins and private absolution, nor have our churches ever wanted to accept them. If in the colloquy that confession with its apology is to be the formula of agreement, I do not see why we should hope that such a colloquy can remove harmful disputes. There is also something in our otherwise dear brothers that not a little disturbs and prevents us from conventions, lest if we happen to meet among ourselves, we may be pitted against each other, even unwillingly, as the Lutherans were pitted against each other at Worms. Brother Beza, our beloved and learned and eloquent brother, was at Worms, and there he offered a confession composed or at least moderated and tempered for concord by Philipp, in the name of the French churches, which inclines towards the Augsburg Confession. He also offered a confession to the Prince of Württemberg last year in the name of the Swiss and Savoyard churches (without having received any commission from any minister or brother for this matter), in which he gave what we have never given here, nor will we ever give, as we have said both in person and in writing. And he also left another confession of the same kind concerning the faith of the Lord's Supper with the Prince Palatine. These confessions are still in the hands of the princes, indeed, and of learned men, who promise themselves that concord can easily be patched up, since such confessions of yours exist, to which we have given as much as neither Zwingli nor Oecolampadius nor any of our predecessors ever wanted to give.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if those were to be objected to us, as they would certainly be objected to in the colloquy, would we not be compelled to contradict them? If we do this, will we not profess to disagree among ourselves? Thus, seeking concord, we will find discord and place a great stumbling block before many. What about the confession you published in Geneva in your academic laws, in which you seem to incline more towards the substantial Lord's Supper of the Augsburg Confession than towards our agreement.</p>
      <p>When we were composing it, you know, we opposed in every way, nor did you object, that we should never use the unfortunate term "substance," and finally that we should not use words that inculcate an incomprehensible and ineffable mode. But now you use them: that Christ feeds or quickens our souls with the substance of His body in an incomprehensible manner. Not that we deny the true body of Christ to be true food, but that we rightly abhor the term "substance of the body," which has caused so many disturbances in the church: and our adversaries still contend that the substance of Christ is present bodily and feeds bodily, etc. But we also confess that the mode of presence and eating is comprehensible and expressible, since it is perceived by faith, and the mode is spiritual: a term used by Scripture and all antiquity. I say this in passing, not to one who is ignorant but to one who knows, and because I would wish and desire that those things be omitted, as I fear that these and similar things, if ever it comes to a colloquy, will give rise to mutual dissent among us, with whom we have nevertheless protested to agree in writing. If we persist on both sides in that writing, we will undoubtedly cut off the occasion for all dissensions and suspicions of dissensions, lest perhaps, wishing to agree with others who do not want our friendship, we ourselves be torn apart, etc. If there will be no danger in these and similar matters, I will never oppose any legitimate conventions. But if there is a danger that more serious quarrels and greater offenses will arise from the colloquy than before the colloquy, I am sure you and all the pious will think with me about those things that are of peace and can cause less offense. For my simplicity, I entirely believe that a more stable agreement can never be established than when what the pious feel is expressed with plain and significant words, and they abstain from words that obscure or involve the simple truth.</p>
      <p>Men must yield to the truth, and the truth must not be bent and tempered according to the will of men. I write this especially for those who say, and perhaps write to you, that for the sake of peace and concord, certain words must be conceded, especially the word "substance," even if it can be interpreted in either direction, especially since the Protestant princes, because of the Emperor, do not want to do without that word in a conciliatory writing. But I think that the many thousands of faithful throughout Europe now living and the greater consideration of posterity should be valued more than the Emperor and some men, who strive more for their own reputation and contention than for the simple truth. Nor do I doubt your piety in this matter, and for that reason, I freely open to you, my singular friend and brother, what I feel, and I trust you will consider all my words favorably. Live and farewell together with all the fellow ministers and brothers, especially Mr. Beza, Mr. Viret, Mr. Budé, Mr. Jonville, Normand, Crispin, Badius, and the rest. Mr. Sebastian will explain to you the Polish matters.</p>
      <p>He will also tell you what he has heard about Vergerio.</p>
      <p>Mr. Wilhelm Klebitz of Brandenburg has been dismissed by the Elector Palatine because of a dispute he had with Mr. Tilemann Heshusius, the superintendent of Heidelberg, who has also been dismissed.</p>
      <p>Heshusius is very Lutheran, while Wilhelm has somewhat defended our side.</p>
      <p>We write to the prince and pray for his reconciliation and restoration. Again and again, farewell, honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 30, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
