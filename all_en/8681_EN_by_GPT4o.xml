      <p>Greetings. We have diligently read all the writings on excommunication and are now finally sending them back, which we would have done sooner if we had not lacked a suitable messenger. The advice is pleasing and perhaps will please even more in the future, those whom the practice of things and daily experience will render as teachers. I especially thank you for sharing them and for allowing Dr. Erastus's authority to have such influence with you.</p>
      <p>Even Dr. Haller, along with the others, sends you greetings. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, 1571, October 12.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Benedikt Aretius.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful minister of Christ and his honorable lord, etc.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
