      <p>On May 15th, His Imperial Majesty had the Interim published at his lodging in the presence of the king and his son, which was generally accepted, except that Margrave Hans of Brandenburg, the brother of the Elector, and Duke Maurice of Zweibr√ºcken protested against it and thereby greatly angered the emperor. Duke Maurice also did not want to consent, saying he had promised his territory to let them remain in their religion, etc. Duke Ulrich's councilors also did not consent to it. The cities gave a reserved response, to which His Imperial Majesty said: he is confident the cities will not cause any harm to His Majesty; therefore, they are now writing to each other to decide what they want to do.</p>
      <p>His Imperial Majesty has requested a considerable sum of money from the estates; this should be kept as a reserve in case unrest arises again in the future in the German or other nations, so that something would be at hand.</p>
      <p>The one from Lyer has ridden to the Landgrave and elsewhere, etc., as it is believed, also because of the Interim. It is believed that if he and the Elector do not consent to this Interim, they will never be free. The Lower Austrian lands have urged the estates for the construction of some fortresses and also some garrisons. Negotiations are being conducted with those in Prem just as with us regarding opening and restitution; what follows further, time will reveal.</p>
      <p>This has been written to my lords by their envoys. What I write to you at all times, you may also let your lords read, as it has been permitted to me by my lords, the secret ones, unless I indicate to you that you should keep a matter in confidence. I ask without ceasing, together with your church, for us.</p>
      <p>The messenger will deliver a small package to you; you should send it along with the letters to Klota to the bailiff. But if you do not expect to have a messenger soon, then send it directly to Marcell in Ror by your own messenger.</p>
      <p>If it can be done in any way, ensure that the Interim is copied immediately; it is important for us that it is returned as soon as possible; this will be easy if five or six young men divide the work of copying among themselves; then they will complete everything in two or three hours without any trouble. I would have arranged for it to be copied here and sent you a copy in a few days if the messenger had not been so certain. But since you indicated in previous letters that you greatly desire it, I did not want to delay any longer, etc.</p>
