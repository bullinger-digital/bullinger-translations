    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Hans Vogler the Younger will report how in Augsburg, where the demons rejoice and frolic, almost hellish conditions prevail! Oh, when will God put an end to this misery, this scandalous situation, and this tyranny of the powerful? This insolence burdens the pious so much that they hardly expect that the proclamation of God's word will remain with them. Emperor Charles V clings so unwaveringly to the old features of his religion that his attitude towards the Christian religion becomes quite clear, indeed the pious have reason to fear him. If, in view of this misery and the sighs of the pious, God does not rise, they are lost, and nothing will remain for them but martyrdom! One must incessantly pray that God's Spirit grants steadfastness to the persecuted!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Today Myconius has learned something terrible about some wealthy people from Inner Switzerland! These private individuals, who fear neither God nor man, but only think of themselves, are said to endanger their homeland. If that is true, then it is over for the Confederates! Bullinger knows well enough this kind of people, who were also responsible for Zwingli's demise, just as the Pharisees once were for Christ's death. These flatterers, who have good manners and have meanwhile become powerful, organize small free meals for the common man, distribute money and clothes, so that they can count on accomplices for their misdeeds if necessary. Consequently, they succeed in things that no one thought possible. One must beware of such people and have them monitored by wise and good officials to counteract their advances. Only in this way and thanks to constant prayers can their plans be thwarted. Bullinger should calm Myconius and inform him of what he knows about the sinister machinations of these men. Recently, a good man told [...], that one hears from a close advisor [...] of the Emperor, that he no longer worries about the Confederates, as he has already divided them. What does Bullinger think about that? Is it true? Does he also believe that traitors to the homeland are ready?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The afflicted people of Constance are said to be less unhappy than their neighbors on the other side of Lake Constance, who also suffer under the imperial mandate issued against the people of Constance. It is also said that the people of Constance want to recruit a small but indispensable city garrison.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Myconius just read in a letter that the Emperor will attack the Swiss in the spring. He is said to have ordered the transfer [of the imprisoned] Landgrave Philip of Hesse to Nördlingen without his bed, so that he would fall victim to the plague there. In addition, Elector Maurice of Saxony and Duke William of Bavaria are said to be at odds with each other.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It is said that Spaniards were killed by people from Appenzell. Is that true?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [The Further Austrian government] in Ensisheim has forced the inhabitants of a village belonging to the people of Strasbourg [Niederhausen] to swear allegiance to King Ferdinand. So this is the peace that [these Habsburg brothers Charles and Ferdinand] grant! To some who wondered about it, the King is said to have said: "What is this? The people of Strasbourg have a peace agreement with my brother, not with me!" What a womanish [cunning] tyranny! May God grant peace!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings, also to Rudolf Gwalther and to the colleagues.</p>

      <p>S. Vogler will tell you many astonishing and dreadful things from Augsburg, which at this time presents a scene that is almost hellish, except for the fact that demons there are dancing and hunting. Oh good God, when will there finally be an end to the miseries, injustices, and tyranny of the powerful? They act so shamelessly, with such great harm to the pious, that they almost begin to despair of the word. For the Emperor is so immovably set in the old ways of his religion that no one can doubt what his attitude is towards the truly Christian religion, so that all good people have reason to fear for themselves and the word. Unless the Lord rises up at some point because of the misery and groaning of the poor, our salvation is lost, unless it pleases Him that we die through suffering. Therefore, we must pray continually that He grants us His Holy Spirit, who confirms us in faith, guides us in love, and strengthens us in patience, so that we do not depart from the word, defeated by the cruelty of men, and perish.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, today we have heard some dreadful things about the people from the Five Cantons, namely that they are acting in a way that is detrimental to the country. I was astonished, knowing that if this is true, it would be over for all of us (which we understood, not about all but about some private individuals, indeed about oligarchs, that is, those who neither regard God nor men as of any value, but only themselves)! You know them better than anyone else, what kind of people they are. Our Zwingli lost his life because of them, just as Christ did because of the Pharisees. Among their own, they are flattering, humane, and meanwhile powerful. They also give small feasts, money, and clothes to the common people, so that they have them as accomplices in their crimes if needed. Hence, they often accomplish what seemed impossible to do. They must be feared, but in the meantime also observed by good and prudent governors of affairs (public affairs). For the care of these can happily prevent and destroy their efforts. Although what I say is very difficult, nevertheless, constant prayers joined with pious efforts will eventually ensure that prosperous outcomes cannot but follow. However, I would like to ask you, by the Lord, to console me here. For I grieve exceedingly whenever I hear about these people’s wicked endeavors, as it were against the common country. It then happens that things become plausible, as a good man recently told me, having heard from the Emperor's intimate advisor, that His Majesty is now at rest, having divided the Confederates. If indeed this is true? What do you think? Does Switzerland not have traitors ready? May the Lord avert such evil! If therefore there is anything more plausible to you, make it known, so that I can be more at ease in this respect, otherwise, there is no tranquility.</p>

      <p>It is said that the people of Constance are happy, as much as the afflicted can be happy, and those who are across the lake complain more than they do, so miserable and unfortunate are they because of the losses they suffer while Constance is pressed by the interdict. They say the same people of Constance are enlisting soldiers, not many, but useful and necessary.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Today I read letters in which it was written: "At the time of spring, the Emperor will invade the Swiss. He sent the Landgrave to Nördlingen for no other reason than to be consumed by the plague. He did not allow him to take his own bed with him. There are serious disputes between Maurice and the Bavarian."</p>

      <p>It is rumored that some Spaniards were killed by the people of Appenzell. I wish to know the truth.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The people of Ensisheim have forced the village of Strasbourg to swear allegiance to Ferdinand. Such is the peace they have! The king mocked those who complained: "What is it to us that there is peace between my brother and them, when there is none between us and them!" Consider the tyranny of this woman! Let us pray to the Lord for tranquility.</p>
