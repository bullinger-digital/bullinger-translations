      <p>S. D. I received and read your most desired letters, Lusenius, most honorable man and dearest brother, but not without sorrow. For right from the beginning, you mention the death of Mr. Johannes a Lasco, an incomparable man, my intimate friend, and the dearest brother of all. Indeed, a quite reliable rumor had preceded your letters; but the recent and most certain mention of his death has reopened and exacerbated the old wound. Meanwhile, we must admit that it was well done with the most holy man, who, freed from these evils to which we are all still subject with groaning, has been transferred to the company of blessed souls, to the sight of the eternal God and his son Jesus Christ, whom he served, and to the fellowship of all his angels. O blessed day, when it will be granted to us also to behold him face to face with the greatest joy, who in that blessed homeland of ours will be all in all. Therefore, having set aside mourning, let us console our souls with the consideration of the communication of all good and the contemplation of eternal life. He indeed departed at a very inconvenient time; however, such are our times that he could never have departed at a convenient time if he had to migrate. You rightly write that the safety of the Polish churches was not attached to the life of Mr. a Lasco.</p>
      <p>Our help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth and holds the stars in his hand, that is, the entire multitude of ministers. He sent Moses and Elijah; he will give Peter, James, John, and Paul.</p>
      <p>The same has given his church splendid lights and has often, through the weakness of the most despised ministers in the world, broken the most well-equipped instruments of this age. If God wants all glory to be transferred, there is nothing, says the apostle, in the one who plants or the one who waters, but God who gives the increase. Therefore, let us pray to him, dear Lusenius, that he may send laborers into the harvest, that he may preserve the sheep in the midst of wolves, that he may instruct the solid ones among the wise of the world with true eloquence, learning, virtue, and authority. For the cause we are engaged in is his; the church we serve is his; he is the Lord of all, he directs and governs all things in heaven and on earth with his most wise and powerful providence. The same is a father, and indeed a most merciful father, who never forgets his own.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore trust him and commit ourselves and the churches entrusted to our faith, diligently doing in the meantime what he has commanded, and his blessing will be upon us, to him be the glory. With sorrow, moreover, we read what you wrote about Peter Paul Vergerius, if indeed he is so disposed that he allows himself to be abused in embassies, which, as you narrate, disturb the peaceful churches.</p>
      <p>It would have been better for such a one to have remained with his pope, who also previously used his services in embassies, by which he attempted to obscure the gospel and destroy the churches. For an open enemy is less harmful than a feigned friend.</p>
      <p>He has very often testified to me most solemnly that he is not alien to us and our churches, indeed that he feels the same about the Eucharist as we do, and indeed, being convinced by the open truth, I cannot think otherwise.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if he is sent by some princes of Germany either to Poland or to other regions, I should be secure and expect nothing else from him than what is fitting to expect from a friend and one who agrees. But now I understand different things from you, that he, agreeing with pure truth and our churches, tries to disturb and to seduce and attract the princes to some confession I do not know, not by scripture and solid arguments but by practices. Either he falsely testified and lied to the Lord before me and the rest of our fellow ministers, or certainly now, what he does, he does against his conscience. But the Lord lives, who looks into the hearts and is a just judge and will avenge in his time; he does not grant a happy success to such practices. The Roman idol propagated its errors through practices; the minister of Jesus Christ acts openly without deceit with the help of God and his truth in all things they do, and indeed they are stable. For although the practice of cunning men may run with happy success for a while, yet it eventually strikes a rock and will shatter.</p>
      <p>Therefore, be of strong and calm mind, persist in pious truth, defend it against Vergerian arts and perversions, pray to the Lord and be in truth concordant, and you will feel the present help of the Lord. I write these things with no hatred against Vergerius, whom I grieve to be as you describe; I speak what I speak out of love for truth and the churches. May the Lord have mercy on Vergerius and give him a whole and simple spirit and free him from practices, so that, as he once purely taught Christ and his gospel with us in Rhaetia Samaden and in many other churches of the Three Leagues, he may return to sincerity, having trampled on the arts. But if he does not do this, that man will not be more feared by us than when he performed the embassies of the pope; for the spirit of the Lord dissipated all his actions; he will do the same today. Furthermore, Stancari must be of amazing and shameless impudence if he wants to establish his error about Christ as mediator according to human nature only with writings published by me, when the books published by me clearly testify that Christ is our mediator especially because he is true God and true man. He is a mediator because he intercedes, atones, and thus performs the office of a priest.</p>
      <p>But if he were not true God, how would he differ from the priests, who were also once in a way called mediators between God and the people? His mediation, intercession, and atonement, and thus his priesthood, are pleasing to God the Father because he is the Son; therefore, he is a mediator insofar as he is God and man. And just as the person of Christ is not to be divided, so the natures that constitute the person are not to be mixed, nor are the properties of the natures to be confused. The most religious antiquity was most careful about both, lest, while fleeing the Nestorian heresy, it should strike upon the Eutychian, or while avoiding this, it should fall into that. We indeed seriously contend that the assumed body of Christ in the indissoluble union of his divinity is not therefore everywhere because it is everywhere according to divinity; for this would not only be to mix the natures but to destroy one. But we do not affirm that Christ is our mediator only according to one nature, namely the human; for the business of the mediator refers to the person. Hence I wrote in explicit words in 1 Timothy 2: "It is necessary for the mediator of this dissension to participate with men in flesh and blood and thus to be a true man, who can die and shed blood.</p>
      <p>Now if he is nothing other than a man and his blood differs in no way from the blood of other corrupt men, he will certainly not atone for sin, the cause of dissension, indeed unless this mediator of ours is also God, he will by no means be able to approach God; for it is necessary for the mediator to be common to both parties," and the rest, which are read on folio 567 in the edition that came out in 1539. I have given other things of the same kind in John 3 and you will not find anything contrary to these in any other places in my commentaries.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he is impudent, who, while I am still alive, abuses my testimonies as if I favored his error. But why should it seem strange to anyone if he twists the opinions of so many dead fathers, if a curious man asks, if the mediator is also God, with which God is he a mediator, or indeed if there are two Christs, one of whom is the mediator, the other with whom he is a mediator. I answer that this question tends towards the blasphemies of Sabellius and Praxeas, who, lest they seem to invent more gods, also confused the persons in the Trinity and asserted that the Father suffered.</p>
      <p>The faithful know that the persons in the Trinity to be worshiped are not confused and the properties of the persons are not abolished. Hence it is not difficult for the faithful to answer that objection that the Son of God indeed intercedes and is a mediator with the Father, to whom he also cried out in death: "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit." Meanwhile, scripture does not hesitate to testify that the God of glory was crucified; but who would infer from this that there are two gods, namely, the one who was crucified, and the one to whom the crucified commended himself? Or who would ask: If it was God who atoned, to which God did he commend his soul? These are profane questions devised by scrupulous and polluted and perverse minds. Therefore, I urge you by the Lord to flee from Stancarus and his profane and impious questions. You write that he slanders our writings previously given to you by us and did not want to believe that such brief ones came from us. But why should we treat more copiously those things which we have long ago most copiously explained in writings published by us? Stancarus seems to be more eager for disputes and schisms than for peace and unity. For when he was in Rhaetia a few years ago, he came into contention with the most illustrious man Mr. Augustinus Mainardus.</p>
      <p>We, who serve Christ and his church in ZÃ¼rich, were then composing that dissension. But I understand that he retains his old habit.</p>
      <p>For this reason, he seems to be most greatly to be guarded against by the pious. Those who have pleased themselves too much, disapprove of everything of others, and delight in new things and altercations have never benefited the church of God.</p>
      <p>May the Lord deliver our churches from him and from others like him! As you requested, I wrote to the most illustrious Prince of Vilnius, and then also to the Reverend Mr. Jacob Uchavius, Bishop of Cuiavia, etc.</p>
      <p>See to it, my brother, that you diligently take care of those letters, etc. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, May 23, 1560.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Lusenius, faithful minister of the church of Iwanowicze in Poland, etc.</p>
