    <p xml:id="regest1">Can hardly express the joy Bullinger's spontaneous letter has brought him. He is particularly pleased that Bullinger and Bibliander continue to maintain Zwingli's friendships. He has long been impressed by Bullinger's writings. Bullinger should especially comment on the two Corinthian letters, about which Zwingli wrote all too briefly. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I can hardly express how much joy your letter has brought me, most kind man, nor can I put into words how much I feel indebted to you, for without any merit on my part, you have spontaneously invited me into your friendship. You did not wait for me to write to you first and ask you to consider me worthy of your goodwill. While I was long and much considering how to approach you, you yourself came forward so kindly and graciously and offered yourself, leaving no duty of a most humane person unfulfilled. If only you knew how great your learning is in my eyes, how admirable and divine! You would indeed understand that you have not bestowed your friendship on an ungrateful person. Not that I consider myself worthy of your friendship, as I wish to be regarded as the lowest servant. I am very glad that you and Bibliander have decided to succeed not only in the profession of sacred letters but also in the inheritance of friends of our Zwingli, a man of holy memory and very dear to me, with whom I had such great familiarity and goodwill that none could have more with anyone.</p>
      <p>Your writings have long drawn me into love for you. May the gods grant that you do not desist from your undertaking, but that you also annotate other letters, especially the two that Paul wrote to the Corinthians. For what Zwingli wrote is too brief. I commend my cousins to you, and if there is anything I can do for your sake, command, order, and delight me more often with your most elegant letters.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name or Millis [!] Leo Jud, your bishop, and Pellican, the sincere interpreter of sacred letters. Our fellow students send you all many greetings and wish to be commended to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell and remember us when the opportunity arises. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Biberach, in the year 1534, on the 9th day of the month of July.</p>
      <p>Your Bartholomäus Müller, preacher of Biberach.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Heinrich Bullinger, leader in the word of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
