    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends Sebastian Meyer's commentary on the Apocalypse for review and requests an introduction or a letter of recommendation from Bullinger, Leo Jud, or Bibliander; in case they are not willing to do so, he has drafted his own version. Bibliander cannot write at the moment; due to being overwhelmed with work, he has not been able to communicate so far.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am sending to you, most learned and upright Bullinger, the Apocalypse of John illustrated by the works of Sebastian Meyer, a work indeed compiled with no small diligence, which we fully entrust to your judgment and review with this request: if it does not seem fit to be published, that you return it uncorrupted and intact with a definite message. If you have examined the book, please add a title, and I would like you to also write a preface for the book, or at least have it recommended and approved by your testimony. If this also seems burdensome, which I do not expect, I would like either Leo Jud or Bibliander to write a preface and lend their testimony to the book. If none of you wish to undertake this task, you may, if it seems appropriate, add the makeshift meditation I have cobbled together as a preface, although it is rough and rustic and in no part polished, yet it is made with a sincere heart. I barely had time to review it once, let alone to write it down, as the messenger was pressing for departure.</p>
      <p>I would have also written to Bibliander, if I had the time, and the reason I have not sent you any letters so far is due to my immense occupations, as many matters of the senate awaited me, as well as the accounts of all the prefects; as soon as I have dealt with these, so that I have leisure for writing, I will not fail to sufficiently burden you with my letters and trifles. But I know your kindness and candor, etc. I ask you to consider me favorably and keep me in your good graces, and if you wish anything to be done by me, let me know; you will find and feel that I am most obedient and ready to serve you.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, on the 8th day before the Ides of August in the year 1538. Entirely yours, Eberhard von RÃ¼mlang, from Winterthur.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, his always esteemed and honored friend.</p>
