      <p>May the almighty God grant you many good years, to your dear wife and all your household, to Mr. Campell and other trusted, dear gentlemen and friends. I have received from Koblenz the honorable tax of the city of Chur, 122 florins, and have therefore kindly thanked them with a letter, written to the mayor and council of Chur. Praise and thank God for the good deed. God will also grant you both His blessing. If you can bring out something new, then do it now with rich, wealthy people; otherwise, I would not want to burden the poor. Regarding Ganthner's matter, that I answered you somewhat impatiently, do not let it confuse you. I would not like him to have so rightly assumed that I was on his side and that I should have lied for him in his matter, as I have always said, I will let it remain as an honorable authority has made it; if he is truly of our confession, he should reconcile with you and show his good intentions, etc. Do right with Ottmar Caspar the best and let us know an answer as soon as possible. I think it has gone almost as you yourself wrote with the letter of the 13 places. It is otherwise certain that neither my lords of Zurich nor Bern are in the union and have not taken it up until now, etc. As I have written before, I cannot think that Basel and Schaffhausen (who have at this time refused the soldiers to the French) will give up the union; therefore, you should also proceed cautiously in this matter, etc. - Bellievre is not here, so that one would have done him neither great honor nor dishonor.</p>
      <p>In Baden, however, he is present and has given a long speech before the Confederates; it holds well in 8 pages. It is a wonder how he talks and excuses the king and blames everything on the late admiral, accusing him as the greatest villain on earth. He claims highly that he has seen and heard the things he presents, and one should believe him, as he has always presented the truth to the Confederates until now. In summary: he has embittered the places, and it is good to accuse dead people, who cannot defend themselves.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it is all a quick chatter and completely contrary to the truth. Even if the admiral were guilty, which he is not, and certainly peace and protection were broken with him, violence and injustice were used against him, what have so many thousands of innocent children, women, and men throughout France deserved, that they were so miserably murdered? But when Cain was accused of the murder of his brother and he stood to answer and gave a proud reply, he heard: 'The voice of your brother's blood cries out from the ground to heaven.' That is briefly the answer to the deceitful rhetoric. Otherwise, someone has also written a venomous little book, Petrus Carpenterius, in which all disgrace is laid upon the admiral and the believers.</p>
      <p>And it is said that Bellievre will come here and from there to Chur, to let his blue ducks fly there as well. If he summons me, as he wrote to me from Baden, I will briefly answer: The king and his people have acted in a way that all honorable people find abominable, all posterity will shudder at, and God will let His vengeance come in His time, and he should beware that he does not also bring himself into great guilt before God with the pious, etc. He will be left to ponder on that. Meanwhile, since so many Spaniards are lying in Italy and Milan, it is necessary that your lords make good acquaintance and speak there. That is the common belief of the people; it would not have harmed if one had asked the priest why he said that Easter should be allowed to come. My advice would be that one should not have engaged in hostility with Retzüntz against Ferdinand as much as possible; one would have soon lost more than gained. And since the great day of the league is present, you should always write for unity and peace. There is otherwise enough on the shoulders. Let me know how it goes on the day of the league. I will write you more at another time; now I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Campell, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Carol, Mr. Victor, Bonet, Mr. Caspar von Salis, and especially my son Johannes von Salis and Bartholomäus Hertner, and finally all friends. Dated January 2, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
