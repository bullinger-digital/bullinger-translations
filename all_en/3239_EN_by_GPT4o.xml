      <p>I have labored diligently to obtain letters to the princes.</p>
      <p>For I easily understood that a delegation was not to be sent. But what I intended did not succeed. Our most honorable Senate, as well as that of Bern, did not think that anything should be done here. Meanwhile, a confession is sent to Master Peter Martyr, taken up by you in the delegation on behalf of the Waldensian brothers, deposited with the princes among them. If it was composed and presented by you, we ought to have been informed of it at least. We hear it is being spread with great joy by the adversaries and to the sorrow of our own. This is reported from Frankfurt and Heidelberg. Confessions ought to be clear and not at all ambiguous or doubtful, especially in those matters which are controversial. I certainly would neither make such a confession nor subscribe to one made or written by others.</p>
      <p>However, I wish that such a confession was not presented by you, if indeed it was presented by you. The same judgment is shared by the others who have seen it.</p>
      <p>Although it has been made available to only a few so far. Farewell. May Master Calvin, Master Farel, and the other brothers be well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 16, 1557.</p>
