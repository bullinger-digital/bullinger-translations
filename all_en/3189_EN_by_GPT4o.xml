      <p>S. D. Your letter, esteemed and beloved compater (godfather) through brother Guido, has been delivered to me. Until now, accustomed and delighted by solitude, you have been ignorant of what the world is; but now, drawn into the theater of the world, you see things you did not expect, you experience many things, you learn much. If St. Jerome had not loved solitude so much, he would have left more useful books for the church; now, since he confined himself in his cell in Bethlehem, he neither knew nor wanted to learn how sinners are to be extracted from the dregs of the world and what or how to act with the children of this age, so that they might have some regard for God. Rightly, St. Augustine, who learned through many years of service to the church of God with varied experience how to conduct oneself in the church of God, was preferred by the most holy over Jerome, and he greatly benefited the church of God.</p>
      <p>Therefore, be of good cheer, the Lord will be with you, and one day will teach another; only remember this always: Be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves. Always strive to retain the purity of faith and doctrine unblemished. I do not doubt that the familiarity and friendship of Mr. Friedrich von Salis will be of great benefit to you; for he is an eloquent man, learned and most devoted to piety.</p>
      <p>I do not command or advise you to assist the legate against the liberty of the fatherland; but, when leisure permits, confer with him about religion, encourage him towards virtues and piety, lest he be deprived of a holy advisor. Furthermore, if the people, a beast with many heads, do not retain the newly restored liberty unblemished, but throw themselves again into the snares of the Emperor and follow his standards, you rightly judge that it would be wiser to cultivate friendship with the king. But it is neither yours nor mine to advise them or urge them; our function looks elsewhere. Hence, I approve of your response that you gave to the legate. Here, we must persist in prayers to the Lord, that he may provide for a matter almost desperate, and persevere in the proclamation of the sincere word of God.</p>
      <p>A delegation will be sent to the King of the French from the four cities of the Swiss professing the gospel, to plead the cause of the endangered faithful in Piedmont; for a great number of faithful have arisen in those parts, whom the king had ordered to be persecuted.</p>
      <p>The Saxons have again published the most slanderous and foolish books against us. A colloquy has been arranged at Regensburg by the estates of the empire to be held at Worms on the 24th of August next. Ferdinand the Emperor or the Bishop of Speyer will preside, the assessors will be the Elector of Saxony and the Prince of WÃ¼rttemberg, the Archbishop of Trier and the Archbishop of Salzburg; six colloquists have been designated on each side, as well as auditors and notaries. I cannot include the names of each in a short letter.</p>
      <p>In the Netherlands, many are captured because of the gospel; some of these have been executed and found firm in faith. On the 18th of June, a diet of princes will be held in Frankfurt. But what, I pray, is happening in Apulia? Live and farewell with your honorable wife and dear children, with Mr. Philipp, Pontisella (about whom we wonder what has happened) and our consuls and friends. You will most diligently greet Mr. Legate, who recently came to you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 21st of May, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my much esteemed and beloved compater and brother.</p>
