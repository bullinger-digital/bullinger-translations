      <p>Greetings. I sent the last part of the response to Brentius to your treasurer Sprüngli last Wednesday, and I hope it will be returned to you soon. Since you wanted to know what I had observed, I thought it necessary to remind you of one thing: that the matter concerning the "wäterhanens" which you requested from Brentius, whether from Staphylus or Latino, should be delivered, as he indeed deserved it well with the fact that he aligned himself with the Interim, and therefore this donkey cannot yet be sold to Dr. Martyr. I have advised Dr. Josias, your son-in-law, about this in more words. Furthermore, I ask you, reverend godfather, to make your Tertullian available to me; I will return it tomorrow. Farewell. I also congratulate you on being relieved of the Brentius troubles.</p>
      <p>Your Wolphius.</p>
