      <p>God be eternally praised, who has once again shown His help, may He also give us strong spirits. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dear lord and brother, new tidings, considering my lord Doctor from Wadt, the faithful, and I, bearing more than we. Therefore, whatever you have further, let him know. We hear that the day in Augsburg has begun; it will bring something. Hohenasperg the castle has surrendered. It is said that Spät has come with Duke Ulrich's named lady to Ravensburg, having requested to settle there. Thus he was told: he may seek justice in their place etc. So he left, it is said: to Innsbruck. The fear is here. If you consider that the duke will soon place preachers in the land etc., or what you perceive. God has driven the enemies away, and not man. Whether the duke remains quiet or acts further etc., do not let it trouble you.</p>
      <p>My (My) wife has once again been denied all rights in the Rhine Valley by the abbot's bailiff. The command of the eight places still helps nothing. God willing, I will be with you again on the day. May the Lord comfort you along with your wife and mother.</p>
      <p>Done in haste, St. Gallen, Friday before Pentecost in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Greet Leon and others for me.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and friend M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to hand.</p>
