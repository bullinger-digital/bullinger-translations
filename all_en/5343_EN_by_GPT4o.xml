      <p>S. What your messenger has brought here, I do not yet know; the council is still in session, and he himself asserts that he will soon leave again once it rises. However, we will soon hear what it is.</p>
      <p>Regarding the response to the council, nothing has been decided by our people; as I hear, it has been entrusted to your people to prepare a common response, and ours have been waiting for this until now. I suspect there is something from the Prince of Württemberg; for it was entrusted to your people to write to him about sending a delegation to France, in case our people might also join the legates of the princes. Yesterday, I received your second letter through another messenger.</p>
      <p>What you have written secretly to Mr. Diesbach, I do not yet know; for I have not yet had the opportunity to meet him.</p>
      <p>However, I saw him yesterday after dinner, seriously and for almost three hours, conversing with Steiger. Today, the deacons are gathered, and something significant is being discussed.</p>
      <p>What this is, however, is unknown to me, except that I suspect it is about the pass; they have (which I write to you in secret) rejected and advised my lords and citizens to write to them about it. But when it was heard that Zug should not go, the writing was put on hold until further notice, and the matter is to remain secret otherwise.</p>
      <p>The citizens are, by God's grace, very courageous in this matter and would like to find the same among the other cities. In Solothurn, it is certain that they have rejected the wandering soldiers; they do not want to leave them any gunpowder or bullets in the gardens. Fröhlich has gone to Lucerne; some say to hold back, but the sensible ones say to initiate everything so that it proceeds, and if possible, to raise money in Lucerne for the campaign. A treasurer or treasurer from France came here yesterday from Solothurn, to inspect the city; he brings no money, and the decision is bad. In Lyon, so much money has been deposited; in Neuchâtel, in my lord's piety, a handsome sum has also been deposited. Our soldiers have run away from the countryside, two or three, over the severe prohibition to Solothurn for service, having denied their names; but when they were rejected and returned, they were captured, lying in Landshut; it is thought they will be judged, but I do not believe it until I see it.</p>
      <p>From France, I have this: Our people would like peace, and it has been negotiated in between that the matter would almost have been brought to peace, so that the Duke of Guise would abandon his armament and return to his land, and with this, the king and queen would be restored to their freedom, in return for which the Duke of Condé would lay down arms and all matters would be set to rest, and moreover, the Duke of Condé and Guise would carry out their matter against each other by law, and also the churches would remain according to the edict issued in January, so that they may have their assemblies freely and unhindered outside the cities.</p>
      <p>While this negotiation was ongoing, one of the main leaders of the Guises rose up and conquered the city of Angers through treachery, capturing four preachers there, hanging them, and beheading many prominent people from the citizenry. When our people heard this, they were enraged and marched against a city in Dauphiné, called Villafranche, stormed it, and because they lost many people before it, they were so enraged that they won it with the storm and killed all the men inside. It is not yet known exactly what the Confederates intend; it still revolves around money. I have nothing else at the moment.</p>
      <p>I diligently commend you to the Lord with all yours and our entire church. I will greet those whom you wish to be greeted in your name.</p>
      <p>As soon as I learn anything more, I will inform you. Bern, May 29, 1562. I pray that you also share this with my brother; for I do not have the time to write the same to him.</p>
      <p>I hear you are writing or sending something through Rhellicanus's son; but he has not yet come, so I do not yet know what it is. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and dear compatriot.</p>
