      <p>I have written to you several times from the lake at Constance, about how it has risen and fallen. Recently, on a slightly overcast day, the gatekeepers at the Rhine Gate, along with some foreign servants who were also on guard there, saw a ship sailing up the Rhine through the Rhine Bridge with such speed that the old gatekeeper said he had watched over the place for many years but had never seen a ship sail upstream as quickly as this one sailed downstream. The ship was completely empty, with neither oars nor anything else on it or in it, neither cattle nor people, and nothing else, which is considered a great wonder, as it is indeed supernatural to sail up the Rhine without any help. God knows what it means.</p>
      <p>There is a serious rumor that in a few days some Spanish troops will be stationed in the city; I heard this from people to whom it was told by some prominent individuals. I do not know whether people are being misled or if this is truly the case. I am waiting to hear what has been decided and answered on the day concerning the emperor and the Roman king. I still hope that we might find some support among the evangelical places, as we can endure the right before them; yet may the gracious will of God be done in this and everything; He is the best of all.</p>
      <p>If there are no special circumstances, it would be a poor calculation on my part; for I was not a citizen of Constance, unlike the other preachers who were all citizens, and I never wanted to renew my citizenship from my ancestors, although I had other reasons and thought little of it, that it would be better for me in such a case (which I never expected, that I would not be a citizen, as it should be for me now); for he who is not a citizen can leave whenever he wants, and is not affected by the many other burdens like the others. So I left before any dealings with the king took place, so that he has nothing to say to me about it, as if I had been a citizen before.</p>
      <p>Although my dear brother and cousin, along with the others, have done nothing nor acted, except what the other council friends have also done and what they have been instructed to do. But he might say that they were true, and since he did not receive them into grace like others, they were still in the ban, therefore he had a right to their property, as much as it might concern him, etc.</p>
      <p>In summary, it will depend on our dear Lord God; He will set everything right in His time.</p>
      <p>Regarding Calvin, I thank you with all possible gratitude. If only there were someone who could translate it into our vernacular language as soon as possible; it would be a great service. There are those who could do it successfully. There are countless people who are completely confused by these things or are certainly disturbed, so that they begin to waver, who seemed very steadfast just a short time ago. If you can spur on some of your own people here, and you certainly can, I have no doubt, please encourage them to divide the work among themselves and complete it in a few days, gaining great favor with everyone for this reason.</p>
      <p>I am sending you 18 kreuzers for the copies; I hope it is correct. I express my diligent and high thanks to you. You should have collected the money from the messenger; but it is fine. How gladly I would still have two more copies, if it were not possible, but I would much rather draw.</p>
      <p>We have a particularly pious and learned young man or rather a youth, Jacob Funckelin; he has also been a guest in Zurich; he is otherwise called the young Schnellen, with whom my cousin Walthart and the other four young men, who are now with Wolphio, were previously in board and learning in Constance. He has now been requested by the peasants of TÃ¤gerwilen in Thurgau, near the city, to be their pastor. However, the bishop has the tithes there and gives the pastor a corpus, and Wilhelm von Payer, the bailiff of Gottlieben, is also the administrator there on behalf of the bishop. He has also arranged with the bishop that he is quite content for him to be there, as he otherwise has to provide them with an evangelical preacher according to the peace of the land.</p>
      <p>They have all agreed with him so that he moved there a few weeks ago. But now they have let him know that he will not receive any grain or oats, etc., until he has served the whole year, which he did not expect at all, and he does not know how to manage the situation; for he would have to incur debts and take on loans, and before the year is over, he might find himself unable to pay and perhaps nothing would come of it, etc.</p>
      <p>But they will not give it to him otherwise, and we suspect it might be a contrived thing from the bishop, who has cast a displeasure on him after learning that he has my dear cousin Conrad Zwick's four youngest sons with him, whom he is teaching; but he has them in St. Gallen, where he has stayed since the storm in Constance, and he has also kept them with him, and since we have just now heard the rumors about the Spaniards, that they are supposed to come to Constance, it is as if we have been cut to the quick, as they say, and we are concerned that disgrace and shame might befall him and his dear wife, and since he is truly a particularly pious, God-fearing young man, very upright, fruitful, and who now teaches and preaches very well and eruditely, having practiced it diligently from his childhood years, for although he has a small but understandable speech, we know that wherever he goes, he will be well received, so it would be my dear brother's and cousin's, also my very earnest request, if you could find or arrange a position for him, that you would do so. For certainly and truly (trust me on this) you would not go wrong with him in terms of piety or skill.</p>
      <p>I have never heard anyone in Constance (speaking to you) who preached more eruditely and better; for he is very diligent in it. I have always had a special love for him and still do as my own heart. If I were to come to Bern, I would not have left him behind; for if it were possible, I would always like to have him with me or at least not far from me. He is about 26 years old and has managed his dear wife well, but he is also very much burdened by the same, especially by the lake. He might perhaps come back to it in time. Therefore, do the best. It would be a great service to all of us and for the sake of our young sons. I would also like to send a son to him; he is only 10 years old; he can manage them very well, as can his wife, who is tireless with the boys. If we have to leave the country, they might perhaps let the children stay for a while, but in the place where he is now, we notice that the gentlemen and children are hated...</p>
