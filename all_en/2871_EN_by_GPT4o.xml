      <p>S. We have now twice received your golden gifts, I mean the gift of books sent to us. I give eternal thanks; when I have read them all, I will write more, as you ask; perhaps it is pleasing for nightingales to hear the tones of cuckoos.</p>
      <p>A comet has been seen wandering for several weeks here; for it was very rarely seen at the same hour in one place. For at the ninth hour of the night, it was seen above one part of the city, and at the ninth hour of the following night, it was seen far away in another place. We must hope that God still wishes us well, as He warns us, which He would not do if He held us all in hatred.</p>
      <p>Many soldiers of the Emperor are passing through here from Italy to Germany, quite wealthy and well-equipped. Some say a truce has been agreed upon; to some, it seems entirely unlikely. Royal affairs are wicked; therefore, any one of them could easily break the faith given to another.</p>
      <p>Comander is very weak in sight and not robust in body; yet he performs his duty in his usual manner. It is truly gratifying that the small gift, a sign of my gratitude towards you, which is your humanity, you consider favorably. I know you deserve greater things, I know; but I will not deprive the Lord of His kindness by paying it myself. Kindly consider our simplicity. We see that we should no longer expect a German schoolmaster. I have no instructions; the lords will send to Lindau for another.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell in the Lord Jesus, most worthy of life among men, and do not cease to love your Philipp.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 24th of March, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours in all humanity, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered lord by all the pious. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
