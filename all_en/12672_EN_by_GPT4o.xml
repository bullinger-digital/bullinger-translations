    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Thanks to Bullinger's last letter [not received], Myconius now knows that [Sebastian] Schertlin is not a traitor, because it had been said throughout the city that he was the traitor Bullinger had written about in his previous letter [No. 2607]. The assassin [Pantaleon Ebner] from Lindau supposedly said that he was commissioned [to attack Schertlin] because the latter did not, as agreed, oppose the Schmalkaldic League when Emperor [Charles V] attacked them. Although this rumor seemed hardly credible, Myconius also knows what money can do. Given Schertlin's good reputation, Myconius hoped [that it was a false rumor]. Someone [...] then told in Basel about [Bullinger's last] letter [to Myconius]. And so it happened that some officials asked Myconius today to send them the letter for reading. This rumor exemplifies the Emperor's cunning! He is driven by the devil, especially since he follows the advice of astrologers and soothsayers. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] What encourages Myconius is the conviction that it cannot go on like this for much longer. But how terrible for the poor victims of raids, arson, and rapes! This should spur prayer and a better life. A foreign nobleman [...] reported that in Neuburg an der Donau, an old preacher [...] was captured by the Spaniards, emasculated, and tortured until he died. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Through Bullinger's report that [Elector Frederick II of the] Palatinate and [Duke Ulrich of] W端rttemberg would likely stop the Emperor's army, Myconius could regain new courage. The news of a retreat [of the Emperor] had kept him from sleeping. Such a retreat would be more harmful to Germany than a battle, as can be well observed in the example of the County of Oettingen (about which Bullinger reported). If only Duke Maurice of Saxony would join the [Schmalkaldic League] and the Emperor would not retreat! Surely things would get better then! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] A messenger sent from Basel to Milan [...] reported how there a herald [...] proclaimed that under threat of severe punishment, all revenues in the Duchy of Milan, which should go to the Pope [Paul III], must be brought to the imperial chamber. The reason: The Pope had promised 12,000 horsemen and 1,000 foot soldiers at his expense but had paid nothing so far. Let the evil spirits continue to plunder each other like this! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] A Franconian nobleman [...] reported that the better part of the Franconian knights were already in the service of [Elector Johann Frederick of] Saxony and [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse, while the [Bishop of] W端rzburg [Melchior Zobel] had long since sent his knights [to the Emperor]. The knights who stayed at home are therefore hardly fit for war. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] A Dutchman [...] thought that the Emperor would bribe the Swiss until he made traitors out of them. Myconius replied that the Emperor was far too stingy for that. To which the other responded that others would probably do it for him. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> [7] Allegedly, [Piero] Strozzi is recruiting soldiers in Venice and is taking as many away from the Emperor as he can. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest8"> [8] Greetings. Myconius will still write to [Rudolf] Gwalther. </p>

      <p>S. Your last letter was most welcome, especially because it cleared Schertlin of a great infamy. It was being spread throughout the city that he was a traitor, which your previous letters also mentioned. They said he was accused by the assassin from Lindau, as he was supposedly sent because Schertlin did not keep faith with the Emperor. It was arranged that when the Emperor was to invade our people, he would invade them with his own. I could not believe it, although I am not unaware of how much money can influence soldiers. However, he has always been regarded as a man of better character by all who know him. Therefore, I have maintained a not bad hope about him until now. I do not know who narrated about this letter. Today, the authorities sent for me to send it to them for reading. You see, my dear Bullinger, how cunning this man is, with what arts he tries to wear down the best men and meanwhile inflict uncommon evils! He is directed by evil (the devil), which is why I almost believe the stories that he has Egyptians and Chaldeans, whose advice he follows; for they follow demons.</p>

      <p>One hope I have here: It will not be like this for much longer. But in the meantime, there are robberies, arson, rapes, and other evils, which is lamentable for those who suffer. For these should be like a stimulus to us for praying and amending our lives. Indeed, when I hear about those violent rapes, I shudder so much that I say to myself with full faith: The Lord will not tolerate it! There was a nobleman here, not one of ours, who reported that in Neuburg an der Donau, an old preacher was captured by the Spaniards (two indeed escaped) and tied on a table, his genitals cut off with the sharp daggers they carry, and tortured until he breathed his last. We have an example of Spanish tyranny and cruelty against the ministers of Christ.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You have restored my spirit, where you write that the Palatinate and W端rttemberg will intercept the Emperor's army. For that retreat vexed me so much that I had difficult nights because of it. For in this way, he would have inflicted much graver damage on our Germans than by fighting, as he has already begun in the domain of the Counts of Oettingen, as your letter states. If Duke Maurice would join them, and the Emperor would proceed, things would be better managed.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I do not know if you know this: I heard from the mouth of our notary, who came from Milan five days ago, that he saw and heard a herald proclaim throughout the city that all goods belonging to the Pope in the Duchy of Milan should be brought into the imperial chamber under severe penalty. He added the reason: The Pope promised 12,000 foot soldiers and 1,000 horsemen at his expense. However, he has not paid a penny so far. I say: Let the evil spirits plunder each other!</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Regarding the French knights, I asked a nobleman from Franconia, who replied that the better part is with the Saxon and the Hessian. The W端rzburgers have sent theirs long ago. Those who are at home are such that they do not easily submit their heads to swords.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Someone from the Lower Germany said that the Emperor would besiege the Swiss with money until he makes all of them traitors. I then said: "The Emperor will never do this, as he is too stingy!" He replied: "Others will do it!"</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Strozzi is said to have gone to the Venetians to gather soldiers and take them away from the Emperor, wherever he can, etc.</p>

      <p>Farewell with yours and Gwalther, to whom I could not write. I will write, however. Basel, October 14, 1546. Yours, Os. Myco.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most excellent man, best minister, brother and venerable lord in Christ. Zurich.</p>
