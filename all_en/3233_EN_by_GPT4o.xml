      <p>Greetings, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, with these my letters I inform you of my happy return to my homeland, and for this, God is to be praised, who has made my journey prosperous. However, after three days, as my lords wish, I will set out towards Venice, and may the same Lord God, the best and greatest, lead me there and back most happily. Therefore, if, while I am away, I do not visit you with my letters, which are indeed very unpolished, but I know they are most pleasing to you because of the love with which you treat me, I ask that you excuse me, since due to the lack of couriers, even if I greatly wish to, it is not possible for me to write to you. Nevertheless, I will be attentive to this, whether I am in Venice or elsewhere, so that when some opportunity for sending news presents itself to me, I will not fail to do so diligently, and I will inform you of any new matters that may arise and the success of my mission.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, most honorable Lord Bullinger, even though I cannot make my son more commendable to you than you already hold him (for you are to him like the kindest father, and you continually demonstrate this in reality), I still ask that you take care that, since he is more inclined to cherries, apples, and such new fruits, he does not indulge too much in his appetite, lest he contract some ailment from it. Also, forbid him from immersing himself in cold waters. But why am I worried, when Father Bullinger is caring for my son?</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write. I met the illustrious man, Mr. Matthaeus Cognetus, as you had instructed, and he said that he had already completed whatever you had ordered him to do even before my arrival.</p>
      <p>I did not see Mr. Fabritius on my return, although I visited his house three times; for he was called away to some wedding banquets; thus, access to him was not possible for me on the day I arrived in Chur, and the next morning at first light, I had to begin my journey to reach here, which I did on that very day, and although I left Chur without greeting him, I diligently conveyed what you had ordered through his household.</p>
      <p>The remaining thing to write is that you may always have me commended to you and, in my name, send many greetings to your most honorable wife with your children and the whole family, as well as to the excellent and outstanding men, your sons-in-law, Mr. Bernardino Ochino, Mr. Peter Martyr, and all others who favor us well, to whom I wish a long life.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again, most excellent and esteemed Lord Bullinger, and love me as you are accustomed to.</p>
      <p>Given in Samaden on the 4th of July, 1557.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you and yours, Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>[To the] highly learned and noble lord... Bullinger, my especially kind, dear lord [and go]od friend. In Zurich.</p>
