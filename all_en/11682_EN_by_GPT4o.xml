    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter, which he cannot answer comprehensively due to great demands on his time. Regrets the death of Leo [Jud]; unfortunately, the church is increasingly being deprived of its supports. He is still unsure where to send the student [Melchior Fäselin?] sent by Bullinger, so he will temporarily keep him at his own expense. Thanks for the part of Bullinger's [Commentary on Matthew], which Jakob Velocianus [Funcklin] delivered, although he has not yet found time to read it; Zwick's wife is very grateful for the kindness shown to her and her companions by Bullinger, which they would all like to reciprocate. Greetings. [Enclosure:] Blarer is always willing to provide [Bullinger], [Diethelm] Röist, and the city of Zurich with news. Has not yet heard of any measures against the Confederates. Uncertain news from Hungary; assembly of the [imperial] troops in front of Vienna; the Turks have entrenched themselves in Buda, according to other rumors they have burned and abandoned the city. From Augsburg, he received news that the Turks are advancing with 300,000 men, but from Venice, it is reported that they are not planning a major campaign, but only an attack on [Ferdinand I.], to then leave Hungary to their ally, the Voivode [Petru V. Rareș?]; due to the interference of the empire, a major armament is planned for next summer to attack Italy and Austria. From Milan, it is reported about the armament of the French, which was also confirmed by the eyewitness and citizen of Konstanz [Hieronymus] Hürus; also Emperor [Charles V.] and Pope [Paul III.] are arming themselves; [Francis I.] pretends that he will maintain peace with Milan, but will attack a margraviate that was in the possession of three brothers fighting each other. Greetings; writes in haste.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, my venerable and dearest brother, amidst great occupations, so I cannot respond as thoroughly as I would like. The passing of Leo, a man of excellent and pious heart, has inflicted a grave wound upon us as we turn our eyes to our own affairs; for as far as he is concerned, we greatly rejoice that he has freed himself from the chains of this most burdensome life amidst all the dangerous upheavals of things, to live eternally in utmost tranquility with Christ, in whom he believed and for whom he fought so strenuously with tireless zeal. However, these misfortunes fall upon us, as we are daily more and more deprived of the pillars of the church, a loss which I do not see how it can ever be repaired in these badly constituted times, with everyone daily slipping into worse and throwing off the yoke of discipline more insolently, so that we rightly mourn the death of such learned men, who are sound in faith, with many tears and utmost sorrow. Our Leo indeed lived here to a ripe old age, destined to live on with great praise among a grateful posterity, if there is to be any, and would that by the Lord's kindness we too might soon fly from here to the most desired homeland! We truly have nothing more in our wishes, which the Lord may grant us.</p>
      <p>The young man you sent, I have not yet decided where I want to send him; for the same difficulties that hinder him here as there prevent him from sticking to and continuing in his studies as he began. He remains here at my expense for the time being, until it is possible to see how he might be provided for.</p>
      <p>Jakob Velocianus delivered part of your commentary, which I have not yet had time to read; I am very grateful that you sent it. Zwick's wife cannot praise enough the great kindness with which you treated her and her entire company there. For this reason, wherever the opportunity arises, we will strive to return worthy thanks to you.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you. Greet the brothers and friends, especially Gwalther, our most dear friend, to whom I could not write now. May the Lord restore Theodor to us as soon as possible! Farewell, my venerable and dearest heart. June 24th, at the 3rd hour in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>To his venerable and dearest brother, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most sincere Antistes of the people of Zurich. Zürich.</p>
      <p>Regarding the news, there is no need for any request from me; for I am so inclined towards you, also my gracious, dear Mr. Röist and the common city of Zurich, that I would also warn and inform you by personal message if anything certain or credible reached me that might harm you. You should undoubtedly trust and be assured of this from me and let yourself be convinced that I will not withhold anything from you in this regard.</p>
      <p>But concerning the Confederates (about the general bad talk that is happening everywhere regarding this matter), one hears nothing at all that anyone intends to undertake anything against them; but it is thought that if one comes to a better understanding and is more able, one will act better; time will reveal this.</p>
      <p>From Hungary, the news is uncertain, for only that our people are slowly gathering and within a few days not more than 12,000 horse and foot have been assembled there in Vienna; it is thought that little or nothing will be accomplished. Regarding Buda, although I have written that the Turk has fortified and strengthened it, also provided it with all things, including provisions and artillery, and guarded and reinforced it with such a garrison that he intends to keep it, yet now there are flying rumors coming in haste that he has burned and abandoned it, which is not credible for many reasons that cannot be written now. We will soon be informed of the truth.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, I have letters from those who have acquaintances and business relations as far as Constantinople, stating that the Turk is advancing with 300,000 men. This is written to me quite explicitly. On the other hand, letters come from Venice that the Turk does not intend to undertake any major campaign this year, but since the Roman Empire is taking up the cause of the king, against whom he alone intended to wage war and keep Hungary for the Voivode as his ally, he intends to prepare himself for next summer by land and sea and attack Italy and Austria with all his might. But the news from Augsburg has not yet failed me, so I give little credence to this.</p>
      <p>We have received certain news from Milan about how excellently the French are arming themselves; now they have 7,000 cavalry and more than 60,000 foot soldiers assembled. One of our citizens, a Hürus, came out on Wednesday; he encountered wagons and carts all day long, carrying nothing but artillery and artillery, all over the Mont Cenis, etc., and tells wonders of great armament. The emperor is also arming himself excellently. The pope is also sending him soldiers, so it is thought that he will be able to bring enough soldiers to deliver a battle to the French.</p>
      <p>The French claim that they do not intend to go to Milan this year, but to maintain the truce, which is supposed to last another year; but they say that they intend to take a margraviate, which was held by three brothers, one of whom drove out the other, etc.; the names have escaped me. But the lords distrust each other badly; they have often angered each other. I can write no more, I must stop. Therefore, take this in great haste. Give my special regards to my gracious, dear Mr. Mayor Röist, his son, and his son's wife, many services, good and greetings. I cannot read it over; I have written in great haste.</p>
