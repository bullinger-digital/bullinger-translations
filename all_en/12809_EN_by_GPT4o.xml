    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Surely Bullinger will have received that letter [HBBW XVIII, No. 2665, from November 8, 1546] that Medmann wrote during his short stay in the [Schmalkaldic] camp in Giengen [an der Brenz]. Additionally, the Bernese [envoy Hartmann von] Hallwyl will certainly have conveyed Medmann's greetings. But only now is Medmann able to respond to Bullinger's detailed letter from May 31, 1546 [not received] (which the messenger from Bonn [...] delivered). He was prevented from doing so by travels and also due to a lack of reliable messengers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He is still quite busy and therefore writes in great haste. [First, he wants to emphasize] how happy he is that Bullinger counts him among his friends! He will prove himself worthy of this and hopes for a continuation of their correspondence. Bullinger can send his letters addressed to him to Johannes Sturm in Strasbourg for forwarding. However, he should be aware that Medmann is by no means as outstanding a person as his friend Dr. [Gerhard] Westerburg claimed during his visit to Zurich [in July 1545]! Nevertheless, he will, as before, prove himself loyal and helpful to Bullinger and the [Zurichers].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Currently, he hardly has time to continue studying. Only for the sake of the godly, bearded, elderly [Archbishop and Elector of Cologne Hermann von Wied] and his [reformation] plans does he continue to stay at the [episcopal] court. There, only a few followers of the true religion remain, and they are now threatened with death by Emperor Charles V. Despite the Golden Bull [of 1356] and the oath given to the Archbishop, the Emperor is taking all measures against the latter, who only intends to reform the churches according to God's word. His opponents are trying to depose him with the help of the Emperor. On January 24, they want to discuss the election of a new bishop in Cologne! This will probably come to nothing, although the Emperor has appointed the Duke of Cleves [Wilhelm V of Jülich-Cleves-Berg], the Lord of Corney and Gelderland [Philip de Lalaing], and Viglius van Zwichem as advocates in this matter. Bullinger may have already heard of Zwichem through Erasmus' writings or through Zwichem's commentary on the "Institutes" of civil law. Many who have spoken with him say that he is not very well-versed in the Bible. Oh, if only Medmann could personally discuss this with Bullinger or send him all the relevant writings so that the Confederates could clearly see the Emperor's intentions! Medmann often thinks about the reasons that prevent the esteemed Helvetians from being more committed to defending the religion and freedom of the [German] fatherland. Why do they not realize that Charles is striving for a monarchy and the suppression of religion? In "Belgium," he has ordered a new persecution, but continues to proclaim in writing and through deputies that he does not intend to attack religion! What hypocrisy! And what blindness on the part of the Protestants, who still have not understood that saying of David: "They love the lie. They bless with their mouth, but in their heart they curse"!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Medmann will strive to ensure that his present letter is not too short. May God bless the works undertaken by Bullinger himself in favor of the church! Many clergy in the Diocese of Cologne are nowadays using his [Bible] commentaries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The slanderous Johannes Campanus was captured by the Duke of Cleves and imprisoned in the castle of Wassenberg in the Jülich region. [His understanding of] the Holy Spirit corresponds exactly to the statements Bullinger made about it [in his letter]! Medmann possesses Campanus' verbose writing on purgatory. It is quite pleasing to the Cologne theologians, although they once considered the author a heretic. However, in his writing, he polemicizes against Luther, Bucer, Melanchthon, and Zwingli. He behaves as if he alone has the correct understanding of the scriptures since the time of the apostles! In the second book [of his writing], he recognizes the Roman bishop as the head of the church. Those who equate him with the Antichrist, he calls schismatics. He even approves of the mass! Yes, he wants to reestablish the entire papacy. He seems to grant the Protestants only the Eucharist in both kinds. In the third book, which he dedicated to Hermann von Wied, Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, and Landgrave Philip of Hesse, he advocates many views that can be tolerated neither by the church nor by other governing bodies. Should Bullinger ever get to see Campanus' writings, he will surely be amazed at this deceitful spirit!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Medmann would have liked to send these writings with the current messenger [...], but dangers lurk everywhere due to the war. However, if the Frankfurt [spring] book fair takes place, Medmann will send Bullinger these writings along with some others about the reformation plans in the Diocese of Cologne (which reveal the Emperor's cunning). Medmann can hope for nothing good from his Cologne people; they are daily encouraged by letters from the Emperor and the Roman "Aposcopus" [Pope Paul III]. If only the brave Helvetians could read these letters at one of their diets! They would immediately recognize the Emperor's tricks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] In Cologne, Medmann knew nothing of Bullinger, especially since he only returned there in 1522 from Emmerich. In Emmerich, he enrolled under the rector Caspar [von Glogau] from Silesia. His private tutor was Heinrich [Uranius] from Rees, who still teaches there. As a public teacher, he had Johannes von Elen [the Younger] (who now lives in Münster in Westphalia) as well as Peter Homphäus from Cochem, a fierce opponent of the gospel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] In Cologne, he studied at the Laurentian College under Johannes von Kampen and Nikolaus [Blockhoven] from Utrecht. Later, he was introduced to the writings of Pliny and Persius by Johannes Caesarius and attended a lecture by Caesarius on his "Dialectic" (the severely ill Caesarius is currently in Moers, 14 miles away; his condition is said to be hopeless). In 1523, Medmann also attended the teachings of [Johann Matthias] Phrissemius on Rudolf [Agricola] (however, Phrissemius developed into a despiser of all religion, turned to civil litigation, and did not hesitate to use his language skills for the most disgraceful legal disputes; he was found dead in his bedroom). In the same year, Jakob Sob began to interpret the Holy Scriptures correctly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Medmann only spoke with Arnold von Wesel a few times, but never attended his lectures. He remained faithful to the papal faith. He was found dead in front of his bed. During his lifetime, he boasted of having written commentaries against the Lutherans. When Medmann heard of his unexpected death, he gained access to his study, but found only a few letters from Johannes Cochläus and some sheets with translations from Greek texts by John Chrysostom (Wesel's writing on the Ten Commandments Bullinger has surely already seen). It is also strange that, with the exception of Horace, the editions of Greek and Latin authors found in Wesel's library showed no marginal notes. Even the other books, whether on religious or secular topics, were like new.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Matthias [Kremer] from Aachen is still alive. He even once wrote to Hermann von Wied that twenty concubines were better than one legitimate wife! He is currently the chief theologian of Cologne... The Chrysanthus [Boess] mentioned by Bullinger lives in Münstereifel and holds some office with the Jülich [Duke Wilhelm V.]. Medmann visited him a year and a half ago. Unfortunately, he is no longer interested in studying; he also wants nothing more to do with the Christian religion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The Petrus [Pherndorphius] mentioned by Bullinger, who worked as a teacher at St. Mariengraden, was an excellent man and scholar who opened the eyes of many in Cologne and the Jülich region. He was Medmann's best friend (his 600 letters to Medmann still testify to this). He was called to the Lorraine court, but was stabbed there by a Frenchman [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] So much in great haste to Bullinger's letter. The Frisian doctor is very diligent in his office! Medmann sends his regards to the Zurichers. They should pray for Hermann von Wied.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] [P.S.:] Medmann thanks for the sending of Theodoret's writing.</p>

      <p>Greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ, our only Savior. From Giengen, during my brief stay in the camp, I sent my last letter to you, which I trust has reached you. I also conveyed my greetings to you through the most honorable Mr. Halwyl from Bern, which I have no doubt he has delivered to you. Now, I will finally respond to your lengthy letter, which you sent to me through a citizen of Bonn at the end of May, to which I have been unable to reply until now due to my various travels and the lack of reliable messengers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now, even due to various occupations that keep me very busy at this time, I must write very quickly. I acknowledge your kindness, my dear Bullinger, for having so lovingly counted me among your friends, and I consider it no small part of my happiness that you allow me a place among your circle. By God's grace, I will conduct myself in such a way that you will gladly continue to associate with me and communicate with me through letters whenever possible. I believe this can be done if you send your letters to Strasbourg to Mr. Johannes Sturm. Indeed, I do not recognize in myself the virtues that Dr. Westerburg, out of his abundant love, attributed to me in your house. It is enough for me, my dear Bullinger, if I satisfy you and other good people with my zeal, faith, and diligence, which I hope I have done so far with God's gracious guidance, as those who have lived with me in the past and those who are now engaged with me in the common affairs of our homeland can testify.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>To this day, I find that I do not have as much time as I would like for the confirmation of my studies, and if I had not seen the pious intention of our good old man, the bearded one, certainly no one would keep me at the court, where there are very few who love the duties of true religion, and now Emperor Charles threatens them with utter destruction. Believe me, he is attacking the bearded old man in every way, contrary to the Golden Bull and the oath by which he is bound to the electors, who seeks nothing else but to reform the churches solidly from the word of God, in which he is wholly engaged day and night. And now some, supported by the authority of the Emperor, are striving to replace him, intending to meet in Cologne on the twenty-fourth of this month to deliberate on the election of a new head of the clergy, as they say. But, as I trust, the mountains will labor, and a ridiculous mouse will be born, even though Emperor Charles has appointed the Duke of Cleves, the Baron of Cornei, the regent of the Duchy of Geldern, and Viglius Zwichem, whom you may perhaps know either from Erasmus' mention or from his commentaries on certain titles of the imperial institutions, whom many who have conversed with him proclaim not to have much true commerce with the sacred letters. If only I could sometime discuss this matter with you in person or send all the writings to you, so that you and other Swiss might clearly see what Emperor Charles' schemes are aiming at. I have often considered with myself the reasons that delay you illustrious Swiss at this time from doing more for the defense of religion and the freedom of the homeland. It is astonishing that you do not want to understand that Charles is seeking a monarchy and the oppression of holy religion. In a few days, he has instituted a new persecution through Belgium and meanwhile, through writings and legations, promises and would have it believed that he does not seek religion. Oh hypocrisy, oh our blindness, who still do not want to be wise and truly repeat that saying of David: "They only delight in lies, they bless with their mouths, but their hearts are full of hatred" [Ps 62, 5].</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Henceforth, as much as possible, I will take care that you cannot accuse me of brevity in my letters. When I consider such benevolence towards me in your letters, may the Almighty Lord govern your labors, which you mentioned, for the benefit of the churches most holily, as He has done so far; for your commentaries are in the hands of our preachers daily.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Johannes Campanus, the most slanderous mouth, was captured by the Prince of Cleves and is detained in the castle of Wassenberg in the territory of Jülich. Concerning the Holy Spirit, it is as you write. I have his very verbose writing on purgatory, which the people of Cologne, who once considered him a heretic, have adorned with great testimony, in which he virulently attacks Luther of blessed memory, Bucer, Melanchthon, and Zwingli of happy memory, and, what is truly remarkable, he grants no judgment to Luther, arrogates everything to himself, claiming that he alone has attained the understanding of the scriptures since the time of the apostles. In another book, he acknowledges the Roman bishop as the head of the church and pronounces as schismatics those who call the Roman antichrist, approves the mass. What more? He would like the whole papacy restored, except that he seems to permit us the communion of both kinds. When you see his writings sometime, my Bullinger, you will marvel at the most vertiginous spirit, such as I believe has scarcely existed since the times of the apostles. In the third book, which he specifically addresses to our good old man, the Elector of Saxony, and the magnanimous Prince of Hesse, there are many things that can in no way be tolerated either in the churches or in other governments, which he nevertheless asserts most confidently.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I would have sent the books with this one, whom I consider certain; but I know how great the dangers of travel are at this time, now the imperialists, now the Hessians, search both foot soldiers and horsemen. If there will be a fair in Frankfurt, which is still very uncertain, I will take care that they reach you and also some writings about our instituted reformation, so that you may see as in a mirror by what arts Emperor Charles has dealt with us. As for my compatriots, as far as I can see, there is no hope; whom the Emperor daily confirms with letters, and also the Roman "Aposcopus," which I wish I could hear recited in the senate of the most valiant Swiss, so that they might more fully understand the marvelous arts and insidious plans of Emperor Charles!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I did not know you in Cologne; for in 1522 I returned to Cologne from Emmerich, where under Caspar the rector from Silesia I enrolled in the Emmerich school, using the domestic tutor Heinrich from Rees, who still teaches in Emmerich, the public teacher Johannes Alio, who now acts in Münster in Westphalia, and Peter Homphäus from Cochem, a fierce enemy of the gospel. In Cologne, I was in the Laurentian college under Campensis and Nicolaus from Utrecht.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Later, I diligently listened to Johannes Caesarius and Pliny and Persius and his dialectic, who now lives in Moers, fourteen miles from that city. He is said to be gravely ill with not much hope of a longer life. I heard Phryssenium in 1523 expounding Rudolf, who later laughed at all religions and descended from oxen to donkeys, that is, from holy studies he turned to forensic actions, so that he even had a venal tongue in the most disgraceful causes. He was found dead in his chamber. In that same year, the best man Jacob Sobius began to interpret the sacred things piously.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I knew Arnold von Wesel indeed with a few conversations, but I never heard him reading; he died steadfastly in the papal confession and was found before his bed. While alive, he used to boast among the papists that he had written certain commentaries against the Lutherans, wherefore, when I heard of his unexpected death, I obtained permission to enter his study; I found nothing except a few letters of Cochlaeus and some papers containing certain things translated from Greek, Chrysostom. What he wrote on the Decalogue, I think you have seen, and what will seem strange to you, I found no author either Greek or Latin in which there was any indication of diligence except Horace, whom he had diligently annotated. All other things, both sacred and profane, were as clean as if no one had ever touched them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Mathias from Aachen still breathes, who dared to write to our old man that it is better to have twenty concubines than one legitimate wife. At this time, he is the chief theologian in Cologne. Chrysanthus, whom you mention, is in Münstereifel, who holds some questorship from Jülich. I greeted him a year and a half ago in Münstereifel and found him very alienated from studies, abhorring the Christian religion.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Petrus, who taught the youth at the steps of Mary, as they call it, about whom you write, was both an excellent and most learned man and who opened the eyes of many in Cologne and in the Jülich region. I used him as a most convenient and dear teacher, which I can still prove a hundred times over with letters. Certainly, I never had anyone more intimate. The Lorraine court took him from us, where he was pierced by a Frenchman.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>So much to your letter, most illustrious man, more than extemporaneously. Doctor Phrysius is most diligent in his vocation. Commend me to your church and pray for our old man, who seeks ecclesiastical reformation from the heart.</p>
      <p>January 20, 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours from the heart if ever his own.</p>

      <p>For Theodoret, I give thanks and will declare my gratitude on occasion.</p>
