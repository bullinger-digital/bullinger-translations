      <p>Greetings. When I recently came with my wife to Zürich, most illustrious men, to see the city and your church, which I have loved for many years, and to commend ourselves to you, we were both indeed received and treated by you with great kindness, faithfully instructed and strengthened in the matter of salvation both publicly and privately (I especially by you, oh Bullinger) most lovingly and truly paternally. Because your kindness bestowed upon us, people until then unknown by face or name, is greater than we can repay, it will be given by our efforts, so that it may never be erased from our minds. However, having returned to our home, which happened on the Ides of August, I began, oh Bullinger, to focus on those thoughts which I whispered to you when present, about selling our affairs here and moving our home from here. Not only I, but also my wife, who was consulted with me, is very pleased with your church, the humane customs, and the location of the city. Since we are unanimous in this, nothing else will remain but to find suitable buyers, upon finding whom we would either follow the money sent ahead (as was done with the people of Basel) or bring it with us.</p>
      <p>However, we both fear that these things cannot be accomplished as early as we wish, due to various delays; yet we will pray to God with diligent and fervent prayers, that He may assist our efforts, so that before our death, our affairs may be arranged in such a way that they serve His glory, to which they are consecrated in our minds today. And you, oh faithful of Christ, vigorous and tireless heralds, assist these our wishes with your prayers to God; for you know how great is the power of constant and fervent prayer. Farewell both in the same Christ, the son of God and the Virgin, happily with your families, and from me and my wife, you shall command to be safe all those who are co-workers and fellow soldiers in proclaiming the word of God and propagators of the glory of Christ in whatever profession, whose names escape us, especially the most illustrious men and lords, Lord Felix Frey, provost of the college, Konrad Pellikan, both equally pious and venerable elders, Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Gessner, your son-in-law, Bullinger, N. Latafer, whom we heard preaching publicly, and others. To these add Thomas Blorer, if seen anywhere in your city, a man today exiled for his piety, also John Butler the Englishman, etc., whom we wish all safe and sound from the heart.</p>
      <p>From Worms on the Nones of September in the year one thousand five hundred and fifty from the Virgin birth, etc.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Waidner, originally from Strasbourg, and his wife. To the most illustrious men and lords, Lord Heinrich Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther, most vigilant pastors of the most ample church of Zürich and most vigorous defenders and propagators of all Christian doctrine, their most esteemed and dearest lords and teachers in Christ. In Zürich.</p>
