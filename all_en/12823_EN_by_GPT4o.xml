    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer's last letter [No. 2771] has arrived. Bullinger's letter [No. 2767] was also written in haste and urgency. Blarer will likely have received it well, as he knows that Bullinger would spare no effort for him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Fortunately, there was no negotiation [between the Landkomtur Johann Werner von Reischach and the Council of Constance]! However, Blarer should know that the false rumor originated from the Landkomtur's own circle!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] [In mediating a contact between Constance and King Francis I], Bullinger is willing to write to Hans Wunderlich in Neuchâtel, without mentioning the names of Blarer or Konrad Zwick. For this, Blarer should send him a draft letter as soon as possible. Bullinger will copy it and add some words of recommendation. He will send the letter to Wunderlich's father-in-law, Venner [Niklaus] Wyttenbach in Biel, with the request to forward it. However, this effort by Bullinger should remain an exception. In case Wunderlich believes this endeavor is realistic, it would be good if the draft from Constance still mentioned the name of a contact person. Bullinger is not available for this, as the matter worries him. As he already communicated in an earlier letter [not received], he would recommend the Zurichers Georg Müller or Johannes Haab to the people of Constance for this purpose.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] There is no doubt that the Confederates will provide the mercenaries requested by Francis I. They are obliged to do so by the mercenary alliance [of 1521]. The king appoints captains who then recruit the mercenaries with money. It is said that the officials of the Five Inner Cantons want to prevent this. However, they will not succeed. The people will go to war despite their prohibition, as they have done so often before. The money is already in Basel! The Zurich Council will try to keep its people at home.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Augsburg will hardly submit to Emperor Charles V, especially since Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony [over Duke Maurice of Saxony] is victorious. According to a report from Basel, Landgrave Philip of Hesse is back in his land with 6000 horsemen from Denmark and is ready for battle.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Blarer should return Vadian's letter [not received] about the events in Genoa. The people of Constance should treat Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz well. They will still need him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Remain confident in the Lord. He will not abandon His own! Better to die honorably than to shamefully submit to the Spaniards and allow the priests to return to Constance!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] More soon, as Bullinger has not visited anyone since receiving Blarer's letter. Enclosed is a letter with money [from Kaspar Seidensticker] from Burgdorf. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, strength and comfort from God our Father through our Savior Christ. I have received your last letter. I am also moved and troubled in haste and without understanding, that I have written just as confusedly as you. Yet I know well that you will turn it all to good for me. For God knows that my heart truly wishes you well, and whatever I could prove to you with my faithful service must remain unreserved.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I am very glad that there is nothing in the negotiation. But I tell you in confidence that such a rumor has come from the Landkomtur's house, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>If you wish and command that I make an attempt with Hans Wunderlich in Neuchâtel, yet without mentioning your name, then send a draft of the negotiation. I will copy it and send it to him along with the good intention that seems good to me. And let it be beneficial to me. I will send it to Venner Wyttenbach in Biel; he is his father-in-law. I will not commit myself to handle it continuously, but only make the first announcement. If it is necessary, as he thinks, to raise the matter, then someone should be named and dealt with. For I do not like to burden myself with this matter for many reasons. I still advise that you negotiate through Mr. Jörgen Müller or Mr. Mayor Haab, etc., as mentioned in previous letters. It would have more authority. I am very anxious about the matter.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>If the Confederates want to let the French have the mercenaries, there is no need to ask, for the alliance demands it: If he demands them, they must let him have them. For not they, but he appoints captains. They recruit with money as much as they want. The officials in the Five Inner Cantons think, as it is said, to prevent it. It will be in vain. The common people will forbid them; and they will go, as has often happened before. The money has already been brought to Basel. But my lords will try to keep their own.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I trust Augsburg will rise again, especially if the Elector is victorious. The Landgrave (as those from Basel write) is said to have arrived from Denmark with 6000 horses and is preparing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have previously sent you Vadian's letter from Genoa. Awaiting the return. Treat Dietrich Marcell well. He will still come to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Be comforted and brave in God. God will not abandon us. It is better to die honorably than to shamefully submit to the Spaniards and let the priests in. God will still give enough comfort. Let us ask Him for it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I will write more soon. This in haste, as I have not been with anyone since I received your letter. I send you this letter and money, as it was given to me from Burgdorf. God be with you and all yours. Greet our dear trusted ones for me. Dated Zurich, January 27, 1547. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his beloved lord and brother, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, preacher in Constance.</p>
