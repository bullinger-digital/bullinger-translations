      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>I write about Titus, but slowly; because no one has traveled down because of the wine. We have consulted with the friendship and do not find it possible for us to obtain it from the shearer, although the two sons Paulus and Titus have received a considerable inheritance from their mother. Some are fiefs from the lordship; these cannot be mortgaged. The other part are own goods, which Mr. Johannes Blasius himself has heavily mortgaged. And what he has left in Chur, he has entangled himself with a heavy surety and cannot get out before the end of February, when the monastery's accounts are settled. Therefore, it is not possible for us to find such a surety as the master requires, and we earnestly ask him not to be angry; for if it were possible, we would gladly comply with the will of his blessed father; for it is God's power and not our fault. We are settling accounts with the lady and the baker by next Friday before Martinmas; so we also intend to send the money on that day, and thank you for the effort and work you have had to do on our behalf.</p>
      <p>Greet Franz and his wife for me, and I have earnestly asked them to let my daughter be entrusted to them. I ask your kindness to meet with him, as much as he requests for half a year and at what time he requests the money, so that I may prepare for the appointed day. Farewell, live long. October 20, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his lord and esteemed brother.</p>
