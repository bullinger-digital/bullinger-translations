      <p>The grace of the Almighty be with us through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>You should not think, most beloved lord and brother, that I have forgotten you, even though I have not written for some time. I am caught in many tribulations: my son Jonas has passed away in God; after the death of my most gracious lord, Elector Ottheinrich, Count Palatine, I suffer such compulsion from many godless people that I have finally decided to sell all my possessions and leave this land.</p>
      <p>I ask you in brotherly faithfulness to give me guidance on where and in which place I might buy a property for 6, 7, or 8000 florins and settle with my wife and children.</p>
      <p>All my persecution comes from the wretched sacrament dispute, which becomes more harmful and burdensome the longer it lasts; indeed, we are all preparing for a new miserable papacy. Write back to me with this messenger; he will return to Freiburg, but the letters can be delivered to me from there.</p>
      <p>The priests here are in great preparation; it is to be feared that an uprising will follow. They are difficult and venomous.</p>
      <p>May God thwart them. Amen.</p>
      <p>It would be nice if we could become neighbors and not live far from each other. Given in all haste in Freiburg on the 9th of March in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>Georg Fr√∂lich from Lemnitz in Schlachtegkh, etc. Greet all dear lords and brothers most highly and from the heart.</p>
      <p>There is a new pasquinade written about the new pope; if it could come to print, it would be a pleasure and benefit to the truth and all the pious. Let me know your thoughts.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, overseer of the church in Zurich, my especially dear lord and friend, to be delivered. Zurich.</p>
