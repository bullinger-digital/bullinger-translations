      <p>Strasbourg, 21st November 1550.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Eight days ago, I returned from England, dearest Bullinger, where I left our mutual acquaintances and friends safe and sound.</p>
      <p>The state of England is such that one can see the truth alone rejuvenating there.</p>
      <p>The word is preached clearly in some places, more obscurely in others: remnants of papal superstition still remain everywhere; both publicly, when sacred rites are performed in churches, and also secretly in the hearts of many who boast of being evangelical: a snake lies hidden in the grass.</p>
      <p>There is contention between the pious and the false and deceitful brothers over garments and the dregs of other ceremonies; and while these things are happening, the flock of Christ is neglected. There are those who have assumed too much license, both in oppressing the poor and in leading a completely impure life, under the pretext of the word of God and the gospel of Jesus Christ. Moreover, many have the truth at heart, who truly strive for a perfect and Christian life, led by the word of God. We must pray for them to persevere; for others, that they may be led to a better life. And these things are said about the general state of England: now to private matters.</p>
      <p>The king increases daily, both in age and in knowledge of the word of God and in illustrious morals. He received both your letters and the book dedicated to him with wonderful embraces. I gave them, as you ordered, to Hooper, who gave them to someone close to the king, through whom they were offered to the king. There is no doubt that you will someday receive thanks from the king himself.</p>
      <p>I gave and sent all the other books and letters to their intended recipients. For the book you gave me, I have eternal thanks. Hooper is in good health, except that he does not quite agree with the Bishop of London. Hooper admits only initiation through the laying on of hands; the other insists on conceding things similar to papal or papal doctrine, namely that he should carry the Bible on his shoulders, wear a linen garment, and thus dressed and burdened with the book, turn around three times in a circle.</p>
      <p>This contention does not do a little harm to the Christian republic; and the end of this tragedy is awaited with uncertainty. The papists rejoice that these chief preachers of the word of God do not agree; and they hope that this controversy will utterly destroy the gospel. Therefore, it would not be out of place if both were advised by you and the chief heralds of truth of our time of their duty: perhaps peace would result from this. Or it would be much more convenient for you to write to the king your opinion on what you think of such profane ceremonies.</p>
      <p>But now, leaving these matters aside, I come to Mr. Richard and his family. He lives and is well together with his wife and dear children; and he sends many greetings to you, your wife, children, and friends.</p>
      <p>Time does not permit me to write more: what I have omitted, these letters of Hooper will supply.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet your wife from us.</p>
      <p>Yours, Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Minster, my gracious lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
