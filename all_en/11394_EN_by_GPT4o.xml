    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's friendship; many pastors, to whom he showed his letter about the doctrine of the sacraments, have copied it. The pastors [of the city of Bern], especially Kunz, have recently been speaking more cautiously about the eating of the body of Christ, perhaps because Bucer is traveling and cannot assist them. Kunz explained to him that he is tired of the harmful dispute and will soon clarify in a sermon that, in his view, the body of Christ is in heaven, but that the all-encompassing divinity of Christ is so inseparably connected with his human [nature] that one can certainly say that under the bread the true body of Christ is received; when taught in this way, the figurative speech clearly emerges as such. RÃ¼mlang, who was asked by Kunz for a statement, would like to hear Bullinger's judgment on this. He apologizes for his long and careless writing; it is to remain secret.</p>

      <p>Greetings. What I have often observed before through many arguments, most humane man, I have now also experienced; you could not refrain from urging the messenger to convey your greetings to me in your name, for which I cannot repay you equally, no matter where I turn. But such is the diligence and concern of friends for their friends, that they care no less for their affairs than for their own interests, lest forgetfulness creep in anywhere, which you have abundantly demonstrated towards me, a most insignificant person, even though you are very busy.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in return, I can do nothing else, overwhelmed by your most abundant services, than to forever venerate, embrace, and kiss you and yours.</p>
      <p>And the letters you recently sent to me, know that they are very pleasing to the learned preachers to whom I showed them, because you have so clearly summed up the whole matter of the sacrament in so few words that nothing could be desired, and many have copied those words so that they can use and enjoy them if the occasion arises, etc. Nor do I want it to be unknown to you that our preachers have relaxed their crudeness, so to speak, or rather the harshness of the substantial eating (which they also dare to call the eating of the true body of the Lord), especially Kunz, who seems, if he remains consistent, to be willing to be brought into order. I do not know what the cause is; but as I suspect, among other things - perhaps not rightly -, because they heard that Bucer has set out on a long journey, so that it would not be easy, if necessity requires, for him to be available to help them patch up both old wineskins. But whatever it is, as long as Christ is preached and it contributes to his glory, let us not be led around and obscured by tricks and deceptions any longer.</p>
      <p>I do not know what has driven Kunz. He spoke to me familiarly about the sacrament of the Lord's Supper and openly told me that he came to me for this reason, first because he is quite tired and weary of this dissension, which has been inauspicious and untimely so far, and perhaps has been a cause of offense and scandal to many. Therefore, he wants, as far as possible, for this wound to heal, lest something worse happen in the future, although he does not know of a more suitable way than if the majesty of Christ were explained somewhat more vividly and vehemently in the communion of the Lord's body. And since he himself must soon preach about this matter, he is seeking a way to make it clear to everyone that he does not hold anything contrary to the scriptures and reason in this matter; for he has found that many suspect him of trying to impose Egyptian pots on us, so to speak, when the matter is otherwise; for he does not deny that the Lord's body is locally contained and situated in some place in heaven, yet this body is united with divinity and the splendor of the Father, doing and fulfilling all things in all, and that which can only be separated from another by reason, is so of another that we rightly say the divine virgin gave birth to God, God suffered, and conversely the Son of Man descended from heaven, etc. Therefore, in the Lord's Supper, through these words: "This is my body" [Mt 26, 26 par.] etc., he does not understand the Lord's body to be given under the bread by Christ in any other way than because this matter, instituted by Christ, is carried out in this splendor of the Father and the shining light of the Son and thus in its warmth, which the shining splendor of the glorified Christ's body does and fulfills all things in all, so that from this participation of divinity and humanity and the insoluble unity of God and man, we must also say that the true body is given under the bread by the power of the words of the instituting God, because that splendor of the Father is no less effective than if Christ were locally enclosed in the bread. Although this is not the case, nevertheless the bread must be called the body, because this matter is carried out in that splendor of the Father, so that because the fruit of all his body's works is present, therefore the body must also be said to be under the bread, because the nexus and bond of the divinity of Christ's splendor is inseparable, and in this way the whole Christ, God and man, is perceived and exhibited under this bread. Although all these words only hint at the personal unity of Christ and do not prove that the bread is assumed into the unity of the person, yet they reveal how they twist themselves to establish their own; they seem to say nothing else than what no one has rejected so far. If they were to speak in this way, the trope would shine forth by itself. Therefore, he asked me to think about these things, how to act in this matter, and to soon be with him with my advice.</p>
      <p>I wanted to inform you of these things so that you may consider them and write to me what you think, so that the man may gain.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, hastily, January 15, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Eberhard. I had received a small sheet and did not think it necessary to pour out so many words. Therefore, take it in good part. I wrote late at night after dinner and did not have time to review it. And consider what is said as being in your bosom, revealing it to no one and not bringing it forth; let them be the secret and sacred rites of Ceres, not to be brought into the open, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours</p>
      <p>Eb.</p>
      <p>To the most humane and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of Zurich, his lord and always to be honored brother.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
