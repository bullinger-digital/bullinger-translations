    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger should not believe that Pfister has not written for so long because he has forgotten their friendship and his warm reception during his [last] visit to Zurich. On the contrary! He will always remember this kindness, which he has experienced not for the first time. However, since their mutual friend Jodocus Kilchmeyer regularly reports on the state of affairs in Bern, he does not want to bother Bullinger, who is busy with important matters, with trivialities. But this time he must make an exception.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He does not need to write about the youths [Ismael Buchser and Samuel Schneuwlin] sent by the Bernese council to Zurich, as his colleague Eberhard von Rümlang has already done so. However, he is just as concerned as he is that the Bernese, who were sent to Zurich earlier [in January 1547], are behaving indecently and are falling into disrepute. Bullinger should put an end to this situation to calm the Bernese church and not damage the reputation of the Zurich school. He knows what is at stake here!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Schneuwlin is a promising student. There is also hope for Buchser, provided that care is taken to ensure he does not stray from the right path. But if his teachers were to loosen the reins even a little, he would be lost! Bullinger will be able to ascertain this after one or two conversations with Schneuwlin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] He may wonder why the Bernese [Zwinglians] have not sent someone else. But one must know that they do what is possible for them, not what they would like to do. Buchser owes his dispatch to Zurich to two circumstances: firstly, the instability and cunning of better and more suitable Bernese students, whose number is not small, but who are infected with Lutheranism; secondly, the choice made by Kilchmeyer. Pfister actually did not want to write about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] He has often asked Johannes Wäber to lend him the yet-to-be-printed work [„De sacramentis“] written by Bullinger against the poison of Lutheran doctrine, at least for a day, but in vain, even though Wäber knows very well that Pfister also has to fight the [Lutheran] monster every day. Wäber always replies that he had to promise Bullinger not to lend the work to anyone else. Bullinger should therefore write to him, allowing Pfister to also view the work. Pfister would be in seventh heaven, especially since he knows that with this, all the crazy views of the Lutherans can be solidly refuted! Bullinger should fulfill this wish for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to Johann Jakob Ammann. Bullinger will hear everything else from Kilchmeyer. He should write again as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>Nicolaus Artopoeus to Heinrich Bullinger, a man adorned with piety and learning, sends greetings. You may think, distinguished man, that I have not written to you for a long time because I have forgotten our friendship, or rather your kindness, with which you received and treated me when I was there. You are indeed mistaken if you think that! I always remember your goodness towards me. I know your integrity, and I know your kindness, which I have experienced more than once. Believe me, these things will never die in my memory! However, since I knew that our mutual friend Jodocus regularly informs you about the state of our affairs, I did not want to disturb you with my unlearned letters and interrupt you, who are occupied with much more serious matters, with my trifles, which would be inappropriate. But now the situation seems to demand that I change my approach. Therefore, I very much wish that you take all these things in the best possible way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the youths sent there by our magistrate, I will not write much. The reason is that I believe my colleague Eberhard von Rümlang has already addressed this, as he was also somewhat moved by the fact that those who were sent to you earlier behaved more indulgently than is appropriate, and therefore have a bad reputation here. We have great hope in you; we ask again and again that you bring this to completion. If you do, you will greatly console our church, and no fruit of this negligence will reflect on your school. You understand the whole matter with your wisdom.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have high hopes for Schneuwlin. I have not lost hope for Buchser, provided he is kept on the right path. But if he is given too much freedom by his teachers, it will be all over for him! You will discover all these things in one or two conversations.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>"Why did you not send another?" you may ask. We must do what we can, not what we want. We still have quite a few who are more learned and more manageable than he is, but they are corrupted by Lutheranism, whose instability and malignity benefited Ismael, who owes this entirely to Jodocus. But I am writing differently than I intended.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Furthermore, you have here, most learned man, a booklet not yet printed, which you prepared as an antidote against Lutheran poison. Johannes Wäber has it, whom I have asked once and again to allow me to use it for just one day if my affairs required it - which I could not obtain from him, even though he knows how many times I have to confront the crabs and hydras daily, solemnly affirming that he received it from you under the condition not to share it with another. I ask you very much, most humane man, if it is possible in any way, not to deny me this favor and to inform him by letter to also make it available to me. If you do, I will touch the stars with my head, to use Horace's words; for as far as I can judge, there is nothing of the Lutheran nonsense that cannot be well, truly, and solidly refuted from it. Therefore, do what is asked, dearest man.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for His church for a long time. You will greet Johann Jakob Ammann very much in my words. You will undoubtedly hear about other matters from Jodocus as well. Bern, the day after the calends of July. Write back, please, if you have time.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a man both pious and learned and a most fervent defender of the purer evangelical doctrine.</p>
