    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger recommends Travers the bearer [...], a messenger of the University of Wittenberg, through whom Travers can write to Bullinger, as the messenger will return to Bullinger. Apart from the high cost of living, [the people of Zürich] are doing well. - Luther has written a book [„Kurtz bekentnis“] against Zwingli, Oekolampad, and the people of Zürich. The response to it, which the people of Zürich are composing in Latin [„Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio“] and in German [„Warhaffte Bekanntnuß“], will soon be received by Travers. - [Charles V], who has not yet appeared [at the Imperial Diet] in Worms, but is lying ill with gout in Brussels, is persecuting the [Protestants] in the Netherlands. Although he wrote that he would soon come [to Worms] or send his brother [Ferdinand I] or commissioners, most believe that he will not come. He reluctantly promised to establish peace in religious matters and is now afraid, especially since Pope [Paul III] has convened the council. - Bullinger cannot write more due to being overwhelmed with work. - Greetings to Travers’ sons [Johannes Travers the Younger and Jakob Travers] and to Anton Travers. - [Francis I] is said to have lost positions [near Boulogne] to [Henry VIII] and has been greatly affected by it.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. This messenger is a courier of the University of Wittenberg. Therefore, I commend him to your kindness, so that he may proclaim your charity and benevolence to his people. He will return to me; through him, therefore, you will be able to write if you wish. We are all doing well here; but the cost of living is high; however, we hope for better things. The power and the kingdom belong to the Lord. Luther has written an insolent pamphlet against Zwingli, Oekolampad, and us in Zürich. We have responded to him in Latin and German; you will have it shortly. The Emperor is severely persecuting the faithful in the Netherlands. He has been long expected in vain at the Diet of Worms; he is lying in Brussels, greatly suffering from gout. He wrote to Worms that he would soon either come to the Diet himself or send either his brother or commissioners. Most think he will not come; for he is ashamed of the promise he does not dare to fulfill. He promised to settle the religious dispute; now he has convened a council with the Pope and fears for himself. - Farewell. For I cannot write more now, being overwhelmed with business. Zürich, 27 February. May your sons and Mr. Anton Travers fare well. It is rumored that the Frenchman has been severely afflicted, having been driven from the camp by the English.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Travers of Zuz, my most esteemed lord and venerable brother. Travers. Zuz.</p>
