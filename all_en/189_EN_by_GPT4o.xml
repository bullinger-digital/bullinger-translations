      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>Even though at present I have nothing at all worthy of your knowledge, most esteemed Bullinger, I could not let our Werli Lord return to you without my letters, in which I would inform you that we have received your last two most delightful letters with gratitude. They have greatly affected us and partly saddened us, not only because of the tyranny of Antiochus, by which he persecutes the pious, but more because of the weakness and faint-heartedness of our people, and that among so many thousands, no one can be found who can suffer anything for God; add to this the question: whether it is appropriate for the ministers of the churches to seek safety in flight, since Christ so openly commends the shepherd who lays down his life for the sheep; on which I earnestly seek your opinion, etc. Farewell through Jesus, who may deign to preserve you for us and for his entire church for a long time. Amen, etc.</p>
      <p>Peter Finer, the bailiff in Grichten, brings a new order from King Ferdinand to reform some monasteries again; he is dealing with the Confederates today. I think he will fail, etc. Furthermore, King Ferdinand has forbidden the Bishop of Chur all his income and revenue in his land on the Etsch, and one cannot yet know for what reasons.</p>
      <p>We think there is a mystery; for the bishop sent his steward to Augsburg just 14 days ago, and we know that there is no dispute between them, etc.</p>
      <p>I have certainly sent your letters addressed to Mr. Stancaro by messenger. Hastily, Chur, July 10, 1548. All good and strong men greet you.</p>
      <p>The same yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, both most vigilant and most faithful, to the Lord and brother to be especially respected.</p>
