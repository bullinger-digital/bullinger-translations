      <p>Greetings. When Mr. Thretius was about to go to you, reverend sir, and he requested some letters from me to you, even though there was not much for me to write at this particular time, I could not refrain from at least using these brief words to testify to my respect for you, so that you might understand from them that your memory is most cherished among us. You will receive from Thretius a copy of the acts of concord, which the theologians of Heidelberg greatly approved of being published, and I do not fear that anything has been committed in their publication that might be displeasing or contrary to you. But I ask that the effort of the one who wished to do something useful for the church in this matter may not displease you. I wish indeed that the printer had been more diligent in printing them; for in many places some words have been omitted and elsewhere some errors by the printers have been committed; but nevertheless, I believe, the reader will be able to grasp the meaning everywhere. Please, I ask you to freely explain to us what you think about this matter.</p>
      <p>With this, may you, your ministry, your entire family, and your fellow ministers fare well and happily. My relative Mr. Philipp Camerarius sends his greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Given in N端rnberg on the 13th of August in the year 1572. Your most observant Christopher Hardesheim.</p>
      <p>To the most reverend man distinguished in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Z端rich, his esteemed sir.</p>
      <p>In Z端rich.</p>
      <p>"From Mr. Christoph Hardesheim, syndic of N端rnberg, concerning the published acts of concord."</p>
