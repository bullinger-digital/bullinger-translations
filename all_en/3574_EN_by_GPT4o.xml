      <p>Greetings. I have received your kind letter, and the longer it is, the more pleasing it is.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord that the bath may be fortunate and auspicious for you and most beneficial for your wife, the most honorable lady. Again, scabies has beset my son's neck; an ulcer has appeared, from which a great amount of pus flows. I hope this discharge will be beneficial to him.</p>
      <p>I am not considering the baths, nor would it be advisable for a young man to bathe so frequently. It would not be wise to send Hector away somewhere, since he is difficult to keep at home in his duties, what would he do outside or who would take on the task of supervising him? Moreover, upon returning, he would create new tasks for me; for I would have to restrain him all over again. I write this because I seem to have perceived or suspected something of this, wishing to visit the baths themselves. For the diligence shown in recalling my son, I give immortal thanks; I hope he will obey my commands. Recently, I sent ten crowns to him through Laurenz Lumaga from Chiavenna and letters in which I recall him, previously I sent 4 crowns through Bellizarius. These are sufficient for the expenses of the journey, so there is no need for you to give anything; meanwhile, I thank you for your prompt willingness. Much is said here about the expeditions of kings, much also about the peace process, for which it is said the constable has been released from chains. Many affirm that King Ferdinand has been crowned emperor on the condition that he does not seek confirmation from the pope; I cannot assert this for certain, I do not know what the truth is; while one says this, another denies it. I would gladly write more extensively; but business calls me away.</p>
      <p>There are learned men here, with whom we have conferred for two days; there are also many other things, so I have written this with difficulty. Nevertheless, so as not to give nothing, I preferred to write this.</p>
      <p>I have received a letter from your father, a most distinguished man, brief, but breathing senile wisdom, candor, and remarkable integrity. You will greet him most dutifully and tell him that I will perform the duty of a father; certainly, unless his authority and your friendship moved me, I would prefer to be free of this trouble; but for your sake, I willingly do what I can. I commend myself to you.</p>
      <p>May Mr. Travers, Mr. Bergomas, and the rest of the acquaintances be well; may your entire household be safe. Farewell and farewell again.</p>
      <p>I have not re-read this.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 22, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Friedrich von Salis, in Samaden, Rhaetia, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Samaden.</p>
