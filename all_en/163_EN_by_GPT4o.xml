      <p>Greetings. While I was intending to respond to your letters, my esteemed Myconius, two inconveniences disturbed me: first, the departure of Mr. Frobenius was more hasty and quicker than I had thought; second, my own carelessness, for I lost your letters, so that now I cannot find them and respond to each point in order. However, you know that I will soon find them; then, if necessary, I will add a supplement. I wish it were true and certain that the people of Strasbourg do not want to accept the Interim, but wish to persevere in their old confession. Mr. Ambrosius writes that he has received in good faith the letters that Bucer sent to him through you and me; he adds that Bucer is unjustly accused of approving the Interim. However, I know where that rumor originated; letters were written to St. Gallen indicating that Bucer, having been summoned by the Emperor, was asked and approved the Interim. I am glad that the one who wrote those letters to St. Gallen wrote lies, and I will not hide from Mr. Vadian what I learned from Ambrosius. I wish all learned men would sincerely promote the gospel. There is a rumor that the Bishop of Constance died of apoplexy within this past week; I do not yet believe it. The people of Constance have not yet been reconciled with the Emperor. We must pray that the Lord will be present with His church. Regarding Valtin Telius, I will write another time; now I can say nothing more.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 20, 1548. The rest is from Mr. Frobenius.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is trying to impose his Interim on the people of Constance, then to have priests admitted into their city as before, thirdly, for the city to be a private house of the House of Austria, and fourthly, to count out a large sum of money, I do not know how much, but it is large.</p>
