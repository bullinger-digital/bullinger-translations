      <p>With eternal greetings, I give the greatest thanks to your kindness, most excellent man, which did not disdain to write to a humble servant of Christ, in place of my dearest brothers, Mr. Johannes Schneewolf and his companion Peter, who, as you write, have long since passed away, who were my angels leading me out of darkness and the shadow of death. Through their persuasion, I gained the knowledge of Christ and His gospel, otherwise, I would have perished in that Carthusian sect both in body and soul. Therefore, I could not restrain myself, when your fellow citizen from Zürich was present and promised to deliver the letters, which he faithfully did, from writing something by which I could inquire about the life or death of my brothers. Now nothing else remains, as you encourage in your letters, except that I also prepare myself for this journey, which they have completed with the happiest end, to soon undertake.</p>
      <p>May the most good and great God grant a prosperous end. Please commend Mr. Ehinger; for he wrote to me much about the benefits conferred upon him through your kindness and the other ministers of your churches. Please greet Mr. Pellicanus in my name; for I use his Bible commentaries very much, as well as yours on Matthew and the epistles of Paul in my sermons, and also that fellow citizen who faithfully delivered the letters to you on my behalf should be greeted. May your kindness fare most happily into the years of Nestor. Given in Gunzenhausen, November 19, 1551.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Sebastian Stiller. To the most excellent and outstanding man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, his uniquely beloved brother.</p>
