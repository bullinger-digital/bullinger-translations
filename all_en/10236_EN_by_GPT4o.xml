    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices over a letter from Bullinger. The difficult situation of the Zurich church is a test set by God. They will support each other in prayer. Veit Kappeler has reported on the hope of an agreement with the Five Places. Greetings from the brothers Zwick and Thomas Blarer. Veit makes a good impression. Please do not respond to Luther's attack. Bullinger should soon realize his announced visit to Konstanz and share details about the omens observed before the Battle of Kappel.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace to you from the heavenly Father through Christ.</p>
      <p>Your letter, full of faith and love, greatly cheered me, most illustrious Bullinger. I earnestly pray to our common Savior Christ that you may obtain what you so ardently request for me. I am fully aware of my humility and how little human effort can achieve unless the divine spirit is present with its power, which many of us understand through clear evidence, as we often do not reap great rewards from great labors. The Lord knows His own, who alone recognize the shepherd's voice and adapt themselves to it more and more, as He gives them the ability, and they have some sense of the heavenly Lord. I would indeed be deeply troubled by the storms of temptation that your church is enduring, if I did not know that the best Father in heaven moderates everything for His children in such a way that their faith is tested, not shaken, by such evils. Certainly, He triumphs through us in Christ, by whose grace, like a palm tree, the heavier the burden that presses us down, the higher we rise with gathered and exerted strength. We experience daily how much strength is added to the faithful of Christ by the cross, so that it is not only not to be avoided but to be embraced with both arms, especially since we are not unaware of how much the peace of the world in the previous century harmed the churches, where all true piety's pursuits were cold and dormant, and there was the utmost license for errors. Therefore, let the Lord's will be done, let Him test, wound, and kill, but in such a way that we become purer through temptations, healthier through wounds, and blessed with immortal life through death, all through Christ, who is everything to us in all things. We will pray, as you request, for you, that you may bear the cross you now carry with steadfast and unbroken spirit, supplementing what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ. In turn, commend us to Christ with diligent and pious prayers, so that we, who seem to have begun not badly long ago, may further advance to a mind entirely worthy of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Now, regarding the hope of concord with the Pagans that has dawned upon you, it was most pleasing to receive this both from your dearest letters and from the clear narration of our Veit. And may this hope not be thwarted by the fickle and indeed more than sufficiently fierce nature of your people, now also spurred on, as many think, by golden spurs! For what does not this accursed hunger for gold compel mortal hearts to do? But we, secure in the Lord's help and armed with spiritual weapons, will bravely await all the assaults of the wickedly audacious world and, through Him who is in us and greater than the world, will most certainly conquer.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Him, most venerable and dearest brother, whose holy friendship delights both Zurich, that most Christian heart, and me uniquely and beyond what I can write; he, along with my own brother, sends you greetings.</p>
      <p>Our Veit commends himself to us sufficiently by his own piety and integrity, so that we wish to consult his affairs in every way, neglecting nothing that seems to be in his interest, and now even more so, since your commendation has also been added.</p>
      <p>We pray to Christ that you may, as you do, bravely and perpetually disdain Luther's accusations and bloody pens. For we must consider more what is fitting for us and what builds up the churches cleansed by Christ's blood than what he deserves.</p>
      <p>Commend us to Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and the others. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>In Constance, March 30, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>Do not disappoint the hope you have opened to us about your visit. Hurry, my brother, and fly to us. We have many things to discuss with you. There are those who affirm that you saw some portents and apparitions before the previous disaster, about which, unless you come soon, I would like you to inform me by letter, and that when you have full leisure; for I do not wish to untimely interrupt your serious and most Christian studies.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most holy bishop of the Zurich church, most venerable brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
