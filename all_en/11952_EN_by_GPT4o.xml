    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for two [not received] letters from Vadian; regrets that nothing will come of his book about the four ages [see last No. 1861]. Sends back Martin Frecht's letter to Vadian [from April 5, 1544, Vadian BW VI 1334]; he is partly Lutheran, partly Bucerian-minded and was never on the side of the Confederates; now he accuses [the Zurichers] of criticizing followers of the Wittenberg Concord for their Lutheran doctrine, but in reality, Bullinger only admonished Gervasius [Schuler] [see above No. 1894 and note 7] not to obscure the doctrine in his planned sermon publication like Luther, as he only deviates from the papal doctrine of the Eucharist in the question of transubstantiation and in his confession [“On the Lord's Supper”, 1528] approved the condemnation of Berengar [WA XXVI 442f]. Luther, with his letter to Froschauer [from August 31, 1543, WA Correspondence X 384-388, No. 3908], has once again demonstrated his lack of willingness to communicate; he anathematizes Zwingli and [the Swiss], has not answered a private letter [from the Zurich theologians from August 30, 1539, No. 1304] and rejects communion with their church, but for his sake, they cannot give up their faith. Does not fear Luther and is ready, if necessary, to fight like David against Goliath [1Sam 17] and to explain, based on the files available to him, how they were treated. What it means to eat Christ's body is sufficiently known from John 6; has read what Calvin, with whom he is not on bad terms, writes about it, but even Calvin and Bucer can do nothing against God's word, and Luther will not agree with Calvin either. Frecht claims that Christ is not enjoyed carnally, but also not only in faith; these are word battles that Bullinger increasingly abhors. At the last Concord discussion in Zurich [1538] and in the letter [from the reformed places] to Luther [from May 4, 1538, WA Correspondence VIII 211-214, No. 3224], it was made clear what they think of the “ineffable manner” of Christ's presence, but Luther expected they would renounce Zwingli, as others have already done in Wittenberg; Bullinger, as he did then, holds fast to the simple doctrine of Christ; he will respond to public attacks, but otherwise leaves Luther to himself and no longer pays attention to talk of a Concord. Vadian should keep these candid statements to himself; Bullinger remains in connection with Frecht and others who consider him a brother, in the hope of better insight. Vadian rightly describes discord as a serious evil, but Luther demands the denial of their previous doctrine, and Bullinger would rather die than agree with Luther under denial of the truth. If it were only about the doctrine of the Eucharist, he would also recognize Schwenckfeld as a brother; has already received Luther's condemnation [from December 6, 1543] against him [CSch IX 33. 76; WA TR V 300f or 301f], which also targets the [Zwinglian] “Sacramentarians”, earlier [Blarer BW II 770, No. 5], but did not forward it to Vadian, as he wanted to spare him. Sends back the [not received] letter from [Johannes] Gast; from this too, it becomes clear what to think of the Concord.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I have received two letters from you, which are most abundant witnesses of your love for me. I will now respond to them briefly and simply. I am sorry that the books about the four ages have come to nothing; perhaps time and circumstances will provide you with another plan. I have received and read Frecht's letters and now return them; I also thank you for making me a participant in all your matters, even the secret ones. However, I am not surprised that Frecht writes in this way. He is entirely, as much as he is, partly Lutheran, partly Bucerian; I know thoroughly that he has never been a good Confederate. It pains him that some of our people encourage the Wittenbergers, who are more inclined to concord, not to discuss the Lord's Supper in a more intricate manner, that is, in the Lutheran way. I indeed did this: Gervasius, the minister of the Memmingen church, indicated that he would publish some sermons on the Lord's Supper in the German language, etc. I therefore urged the man not to complicate a plain matter like Luther, who, while wanting to appear to assert a view different from the pope's, defends exactly the same except for transubstantiation, which can be gathered from his great confession, in which he approves Berengar's condemnation, etc. What, I ask, have I sinned in this matter? What, I ask, do they still dream of concord? Luther never kept the articles of concord, as he sufficiently testifies in his last letter to Froschauer, how eager he is for concord. If some of our people have called this concord feigned, they have not sinned; for we, deceived by vain hope, have expected concord. We have not aimed against concord, especially those articles established in the last synod of Zurich. But Luther has never ceased to publicly and privately condemn Zwingli and us. We wrote to him privately, as it was decreed; but he did not respond, he despised us, indeed he even slandered us. What, when he finally writes that we are seducers, with whom no church can have any union or fellowship? And since he tells us the matter so clearly and his books and reports are so openly available, that he wants nothing to do with us, how long will we be led around by the nose? What is now said of the concord, which is nothing? For we will not give up our faith and church because of Luther, nor can we accept his doctrine and way. That good man thinks Luther's pen is formidable to everyone. I, strengthened by the grace of Christ, fear nothing of his pen. If it comes to the point (although I do not desire it), that we must fight, trusting in the goodness of the cause, I will fight cheerfully with David against that terrifying Goliath. I will also set down how we have been treated, what has been attributed and alleged against us at the councils, and how true and fine that has been kept or who has kept or not kept it; for I still have all the records. You also know well how it has gone. I have letters and other things very useful to the matter behind me; although I do not desire them, I can well let them dry up. But if it must be fought, then with God's grace and help, they must have enough fighting, that they wish they had sat quietly on the nest. What special eating of the flesh of Christ he makes after that which the scripture teaches as true through faith in the Son of God, let him see. If they invent anything from themselves, let them enjoy it. The sons of God rely on the word of God. What it is to eat the true flesh of Christ, Jesus, our Savior, taught in John VI., nor does the church ignore what it is, with the help of the symbol, which the ancients said sacramentally: to eat the body of the Lord. I know what Calvin has written here; I have read it often; I have weighed his opinion. But the word of Christ in John VI. is so plain, firm, and certain, that a hundred Calvins and Bucers can do nothing against it, although I am not on bad terms with Calvin; nor will Luther approve his opinion, unless he retracts what he has published before. Good Frecht declares in this letter that he believes in some kind of bodily and yet not carnal, true and yet not only of faith, eating. What then is the reason? Ineffable, that is, what they invent outside the scriptures, then boast greatly. They are clouds of word battles, from which, the longer I live, the more I abhor. What, that the minds of the faithful are grievously tormented, having nothing certain in their hearts? For the teachers themselves cannot explain it. You know how much was contended among us at the last synod in Zurich about the manner of presence; you know how explicitly we excluded in the letter to Luther that ineffable manner, the most fitting haunt of darkness. But you also know in turn, that after receiving that letter, that great Luther began to rage again; for he hoped for a retraction from us, as some of the nobles have openly retracted in Wittenberg and condemned Zwingli. What I report is certain; those who heard the retractors are alive and can testify. If we do not do that and want to worship Luther, then we are the worst that ever were. Therefore, what we testified in the last letters from the Zurich synod to Luther, I will accomplish: I will be entirely in this, to teach the simplicity of apostolic doctrine publicly and privately in words and writings, not looking to Luther or any man, but only to Christ himself. If he continues to convict sermons or writings of error and heresy, I will respond to the best of my ability. Otherwise, I will think nothing pertains to me, what he has done or said; he stands and falls by his own judgment. And this is the sum of my counsel: speeches of concord will be smoke and clouds to me henceforth, as he has so explicitly renounced it. If he wants to let himself be led further, his harm, etc. I love you, my esteemed and very dear Vadian; therefore I freely pour my thoughts and my counsel into your bosom. You keep these to yourself; I do not want you to send this to Frecht immediately, whom I know to be entirely Lutheran. However, I write to him familiarly, although I do not conceal my opinion of my mind with him or anyone else. What they write to me and acknowledge me as a brother, I do not despise them, I do not reject them. For I hope, there will be a time when they too will see, with what sincerity some have handled the sacramental matter in the church. But if you want to write to him, what you think is conducive to piety and public tranquility, I do not oppose. You say, and rightly so, that discord is a pestilential disease of the church. But the denial of truth and its obscuration is a more deadly plague of the church. It is clear, however, that we cannot come into favor and concord with Luther, unless we retract and deny Zwingli's and our doctrine of the Lord's Supper, of images, of confession and absolution, etc. But I would rather die than obscure or deny the true and simple truth. What then will happen? Do you advise that for the sake of concord we should deny the doctrine hitherto handed down to the church, true, just, and certain? I do not think so. Therefore, we must remain in discord, certainly, and I would rather be in concord with the truth, discordant with Luther, than in concord with him, discordant with the truth; and that is also the sum, if I said it for 1000 years, etc. If Schwenckfeld had no errors other than that which is imputed to him about the Lord's Supper, I would recognize him as a friend and brother, not as an enemy. The condemnation of this by the anathema of the anti-pope Luther has long been sent by friends, but I have not communicated it. For I do not want to disturb you and your modest and peaceful mind with such curses and devotions. For he condemns and devotes us along with Schwenckfeld, nor is it grievous to me, who see that Christ expired salutarily among thieves. For he understands no others than us, when he strikes the sacramentarians. - I return the example of the letter from Gast. From this devotion too, it can be judged what we think of concord. Farewell. In the month of May 1544. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
