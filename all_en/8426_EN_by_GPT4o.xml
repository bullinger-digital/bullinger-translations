      <p>S. P. It was so pleasing that you, venerable old man, most illustrious man and to be honored with perpetual reverence as a father, Heinrich Bullinger, took upon yourself the parts that should have been mine by writing letters first, that I consider myself entirely granted immortality. Therefore, since I must not only congratulate myself but also give thanks, as I ought, for the gratitude that must never die, both to be given and to be returned, it remains that I establish myself as a debtor and a faithful name[?] at the first opportunity, which is the last, and truly fulfill them from the heart in the present. Would that my letters, to which you invited me to write, were also of such a kind that they could delight you even in the slightest! But since I am of such an age that this kind of duty does not greatly help me anymore, whether it happens due to the weariness of my greater old age or the misfortune of my talent, your venerable humanity must be asked again and again, that you do not disdain to at least patiently read through my unpolished and barren letters and consider that in a letter to a friend even negligence (as he said) is considered a form of cultivation. For I, not to dissemble anything, most illustrious man, from the day I first saw and read your works, began to love and admire you uniquely and have always since that time looked for an opportunity to form a friendship with you, and to enjoy your most pleasant company, which, because it happened to me recently by your consent [Greek], I do not count as part of common happiness. You have me entirely.</p>
      <p>I write what my mind feels, not to flatter, from which I have always recoiled. These are in response to your most humane letters. What you write, that the sight and access, which you made available to me, was pleasant to you, I embrace and accept in the part that I should. But that you adorn and pursue me with certain praises, although I am not deserving, indeed unworthy even to be praised by a distinguished man, yet your zeal and goodwill are most pleasing. For what you attribute to me, which I do not recognize in myself, because I believe it is attributed not to me, but to letters, but to virtues, of which many think and proclaim me a lover and follower, I will easily bear and embrace from the heart. Nor will I fail to know my duty, wherever the opportunity is offered, so that I may not only declare a grateful mind but also seem to have striven for those things, as far as my strength allows, with which your dignity depicts me. And these few things for the time being. A certain fatal grief, which has exercised me most bitterly for several days, forbids more. May our Lord Jesus Christ and only savior deign to preserve, prosper, and protect your reverend piety perpetually. Farewell and be well eternally together with your daughter, sweetest granddaughter, and indeed the whole family. Given at Freiburg, at dawn on the 16th of November in the year etc. [?] 70.</p>
      <p>Your dignity and yours from the heart, pure Johannes Hartung.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man both in learning and in the sanctity of life [...?] Lord Heinrich Bullinger etc. [?] ecclesiastical teacher of heavenly doctrine in the republic of Zurich [...?], his lord, brother, and to be perpetually observed friend as a father.</p>
      <p>Dr. Johannes Brenz in Stuttgart recently passed away on the 11th of September in the 71st year of his age, about whom a certain professor from TÃ¼bingen gave me this poem: Twice seven lustra (a lustrum is a period of five years) now Brenz has added a year to his body and laid down the decaying limbs of his body.</p>
      <p>His pious writings will always remain in the world, but his good spirit sits in the citadel of heaven.</p>
      <p>I would wish, on occasion, to greet the most illustrious men there, the doctors of medicine of your republic, as most dutifully as possible, and Lord Abraham, a most humane man, reverently. Johannes Hartung.</p>
      <p>May your humanity forgive my hasty writing, I ask.</p>
