      <p>Greetings. The reason for the long interval in writing to you, most esteemed sir, is due to domestic treatments, which I had to undergo for three whole weeks because of my health. Although I am still in a weakened state, I had to go out because of the unfortunate condition of my colleague, who is trying to expel it with treatments from Fideris and has left all the burden of the church to me.</p>
      <p>I would have decided to go to some more beneficial baths myself, if not for the contracted state of my affairs and the hateful poverty, which increases more and more every day (the Lord knows, by whose fault this has happened so far) that has been an obstacle for me. Because I have somewhat neglected the duty of writing for these reasons, I will not hesitate to renew it with greater zeal in the future, especially since I see that I am required to do so, as I can only be burdensome to you in every way. But your humanity and patience are so great and ineffable that you are not accustomed to reject even the most unworthy, but rather to embrace them paternally, if they can be led to a better state. Therefore, I would have written long ago about the unfortunate outcome of our missions, if I had not already warned that this would happen. For why would a wolf guard the sheepfold, except for the bloody prey? Why would they wrest the long-desired prey from those monstrous monks, who are their greatest supporters and patrons? Everything here is corrupt, and there is nothing healthy in the sick body of the republic from head to toe. Money reigns among the magnates, and the more it reigns, the less they want to be criticized; which is an unmistakable sign that they will fall sooner and more miserably than expected. The monks have money in abundance, and with the generosity of the Babylonian harlot, they attack those who hold the helm of the republic. Hence the tears, hence the chains and the crests of the adversaries, which they do not hesitate to raise over friends and enemies for their own benefit. However, what our people have achieved or how they have proceeded so far, you can gather from the attached document, a copy of which was to be brought from the benches to the rostrum or to the communities by the decision of the lords. I know that no danger threatens our most pestilent monks, who, beyond any doubt, have been the sole authors of such frivolous and most impudent acts; indeed, the rogue from Plurs not only participated in the imprisonment of the Cellarius but also presided over it in disguise. But why would the lords destroy that speculatory cesspool, I mean the Morbenno monastery, who would more eagerly build new ones, caring little that all evil would fly out from here like from Pandora's box? But fraud will eventually fall back on the perpetrator. I am also sending you letters from the minister of Solis, which he sent to me from Pregallia before the envoys arrived, to which Antonius from Salice subscribed, who, however, is usually the greatest supporter of the Morbenno filth; but he will not ensnare me nor entangle me in his deceits. I have also attached the writing of Mr. Lentulus, the minister of Chiavenna, which I have had for a long time, but because others did not perform their duty in sending it back, I have not been able to send it until now. They are outdated, unless the pasquinade has aroused your admiration. But enough about these matters. If there are any things that seem worthy of knowledge, I will not fail to always inform you of them.</p>
      <p>Now, farewell with all your people, most esteemed sir and immortal and incomparable glory of our age, and always keep us poor souls entrusted to your faith. It will also be not ungrateful, indeed most pleasing to me, if through you my brother Ernius is greeted as courteously as possible. In turn, Mr. Consul, Mr. Karl, Mr. Pontisella, and Mr. Franz Bonettus, a singular man and friend, greet you in every way. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Chur, hastily, July 26, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>Were those signs of the Wahalensians, about which you write, destroyed, or to which party did they adhere? I will send your books shortly.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most excellent pastor of the church of Zurich, his eternally honorable lord.</p>
