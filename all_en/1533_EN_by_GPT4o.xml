      <p>Greetings. Yesterday I received your letter, dearest compater, along with the coin you sent for my little son Johann Heinrich as a gift, for which we give you our greatest thanks. The boy seems to be endowed with a certain singular grace; he is wonderfully elegant, delicate, charming, and talkative; thus he is especially praised by his mother.</p>
      <p>However, since you are not quite satisfied with the writing I sent regarding the proposed question, and you still wish for some additions concerning the magistrate's duty to fight for true religion, if the situation demands it, behold, I am sending my opinion on this matter as well, summarized in as few words as the previous ones, yet in such a way that you may read and, if anything seems to need correction or change, correct and change it before it is published.</p>
      <p>The subject is liable to the envy and indignation of the powerful; therefore, care must be taken, as far as possible, that neither the truth is abandoned nor any of the good are offended through inconsideration or rashness. No one can be cautious enough alone; I therefore pray that you also add your judgment, indeed, if anything displeases, cut it out and adapt it to the convenience of the cause.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, dearest compater in the Lord. Greetings to all yours in our name, likewise to the lords and brothers, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Theobald, Mr. Gwalther, Mr. Amian, Mr. Colin, Mr. Johann Phrysio, and Mr. Butler. I also commend to you our fellow minister Johann Traber from Augsburg.</p>
      <p>The people of Augsburg, on the eve of the Lord's nativity, have replaced the interimist preachers with others, among whom is Huberinus, once my deacon. Today, the growth of false brothers is prolific. Farewell again. Bern, January 12, 1552.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your compater. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, compater in the Lord, by far the dearest.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
