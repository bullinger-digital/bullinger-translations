      <p>I believe, dearest teacher, that you have received my letters, which I left with Dr. Wolfgang, the theologian, in mid-September.</p>
      <p>As you first, and then the friends from Neuchâtel advised, I entered Strasbourg on September 20th with books, but nowhere did I find less in common with books than there. Not even with affection am I drawn to Tübingen. But still... my prudence (if there is any) has so far yielded and perhaps it protects what I almost regretted.</p>
      <p>But what made me return to my previous plan, you will soon learn. I never agreed... about Strasbourg, except for that hope, which some noble friends from Lorraine had given me... they had promised to bring my family... to Strasbourg in September (so that I would be there then). I was present, but... they could not. I complained to the leaders of Strasbourg and had been there barely three days when everything...</p>
      <p>I sent to Tübingen for advice to approach the princes of Germany, especially those for whom I had been an advocate. With letters to... I had, which... would allow me (whose industry they wanted to use in public and private affairs) to act with them... and to bring my family with goods there, it pleased the council... and soon wanted to execute, the republic of Strasbourg lent me two good public horses with a rider... piously... and the plan succeeded through September... I set out on a journey, returned on November 18th with letters from the most illustrious Christoph, Duke of Württemberg, Augustus, Elector of Saxony, Wilhelm, the younger Landgrave of Hesse, the Elector Palatine, Heinrich Otto, and from Christoph Prob Vito and others... letters to Ulrich...</p>
      <p>To Strasbourg to perform this legation to the King of France. But since neither home... nor place for books... I found in Strasbourg (I would have obtained, if...) I wanted to wait. I again and... impatient of delays (otherwise I would have at least the whole winter...) was going to profess gratitude for things... enclosed, I turned the journey to Tübingen, the most pious Peter Martyr and the truly learned theologian Hieronymus Sanctus, Coelii Curionis of Basel, my son-in-law... are... the last... today... I entered here with books. My affairs... are, unless I rescue my family this winter, I will hardly ever... I am going to. The messenger from Strasbourg was not enough, because... the prince will extort everything... and thus my family could be here next, and then... I will pour everything into papism. Furthermore, the princes of Germany... write to the King of France that they owe me... I barely escaped from the hands of the Landgrave... also and offering double wanted to detain me in Heidelberg, but... prevailed, because the best prince of Württemberg first looked to me and first took my hand in Hallprune, from whom (... first by your holy and paternal advice) I was called... I could not deceive him of his hope. Therefore... my family... I complain that I will come here... first and... obtained... of the republic of Strasbourg... and having greeted him, I sent this to... about you. Farewell, dearest teacher and father, you are the first of all, whom... with your entire number I greet. In Tübingen at the inn of the Crown, November 28, 1553.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends... in my name... only not... always.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient Charles du Moulin, formerly of France, now a jurist of Germany.</p>
