    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the goodwill shown to the people of Zurich at the meeting in Basel and refers to his letter to Grynaeus about the favorable reception of the [First Helvetic] Confession in Zurich. Reports on a violent altercation in Lucerne, where a hermit from Hergiswald, who had harassed a widow, stabbed several people, including Captain Jakob Martin, and was eventually killed by Mangold von Wil; on the same day, a mighty bang was heard, which many interpreted as a divine warning.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I cannot express to you, my venerable Myconius, dearest brother, adequate thanks for your benevolence and humanity towards all of us. May the Lord be your reward and that of all the others. I have informed Grynaeus how our council received the written confession with great joy, and finally all the points of the convention. You will inquire about this from him. I believe he will not hesitate to report it to you. For what I write to him, I write to you, and what I write to you, I write to him. For I have seen the utmost harmony between you and have reported it to our other brothers with the greatest joy of my heart. May God grant that we love each other as brothers everywhere.</p>
      <p>But a strange wonder occurred in Lucerne on February 8th, which many people consider a portent. A hermit had stayed outside of Lucerne in the Hergiswald, who had presented himself for some time as a seer (prophet); he also had great esteem and a reputation among them, as he had predicted the outcome of the Kappel War, saying it would go well for them, etc. On February 8th, he came to Lucerne, dressed entirely in snow-white like a hermit. He entered a widow's house very close to Jakob Martin's house; there he attacked the woman in a friendly manner and wanted to sleep with her. When the woman's lover was there, he held the brother back. Because of this, the brother left the woman, turned to the lover, and stabbed him to death with a dagger. The woman ran into Vogt Martin's house and screamed. The brother and the wounded man came down from the house. Below, a good fellow was there, who had brought help, and he also wanted to leave; but the brother attacked again and stabbed him to death on the spot. Meanwhile, Captain Martin and a servant also ran up; the brother stabbed both of them in the hips, especially Jakob Martin, whose intestines hung out, and both were carried away for dead, although it is said that neither has died yet. Then Mangold von Wil ran up and stabbed the brother with his rapier (dueling sword), so that he also remained dead on the spot with the others, etc. This is all certainly true. Now some say that when the brother fell, he cried out: "Jesus Maria, I have opened up to mine." Then he remained dead. The two were carried away for dead. Then some say quite cheerfully that when they undressed him, they found under the white hermit clothes on his body a pair of pants, cut in the most boyish manner, and a shirt made with gold, more precious than 1 crown, etc. But it is certain that on the same day such a noise and bang was heard, as if two mountains had collapsed. Many people in Lucerne considered it a thunderclap. Many people in our area heard the bang and told me with their own mouths. Many consider it a great warning.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I trouble you with a fatal tragedy.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 18, 1536.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, most faithful pastor of the church in Basel, brother in the Lord, much to be respected.</p>
