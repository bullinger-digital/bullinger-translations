      <p>Greetings, most distinguished man.</p>
      <p>My nephew is with you, who will inform you about matters that concern me. Therefore, there is no need for me to write about these things.</p>
      <p>He will show you the preface of the book, which was to be printed here, unless I especially watched over it. Will I be stoned for this work as I was for the expulsion of Gribaldo and for another accused booklet? Therefore, I had to endure all these poisons. Our condition is miserable; if we prohibit, if we expel, we arm the importunity of many against us; if we do not prohibit, do not expel, the churches are infected.</p>
      <p>But I prefer to endure the insolence of men than the wrath of God. In summary: such writings are spread, as you see; from where this has arisen, my nephew will indicate. Recently, a legate from Poland was present with my prince, who affirmed that in his country the beginnings of this pestilence are not lacking. Even if you see peace, even if you see truces with the Turk, we still know that nothing is to be feared from these assemblies. Do I not bless you? I am sending booklets soon to be had and four dialogues about Hosius; for they are under the press.</p>
      <p>There is no lack of the labors of journeys and studies, which I willingly bear; more troublesome are the false interpretations and envies of some concerning my actions. But I leave everything to the judgment of God and sustain myself with a good conscience in the meantime.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Pray for me with the whole family, school, and church.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, April 29, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
