      <p>S. P. When your son, the image of your most humane spirit and body, recently came to my house here, I leaped for joy, believe me. Because, due to my business, I have not been able to see and speak with you and my other great and old friends there in person. However, regarding this matter, I somehow cannot completely despair and I think and hope that either the Landgrave or the Duke of Württemberg or some other city in Germany, who cares about such things, will eventually bring together and unite learned and educated men.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, as I began to say, I rejoice and hope that either the children of our children or those who will be born from them will now grow up in the truest religion of our Lord Jesus Christ and in all humanity, and be more and more united in spirit and custom. Therefore, I brought your son immediately after receiving and giving greetings and after discussing the private and public well-being of all of you and us, and I recommended to my sons, as much as I could, that they cultivate paternal friendship and mutual zeal while we are alive and even after we are dead, which I hope they will do if they listen to me. Indeed, out of my respect for you and mutual spirit, I have already and always revealed and dedicated myself entirely to your son, and with my own hand, as it pleased him, I wrote in his little book, which I happened to be publicly lecturing from the Psalter in our school, a testimony of my perpetual goodwill towards you and all yours. And if only circumstances would allow, so that I could show not only in words but also in face, gesture, and every sign, to all or to my own, how much I value you especially for your excellent and singular learning and zeal, and also our other common and, as I hope, eternal friends. Let me, dear Bullinger, deal with you truly, as is fitting between us, candidly and from the heart, without any pretenses or introductions. I have thus resolved once and for all that with learned, educated, and zealous men, I wish not only to have perpetual peace with Paceus but also I am entirely of the opinion that all pious and learned men, lovers of truth and humanity, can easily agree and come together on all matters, even if some are very controversial, if only they do not disdain to meet amicably and very familiarly and to listen to each other calmly and moderately, or at least through letters, as much as possible, setting aside emotions and that barbarism more than Cyclopean. Let that perversity be in the levity of the Greeks and the madness of their dialects, not to say monstrosity, as it is now almost everywhere, so that those from whom they differ not a little or even much, they do not cease to attack immediately with insults and hatred more than Vatinian. Our reason and that of all Christians, however weak or tempted or preempted by Satan, should certainly be very different and much, much more diverse. Therefore, I am as displeased as possible with the ignorance, or should I say sycophancy, or both and many other similar things of the sons of the land of the Saxons, Westphalians, Timanns, Knöpperdöllings, etc., and the like. But they are utterly unworthy to in any way hinder the most useful studies of learned and eminent men, whose mention in learned and enduring writings should in no way be made.</p>
      <p>For perhaps they seek this very thing, as Erasistratus and Pausanias are said to have done in the past. But too much about these things for the present.</p>
      <p>I was surprised that you have not written back to me for so long, and not even with your son recently; but I easily excuse your occupations. For taking an example from myself, although I often gladly devote this to friends even during meals, I am reluctant to be surpassed in this kind of thing, if there is any way I can gratify them. This, I think, is now known and evident to you and others again and again. Therefore, if there is anything that you or yours would like to be taken care of here or in all these regions through me, command it in a word and you will immediately feel the effect, as much as is in me. As I said, I have voluntarily offered and received my complete faith and zeal to your son without any exception, and I have enjoined my own, as I also indicated somewhat above, to always and on every occasion show all diligence and effort, in whatever way they can gratify you or yours at any time, which I want you to be very much persuaded they will do again and again. I wish to respectfully greet all our common friends, as I said, both those who are with you and those who are nearby, the most learned, humane, and pious men, and those who are far dearest and most respected to my heart, with my words at the right time and on occasion. I especially wish to be commended to them with the best note, especially to the venerable senior Mr. Conrad Pelican, Bibliander, Gessner, and that they also write back in their time and leisure, as they used to in the past. I will also love you for your great merit, take on this care and thought, if it can be done in any way in the future on any occasion, so that some of ours, especially the more moderate and learned ones, can communicate with us either in person, which would undoubtedly be best, or certainly through friendly and peaceful letters, so that nothing is omitted in the future of all things that seem in any way to contribute to perpetual and orthodox and catholic peace and concord.</p>
      <p>I ask and beseech that the people of Basel, Lausanne, and as much as possible, Strasbourg, Tübingen, Bern, Geneva, and all those everywhere who prefer pious and more humane unanimity and union to hatred, to distractions, to destruction, which must eventually follow if the more learned themselves prefer to bite each other than to listen and agree or at least not to engage so hostilely.</p>
      <p>But more about these things than perhaps your occupations can bear, yet poured out with the best spirit and most loving of Christian peace and tranquility rather than written, which you, I am sure, will take and understand in the best part for your humanity and piety and your spirit towards us, and you will be well. To your wife, the most honorable matron, and your children and friends, signify... that Heinrich from Wittenberg was now with you and here with me in a happy and cheerful spirit, safe and sound, and in Wittenberg, as I heard yesterday from students who came directly from him, he is doing very well in a most pleasant company. I am expecting letters from him every day, which I will also send to you at our fair here, for he made such an agreement with me recently here in my house.</p>
      <p>I wish Calvin, Musculus, and others like them to be greeted by name and very respectfully and dutifully with my words through you or through your letters, which I think are very frequent to them. Farewell again and love us as you do, and write back. But hey, I almost forgot and omitted what I should have mentioned among the first: the one who delivers this to you, Master Ernest Vögelin, not only promoted here to a doctor of liberal arts by his merit and outstanding and singular learning, as you will perceive in person, but also a bachelor of sacred theology, as they used to call it, is now returning to his homeland, and since he knew that we have long been bound by mutual duties, he wanted me to also insert a true and certain testimony of his studies in these my letters and to commend him to you and other learned men as diligently and with the best note as possible, as he is certainly worthy. This is what your humanity should understand much better and follow with words, as needed and wherever needed, which I very much and again and again ask and beseech. I will not add a word and will consider myself more talkative and bothersome to you than is proper unless you deign to write back briefly and copiously and fully.</p>
      <p>Given very quickly in Leipzig during our autumn fair in the year 1555 above one and a half thousand.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your humanity, Valentin Paceus, etc. To the most learned and humane man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, known for his most learned writings published and to be elaborated from here to the stars, our lord and friend to be honored with respect, etc.</p>
