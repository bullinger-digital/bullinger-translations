    <p xml:id="regest1">From Bern, it is reported that the Turkish fleet expected by the French [King Francis I] did not reach Marseille due to a storm and also did not receive free passage from Venice; the Margrave "Guaiasco" [of Vasto?] was therefore able to bring reinforcements from Genoa to Spain; a Turkish delegation is said to threaten the French king with war from Hungary due to breach of contract; in Lyon and elsewhere, believers are being persecuted with fire. [Georg?] Lübegger was not willing to deliver a book to Bullinger at the request of [Johannes] Gast, but Hans Wiederkehr is transporting it along with another one intended for Pellikan.</p>

      <p>S. These words are written from Bern: "News is being spread that is not entirely unfavorable: The Turkish admiral, with a large number of ships and men, was overwhelmed by a storm while heading to the port of Marseille to form an alliance with the French, where he was to disembark his army, for whose arrival provisions had already been prepared by agreement. Thus, the French, deceived in their hope, are quite disturbed. But even the Venetians have denied passage to the Turkish army, which many find surprising. However, this rumor is confirmed by the fact that reinforcements were sent from Genoa to Spain by the Margrave of Vasto, which the Turks could have easily prevented unless they were compelled by some fate to provide a safe and free passage."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it is reported that the Turkish delegation accuses the French of treachery, claiming that if they do not honor the agreements made (namely the handover of Marseille), war will be declared against them from Hungary. Thus, perhaps the Lord has decided to finally disperse the unholy alliance of the impious. During this time of war, believers are being persecuted with fire in Lyon and many other places, so that the monarchs, seemingly driven by an evil spirit like Saul, appear to be fighting against God. Thus, hands once stained with the blood of the saints cannot help but sink deeper until the Lord puts an end to it." I did not want you to be unaware of these things.</p>
      <p>Gastius entrusted a book, which I do not know, to be delivered to you; but when I told Lübegger what I was asking, he replied: "I truly cannot do it; I am a large, heavy man, as you can well see; but I will go to Hans Wiederkehr and ask him to come to you; since he has a horse, you can safely entrust it to him." He came willingly, if I wanted anything; so I entrusted both that book and another one, which I also do not know, to be delivered to Pellikan. Therefore, express your thanks to Hans as is fitting; he willingly undertakes this for your sake, whatever it may be. But spare Lübegger, for he is a great man. These things I tell you, so that you may laugh in your sorrow, not to reproach him for anything.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 20, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
