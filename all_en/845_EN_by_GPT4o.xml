      <p>Greetings. I do not have much to respond to your recent letters. Regarding the Valesian uprising, apart from what I wrote recently, I have learned nothing more; I do not know what outcome this tragedy has reached; however, when I find out, I will inform you. Furthermore, I thank you very much for your homilies. I am greatly delighted by the clear treatment of ceremonial and judicial laws, a subject that has been briefly touched upon by others and almost disregarded by some. You will send the rest when they are completed, I am sure.</p>
      <p>As for seeing you disturbed by my letters, I apologize if I have offended you in this matter. Certainly, this change in my circumstances has affected me in such a way that it is not surprising that sometimes I did not know what to write, what to say, or what to do, and I have not yet fully recovered my spirit until everything is settled and I can apply my mind to studies with peace. If I wrote anything harshly either in those or in later letters, I wrote not so much about you as about others, who frequently wrote letters here during this whole time to not insignificant men, almost provoking them to petition me, and this was objected to and reproached by some; I speak the truth, I do not lie.</p>
      <p>This also, not without reason, although I have undertaken all other things with a calm mind, as you know, has stirred me.</p>
      <p>I could easily gather and sense from there what was being sought, and I still sense it, nor do I hide it from you, nor do I think you will be unjust to me because of it. Therefore, if I wrote more harshly than was fair, attribute it to the emotions, which we all do not lack; for they are especially wont to exert their strength when they are stirred by such great occasions as have befallen me for now four whole years. For I know you will not judge it a light thing, to leave a mother, brother, relatives, connections, friends, learned and humane men, a rich condition, utmost peace, and many other things of this kind, and to undertake a condition so troublesome, full of labor, hatred, envy, where there are still not to be despised the incentives of factions and old dissension, perpetual cares, a French nation plainly restless and agitated, and to all this, the scarcity of all things. He would not be human who would not be moved by these.</p>
      <p>I indeed know what you said to me in person, and what you wrote to me absent. You also know what I said to you in person, and what I wrote to you absent. Meanwhile, however, it happened that I was granted to the Bernese, who had not yet decided anything about the auction of the stipend. Indeed, that acceleration, and no return reserved for me, moved me not a little and still moves me. I do not wish to proclaim what I have endured in these four years; however, that way of acting now seems unworthy of those labors, with which I am now dealt. Therefore, I beg you to forgive me something.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I will always love you and will continue to diligently perform my duty. As for what I wrote recently, that you should intercede for me with the senate about my return, I would like you to refrain; for these and other necessary reasons, I am compelled either to come to you soon myself or to appeal to the senate by letters. Meanwhile, farewell with all yours, whom you will greet from me and my wife and children, Mr. Gwalther and other brothers to be honored in the Lord. Bern, February 25, 1550. Our Musculus greets you.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, my lord always to be respected.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
