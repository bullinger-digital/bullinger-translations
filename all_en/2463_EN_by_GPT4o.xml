      <p>I wish you the best of health and offer my most respectful service, most illustrious Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>On the day before the Ides of November, we arrived in Frauenfeld, contrary to our expectations; there we happened to encounter followers of Epicurus, you know whom I mean, certainly distinguished ones. Among other things, when mention was made of new matters, we heard from a notable source, etc.</p>
      <p>That in Constance, 100 horsemen are to be gathered in one inn these days; what is happening in others, we do not know, but when we arrive there, we will hear; however, I think, as I understood, they are going to Baden.</p>
      <p>I did not want your dignity to be unaware of this, in case it might be relevant; however, I understood [nothing good]. I would gladly write more, etc. The uncertain courier does not allow it. Farewell very much. My lord greets you, given the day before the Ides of November in the year 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely and most obediently, Gregor Karli.</p>
      <p>To the outstanding man in both piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
