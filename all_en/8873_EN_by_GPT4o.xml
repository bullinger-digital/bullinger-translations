      <p>Today the following events took place: Four syndics were chosen from each League to go to the communities of the Upper League to urge them to send and present those who have been summoned; if they do not do this, they will be forced to bring forth a multitude to indicate their obstinacy. Whether the syndics have set out on their journey, I cannot say; for by midday this had not yet been done. Perhaps they will wait for better things and hope for obedience. The people of Salis complain that they can hardly bring their president to act unless the more powerful superiors are more inclined to enter this arena. Later, the bailiff of Davos was fined a sum of two hundred gold coins, yet his reputation remains intact. Tomorrow, another bailiff, Peter Guler, will face trial. Letters have also been written to the most illustrious Lord Ferdinand, in which his opinion on today's matters is sought, which is said by rumor to be not so friendly. May God protect us, lest the League of the Greyhounds resist its other allies in this purpose and, relying on the importunity of neighbors, wrest from our hands all the subsequent fruits of this reformation, which certainly cannot happen without great calamity, if those who are more powerful and involved were to win over the minds of the people, provided they are not forced to come to judgment and censure. - 15 days ago, a new duke entered Milan, namely the greatest commendator of the Order of the Knights of Malta. In Mestre, which is under Venetian rule, a sedition arose among the passing soldiers, namely Italians, French, and Germans; but the Germans and French slaughtered the Italians to extermination. We do not know the cause. These things were reported to us by Hannibal Guicciard, a most learned man and exceedingly Greek." April 21, 1572.</p>
