      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Satan has almost the entire year here, most illustrious men, harassed us through a certain Adriaan Haemstede, who had occupied the ministry of our church here before our arrival and kept us so occupied that there was scarcely time to scratch (as they say) our ears, let alone to write much to friends at leisure. Therefore, I would like to ask you to consider my prolonged silence with understanding and goodwill. He indeed caused us more trouble because he acquired many followers, whose ears were struck by his plausible doctrine, expanding the kingdom of Christ the Lord, which is otherwise quite narrow, so that he recognized all as brothers and members of the body of Christ the Lord, even if they were disgracefully mistaken about his nature, as long as they recognized him as the supreme priest of the church of God. This Adriaan had a certain patron of his cause here with the most reverend Bishop of London, who is said to burden our foreign churches here with many slanders, which have exchanged mutual services here, and even wrote to Geneva in that sense, so we were forced to send a certain writing to Mr. Calvin, which the Bishop of London himself signed to declare our innocence in this matter. And because we fear that the same person, namely Jacobus Acontius, might do the same there, I thought it worthwhile to send that writing to you as well, so that you may be equipped against slanders. I also ask you to kindly write to me your judgment on this matter in even three words, not doubting, given the authority of your church there, that you will bring not insignificant benefit to our church. Furthermore, the joy here over the successful progress of religion in France can hardly be expressed. We also hope for some good in our Flanders from the nearby good in the Lord, even though Satan rages. The adversaries indeed prepare greater and greater persecution.</p>
      <p>But the more furiously they are struck, the more I am led to hope that their downfall is at the door. May God crush Satan under his feet! Religion is also in a very good place in Scotland, where there are many bishops and most excellent ministers who almost perform their ministry in the manner of the Genevan church.</p>
      <p>Moreover, here too, religion makes good progress by divine benefit both among the residents and among the English themselves. The church once granted to foreigners by Edward I obtained from the queen upon my return.</p>
      <p>We are now soliciting for municipal freedom at court and hope to obtain it for our brothers. More cannot be said due to the constraint of time.</p>
      <p>I ask you to consider my brevity with goodwill and, if there is anything new there that can refresh pious minds, let me know.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious men, in Christ the Lord, and love me as you have done so far. Greet Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, Mr. Bernardino Ochino, Mr. Gesner, Mr. Zwingli, Mr. Wolf, and the other brothers known to me, along with Mr. Burcher.</p>
      <p>London, March 3, 1561, according to the reckoning of the Anglican Church.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety, Jan Utenhove.</p>
