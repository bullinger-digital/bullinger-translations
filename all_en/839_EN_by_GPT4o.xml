      <p>Most celebrated Antistes, I write to you frequently now, either because I need your assistance, not so much for my own sake as for the sake of friends, or because I am tormented too sharply by the delay of your letters, which would indicate that you have received mine; for from these you could have learned well how unjustly those worst detractors have spewed out slanders against me. But if I seem too troublesome to you, attribute it not to me, but to this cause, which, since it has begun to turn into an insult to God, urges me more every day, until it is made clear to all how it stands. Therefore, as soon as you can, you will indicate whether you and others have been fully satisfied in this matter. For I will ensure that you think more rightly of me day by day. Furthermore, I strongly commend this brother to you, in whom you can, if you wish, embrace not just the person of one man, but the entire church; for he is most dear to the brothers in Cremona, whom they send there for purchasing books. If you do anything for him, know that you have contributed to all of them.</p>
      <p>That church is indeed worthy of your effort, which above all others loves, defends, and cherishes Christ. You truly, Mr. Bullinger, vindicate your brother's innocence against the treachery of men. Farewell and love me. Given from my hiding place on February 17, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Balthasar Altieri. To the most distinguished minister of Christ in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, always to be honored as lord and brother.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
