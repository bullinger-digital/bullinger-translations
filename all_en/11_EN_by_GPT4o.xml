    <p xml:id="regest1">Johannes Haab would have been sent as an envoy [to the baptism of Claude de France, daughter of Henry II] if his gout had allowed it. [His representative] Andreas Schmid is quite capable and, due to his education with [Guillaume Du Plessis, sieur de] Lyancourt, is very familiar with the French language.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">He set off around noon today. May the endeavor succeed! Schmid carries the medal [for Claude] with him. Since the completion of the two coins [for the godmothers Margaret, Queen of Navarre, and Antoinette de Bourbon] was delayed, they will be sent tomorrow. Bullinger arranged for [the St. Gallen messenger Alexius] Knoblauch to see the medal for the king's daughter. He showed him the coat of arms of St. Gallen with the bear and the golden chain, which is stamped in second place in the depiction of the allied places after the coat of arms of the Prince Abbey of St. Gallen, followed by the Three Leagues, Valais, Rottweil, Mulhouse, and Biel. The people of Zurich would have liked to place the city of St. Gallen before the Prince Abbey, but the city clerk [Johannes Escher vom Luchs] found no evidence for this in old legal documents. Bullinger knows that Schmid is well-disposed towards the city of St. Gallen and that he is to advocate for the city and its concerns on behalf of the Zurich Great Council with the other Swiss envoys at Henry II. Incidentally, because Antronius [Abbot Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee of St. Gallen] also harbored the vain wish of having his own envoy, it was decided that no allied places should send representatives.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Bullinger agrees with Vadian's opinion about the famous [old-believing] Swiss [Jost von Meggen and Amandus von Niderhofen]. He himself knows Jost von Meggen very well, as he has received him several times and occasionally corresponded with him. However, he believes that unfortunately, he mainly seeks recognition. May the Lord enlighten both of them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">The imprisoned Landgrave Philip of Hesse is being treated poorly by Emperor Charles V. Moreover, he spread the rumor before the estates [at the Diet] that Philip had betrayed his allies at Giengen an der Brenz and wanted to side with the Emperor. Only for this reason were his insignia of power not taken from him. Meanwhile, the Emperor condemns such unprincely behavior of an outlaw. A pity!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Bullinger received a letter from the Englishman John Burcher around Christmas [not received], in which he reported that their mutual friend, the Englishman Richard Hilles, returned from England [to Strasbourg] on the 8th [of December 1547]. He conveys to Bullinger that the true religion in England is growing day by day and the legal persecution [of Protestants], for which many pious Christians [were burned at the stake], has been abolished. Images, even crucifixes, have been removed from the churches. Hilles also claims to have seen [Zwinglian-oriented] churches in London. The papist Bishop of Winchester [Stephen Gardiner], this impostor, is imprisoned in the Tower [correctly: Fleet Prison] of London. Bartholomew Traheron, who dedicated himself to theology in Zurich a long time ago and reveres Bullinger, has been called to the English Parliament at the request of the Lord Protector Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset. The Scots were defeated by the English. The situation between Edward VI of England and Henry II of France has relaxed to the extent that all confiscated ships have been released. There is hope for lasting peace. Bernardino Ochino and Peter Martyr Vermigli have been called to England for the reorganization of the church. Martin Bucer does not cease to harm the Strasbourg church. Now he is trying, against the resistance of Kaspar Hedio and others who are trying to prevent worse, to introduce church discipline!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Bullinger did not want to withhold the report of the reliable Englishman from Vadian, although Vadian is certainly already better informed about this from others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">In Constance, there was a rumor that Henry II had conquered Genoa. Bullinger does not believe it. Vadian should not withhold reliable information from him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Bullinger's colleagues send their regards to Vadian and his family.</p>

      <p>S.D. Johannes Haab would have been sent as an envoy if he were not continually unwell and afflicted by gout. Andreas Schmid is a truly heroic man, educated in France with Guillaume Du Plessis, sieur de Lyancourt, and therefore very proficient in the French language.</p>

      <p>Today, around noon, he finally set off. May the endeavor succeed! He carries with him one of the medals. The other two will be sent tomorrow, as they could not be fully completed today. Therefore, I arranged for Alexius Knoblauch to see and take into his hand the great gift for the queen. I showed him the bear with the golden chain, the emblem of your city. It holds the second place among the allies. The first is held by the abbot, the second by the city of St. Gallen, the third by the Three Leagues, the fourth by the inhabitants of the Valais, the fifth by the people of Rottweil, the sixth by those of Mulhouse, and the seventh by those of Biel. We would have preferred to place your city in the first position. But while the city clerk was inspecting the old documents and treaties, he found that order was always observed: abbot and city of St. Gallen. However, I know that the envoy favors your city and republic, and has also received instructions from the most honorable council to commend your republic and its affairs to the king as faithfully as possible, along with the other envoys. And, what I want to tell you, Antronius sought this honor, to be received as an envoy himself. For this reason, it was decided that not a single one of the allied cities and districts should be joined. For they deemed it better to accept none of them than to satisfy the ambition of a monk, etc.</p>

      <p>You write rightly about those most illustrious men of Switzerland. I know Jost von Meggen very well. He has been at my house in Zurich once and again. I have written to him once and again, and he to me. But I see that nothing more than worldly ambition weakens those noble minds. May the Lord deliver them from evil and enlighten them.</p>

      <p>The Landgrave is said to be treated poorly by the Emperor, and the Emperor has told the estates that the Landgrave offered himself to the Emperor before Giengen, to abandon his allies and join the Emperor's camp. Therefore, he still has his hand and seal. But the Emperor did not want to accept such unprincely offers from the outlaw, etc. Misery!</p>

      <p>Around Christmas, the distinguished man John Burcher, an Englishman, wrote to me in these words: "Richard Hilles, our mutual friend, returned from England on the 8th of this month. He instructed me to write to you. First, that the true religion in England is growing day by day, and then that the impious laws, because of which many most Christian men were struck down and burned at the stake, have been entirely abolished. All images have been removed from the churches, even the crucifix of Christ. Richard joyfully confesses that he saw the churches of Zurich in London. The Bishop of Winchester, a papist and an egregious impostor, is held captive in the Tower of London. Bartholomew Traheron, who long ago dedicated himself to theology in Zurich, a very learned man and very devoted to you, has been received, at the will of the protector of the kingdom, into the first rank of the council, which is called Parliament. The Scots have truly been defeated by the English. The discord between the English and the French has been settled in such a way that the captured ships on both sides have been released. We hope for complete peace. You know that Bernardino Ochino and Peter Martyr have been called to England to establish churches. The church of Strasbourg is greatly vexed by Bucer, whose mind cannot rest. For now, he is trying to introduce some kind of excommunication. Hedio and some others resist him, lest Africa always bring forth something evil."</p>

      <p>This is what the Englishman, a pious and learned man, wrote to me verbatim, which I did not want to conceal from you, although I think you have already learned it more fully from other sources.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>There was a rumor in Constance that the French had taken Genoa from the Emperor. I consider it to be utterly false. Do not conceal from me anything you receive from other sources that is verified by faith.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Farewell and always love me. Zurich, January 13, 1548. My colleagues and brothers send their greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, my ever-honored lord. St. Gallen.</p>
