      <p>Greetings. If I did not sign the previous letters, I acted very foolishly and thoughtlessly; for although they contain nothing secret, it would be troublesome for them to fall into the wrong hands.</p>
      <p>But, to let you know, I wrote two letters, and indeed Balingketus gave the first to the Clavenna (Chur) messenger, who was traveling to Basel through you; in those was what had happened between the envoy of Philipp and Mr. Vergerius, and in the latter, what Vergerius's servant had done, who was later freed through our intercession. We were, however, the authors advising Mr. Vergerius that, since he had many adversities, he should leave here. He obeyed and set out on his way as soon as possible; however, as he was leaving, he promised something about his return to us, not understanding, the good old man, how unfit he is now for conducting affairs and, moreover, how he is hated by many in these parts. If he returns, he will stir up new troubles from the beginning. - I neither saw nor met the envoy of the French king, nor did he ever seek our meetings, which is for me a sign that he is not favorable to our religion, about which, however, I affirm nothing.</p>
      <p>What he proposed to the lords of the Three Leagues, I send here. Return it to me on occasion, for I kept no copy; however, you can keep it for eight days and present it to yours for reading.</p>
      <p>I am surrounded on all sides; I debate much with myself about what should be done. I fear one thing, that the envoy of Philipp (whom I subtly criticize here) might return and then matters will erupt into a crisis. - To these evils is added the miserable and afflicted state of the Clavenna (Chur) church.</p>
      <p>The church is torn in various ways, with powerful factions on both sides. There are two ministers: Florillus and Zanchus; each has his own followers and indeed they are very hostile to each other.</p>
      <p>Immortal God, what will finally happen? The plague cruelly infests Clavenna (Chur) and, as Zanchus writes, half the city is infected. They preach in the public square, not within walls, etc., and not even this evident plague of God can restore them.</p>
      <p>I often doubt whether there is any spirit in such people.</p>
      <p>However, I hear Zanchi's modesty praised, while the rigor and ambition of the other are criticized. But, as I said, there are factions, and each defends its own teacher and attacks the other.</p>
      <p>I thank you for those new things you share with fatherly care. Continue to extend your hand to us, so that I may more easily struggle through all these waves.</p>
      <p>I pray to God to keep you safe with us for a long time. Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Chur, on the first day of May in the year 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
