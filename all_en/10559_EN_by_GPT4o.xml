      <p>Greetings. It has come to pass, most honorable Bullinger, through your encouragements, that by continuing my day and night labor, I have completed this brief little Greek grammar instruction. Initially, I began to compose it with the intention that it would be printed in the summer; but since it is now being requested, I have decided not to give myself rest until it is finished. Furthermore, I ask and beg you, if I am given any time to observe, to look over it a little and bring it to the judgment of your mind. Meanwhile, please set aside the role of a friend and take on that of a judge. If the booklet is pleasing, let it be preserved. But if it cannot bear judgment, let it be discarded as an impure birth and an adulterous and spurious offspring, just as it is said of the eagle, whose chicks are tested by being exposed to the rays of the sun, in such a way that if they can bear the sun, they are considered its own and true offspring. But if they squint at the brightness of the sun, it rejects them as illegitimate children. Therefore, if it is deemed worthy of the press, let efforts be made to have it printed either with you, or, if the lack of type does not permit, in Basel. Theodor [Bibliander] will not be absent. For he has promised to undertake the role of proofreader. In summary, I entrust the entire matter to you. However it turns out, I will take it in good part.</p>
      <p>At present, I will not discuss more with you. May the Lord guide you in all things that are worthy of His own word and gospel, and may He so advance the gospel among you that it yields the greatest fruits.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet my loving brothers, especially your household.</p>
      <p>February 7, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Ludwig Lopadius.</p>
      <p>To the man of remarkable piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, my singular friend.</p>
