      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not responded to your most recent letters for such a long time, you will now learn from your Simler or even from my own. Therefore, although I think you have already learned what you wanted to know from me, and perhaps even more certainly than I can write to you, I will nevertheless write what I have been able to learn so far, and that in German; for I understood from your letters that you wanted this." I have been informed by my gracious lord's court that a young nobleman named Bat Wilhelm von Bonstetten from Zürich, who had been at my gracious lord's court for some time and was held in love and esteem by many there, traveled last year with Count Bastian von Helfenstein to Transylvania, and how he returned from there with others fresh and healthy to the land of Württemberg, he did not wish to return to the court, but joined Margrave Albrecht of Brandenburg; there it is said, he perished." Since these things are uncertain, I have not ceased to investigate further; thus I have learned that there are some in the town of this duchy, named Schorndorf, who were companions of Beatus in the later military service. To whom I wrote that they should inform me in good faith in writing at my expense about this matter.</p>
      <p>As soon as I receive this (I expect it daily), I will send it to you at the first opportunity by messenger and in time. Meanwhile, farewell, most learned and excellent man, and may the service of Volmar always be dear to you. Tübingen, on the sixteenth day before the calends of February in the year 1559.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your name, Melchior Volmar Rufus. To the man of exceptional learning, piety, and dignity, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his lord and honorable friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
