    <p xml:id="regest1">Hochholzer thanks for Bullinger's last letter [not received], even though it was brief. He relies on the promise expressed therein that he will not be forgotten. Bullinger admonished him not to leave the office assigned to him thoughtlessly. However, Hochholzer does not act rashly when he considers a new position in his distress. Many things not only speak in favor of it but even urge him to do so. The financial means that others have in abundance are not even enough for his necessities! He is crushed by debts while others are excellently provided for.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">It is not unknown to Bullinger under what conditions he took up his position. What was promised to him is surely not already forgotten. Hochholzer does not doubt Bullinger's goodwill but wants to make it clear that he does not act thoughtlessly. He does not demand that Bullinger procure this or that position for him. However, he would gratefully accept the vacant position of deacon at the Grossmünster. If only an offer for a proper position would come! But he remains hopeful, as everything is in God's hands.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">He only asks that Bullinger and the pastors and councilors of Zurich do not forget him, so that he does not regret having followed the council's decision and lived with a low income and accumulated debts!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">The people of Zurich should ensure that others do not show disobedience out of fear of being forgotten when the council assigns them a position. But enough of that! The well-disposed Bullinger will know what is best for the church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">As a Zurich native, Hochholzer would prefer to serve his homeland, although in need he would not refuse other positions if the people of Zurich did not need his services or preferred others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">So far, he has never regretted complying with Bullinger's will. But now things are such that he must act, which is why he now offers his services to the people of Zurich, as there are vacancies in Zurich and the surrounding area. If he seems suitable for this, Bullinger may make use of him. However, he hopes not to be transferred to a remote place, as he has always obeyed Bullinger until now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">It is not his way to constantly complain, and he has not complained to others either. But in view of his current situation, the people of Zurich should know that he is available to them, so they cannot accuse him of ingratitude if he has to take up a [better] position elsewhere.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Bullinger should continue to support him as promised. Greetings to Rudolf Gwalther, Johannes Haller, and all councilors and pastors. Greetings also from Hochholzer's wife [Sara, née Näf], who eagerly wishes to return to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Enclosed for Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] as a token of gratitude is unfortunately only a small piece of a unicorn's horn. The fact that Hochholzer has never given her anything before is not because he is ungrateful, but rather because he has not found a suitable gift. But now this treasure has come into his hands. And since it is particularly helpful during childbirth, he gives it to her. Bullinger and his wife may kindly accept this modest gift.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I recently received your letters, brief indeed, but nonetheless satisfying to me. For you assure me that you will remember me, of which I have no doubt. You admonish me, and rightly so, not to leave those to whom I am legitimately called, thoughtlessly. I do not think you will judge it rashness if, compelled by necessity, I consider a change of place and condition. For there are many things that not only advise this but almost urge it. For what others receive splendidly and abundantly, I do not receive even for necessity. I am pressed by debt, while others are well provided for.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>It is not unknown to you under what conditions I undertook this province. I do not think what was promised to me is now forgotten. I do not write this because I doubt your faith and goodwill towards me, but only so that I may not seem to act rashly now. Nor do I expect you to ensure that this or that condition is given to me (although if it should happen that I am called to the place of your deacon, which I hear is now vacant, I would by no means refuse, indeed, if judged worthy by you, I would accept with great gratitude), if at least some honorable and legitimate calling were offered to me, about which, as I have never been anxious before, so I am not now. I acknowledge that all these things are in the hand of the Lord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>This I only pray, that you remember me with the other esteemed lords and brothers, so that I may not regret having lived on such a meager stipend during this time, while I have followed your and the most prudent magistrate's will, and accumulated debt, if anything has been lacking so far, may henceforth be repaired.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Also ensure that I do not become an example to others, causing them to be less obedient in such matters, if they see those once sent away consigned to perpetual oblivion. Nor is it necessary for me to discuss with you at length under what titles I would like something to be granted to me. You, with your singular prudence and accustomed goodwill towards me, will perceive what will be best for my situation and most advantageous for the church of Christ.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I prefer to serve my homeland rather than others. Although in the meantime, I do not reject other positions, which I would necessarily accept if indeed my services are not needed by you or if you prefer others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Thus far, I have always allowed myself to be guided by your counsel, and what you judged should be done, I did, nor have I ever, as far as I know, opposed you, nor have I ever regretted this. I have fared well, and it has succeeded. But now my affairs are such that I must provide for myself differently. Therefore, I offer myself and my services to you above all. For there are vacancies both in the city and in the countryside. If indeed I seem worthy, you may make use of me (for I hope I am not to be thrust into any most contemptible place, because I have hitherto obeyed your command).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>And thus far, I have not been accustomed to complain much, nor have I revealed my mind's counsel to anyone. But now, since my affairs are such, I will ensure that at least the chief men of the Zurich republic know that I have offered myself to my homeland above all others, so that if it ever happens that I am called elsewhere and accept a condition, I cannot be accused of ingratitude.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell and keep me in your commendation, and continue to do what you have clearly persuaded me you will do. Greet in my name your entire household, Mr. Gwalther, Mr. Haller, along with all the esteemed lords and brothers. My wife also greets you, who eagerly wishes to see the day of return to her homeland. Aarau, January 4, 1548.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>To your wife, I hereby send a small piece of a unicorn's horn, solely as a token of gratitude. If I could and were able, I would repay the kindness she has shown me with something greater. I have never given her anything before, not because I am so ungrateful, but because I did not know what would be suitable to give her. Now this has become a great treasure to me. I give it to her, for it is particularly useful for women in childbirth, with the request that she kindly accept it from me. The gift may seem small, but the will is good.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Christ in Zurich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
