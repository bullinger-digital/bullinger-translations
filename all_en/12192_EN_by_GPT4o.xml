    <p xml:id="regest1">Aquilomontanus thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received] with the description of the Zurich church and school system. He is pleased about the [new] edition of Zwingli's works, which many have been expecting. Bullinger, for his part, should continue working on his Bible commentaries with the same sincere attitude; the church is already more than enough plagued. - Aquilomontanus has heard that the people of Zurich are planning another writing against the carnal presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper. In doing so, they must not let themselves be carried away by their emotions. In particular, Bullinger should keep the young and temperamental pastor Gwalther at St. Peter, who is married to [Regula] Zwingli and to whom Aquilomontanus has also written, in check. One should not strive for victory, but for the truth to be pursued in patience. - Aquilomontanus continues to strive to be a good catechist and pastor. Therefore, he would be interested in obtaining the publications of the excellently trained Zurich catechist [Otto Werdm√ºller], thanks to Bullinger's preaching activity, through [Johannes] a Lasco. - If only everyone would strive for unity alone and no one would be intent on being wiser than the other! Now that all powers hostile to Christ are closing ranks, [the believers] should hold together all the more, as Calvin has aptly emphasized in the preface to his catechism. - Aquilomontanus will not be unfaithful to Bullinger, even if he should despise him [because of this letter].</p>

      <p>Greetings and spiritual growth.</p>
      <p>I am grateful to you for the lengthy letter in which you describe in detail the system of your church and school. I embrace your affection towards me and my innermost feelings, if the opportunity arises. Furthermore, I rejoice in the publication of Zwingli's works, which many have been eagerly awaiting, and from which no small benefit to the church of God is expected. I urge you, please, to continue in the exposition of the Gospels and not to forget the candor you have maintained thus far. There are more than enough calamities in the church of God; but the Lord foretold these would come. Therefore, let us bear them with a strong spirit, praying in humility. I have heard that you there are again planning something against the carnal presence in the Lord's Supper. I pray through Christ the Savior, that the flesh does not give counsel here or be part of the counsel; this I especially fear in Rudolf Gwalther, the pastor at St. Peter's, since he has Zwingli's daughter as his wife and that fervor in a young and flourishing man is not yet settled, as he has taken upon himself all that was intended for Zwingli. Therefore, ensure that nothing is issued without your moderation and refinement. We should aim not for victory, but for truth pursued with patience. For no one, as it is said in our native tongue, is wise in his own cause. These things I write to you, most distinguished of men, with Christian freedom, from whom I always desire advice in serious matters. I have written to the man, to form a friendship with a learned and fervent man; it is your part to consider my simplicity and trivial writing favorably.</p>
      <p>I indeed do what I have done thus far, and I often turn to the youth and the school, so that I may begin to be a catechist and not neglect the pastoral office.</p>
      <p>I hear that there is a learned and pious man there through your preaching, who has been given as a catechist to the youth; here with great skill and clarity. If anything has been forged for this purpose, I would like you to send it to the magnificent and true bishop, Johannes a Lasco.</p>
      <p>If only everyone would conspire towards unity and each would lend a helping hand to the other, and no one would seek the title of rabbi for himself! We now see all orders, before Christ was born, divided by fatal hatred in this age, now gathering in a dense wedge to attack Christ. If there is such agreement in the prince of hatreds, factions, and dissensions, how much more should we closely unite our minds and forces, who fight for the King of Peace against him! On this matter, I ask you to read Calvin more extensively in the prologue of the Catechism.</p>
      <p>Farewell, excellent Bullinger, and consider our infancy favorably. I will not abandon you, once you have accepted me, even if you despise me. Farewell again and pray, that the Lord may be with us, as it is now most necessary in so many calamities.</p>
      <p>From our chamber, April 25, 1545. Yours, Hermann Aquilomontanus, minister of the church</p>
      <p>at the House of the Elders in Emden, the capital of East Frisia.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, a singular friend, known for his piety, learning, and vigilance.</p>
