    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer knew that Bullinger would like the opinion that speaks [against] alliances [with antichristian bishops and prelates]. However, he is surprised that Bullinger did not enclose the opinion as announced, and asks him to send it, as he does not have a copy of it. - Blarer will report to Bullinger immediately if there is important news, unless no messenger is available. - Johannes Haller is just as Bullinger described him and is very suitable for the Augsburg church. Blarer has informed him [about their circumstances] and will continue to support him in the future. - Zwingli's son [Huldrych the Younger] is in many ways just like his father. Haller did not even stay in Konstanz for a day. - Blarer sends a letter from the princes [Johann Friedrich I of Saxony and Philipp of Hesse] to Strasbourg, which recently arrived with other letters [in Konstanz] and from which one can see how the [Catholic] opponents exploit the honesty of the [Protestants]. If only [the Protestants] could refrain from such religious discussions that do more harm than good! Bullinger should return the letter and the above-mentioned document. - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I indeed thought beforehand that this advice, which I sent regarding the alliances, could not displease you. I am truly surprised, however, that I have not received it, since you yourself write that you are sending it back there; but perhaps, as often happens, you were carried away by other matters and forgot to enclose it in the letters. I ask you now to send it, especially since I have no other copy.</p>
      <p>Regarding my faith and diligence in writing to you, if I ever learn anything concerning you, your people, or even our common affairs, I do not want you to have any doubts. I will not fail you, unless I lack messengers, whom we often miss here.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, a young man of utmost candor and candid gravity, seems to me exactly as you described him to us, and he will be very suitable, unless I am completely mistaken, to serve the church in Augsburg. May the Lord graciously imbue him with the union of His spirit, so that he may work faithfully and successfully in that vast vineyard. I have advised him on some matters; furthermore, I will do or write anything necessary wherever my advice is needed by him.</p>
      <p>The son of our blessedly remembered Zwingli, in many respects, is the very image of his father; endowed with a certain holy simplicity, which experience will gradually sharpen beautifully. Haller did not want to stay with us even for a single day; otherwise, we would have shown him more humanity and duty.</p>
      <p>I am sending the letter from our princes to the people of Strasbourg, which was sent in recent days along with some other letters to us, from which you will understand how our adversaries abuse the sincerity of our people. Please return this letter along with the previous one. If only the end of these discussions were better than what our adversaries intend! If only our people, who have been struck so many times by such discussions, would greatly (as they absolutely should) refrain from them, since nothing is gained by these means; indeed, much is hindered! Let us pray to the Lord to forgive this foolishness of ours and to so moderate it with His divine wisdom that we may never suffer any penalties for it, but rather, with everything turning out more happily than we deserve, we may glorify His great name with all our hearts.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest and best Bullinger, with your entire household and all your servants in the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, November 18, 1545.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a friend in every way supreme. In Zurich.</p>
