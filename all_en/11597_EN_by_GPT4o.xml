    <p xml:id="regest1">He is beside himself with grief over the death of [Simon] Grynaeus. The new prophet [Ruprecht von Mosham] from Passau, who has already deceived the people of Nuremberg and Strasbourg, revealed his true nature in Basel during a lengthy conversation; after being dismissed by the council with a gift, he will surely come to Zurich, which is why Myconius, on behalf of his colleagues, warns the people of Zurich about him; initially, however, Mosham is seeking out the Bishop of Basel [Philipp von Gundelsheim]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace.</p>
      <p>I do not know what to write, I am so beside myself. There are tears, lamentations, and much wailing, and there is no one to console; for our Grynaeus has departed to the heavens. I add nothing more.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while he was gravely struggling, another calamity came, all the more serious as it is more pestilent, namely the dean from Passau, a new prophet, indeed a new Pelagius, who, after deceiving the people of Nuremberg and many others in Strasbourg, finally came here hoping he could spread his errors in the world, because the free people are neither bound to the pope nor fear the emperor and king. For he himself told me this reason and asked that I promote his plan with all my might. However, after some privately met with him and realized through experience that he is not a good man, wanting to teach, not to be taught, boasting remarkably of his revelations and countless other things of this kind, it seemed to our lords that he should be dismissed with an honorary gift. He will undoubtedly come to you; therefore, the brothers have entrusted me to warn you with all diligence to beware of him immediately; for he is such that he insinuates himself and his little books beautifully and kindles a fire where you least expected. It would be too long to narrate what he has planned here. But, since there is no time, I will reserve it for the future. I feared he might precede these letters; however, upon closer inspection, he has gone directly from here to the Bishop of Basel. Thus, he intrudes upon everyone indiscriminately, if he can find someone to help confuse everything. Beware!</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest brothers, and consult this perplexity well. In Basel, hastily, August 8, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the lords Heinrich Bullinger and Theodor Bibliander, venerable in the Lord.</p>
