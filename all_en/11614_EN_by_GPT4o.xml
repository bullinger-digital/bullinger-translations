    <p xml:id="regest1">A relative of Leo [Jud] left [the opinions on Grynäus' lecture about the Lord's Supper] [in Basel]; Myconius tore up the accompanying letter, and he is now sending back the opinions of Bullinger and Jud. Due to the plague, he is unable to present his objections - especially to Bullinger's opinion [No. 1550] - but if Grynäus were still alive, he could undoubtedly clear up some misunderstandings and would otherwise point out the requirements of concord; through the dispute over the Lord's Supper, the devil hinders the spread of the Gospel, as is currently shown again by the departure of [Johann] Forster and [Joachim] Camerarius from Tübingen; since Myconius could not decipher the transcript of Grynäus' lecture, he does not want to comment on it, but what Bullinger accuses him of, he has never heard from him. The dean [Ruprecht von Mosham] has apparently learned from past experiences and concealed his arrogant claims in Zurich; in conversation [with Myconius], it became clear how much he clings to works righteousness. He probably tried to explore the stance of the people of Zurich to report back to his clients; he must either be a bad person or mentally ill. It is strange that he asked for a recommendation from Myconius, even though he can do nothing more for him; in his books, he shows a different face; Myconius thanks for the communication of the conversation protocol. The Turkish victory [at Buda] was not unexpected and, like the plague, is a sign of God's wrath over Germany; Poland is being devastated by locusts. He inquires whether the Zurich council is also trying to keep those recovered from the plague away from the healthy; [the Basel pastors] cannot justify announcing this from the pulpit. He must break off due to dizziness. Greetings. He will take care of Rudolf's [Gwalther] request and lets him know that [Wilhelm] Zwingli has died in Strasbourg, even though he was taken to the countryside.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If any of Leo's relatives come there, you will rightly reproach them; for they left behind your and his opinions along with mine (which I soon tore up). But now, behold, I send them to you.</p>
      <p>I am unable to respond due to the business caused by the plague, although there are certain things, especially in your response about faith, that greatly trouble me, about which perhaps another time, if the Lord grants life and peace. If Grynäus had not been taken from us, there is no doubt that he would have responded in such a way as to indicate many things not properly understood and, what remains, to clearly pertain to the concord of all in this matter. It is no secret that the devil finds the concord about the Eucharist very troublesome, especially where the Gospel is preached, as he has hindered it for so long. Because of the same contention, Camerarius along with a certain Forster left Tübingen. I wish these foolishnesses would finally cease! Indeed, believe me, I have not yet read Grynäus' dictations; for with his books closed, I can obtain nothing from others except how they transcribed them. But because of the poor handwriting, I cannot read them, and they are more uncorrected, as is usual with such transcriptions, than that I can trust them. Therefore, I am not to defend or attack them; however, I saw in your writings certain things which I never heard from Grynäus when the matter was discussed, etc.</p>
      <p>How differently it turned out than that titled dean in Switzerland hoped! How is it that he did not act among you as he did in Nuremberg, Strasbourg, and here, to say nothing of other cities and places? The petition he presented to our senate showed that he wanted to become a prince from our city. To this end, he not only sought advice and help but also a canonry in the main church and permission for his books to be copied here and spread throughout the Christian world. If there were time, I would send you the entire petition as described. Among you, he asked for nothing except to confer with you and Pellican. He certainly did not share what he secretly holds in his mind; otherwise, you would have heard a Pelagian. In familiar conversation, while he almost exalted works to heaven and said that a man could ascend to the highest perfection here, when it was objected why then the church prays: "Forgive us," etc., he replied that this prayer, when made by a perfect man, does not pertain to him but to imperfect brothers, which is why it is said "us," not "me." From this, it can be clearly understood how he wants works joined to faith for a man's justification. But what else is this than to detract from the merit of Christ's passion?</p>
      <p>Since he did not succeed here or in Bern, he decided to act differently among you (which he also did) and, after knowing the minds of all, to return to his own, not to say those of Passau, but to those who sent him on this pilgrimage; for I am more and more convinced daily that he was sent by uncertain ones. As far as I can understand with thought and mind, the man is either notably bad or of unsound mind. Many things compel me to this, but especially the obstinacy he used here and the suddenly changed plan he acted on there. I am very surprised why he asked for recommendations to me, after he spoke with me only once and in that conversation understood my mind well enough. If he returns, I can add nothing to the senate's decree or take anything away from there. Through it, passage is allowed along with lunch or dinner. The books he published certainly show a different person than he presented to us. But however these things stand, I rejoice and give thanks that you did not want me to be ignorant of this action. May the Lord repay that benevolent spirit towards me and always ready to serve me.</p>
      <p>You have surely heard of the slaughter inflicted by the Turk. Indeed, from what preceded, I foresaw it so clearly that I never hesitated. We will not defeat the Turks with "great torment and wounds," etc., to say nothing of the rest. The common plague and common enemy indicate God's great wrath against Germany. In the borders of Poland, a swarm of locusts has destroyed everything.</p>
      <p>Someone, I don't know who, spread in our senate that the people of Zurich ordered that those who recovered from the plague should not go out in public for a time, and immediately our senate decided and ordered that we announce it from the pulpit, which is impossible for us as Christian teachers. It would be strange if anything like this was done by you; indeed, I do not believe it.</p>
      <p>Dizziness commands me to stop. Farewell with yours in Christ. Greet Leo, Theodor, everyone. Basel, September 22, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>I could not write to Rudolf due to dizziness. Tell him I will diligently carry out what he requested. And add the sad news that Zwingli has died in Strasbourg, although they took him to a village away from the city, etc.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed in the Lord.</p>
