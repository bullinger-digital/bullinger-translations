      <p>Greetings in Christ.</p>
      <p>Since I know that you are more fully and better informed about the many greater affairs of our English state and church by the letters of others, I will now write about a few minor matters according to my modest ability. On my return journey from you to England, I saw in Strasbourg a proclamation, that is, an edict published in writing by the authority of Queen Elizabeth, severely prohibiting all preaching and exposition of Holy Scripture, or any change of religion throughout England, until the supreme council, which we call Parliament, to be convened later, would decide on religion. Thus, when I returned to England, according to the aforementioned proclamation, I saw, or rather did not want to see, masses and all papal nonsense and abominations everywhere fortified by the authority of the laws, and the gospel nowhere, except among some in London, who were either admitted before the queen in the court, only during Lent, on a few customary days, or in a congregation persevering in hiding throughout the time of persecution, and then emerging not beyond open private houses, with the persecution ceasing by Queen Elizabeth, in open private houses, but not permitted in any public temples. For there had been a congregation of faithful in London hiding during the time of persecution under Mary, among whom the gospel was always preached with the sincere administration of the sacraments; but during the harsh persecution under Mary, they diligently concealed themselves, and with the persecution ceasing under Elizabeth, they persevered in the same congregation even openly. But because their pious religion was condemned by the laws of the kingdom, the magistrates, while conniving at frequent gatherings in private houses, nevertheless did not want to allow them to occupy public temples. Therefore, many flocked to them not in public temples, but in private houses. And when the Lord's Supper was celebrated among them, no strangers were admitted, except those who were kept pure from papism and any note of infamy, or those who, acknowledging their own defection and public offense, humbly sought forgiveness and reconciliation before all.</p>
      <p>Thus indeed I often attended, and saw many returning with tears, and many similarly with tears receiving such into communion; so that nothing could ever be sweeter than their mutual tears, sympathizing with each other's sins, and rejoicing in reconciliation and renewed fellowship in Christ Jesus. Inflamed by these, certain preachers returned from Germany to England, and understanding that the silence commanded until a long and uncertain time did not agree with the Pauline command and exhortation to preach the word of God in season and out of season, at once, when requested, we preached the gospel in some public temples, to which a frequent audience eagerly flocked. And when conversion to Christ through true repentance was seriously addressed, then many tears of many testified that the preaching of the gospel was more effective for true repentance and salutary reformation than anything the whole world could devise or approve.</p>
      <p>For while these things were conducted among private individuals without any public authority approving, behold, at the same time among those excelling in power, wealth, and public offices, with the highest authority of laws, edicts, and customs, masses were celebrated with all papal idolatrous superstition. And now finally by the authority of Parliament, papism is abolished, and the true religion of Christ is restored: this unclean world, as in that, so in this, seeks nothing but shameful gain and foul pleasure. Many are converted from that to this, so that they neither want to purge the dregs of that, nor embrace the purity of this, but wish to conform to the form of this age. For the monuments of superstition, the profits of gain, the liberty, indeed the pleasure of the flesh, with great scandal and disgrace to the religion they profess, many love, have, and display. Yet God will finally give victory to the little flock of Christ against the powerful tyrants of the world. For all the bloodthirsty bishops here among us are deposed: learned, pious, and prudent men are sent to visit all the regions of England.</p>
      <p>Zealous preachers of the gospel, who first preached against the queen's edict, now have the free faculty to preach throughout all England with letters signed with the queen's seal. And I, who have long been in remote parts evangelizing among the most ignorant, have decided, God willing, to return tomorrow from London to the same and similar ones, who have rarely or never heard any exposition of the gospel of Christ. For such seem to me to most desire and most gladly receive the offered edification and consolation in the gospel of Christ. There is nothing more to write about myself, except that I now wish to promise by letter, that according to the opportunity and ability that God will supply, I will always faithfully strive; to let you and your people, who kindly supported the English exiles for the sake of religion, know that we will always remain mindful and not ungrateful for such great beneficence. Commend us to the prayers of all the pious.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife for me, my excellent hostess, with your children, and the whole family, to whom I wish many blessings of God in Christ. Greet the ministers of the church with you, and separately the chief pillars of the same, Mr. Bernhard, Mr. Martyr, and Mr. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus long preserve you for the edification of his whole church in Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>London, August 8, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours always devotedly faithful in Christ, Th. Lever.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and wise father, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Switzerland: ZÃ¼rich.</p>
