    <p xml:id="regest1">Hopes that Bullinger and his family are well; Hochholzer has arrived [with Johannes Pontisella] in Frankfurt; in Basel and Strasbourg, they were kindly received by the scholars present, especially by Wolfgang Capito and Jakob Bedrot, while Martin Bucer was dismissive. Christoph Rotacher accompanies them on the advice of Myconius; Rotacher will not marry the girl [Barbel Esslisperg], but may have to provide for a child; the rumor that he has married another is false. The plans regarding their stay in Marburg are still unclear; over the winter, Hochholzer [and Pontisella] would like to stay in Marburg, unless the plague raging along the Rhine breaks out there as well. Christoph Froschauer has handed him 14 guilders, which Bullinger or Johann Jakob Ammann will reimburse; for this, the wheat due to him should be sold; they strive to live frugally and honestly. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If you and your entire family are well, most esteemed father, it is very pleasing.</p>
      <p>My companion and I are indeed well. We have arrived in Frankfurt quite successfully, after being delayed on the journey for a long time. We visited the learned individuals in Basel and Strasbourg, who all treated us kindly and promised their ready assistance, especially those in Basel, and no less Dr. Capito and Bedrot in Strasbourg (for Sturmius was absent) showed great goodwill, except for Bucer, whom we approached with Dr. Bedrot while he was standing in front of his house, and we greeted him; then, when Bedrot said that we were from Zurich, and we affirmed the same, he barely returned our greeting as politely as possible, entered the house, perhaps occupied with some business, leaving us, whom he had barely greeted with a word or two.</p>
      <p>Now I return to our matters: Christoph Rotacher is traveling with us on the advice of Myconius, freed from the one he had wronged; he may be forced to support the child, yet he is not bound by the law of marriage, for he had not pledged his faith to the girl. Besides her, he has not taken another, as the rumor had reached Zurich. We are now heading to Marburg together, from there you will soon learn diligently how our affairs stand. For now, I myself do not know how things will turn out from here, but well, unless my hope deceives me. We have decided to stay in Marburg over the winter, unless the plague begins to rage there as well. For in all the places along the Rhine, to which we have come so far, it exerts some force.</p>
      <p>Christoph Froschauer gave me 14 guilders, which you or Dr. Ammann, the schoolmaster, will receive. For if I am not mistaken, it will be easy to satisfy him for these, if the wheat that belongs to me is sold and added to the stipend. We will be frugal, as long as we are in our right minds. For we see even now at the very threshold, how much is needed. I promise that in all things I will act in such a way as you, most observant father, and others seem to wish.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and never drive me away from your protection. You will greet in my name as politely as possible your wife, who has deserved the best from me, and all your happy offspring. Also your brother, Dr. Johann, my very good friend, and his wife, your servant Brygitta, especially Anna Keller.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, 15th of September 1541.</p>
      <p>Christian Hochholzer, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and no less pious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed father.</p>
