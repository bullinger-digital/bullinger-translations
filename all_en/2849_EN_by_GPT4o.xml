      <p>Greetings. I have not yet received your letters and I am surprised that the young man who had taken mine has been absent for so long and neglects the opportunity that could now be provided to him. You will soon receive the book you requested. For now, there is nothing else, except that the Elector Palatine has died. If Otto Heinrich succeeds him, there is hope that it will significantly contribute to the advancement of religion. The Margrave, our neighbor, is delaying longer than we would like; we are expecting a response from him these days, as he has been approached by the prefects of the monastery at St. Alban and also by me in the name of a certain parish within his domain, to which, due to the right of patronage, as they call it, we have appointed a preacher from the city for two months now, and the teaching of the gospel is flourishing with notable success. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all your family.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 5, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your [faithful] Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
