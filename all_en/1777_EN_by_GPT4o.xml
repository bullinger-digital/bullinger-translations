      <p>Man of utmost distinction in every way, for with this true praise I wish to cut off the circumlocutions of all introductions; for I know how occupied you are with others and how briefly I must conclude everything, we received your letters today. A few years ago, the people of Davos supported a few priests who performed masses; soon they consolidated their entire region into one parish, giving a single preacher one hundred Rhenish gold coins annually, who preaches in four churches.</p>
      <p>Among us, there is no one whom we judge suitable for them; we were hoping for some serious man from your side. Now, frustrated by this beautiful hope, we do not know where to turn; we hope that God will appear unexpectedly. Many parishes among us are lacking preachers; they offer fifty Rhenish gold coins, some sixty. Everyone wants to know, but no one wants to pay the fee. Many churchmen in the Confederation, believe me, suffer from hunger; for the greatest part has no more than 60 Rhenish gold coins. Those who have the highest salaries reach 120 Rhenish gold coins; only our Comander has as much.</p>
      <p>There are no scholars in the Confederation from whom you might hope something will be accomplished in this matter. Where the situation in the Confederation will lead, God knows. Preachers and teachers have been granted to our Valtellina under the agreement, which the bearer here, a man of great renown among us and a senator most favorable to us all, will tell you. - To acquaint you with Camillus, I send you here a booklet, or rather syllogisms mostly collected from his very extensively written book in Italian by me. Even if all these are my words, you should believe that I have done everything faithfully; for it was read by the brothers of the synod, in which he himself was present. On this very day, however, I write to the authorities of the Valtellina about him and other matters pertinent to the case. Read these gleanings of Camillus, if it seems good, and when you have read them, return them to us after a few days. In the next eight days, if God wills, you will see my very lengthy letters about all the institutions of our synod in the Confederation, which we all ask you to read, understand, and judge. In the meantime, farewell, most esteemed man to us. News about military matters from Italy will be told to you here, if asked. In the meantime, farewell again. From Chur, on the 12th of December in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander and Philippus Gallicius. To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and brother, etc., in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
