      <p>Conrad Gessner, Doctor of Philosophy, to his singular patron Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Having finally completed, by the grace of God, the book on aquatic animals, new and even greater labors arise for miserable me. For almost 20 continuous years now, I have never had the chance to rest even a little from my studies. I do not wish for idle and useless rest, but only for a tranquil one, more suitable to my profession of both healing and reading: for until now, I have done both superficially and perfunctorily, overwhelmed as I am with writing books and typographical business. If I were given leisure from these, and enjoyed better health (which is now, as my extreme pallor and emaciation indicate, utterly afflicted), and lived with a more cheerful spirit, which is now almost always sad and dejected, I would undoubtedly handle medical matters more successfully and my readings more fruitfully. Why then do you not abstain (someone might say) from these businesses, content with your salary? But if I had abstained, who would have satisfied my creditors when I returned from France as a young man, supported there by a meager stipend? Who would have provided sustenance for me and my family, when you for some time supplied no more than thirty florins a year? From where would I have bought a house, when I was wandering about? How would I have supported my relatives, nephews, nieces, most of whom are in extreme poverty, and my dearest mother? Not to mention the somewhat more decent sustenance necessary for me, considering my poor health, and the many and precious books (which I could not do without). Now, too, many of the same reasons exist and remain; some perhaps even greater, such as the number of poor relatives. Therefore, I am forced to live not as a doctor or a liberal scholar, but as the most wretched laborer. Someone might think me rich enough, who has bought a house, then a garden outside the city, and now even built at great expense. But buying a house was necessary unless I wanted to wander about; the small garden, which I bought to plant herbs in, whose use and knowledge are most pertinent to a doctor, I have now sold again due to poverty, to build one or two comfortable rooms (which I have long lacked) with that money.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, Mr. Bullinger, for repeating much of what you already know: it had to be repeated for the sake of seeking your advice. The Frobens (to whom I must respond within a month) ask me to compare the translations of all Galen's works to the Greek originals, an enormous labor. Froschauer asks me to condense an epitome of three volumes on animals.</p>
      <p>Am I now, exhausted by labors, worn out, emaciated, almost blinded, not to mention sometimes barely myself (no wonder in these forced writings so lengthy), to return again to the old grindstone? Am I to undertake again the labor from which I have not rested for two or three whole years? Is this what you advise me, Mr. Bullinger? Please give me kinder advice, by which I may have some regard for my health, both of mind and body, so that I do not spend nights largely sleepless, while either thoughts of studying or sorrow from the lack of hope for a better condition drive away sleep: so that I do not waste away with a sad and dejected spirit perpetually. Why is it not finally decreed that a single full stipend be granted to me, a doctor of the city and public lecturer (who has served the country for twenty years now), for double labor, so that I may finally enjoy some small rest in my declining years. I am certainly no longer equal to sustaining the labors of studies: the printers seek only large books, they even reject small ones for free. I can do something in medicine (by the grace of God) if I apply diligence, and the sick comply, and do not call too much, more than common doctors. I have the most excellent doctors of princes and kings as friends, who not only often teach me something with their letters and send some exquisite remedies: but they are also taught by me, and some do not disdain to call me their teacher. I do not write this to you, Mr. Bullinger, but so that you, if necessary (and it is very much so), may commend me to our senators with these and similar arguments. Someone might object that younger doctors also need to be supported.</p>
      <p>But they could also be helped from what I now receive from the city and from you: they are young, they have inheritances, I know they will earn far more from medicine than I do. For my mind is alien, and my whole nature is unfit for earning.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would soon yield to them: for my body feels a premature old age, and my face speaks of it. I am without counsel, my dear Mr. Bullinger, unless you give it, and unless you help, I do not know what melancholy will consume me due to the ingratitude of my country. If you are willing and try seriously, you can do much.</p>
      <p>I depend solely on you as my patron: and I wish to owe my freedom and myself entirely to you.</p>
      <p>Whatever you promise about me, whatever you commend in me, I will fulfill with all faith and diligence. Armed with your testimony, that by the labor of my lectures alone, I deserve as much as other lecturers, (not that I compare myself to others: yet I think this can be said by you,) I wish to present my case to the senate, and at the same time offer the book on aquatic animals, only as a token, so that they may estimate my labors over 20 years in composing almost twelve such volumes, by which I am certainly too much (indeed entirely) distracted from medicine.</p>
      <p>It is fair, however, that I account for my profession to them, especially at this time, when I have finished a great work, and a new one was to be begun: so that if they wish me to continue thus, I will; if not, and to be more diligent in medicine by their liberality, that too may be done. If I were to devote myself more diligently to the study of healing, I might perhaps, with God's help, sometimes save great men from the most dangerous diseases, and snatch them (if it is permissible to say) from the very jaws of death. And if a plague were to strike, which God forbid, I would have some precious and singular remedies, given some leisure to prepare them, which is not allowed now. If the senate wishes to have me as a good and cheerful doctor, they should also show themselves to be liberal and kind patrons to me. No doctor in our age knows the section of the arteries in the temples, almost no one in the most serious diseases of women uses uterine clysters and some other things, which I have used successfully more than once, having repeated them from the age of Hippocrates. I have cured several severe dropsies, not a few apoplexies, many epilepsies, and other great diseases (by the grace of God) in those who were willing to call early and obey. I have revived some elderly asthmatics who were almost breathing their last.</p>
      <p>In the knowledge of animals, herbs, and all simple medicines, which are of the greatest importance to medicine, I would lie if I claimed to surpass almost all doctors who live and have lived, unless I could prove it by the testimonies of today's leading doctors. Finally, in the understanding of the Greek language, necessary for understanding the books of ancient doctors (of which we have many, and I privately have some manuscripts, never published), I will easily yield to no one, who does not have that language as familiar to them as their native tongue, whether it is necessary to write or speak. I reluctantly proclaim these things, nor would I wish to do so to anyone other than you and a few like you, who can judge my modesty. You will forgive these outpourings, Mr. Bullinger, and you will have me commended, as I trust. If I find your recommendations useful to me, and gain some leisure not so much for my own as for the public's benefit, I will declare my perpetual gratitude towards you and yours. If not, I will continue in the way I have begun, to somewhat relieve and waste away in my labors and sorrows: or I will swallow something else, I do not know what. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Conrad Gessner.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich NÃ¼scheler.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I hoped, most distinguished man, that I would easily live here in the Baths with the money I received from you: but what can I say? Fortune has deceived my hope, which turns everything at its own will, I speak in human terms, for there is no fortune if we believe in divine will, fate, and providence, which does not, as the pagans say of fortune, randomly turn everything unstable, but produces both what has happened and what is to come in a certain and unchanging series, leads the willing, drags the unwilling. But lest I seem to cover with words for too long, I will say once what I wanted to entrust to you, to keep silent until I return, and pour into your bosom. I have taken a wife, not indeed rich, but young, modest, and who is to me the greatest dowry, chaste, and loving of me, I do not know whether I will add beautiful, for a wife is to be taken not for beauty, but for character. I followed the advice of one of the wise, who, when consulted by a young man, whom two girls, one rich, the other poor, were courting, replied [Greek], that is, let each take the one nearest and most similar to himself.</p>
      <p>Indeed, as long as I live, I will never desert her, no matter who hinders, not because I am so inferior in love, but because I have given my word: Moreover, this will not be a hindrance to my studies, but a spur. Please send four gold coins through this driver, and if it comes to that, protect my interests, I beg you, show yourself as a parent, you will also feel me as a son and obedient in the future. Farewell.</p>
      <p>If you think it would be more prudent, reveal the matter to Bullinger and show him this letter, but only to him, for I have him as my greatest and almost only patron.</p>
      <p>On the next Saturday of Easter, I will certainly be at home. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>From the Baths, [14?] March.</p>
