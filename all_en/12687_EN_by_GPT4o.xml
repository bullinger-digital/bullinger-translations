    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller wrote on October 18 [No. 2631] and gave [Georg] Frölich the letter because he reported that a public messenger [...] would set off for Konstanz. But yesterday the letter was still with Frölich! He will now send it off with his own letter [No. 2639].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] On October 14, about 1000 Imperial soldiers fell in skirmishes between cavalry cohorts. On the 16th, there were combat actions in which both sides had to endure many casualties.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] On the same day [correctly: on the 14th or 15th], Spaniards plundered a village [Elchingen] adjacent to a monastery [the Imperial Abbey of Elchingen]. They dragged the women into the monastery and raped them. The population banded together, attacked the enemies in the monastery, and killed several of them. Some fled to the church tower, which was set on fire with them inside.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] On October 18, riders from Augsburg confiscated eight wagons with five loads of provisions intended for the Emperor's [Charles V] camp. The drivers were released, the horses sold, and the food distributed among the poor and soldiers in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] These days, Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg has allegedly joined the [Schmalkaldic] army with 15,000 infantry and 1,800 cavalry.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] It is also said that many of the riders sent by [King Francis I of] France are currently joining the [Schmalkaldic] forces through Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] On October 20, a cavalry troop from Augsburg once again conducted a reconnaissance mission to Rain [am Lech], where 200 Imperial cavalrymen are stationed. They encountered looting cavalrymen and killed 30 of them. 13 horses were brought to Augsburg, but no prisoners, because according to the laws of war and to Schertlin's annoyance, they cannot be killed and become dangerous traitors after their release.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] On October 21, two wagons with provisions were confiscated. Yesterday, peasants brought four captured Spaniards into the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The son [...] of an Augsburg guild master [...], who arrived in Augsburg yesterday, was arrested on suspicion of espionage. He lived in Italy for a long time, often frequented the Emperor's court, and was also in the Imperial camp until yesterday. Some believe he should be hanged on the newly erected gallows.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] On October 21, loud cannon shots were heard on the [surrounding] heights. Haller could not yet learn anything about it. Since the Emperor is situated between Augsburg and the [Schmalkaldic] army, a detour of ten miles is necessary to reach the latter. Therefore, it takes at least three days for news from the camp to arrive.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] [Sebastian] Lepusculus will work in Augsburg. However, since the otherwise learned and pious [Hieronymus] Gunz does not possess a talent for teaching [meaning preaching], he will be sent back to Basel, albeit with a good testimonial.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] The return of the Zurich pastors [Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer] is expected daily. Bullinger should urge them to better behavior, for they are not leading peasants, but such a distinguished population as is hardly found elsewhere in Germany! They should also not quarrel among themselves to avoid causing offense. They should also refrain from rustic drinking in taverns, as they are judged by the people of Augsburg more by their lifestyle than by their teaching. Haller writes this in their interest, especially because he cares about the reputation of the Zurich church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Any news that arrives today would be added by Haller [to this letter] before [Lepusculus and Gunz depart for Basel]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you on the 18th of this month about the news I had at that time. Mr. Laetus had told me that a public messenger was going to set off for Konstanz. Therefore, I handed the letter to Mr. Laetus, but yesterday I still found it with him. He will now send it along with his own letters. He promised to write to you about the current news.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>On October 14, several cavalry cohorts clashed. No less than 1000 were lost from the Imperial side. Then on October 16, there was another skirmish, not a full battle, but one in which many from both sides were lost.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>On the same day, some Spaniards came to a certain village adjacent to a monastery (whose name I do not remember), where they not only plundered everything but also dragged women and virgins into the monastery by force and violated them. The peasants, having gathered together, attacked them in the monastery and killed many. The rest escaped to the tower. Since they could not be lured out, the tower was set on fire, and they were killed by the smoke.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>On October 18, our cavalry went out and intercepted 8 wagons with 5 carts carrying provisions to the Emperor's camp and brought them to Augsburg. The drivers were released, the horses sold, and the bread distributed among the poor and soldiers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In these days, Duke of Württemberg has joined our forces with 15,000 infantry and 1,800 cavalry, as they say.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>There is also a consistent rumor that a large number of cavalry sent by the French have crossed over to us through Strasbourg in these days.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>On October 20, our cavalry went out again and reached the town of Rain, where there are 200 Imperial cavalrymen, some of whom they found looting peasants. About 30 of them were killed, none captured, but only 13 empty horses were brought back. Schertlin is indignant if such rascals are brought back as captives, whom they cannot kill by military law and who become the worst traitors when released.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>On October 21, two wagons with provisions were confiscated. Yesterday, that is, October 22, the peasants brought back 4 captured Spaniards.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>There is also a certain tribune among us who has a son who spent a long time in Italy and frequently followed the Emperor's court and was in his camp until yesterday. He came to Augsburg yesterday, undoubtedly on suspicion of treason; our people arrested him and put him in chains. Some think he should be hanged on the newly erected gallows in the market.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>On October 21, there was an inhuman amount of shooting heard on the mountains, making one think something new might have happened. However, I have not yet heard anything, because, since the Emperor is situated between us and our camp, one must make a detour of 10 miles. Therefore, it takes three days to receive news from the camp. If anything new comes up, I will let you know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Lepusculus will stay with us. Although Guntius is a very learned and pious man, he does not have any talent for teaching; therefore, he is being sent back to his people with the most honorable excuses.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>We are expecting the arrival of the Zurich brothers any day now. Please instruct them to adopt different manners and not to think they are leading peasants, but such a people as can hardly be found elsewhere in Germany. Also, they should be in harmony with each other, so as not to cause any scandal among themselves. They should avoid rustic hospitality and feasting. Our people can judge them more harshly for their lifestyle than for their doctrine. I write this because I care for them and wish for the good of the entire church and the name of Zurich. Farewell. Augsburg, October 23, early morning.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>If I hear any more news today before they leave, I will add it. Greet the brothers. Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his lord and venerable father.</p>
