      <p>Greetings. I truly give the greatest thanks to your piety and kindness, illustrious man and one to be respected by me for many reasons, for that Clement of yours, which, having now received, I could not read entirely, but soon I read certain parts of it and it seemed to me that I could sense the book to be spurious, transcribed from the books of Recognitions, which were once published by Rufinus. Certainly, the beginning is taken from the letter, which is said to be from Clement to James, the brother of the Lord; soon, however, it transitions to the first book of Recognitions, from which, after reciting certain parts, it will transition after a few pages to the second book of Recognitions, so that, although it does not seem to be an epitome by the translator of these books, the matter itself speaks of being taken from them.</p>
      <p>I myself deny it to be a compendium, since it does not conveniently encompass in brevity what is more fully described in those books.</p>
      <p>It clearly appears to be a rhapsody of some reader of Clement's books, which he prepared for himself while reading, omitting many things and sometimes connecting the series of history at his discretion. I think you will judge the same if you compare this book with the books of Recognitions. As for the translator of the booklet, I agree with you; for he seems not to have rendered the author's meaning well everywhere. Now, what I think of the work itself, both of those ten books and of this collection undoubtedly taken from here and there, since you command so, I will explain briefly. I will not deny that it was by some Greek writer named Clement, but I do not believe it was by that ancient Roman bishop, the disciple of Peter and Paul. The reason why I do not believe is this: the doctrines and the treatment of doctrines do not seem to reflect the taste of apostolic simplicity and sincerity; many philosophical things are mixed in, and many things are not at all alien to fables, but very alien to apostolic gravity and the men of the apostles. Furthermore, since the most famous writer of ecclesiastical history, Eusebius, a man learned and diligent to a miraculous degree, reviews all ecclesiastical writers and enumerates their books, and also mentions Clement, the apostolic man, in more than one place and does not omit that he also wrote to the Corinthians (in the third book of ecclesiastical history, chapter 15, etc.), but makes no mention of these books and other letters, to whom, I ask, are those works not therefore suspect? To this is added the diligence of the blessed Jerome, a man most learned in every respect.</p>
      <p>You know he wrote an elegant and accurate book about ecclesiastical writers and in that very book makes mention of Clement, the apostolic man, and also commemorates his works and yet makes no mention of either the books of Recognitions or the letter to James, the brother of the Lord; he does indeed mention a certain other letter than the one he wrote to the Corinthians, but adds that it is rejected by the ancients. In the book of councils once published in Paris and Cologne, there is a decree of Pope Gelasius with 70 bishops concerning apocryphal scriptures, in which among other things, under the name of the itinerary of the Apostle Peter, which is called St. Clement's, the ten books are apocryphal. Now, Marsilius of Padua, a most learned jurist and of rare erudition and varied reading, wrote the Defender of Peace 200 years ago and in the second discourse, chapter 28, asserts that the letters of Clement to James, the brother of the Lord, are suspect. Indeed, the abbot Trithemius, at the very beginning of his ecclesiastical writings, says, "The ten books of Clement's itinerary, likewise the Disputation of Peter, are counted among the apocrypha, as is clear in the 15th distinction of the Holy Roman; other letters of his are also said to exist, but they are apocryphal." These are what I had to respond to your request at present. I pray you consider these things kindly and keep me commended to your piety. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 10, in the year of our Lord 1555. To your excellence, Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
      <p>To the royal ambassador Sanlaurentius in Solothurn.</p>
