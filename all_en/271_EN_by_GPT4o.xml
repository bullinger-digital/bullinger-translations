      <p>S. P. To your letters, venerable lord and godfather, I will respond more fully, especially to each point, than I can now due to great business and significant inconveniences. My dearest brother Musculus came to me, and I was more delighted by his arrival than can be expressed. He asked me for advice on whether he should come with me to Bern or not.</p>
      <p>At present, it seems to me that it is not convenient for him to travel to Bern with me, partly because I will not return there directly, but will first delay in Zofingen and Thun for examinations, so that I can hardly return to Bern within eight days, and partly so that certain suspicious people do not suspect some kind of scheme, as if I wanted to introduce him in such a way. It seems to me that the best advice is for him to go to Zurich. I promised him my house for some time, until either he is provided for or I return; for I do not want to stay in Bern at all. If he stays in Zurich for even just one or two months, everyone will judge and feel better about him; for your cohabitation and recommendation will gain him authority even among the harsher ones. In recent days, the theological lecture was assigned to our Eberhard, and he was thus freed from the dust; we could not act otherwise for many reasons. In the meantime, I will work and leave nothing undone that I think will be beneficial for Musculus. Perhaps after 2 months, I will come to Zurich myself. I will arrange with our people so that I can bring him with me with their advice and foreknowledge; in the meantime, he should stay here. He will write to his wife to come with the children. If the Bernese understand at the end of the half-year term that I will not stay, they will think more diligently about calling learned men at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>By Caspar Sigrist, he finds the key to the house; he will have one made himself, so that Caspar Sigerist keeps his own for the cellar and grain chamber. I have given him the large room by the parlor and the one on the wood house, as well as the long one on the summer arbor, so that he can manage well.</p>
      <p>If the Buchters had their wine out of the large cellar, I would gladly allow that it be given to him for his use. The rest will be reported by him and my brother; for now, I cannot say more; when I come, I will arrange everything more diligently myself.</p>
      <p>Now farewell. What you write about Apiarius, I will take care of most faithfully. May the Lord Jesus eternally protect you and your family. From the monastery in KÃ¶nigsfelden, September 10, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father, to be honored forever.</p>
