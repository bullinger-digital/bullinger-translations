      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>On September 16th, Johannes Brenz, Erhard Schnepf, Matthäus from Reutlingen with the deacon Schradin, Caspar Gräter, the bishop of Herrenberg, Wenceslaus from Urach, Doctor Paulus Phrygio, and our Ambrosius were called to Urach. They were to discuss amicably, in the presence of some who are advisors to the prince, whether images should be removed from the church or not. Schnepf continuously argued that not only could they be tolerated, but they were also useful in Christian churches, provided they were not displayed for worship. Ambrosius always thought otherwise, although he did not wish to cause any drama over this matter. Some learned men were also called. They debated the entire day, but could not reach an agreement. Finally, they were instructed to present their individual opinions in writing the next day and to respond simply, namely whether it was permissible for the prince to remove all statues and images from the churches entirely. This was done. After reviewing all the writings, the prince made a decision, which has not yet been announced. Some suspect it is in our favor. Brenz and Wenceslaus sided with Schnepf.</p>
      <p>I wanted you to know this; however, it should not be spread to everyone. Pray to the Lord with Pellican, Leo, and Theodor, my dearest brothers and lords, that these trifles may be set aside and attention be given to serious matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>September 24th, 1537.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my best and esteemed brother. Zurich.</p>
