      <p>S. The news about English affairs that you wrote to me, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, were very pleasing to me, for nothing is more delightful for me to hear than that in any way the kingdom of Christ our Savior is being promoted and his adversaries are being diminished. I have always considered the marriage between Charles of Austria and the Queen of England to be courtly fabrications, as they have been accustomed to play among themselves and with others, while under various pretenses they either deceive or attempt to achieve one thing by doing another. It often happens that while they intend to deceive others, they deceive themselves. I wish it were true, what you write about the Spaniard, that there are not insignificant signs of the most serious judgments of God, who, although we are undeserving and ungrateful, wishes to finally rescue us from the tyranny of the Antichrist against the will of the powers of darkness and to repay the harlot of Babylon justly. Here with us, almost everything is silent. In Friesland, some disturbances have arisen, and to suppress these, the Duke wanted to send the Duke of Alba with his army; however, they also have considerable forces, and William of Saxony is said to join them.</p>
      <p>From Mr. Gwalther, I learned that my tutor does not meet your approval. I thank you for sharing your candid advice; he has indeed been somewhat suspect to me, but I could not fully explore his mind in the short time he was with me; I have informed Mr. Gwalther of the plans I have regarding him. On the 26th of May, it was written to me from the city that the Papists in France are renewing the war, which will undoubtedly be very bloody. Condé has already recalled the dismissed German cavalry and hired them for 3 months.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your people.</p>
      <p>Given at Bocksberg, 28th of May, in the year 68.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten. To the reverend, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
