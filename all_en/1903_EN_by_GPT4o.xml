      <p>Greetings. I received your letters with great joy (as always) along with those to Mr. Baionensem, which I gave to Vincenz Magius to deliver to him, as these letters testify, which he returned to me to be forwarded to you. The same Vincenz is a pious man and recommended to us by the letters of the pious, originally from Brescia, once an envoy of the King of France. He says he acted as the envoy of the same king in Constantinople for seven years; he has now lived in Venice for some time, but was recently forced to flee from there due to the pressure of the inquisitors' wickedness. He came to us not wealthy; but after being recognized by Mr. Baionensem, his affairs are better. So that you may know him more closely (for he himself requests this), he says that some years ago he passed through there and was gifted by you with your book "On the Authority of Sacred Scripture," which you had written to the King of England. Today, a meeting is held here by our Three Confederations to give a response to the royal envoy, whether they are willing to permit soldiers to him; we hear that soldiers will be given to him, if indeed he wishes to accept them according to the terms of the confederation. Those coming from Italy bring no news. From Germany, I hear from a man of good faith that three bishops, the city of Nuremberg, Duke of Brunswick, and Duke Maurice have joined the French; it is also rumored that the emperor is dead. - But this more to our profession: which I have often thought to do but have not done timidly, wanting to avoid the suspicion of denunciation or emulation, now I am finally compelled to do: Our Comander, sufficiently attentive to his affairs, becomes colder by the day in teaching and in publicly reproving delinquents and is altogether gentle and remiss in exhorting; nevertheless, he is most pleasing to the senate. This week, our bishop held a wedding for his brother; he invited many citizens. Men and women entered his church, stood at the mass, and even offered, as is their custom; after the meal, both married and old women as well as unmarried and young ones danced, I say citizens. Comander himself was not at home, but in the bath. Therefore, I wish that you would write to both of us and equally encourage us both to vigilance and to act more strongly against such manifest impieties and turpitudes. If I advise anything more boldly or severely, I immediately hear: "We have a good and peace-loving father, who has taught us for thirty years" (they mean Comander) "he does not act or speak thus: you want to know more and be considered greater than he." I do not wish to write more; for you understand what these things mean. I often advise the good father to be who he was ten years ago, and being near death by age, to sing us the swan song. He replies: "I have done enough; let others do now, if they wish." Let these things be enough for you; consult together and come to the aid of the weary affairs. Farewell in the Lord Jesus and continue to love us perpetually. Ponticella and others greet you, etc.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 19th of June, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours in all humanity, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord, minister of the word of God.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
