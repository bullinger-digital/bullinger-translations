      <p>Greetings. My most excellent and dearest relative, Peter Sch√§r, wrote to me in his most loving letter not long ago, saying among other things: "Greet the dear Mr. Heinrich Bullinger for me; I would so gladly do him a service that would bring him joy; truly, I would not spare my body, for he is dear to my heart. I have arranged for a small cheese from a vintner at Stain by Master Jergen Wympfer for you, eat it on our behalf, and if you think it is not a jest, then write to him for another and send and gift it on my behalf to Mr. Bullinger." Indeed, my dear Bullinger, since I did not doubt that this gift would be pleasing to you, who would appreciate the spirit in which it was given, I arranged for two cheeses of that rich milk to be brought, which are also considered among the finest delicacies in Augsburg, so that my good Peter sells them there at a high price. I am now sending one of them to you through our driver; if it pleases your palate and stomach, I have no doubt that you will always have a supply of this pressed milk through the generosity of our Peter. Besides this, I have nothing else to write now, except that I am sending a letter written by Bufler to me about that girl, who, I do not know by what evil arts, has dazzled so many perceptive eyes with her marvelous tricks for so many years; I think, however, that her belly, stuffed in this way with the INTERIM patchwork, has swollen.</p>
      <p>Indeed, you could rightly say of both: "The mountains are in labor" etc. But what, I ask, are the swellings of that bloated monster other than a stuffing concocted from various patchworks, which shamelessly claims to be the offspring of God, something that the matter itself easily teaches, if someone wisely dissects this artificial belly with the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God; thus, indeed, this other monster of a virgin most aptly represents the type of that other one. If only our monarchs and all those who have been placed at the helm of the Christian republic would finally understand this, so that they do not allow themselves to be perpetually driven mad to the great ruin of the whole world. I wish our Gwalther would illustrate this matter for us more diligently with his most delightful muse.</p>
      <p>The siege of Magdeburg, if what is written from Nuremberg is true, was not yet lifted on the 8th of November; which I now have no doubt has been resolved by this harsh cold.</p>
      <p>May Jesus Christ, the most valiant defender of his own, soon avenge both them and us, all who trust in him, from both his and our enemies, and may he most abundantly extend the boundaries of his kingdom with the peace he grants. In this, my brother, my soul, fare well and eternally with your most holy family and all friends and brothers, whose most delightful sight and conversation I had indeed intended to enjoy for a few days after I returned from Biele; but the course of the journey did not allow it, since I traveled from Basel to Rheinfelden to my cousin, and from there to Pontus, and then directly here because I had to hurry for the sake of this servant. However, the Lord will grant that I may enjoy you more conveniently and happily for a longer time in the Lord.</p>
      <p>But behold, the cheese, which I thought had been brought, has not yet been sent by Mr. Wympfer; I will send it as soon as I receive it.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. 27th of November.</p>
      <p>Write to me, I beg you, about your assemblies, and if there is anything else, diligently. It is Bufler's agent who sent this German letter. The letter should have reached me long ago.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
