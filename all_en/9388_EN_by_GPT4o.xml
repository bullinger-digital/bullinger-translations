      <p>The summary is: The cases of the exiled are being reviewed, to whom safe conduct for coming and going has been granted; nothing is being done to harm the Archduke and the people of Como, and once again the wretched people of Sondrio are being subjected to the yoke. May all these things turn out well and without any greater evil! But what I should hope for, I do not know; for gold reigns, and on July 18th before lunch, it was decreed in the Senate of the Three Leagues that all preachers, under the penalty of losing their position, should close their mouths so as not to touch upon anything that pertains to the magistrates and civil matters, not even with the slightest finger. I do not accept the pretense and colors with which some wish to cover the intent of this law, as if that constitution only aims for both pastors and the depastors of the Rhaetian churches, under the aforementioned penalty, to strive for peace and to exhort the people to remain obedient to the magistrate, as if we had incited them, who are now to be restrained by public law. I fear that the Pagans have worked on something, to whom we are a thorn in the eyes; they would like to put a bridle on us and impose mute silence, so that the Antichrist may flourish again and nothing may be taken away from the accustomed corruptions.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the papists have become more arrogant with the arrival of the Pagans; for in recent days, the monks, through their envoys, have asked the lords against public laws to allow foreign monks, namely the preachers from Como and Milan, to be admitted in groups into the Valtellina during Lent, who, as has happened more than once, would incite the people to defection and confirm the papacy. Although this has been prohibited by frequent decisions by the Rhaetians until now, we are now growing and maturing in purer doctrine, if it pleases the gods, so that the superior opinion was better by only 5 votes. When the procurators of the monks noticed this, they again brought this impious petition to the Senate, which, having become more lenient, finally referred this matter to the communities, as if it needed new deliberation, which had been agitated and promulgated by so many decrees, decisions, and edicts many years ago and even two years ago, so that those foreign swarms and monstrosities of monks would not be received. These are the primary fruits that come from the zeal and work of those who adore the Pope of the Roman Church. Thus, we seek external peace with the tears of the Church of Christ.</p>
      <p>Truly, I cannot praise enough with worthy commendations the singular humanity of the most distinguished Mr. Treasurer towards me, who has deigned to visit and converse with me so many times.</p>
      <p>I could not observe anything in this great man that did not singularly reflect zeal for promoting the glory of God and public welfare.</p>
      <p>I humbly ask your reverence to thank him in my name as well, for having embraced me with such humanity.</p>
      <p>Because I, like others, fear that royal benefits may nurture some monstrosity and work some military endeavor, I touched upon this matter briefly once and only very obscurely mentioned the chained leaders, which some Helvetians, it seems, have drawn to their own chains. But no one will rise so early as to satisfy everyone. Perhaps I have offended some, whom, so help me God, I have never seen wearing chains. But if only they were so curious, etc.!</p>
      <p>Most swiftly. Chur, July 20, 1573.</p>
      <p>We saw a spear in the sky and bloody globes flying in the air, etc.</p>
