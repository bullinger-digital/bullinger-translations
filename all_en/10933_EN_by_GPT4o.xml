      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I do not know what the people of Konstanz are aiming for. This I know, that Zwick is entirely committed to restoring concord. In a letter dated August 28th, he writes to me: "I seem to understand Luther's mind well myself. If only all Lutherans and the entire Lutheran people understood him!" This is from Zwick. What Vadian has written about this matter, you will understand from the letter attached to this one. I am sending it to you to read, with the condition that you return it with the next messenger. I also hear that the brothers in Schaffhausen sincerely support concord. In the meantime, I will do my duty and encourage them to continue doing what they are doing.</p>
      <p>I wish to hear your judgment on Vadian's books.</p>
      <p>The dearest of mortals, Utinger, passed away to the Lord on September 6th after 2 PM with such faith as I have not found in any man of my age. Praise be to the Lord. He instructed me to bid you a final farewell. To the spectators, he seemed to fall asleep, not to die. They testified that they had never seen a similar end in their entire lives. Meanwhile, I am deprived of the best friends. I grieve more than I have ever grieved. But he has gone to the Lord.</p>
      <p>The excellent men you recommended to me and ours could not be diverted from our company even for an hour. Therefore, the fact that we did not show them any hospitality was not our fault, but theirs, who anticipated our duties.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>September 8, 1536.</p>
      <p>I think the castle at Cham still wants to remain standing. All a rogue's work (Schurkentat)! All (you know Utinger's word) should be hanged.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, Bishop of the Church of Basel, dearest brother.</p>
