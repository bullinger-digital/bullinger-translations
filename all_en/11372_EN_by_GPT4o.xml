    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not yet received any consolation, although he has complained about the hopeless discord within the Basel church and his wife has been suffering from the plague for fourteen days. In all distress, God is his only refuge; he is more desperate than during the [Second Kappel] War, because [Karlstadt] has devastated the church and no improvement is to be expected. Bullinger no longer needs to address him as "Bishop," since the church leadership now changes quarterly; ironically, he, who never sought his office, was accused of striving for sole rule. He asks to be comforted and for prayers for the sick [former] mayor Jakob Meyer.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The more disturbed I am, the less consolation I receive from you. I have complained about the greatest evil that can invade the church of God, namely the discord among brothers, and what is worse, the ambition of the restless, not to mention anything else, indeed what is even worse, no hope of concord. For such is the nature of the adversary, that unless he dominates, he does not rest. Meanwhile, the plague approaches, and it does not come generally, but invades my flesh most grievously; for my wife has been bedridden for fourteen whole days now, and I see no end, she suffers so cruelly. What do you think I endure amidst these things, with what emotions I am shaken, with what great pains I am anguished? I can truly say with David: "The sorrows of death have compassed me" etc.</p>
      <p>I am forced to see the church perishing, to hear insults against me, to endure the death or at least the long illness of my wife, to feel the defection of friends, to see the most Christian ones taken by the Lord, indeed to despair of the gospel. "And where," you ask, "do you find rest in the meantime?" Believe me, there is no rest except in the Lord; for even the friends who remain, when they visit me, make everything more disturbed. It cannot be otherwise; for he is not a good man who does not weep for the common state of the church and the republic whenever he looks at it, nor is there any other word to hear than: "It is over." "In the war against us," you respond, "we never despaired so." But I, together with pious men, despaired after this boar began to devastate the field of our church, and there can be no hope that he will be corrected, especially while he finds favor with those like him, that is, the papists, the Anabaptists, the poorly evangelicals, and those who under the title of faith indulge their own passions; for they together threaten tumult if anyone presumes to do anything against the doctor. Otherwise, he is more timid than a hare, as he said he acted in Zurich; do not say: "We found him a good man here."</p>
      <p>Hitherto you have written to me as "Bishop of Basel"; beware henceforth, for it has been arranged that the care of the church is carried out by the parish priests in turn, not by one alone, lest an opportunity be given for the return of the papacy, and lest Myconius sell himself as an ecclesiastical monarch, for which reason I was secretly accused before the senate - by whom, I do not know. You are forced to say, because you know me: diligent, indeed curious inquiry against a wretched man; a sign that they would have gladly harmed, indeed that they will harm if they find an opportunity. Myconius would seek monarchy, after he has learned throughout his life nothing but to be subject? Indeed, he is ashamed to have been placed by the Lord in this position, to which he never aspired and to which he never thought he could satisfy, even if he had strived greatly. May the Lord spare those who have devised such a crime against me; for it is clear before the eyes of the Lord that they judged me from their own proud and ambitious minds. Come, they have what they sought. I wish for peace of good mind from the Lord, nothing more. Do you think I need the consolation of friends, indeed and solace? Therefore, make me feel more frequently what I so greatly need. May the Lord preserve you with yours, and also the brothers, in perpetual tranquility.</p>
      <p>Our consul Jakob Meyer is bedridden; you will pray with your church to the Lord, that he may not deprive us of such a great good.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your household and all the brothers. This complaint is for you alone etc. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Church of Zurich, brother in the Lord to be respected.</p>
