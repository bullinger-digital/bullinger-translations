    <p xml:id="regest1">On September 18, Haller received Bullinger's letters from the 7th [No. 2571] and the 8th of September [not received]. What was promised in them has now come true! For today, as he wanted to write to Bullinger, the [Zurich] pastors [Lorenz] Meyer, [Rudolf] Schwyzer, and [Thoman] Ruman arrived in Augsburg. On the advice of the city clerk [Georg Frölich], Haller delivered the letter intended for the Augsburg Senate [from the Zurich Council] to the mayor [...]. [Wolfgang] Musculus was present with the mayor, who knew as little about the appointment [of the three Zurichers] as he did about Haller's call to Augsburg. Musculus, to whom the mayor now explained everything, did not seem very pleased about it but remained silent. The mayor asked him to welcome the newcomers and also to organize a meeting with the other pastor colleagues. He further said that he would present the letter to the council tomorrow. Only then will it be known where the new colleagues will be employed. Musculus then accompanied Haller to his residence and greeted the Zurichers warmly. Haller invited him, [Michael] Keller, [Bernardino] Ochino, and Georg Frölich for lunch tomorrow. Due to the impending war, the situation is very precarious, so the newcomers will initially help out in the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Haller refers Bullinger to the letter [No. 2594] from Georg Frölich, as he learns much more about the state of affairs than Haller does.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- However, Frölich could not yet have reported that on September 19 at four o'clock in the afternoon, Neuburg [on the Danube] surrendered to the imperial army without resistance due to a betrayal. The three banners of the [Schmalkaldic League] in the city were assured free withdrawal with their weapons. But once the imperial forces had control of the city, they took everything from the banners and released the mercenaries naked, except for the [three] captains, whom they held captive. They then rampaged in the city, killed some citizens, and violated the women, some of whom died. Then they invaded Ottheinrich's territory and also violated the women there. How long will God continue to watch this?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The sluggish "bellies" [of the Schmalkaldic League], who were barely three miles away, could have prevented this but did nothing! They claim that the emperor [Charles V] could neither be attacked nor defeated, and that they would let him act to lure him out better. However, Haller fears that this omission will have dire consequences. It would have been much better if they had attacked Bavaria! But they wanted to spare the "drunken prince" [William of Bavaria]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Now he is being punished by the emperor himself, for his land is being devastated, and its inhabitants are being plundered by the [Italians and Spaniards]. What the rulers devise, the common people must atone for! The foreign troops are [only] two days' march from Augsburg. The Augsburg authorities have [therefore] destroyed all the bridges over the Lech and made crossing the fords impossible. The population, some of whom are fleeing towards Augsburg with their cattle, can no longer cross the river. Some swim across. As a result, everything has become more expensive in Augsburg. Last night, relatives of Michael Keller arrived, fleeing from Bavaria and not knowing where their wives and children are. The people seek refuge in the numerous swamps. It serves Bavaria right to be punished by its allies, the Spaniards; if only the poor, innocent people were not involved!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Hopefully, the violators of women will soon fare like the Benjaminites!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The [Schmalkaldic] force is stationed at Donauwörth. It achieves nothing. With the "belly" of Saxony [Elector Johann Friedrich], nothing can be accomplished. Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] and [Sebastian] Schertlin, on the other hand, are very diligent. If they had listened to [Schertlin], they would have made more progress by now! When he advised occupying Ingolstadt (since this city had already surrendered) before moving on to Regensburg, they did not listen to him. The Saxon does not tolerate his advice.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The matter of Thomas Naogeorg also worries Haller. He already wrote about it [No. 2576]. The Augsburgers had called Naogeorg two years ago. At that time, the [Elector of Saxony] did not let him go. In the meantime, he was declared a heretic and enthusiast by the Wittenberg theologians. He therefore came to Augsburg, where he preached and pleased the people. The Augsburg council then asked the elector in writing to keep Naogeorg. After a long time, the answer came: He must be arrested because he does not believe that the body of Christ is truly present in the altar sacrament and that all baptized children receive the Holy Spirit! Undoubtedly, the elector wanted to oblige Naogeorg in writing not to teach or write anything against these foolishnesses in the future. The Augsburg council then waited [with its response] until Naogeorg was secretly accommodated in a village [Lauingen]. There, the Augsburgers now keep him hidden at their expense. His wife [Margaretha Hinzenhauser?] was informed by messenger [...] to sell the household goods and move to Augsburg. Bullinger should look for a position for Naogeorg, especially since it was his writings that brought Naogeorg to a different view! To avoid conflict with the elector, the Augsburgers cannot appoint him now; but after the war, they probably can.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- A French nobleman [Philippe de Fresnes], who was in Augsburg a few days ago and wanted to serve in the [Schmalkaldic] army, was killed on September 16 on his way there by some noblemen from Lorraine in an inn. Two of the perpetrators were captured. The body of the murdered man was buried in Augsburg on September 18.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- There is a rumor that the Zurich council opened and confiscated some barrels of poison. However, this is neither confirmed by Bullinger's letters nor by the three [arrived] Zurichers. They only report that the cargo passed through Zurich, but was not intercepted.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Haller received a duplicate print sheet of the Luke commentary. The following one with pages z2r. [to z5v.] is missing. Bullinger should send it to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- He sent a shipment intended for Heinrich Schöner with the leather [bag] through [the messenger Hans] Großmann. He had forgotten the accompanying letter to Schöner and encloses it here.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Since many new [Swiss] mercenaries have joined, Augsburg established a new banner, led by Jakob Reinhart as captain, and Bullinger's cousin Michael Hedinger was included. He has just been sent from the Klause [Ehrenberg] to Augsburg with a mission.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- He reports the following: The Klause is occupied by the Tyroleans. In front of it are 13 banners with Swiss and several more with Landsknechts, who together prevent the breakout from the Klause. The Swiss mercenaries are disciplined and brave, but their captains are useless because they are inexperienced. They are therefore mocked by the [Schmalkaldic League]. They all want to become rich, making at least 1000 guilders profit per month, and they torment their mercenaries. After the princes, they only care for themselves.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg is now also with the [Schmalkaldic] force.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- [Rudolf] Gwalther has sent his book "The Antichrist" and has already written twice [to Haller]. Bullinger should convey Haller's thanks to him. Haller will also write to him soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Haller will try to fulfill Bullinger's wish to place Lorenz [Meyer] in Augsburg. If this is not possible, Haller will support a position for him in Kaufbeuren. He fears that Meyer might not be sufficiently distinguished and too direct for the educated citizens of Augsburg. But first, one must wait to see what is decided in this regard.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. On the 18th of this month, I received two letters from you, one dated September 7th and the other September 8th, in which what you promised has been fulfilled today. For today, as I was just about to write to you, our beloved brothers Agricola, Svittzerus, and Romanus arrived, whose presence greatly delighted me. The letters they had for the senate, since they were too tired from walking, they handed over to me to present to the consul; this was done with the advice of the city clerk. When I went to the consul, by chance I found Mr. Musculus with him, who was still unaware of this appointment (as he was of mine) and the consul explained the whole matter in my presence, greatly praising the diligence and benevolence of the city of Zurich. Musculus, who seemed not very pleased with the matter, was nevertheless compelled to remain silent in my presence and agree with the consul's commendation. The consul then arranged for other ministers to meet with them and to have a friendly conversation with the brothers. For tomorrow, he said, he would present the letters to the senate, from which we should expect a response on what more should be done with them. So Mr. Musculus went with me from the consul to my house, where they were waiting, and he received them kindly. I invited him, Cellarius, Bernardinus, and the city clerk to lunch tomorrow. We will talk more then. I still do not know what will happen with them. While the war is still imminent and it is certainly still uncertain, although we hope to soon see a different face of it, they will be kept in the city to work with us until God puts an end to these evils.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>For the matter, as the city clerk told me, he has written to you in detail, being aware of their plans, which rarely reach me in secret. Therefore, I refer you to him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I want to add this one thing, which he might not have in his letters, because he wrote two days ago, namely that on September 19th at four in the afternoon, the emperor's army (though not all, but the greater part) entered the town of Neuburg, opened to them by the citizens and through some betrayal, without any resistance. Three banners or cohorts of our people were in the town, to whom they promised free departure with all their belongings. However, having gained the upper hand, they plundered everything and released the captains naked, though they were captured. Then, rampaging miserably among the citizens, they killed a few, but, acting far more cruelly with them, they continuously violated matrons and virgins (forgive the shameful statement, about which no one can speak decently), so that some were found dead. They did the same later, breaking into the territory of Otto Heinrich: stripping virgins and rustic women, they took as many as they pleased with them for vile deeds. O God, how long will you endure and watch this?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Meanwhile, our bellies (not to say anything harsher) were barely three miles away and could have prevented all this, but nothing was done! I fear that this delay will bring us great harm and that we will pay the penalty for these disgraces, which we did not prevent. They pretext this reason: The emperor is in such an advantage that he can neither be attacked nor won over. Therefore, to make him fearless and lure him out, they let him do this, so that they can bring him out of the nest. Then they will give him the reward. This plan does not seem to me to come from the divine spirit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Should we help ourselves with this disgrace, God have mercy! They could have starved him out in his hole if they had wanted to attack Bavaria.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>But the drunken prince is dear to us. Now the emperor himself gives him the reward, for he has devastated all his land, and the poor people are robbed by the Italians just as well as women and children, as if they were our religious relatives. Thus, whatever the kings devise, the Greeks suffer. The Italians are roaming in Bavaria up to two miles from Augsburg. My lords have thrown down all the bridges on the Lech, so that Bavaria is enclosed, and all the fords are blocked. The poor people are fleeing to Bavaria, driving their cattle, wanting to go to Augsburg, but they cannot cross the water. Many swim across. You would see a wonderful misery! So everything is rising in price, as nothing more comes from Bavaria: wood, salt, other goods, etc. They will also pay dearly for it. Last night, some of Cellarius' relatives, fugitives from Bavaria, came here, uncertain where their wives or children are. The people are fleeing into the swamps, of which Bavaria is full. In short: Bavaria will be punished, even by its friends, the Spaniards! It would be right if the poor innocent people were not involved! May God have mercy on them and on all of us. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I hope that the violators of women will fare like the Benjaminites, although we must also take something beforehand like Israel.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Our force is stationed at Donauwörth. Believe that they are looking out, for I hear nothing from them. The belly of Saxony has the ride; nothing can be done before him. The landgrave is busy, likewise Schertlin beyond measure. If they had followed him, we would already be at peace. For his advice is not to move to Regensburg and leave Ingolstadt unoccupied, which has already surrendered. Then the matter would already be helped. But what he advises, the Saxon cannot tolerate. We will cry out to the Lord, otherwise I do not think we will have much luck.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>For another argument persuades me of this and makes me (not so much disturbed as concerned about the whole outcome of the war), namely the matter of the most learned and pious man, Mr. Thomas Naogeorg, about which I recently wrote to you. He was called by our people two years ago, but could not obtain permission from the elector under whom he served. Meanwhile, he was greatly harassed by those Wittenberg theologians and proclaimed a heretic and enthusiast. Now, therefore, with the prince absent, he has come to us, hoping to be freed from this millstone. When he came to Augsburg, he preached. He pleased the people. The senate wrote to the elector asking him to grant him to them. After a long wait, the response finally came: Because he does not believe that the true body of the Lord is in the sacrament of the altar, and that not all baptized infants receive the Holy Spirit, he is to be thrown into chains. No doubt they wanted to extort from him a written statement and oath not to teach or write against their nonsense. The senate deliberately delayed until he could leave. For they did not want to stir up greater troubles in these turmoils. So we secretly dismissed him, and at our expense, we keep him in a place near us, where he is quite safe. Meanwhile, we sent a messenger to his wife to quickly sell all their goods and leave the elector's territory and finally come here. Meanwhile, I want to ask you, venerable father, to look out for some position for him in the upper parts. He is sincere, learned, pious. And indeed it is your duty to do this; for he freely admits that he was converted by your writings, who previously even considered heretics those who thought otherwise. At this time, he will hardly be received by our people, lest they incur the elector's offense. If the turmoil were over, I think he would be called back.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>A few days ago, a certain nobleman from France came here to join and serve the army. He was observed by some Lotharingian counts and nobles as he left the city two miles away and was surrounded and killed in an inn. Two of them were captured by the army. His body was brought here and buried with honor. It happened on September 16th, and he was buried on the 18th.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Furthermore, a constant rumor has reached us that several barrels full of poison have arrived in Zurich and were opened and preserved by the magistrate. However, your letters say nothing about this, nor do the three brothers say anything about it, except that it passed through Zurich, but was not intercepted.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I am sending you here a sheet from Luke, which you sent me. It is too much. On the other hand, I have one too few, namely the next one, which belongs to it: z2. It begins with: "namely," and ends at the 8th book of commentaries. Please send it to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>I also recently sent you a bundle in the leather with the Großmann. It belongs to Heinrich Schöner. And the letter that belongs to it, I forgot in haste. I am also sending it herewith, so that it reaches him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Michael Hedinger, your cousin, was accepted by us. However, since so many honorable Swiss have fled there, who have not yet been given any service, my lords have obtained from the superiors that another Swiss banner has been established. Jacob Reinhart, a Zurich captain, is in charge of it. Michael is now with him. He is doing well. He has just returned from the Klause to accomplish something. He sends you all his best regards.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>At the Klause, he tells me, it stands as follows: The Tyroleans have it. But there are 13 Swiss banners and some Landsknechts lying in front of the hole, so they cannot get out. The leaders of the Swiss are worthless. None of them have ever been a captain. Our people mock them: They can and know nothing. This makes them despised by the warriors. The common man is willing, behaves well, and has great praise from everyone for his discipline and friendliness. But it lacks leaders. They all want to become rich, miserably exploiting the soldiers. Now they are given splendid provisions, but they think that if they do not make 1000 guilders a month, it is nothing. Meanwhile, they neglect what is necessary for war. They take care of themselves after the princes; therefore, they are spoken of badly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg is now also with our force. Dr. Gwalther sent me his Antichrist and has already written twice. I thank him. I have never known the Antichrist so well as from this little book!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>I will write to him as soon as I can because of business. You would like us to keep Mr. Laurentius in the city, in which I will make an effort, if he does not stay here, that he at least comes to Kaufbeuren. This is the only thing I desire in him, that I do not think he suits our city: namely his unrefined manners and rashness. For among us, the people are excessively fond of civility. Hence, I fear that his authority will be small. But we will see how this matter is handled.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell with your family and brothers and the whole church. These things hastily. I will give more soon. Augsburg, September 22nd, with night already approaching 11.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Hallerus.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger, his venerable father. Zurich.</p>
