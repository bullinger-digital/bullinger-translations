      <p>Greetings. What is happening with me here and what has happened, I believe you have understood from my brother's letters. I have many things that would be worth telling you; but it is not safe to commit such things to letters. You, although absent, have borne part of this tragedy with me.</p>
      <p>Wingartner is still furious; Negelin, as soon as he heard my apology, became more mild; for my conversation was not about the legates themselves, but about the matter itself. Today I encountered him and from his words, I recognized him as quite favorable. Some advise me to approach Wingartner, others dissuade me. I would gladly do this for Christian charity, if it would not bring any harm to the goodness of the cause; for I fear that the pious might attribute this to me as servile submission, while the impious might boast as if I had yielded my opinion. Therefore, I am still in doubt.</p>
      <p>The day after tomorrow, he will leave here for Baden to the assembly. Joining him is Mr. Wolfgang von Erlach, a most modest and pious man, who without a doubt, if life permits, will eventually reach the consulship. I wish that your legate would embrace him; for he is peaceful and well-disposed towards the common cause. I suspect the other, due to his intemperance, will in a remarkable way slander me to your legates in Baden. Therefore, I wish that they, whoever they are, would be warned and instructed about this matter beforehand. But perhaps, as he is disposed towards the people of Zürich, he will not deem them worthy of such an address; I wish for him to be given a sound mind by the Lord.</p>
      <p>I hope you have already received the defense of the Sacramentarian Consensus. We always have something to deal with our French; they almost kill me with their tedious actions. We have nothing new, except that our people and those of Freiburg are occupied with purchasing in the county of Gruyère. The people of Saanen, as I hear, refuse to accept the gospel, conspiring somewhat with the people of Lucerne and Unterwalden; but I do not know how they will benefit from it. Would that we were as concerned with promoting the kingdom of God as we are with expanding the external borders of the empire! Farewell.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, especially Musculus and Schlatter; my wife also sends her many greetings to you and yours; Mr. Haller and Nikolaus von Diesbach also greet you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 16, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his honorable lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
