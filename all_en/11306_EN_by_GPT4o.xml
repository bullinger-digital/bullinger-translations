      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>When I recently wrote a letter to you, most kind patron, through that public courier, and sealed it, and he was already preparing to depart, Mrs. Myconius asked me to instruct you through this message to give half a gulden from my money to Rudolf Grob, the coachman, for her sake, as he is her relative; I will then account for this. If you have taken care of this as I instructed Appenzeller, it is well; but if you awaited further confirmation from me, I ask you to expedite it now.</p>
      <p>I personally met with Adam Frey, who says he can never express enough gratitude for the book. He certainly exercises remarkable piety and uses incredible patience. May God grant that he is freed from this illness.</p>
      <p>I ask you again, dearest teacher, to send me a gulden from the money you have, so that I can purchase summer clothes and other things; it is incredible how much Strasbourg has drained me. From the last money sent to me, I had to send six guldens and six batz to Bedrot; for I owed him nine guldens in Strasbourg currency for board, having already given him five. Additionally, I spent a gulden there on wood, gave a gulden to Herlin for Ptolemy's lecture, half a gulden for heating and a room; the remaining two I spent on some booklets and travel expenses. And indeed, Strasbourg has left me quite behind. Therefore, most kind patron, I ask you, if it can be done in any way, to add some increase to my stipend, so that I can more easily devote myself to my studies. I certainly testify to those with whom I live that I do not incur any unnecessary expenses; but you have understood well enough how I have now reached this state of need. I have nothing more to write. I ask you to consider this favorably and kindly and to hold me in your highest regard.</p>
      <p>Johannes Reyfenstein, who loves me dearly, and our Otto send you many greetings. Please also convey my greetings to your wife and mother, most honorable women, along with all your children. Farewell, most esteemed patron.</p>
      <p>Basel, from the house of Mr. Myconius, May 3, 1539. Yours most respectfully,</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the truly learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
