    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the letter and for Bullinger's booklet on marriage. Delighted about Zwingli's book, whom he greatly admires; however, he is missing - as noted on the attached note by bookbinder Hans Fritz - two sections, which Bullinger should send to Johannes Zwick in Constance. He knows nothing about the Schmalkalden meeting, as [City Clerk Maurer] has not yet returned; he has given his opinion on behalf of the church. The good relations between Emperor [Charles V] and King [Francis I] are said to be disturbed, while [Henry VIII] is seeking the Emperor's friendship and wants to offer him his daughter [Mary Tudor] as a wife; in Schmalkalden, it was decided to send a delegation to England. The Bishop of Augsburg [Christoph von Stadion] is advocating moderation towards the Protestants during the visitation of his diocese. The Old Believers disapprove of the Emperor's negotiations with the Protestants; he sees through their dishonesty. [Martin] Frecht is still in Schmalkalden. Friedrich [Wagner] wishes Bullinger all the best. Ulrich Wolfhart, an admirer of Zwingli, and also Schuler's wife send their regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter on April 16th, which was as rare as a phoenix, yet most welcome, along with the booklet you recently wrote on the state of marriage, which is as learned as it is extremely necessary in our age. May the Lord assist your remaining efforts with His spirit, so that the glory of His name may be spread as far as possible and you may benefit the churches and me for a long time.</p>
      <p>I indeed received the book of the blessed memory of Zwingli and do not doubt that you gave it willingly, as you recognized that you would greatly gratify me in this; for the memory of the once great hero Zwingli is still fresh with me, and I never mention him without weight among good men, and while I read his writings, it is as if he were speaking to me in person. But although the book pleases me, I am troubled by the defect it has, namely the second and third sections in the first alphabet, beginning "Si eccle-" and ending "num," as the bookbinder Hans Fritz noted here on a slip of paper with us; he wrote to Froschauer around the time of the Frankfurt fair about the first section, but Froschauer only sent the first sheet; the other two are still missing for me. It is my request that you see to it that Froschauer sends me the missing parts, so that I can bind it, enjoy it, and use it with pleasure; just send it to Johannes Zwick in Constance, etc.</p>
      <p>The Schmalkalden assembly, as I write this, is not yet finished, nor has our envoy returned, so I cannot write anything certain to you. I have given my response in writing on behalf of the church entrusted to me; perhaps you have it from Zwick; if not, I will not hesitate to send it to you, my most beloved friend.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor among us that the French king is not getting along very well with the emperor; the alliance is off. The King of England is seeking the friendship of Charles and intends to offer him his daughter. Our people from the Schmalkalden assembly have sent a delegation to the King of England; I do not yet know the reason for the mission.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Augsburg, Christoph von Stadion, is visiting his diocese; he orders his priests to serve more sparingly and to speak more modestly about us Lutherans.</p>
      <p>Our papists are frowning, sometimes striking the emperor with anathema, as he makes agreements and forms alliances with us contrary to their wishes; the insane papists are plotting extreme measures. The emperor somewhat perceives their deceptions, and they blame his delay in taking revenge against us. May the Lord grant that the Church of Christ is finally restored to its pious growth.</p>
      <p>Martin Frecht is in Schmalkalden, not yet returned. My Friedrich wishes you all good things, that is, Christ Himself.</p>
      <p>First and foremost, the doctor of our city, a pious and learned man, Ulrich Wolfhart, greets you, who uniquely honors and venerates you as the successor of the most holy man Zwingli, although unknown by face. My entire family is well. My wife also wishes you well in the Lord. Greet Leo, Pellican, etc., especially your wife and her parent. Farewell in the Lord, my brother.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, April 18th, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your old true friend, benefactor, and brother Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, my dearest lord and brother.</p>
