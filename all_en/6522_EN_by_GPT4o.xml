      <p>Greetings. I have received everything you sent and I give you my utmost thanks.</p>
      <p>I am not sending back yet, as I have not yet communicated with everyone I wanted to; therefore, I will send it back with the next messenger.</p>
      <p>It truly pains me that you are not feeling better, and as far as I understand, it is due to the kidney stones, a torment I too suffer from too frequently. However, I hope you will feel better soon and I pray to the Lord for this to happen.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I have not encountered Mr. Diesbach since he returned.</p>
      <p>However, Telamonius has told me everything that happened there.</p>
      <p>As for your students, I have written to my brother about how they are behaving here. The situation is not so bad; however, they might make it worse with what they think will make it better; namely, they are overconfident because they are from Zurich, and thus they are being disrespectful to my lord and others.</p>
      <p>HÃ¶ngger has publicly confessed; he has been punished like anyone else who would do such a thing, if he were the victor. And when the others were sent for and questioned about it, they used some falsehoods, which they were caught in; this has caused them to be held in contempt; otherwise, people would have been satisfied with them. I also could not detect from others that they had to pay for the name of Tigurini.</p>
      <p>Dr. Valentinus did not like them, yet he nonetheless did his best with them because they are from Zurich.</p>
      <p>But I plead for them; they are otherwise decent and quiet and very diligent in the sermons. I have nothing new now that you do not already have.</p>
      <p>Death is breaking out quite strongly again. Our Nivinus is lying ill along with 6 children; Weberus is silenced; Mauritius cannot, and all the burden lies on us remaining, so there is no rest. Therefore, have patience now; I will write more soon.</p>
      <p>May God bless you and yours and protect you from all evil. Amen. Bern, August 24, 1565.</p>
      <p>May the sons, sons-in-law, friends, and all brothers be well. Yours always, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
