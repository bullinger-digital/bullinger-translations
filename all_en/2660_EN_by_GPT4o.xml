      <p>S. Regarding our brothers, they themselves will explain what they have achieved. The council was very favorable, and whatever they requested was granted to them. At the same time, the matter of the collection was finally completed on this occasion. It is being sent by courier; the sum is quite large. May the Lord bless them so that they may be refreshed by this grace.</p>
      <p>As far as the Swiss Confederation is concerned, I have felt nothing but good with some difficulty; one will not swear lightly, rather not at all. The method you wrote about also pleased my lords the best; they initially brought it forward, and their opinion is still to raise it, for they know how the cantons oppose it. The second method, which my lords proposed afterwards, you also know well. The third, which the cantons brought forward, will not go, God willing. However, there will be special negotiations in Baden with yours, in good hope that it will not cause a rift or separation between us. Tomorrow the decision will be read and the matter discussed. Where it will lead, I do not know, but I hope for the best.</p>
      <p>Geneva is still wounded. What is really happening, I do not know for sure. Our council has met several times at unusual hours these days for their sake. The disputes among the ministers are now silent; however, I do not know how long this will last. I fear that I may have to go to them again; for those bitter disputes tire me so much that I would rather do anything than be involved with them.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new from France or Germany. I congratulate my brother on his success, and I commend him to you; he is young and not equal to managing these affairs, and although I do not begrudge him his success, I would have thought that this province should have been entrusted to someone deserving and older. However, may the Lord's will be done. I would ask that he not be completely withdrawn from the ministry and dedicated only to secular affairs.</p>
      <p>There is nothing else to write. We are all well and wish you well too. We are recalling Johann Hofli, another of our students, and in his place, we are sending Peter Chiorum, a young man of the most fortunate talent, whom I commend to you greatly. Mine and yours send you many greetings; may they be safe in the name of all of us. Bern, June 19, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his honorable lord and compatriot.</p>
