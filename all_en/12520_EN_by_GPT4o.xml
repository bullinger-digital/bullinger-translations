    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller has not received Bullinger's letter from June 19. Since the public messenger [...], who delivered the letter, must depart again in two hours, Haller can only respond briefly, without repeating the information conveyed in his last two letters [No. 2462 and No. 2467].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- As already reported, the wealthy [of the city] are afraid. The people are outraged by [their] flight. The imperial ambassador [Lazarus Schwendi] was received by the Augsburg council on June 22, complained about the ongoing war preparations in Augsburg, and urged the people of Augsburg to remain calm and trust the Emperor [Charles V]. However, the council sees through the Emperor's ruse. Outside the city, auxiliary troops are being prepared in camps. The people and several preachers are in good spirits.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Haller thanks Bullinger for his encouragement. He intends to behave bravely like a Christian and a Swiss, even if he must die.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Why does Bullinger report nothing about the Confederates, especially since Haller knows that the [people of Augsburg] have asked them for help? The Emperor would certainly abandon his attack plan if he learned that the Swiss were offering their assistance. Bullinger should therefore encourage them, for they too face the end.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings from Bernardino [Ochino], [Wolfgang] Musculus, [Michael] Keller, and [Johann Heinrich] Held [von Tiefenau]. Greetings to the father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli], who should not worry too much, for God will take care of Haller's family.</p>

      <p>Health and life through the Lord Jesus, etc. Your letter dated the 19th of this month was delivered to me today by this public messenger, who says he will depart again in two hours. Therefore, I wanted to respond briefly to yours. There is no need to repeat all those things which I have already written to you more extensively in two letters within a few days, both of which I hope you have received in the meantime.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As I wrote in those letters, the situation remains the same. There is great fear among the wealthy. The common people are most impatient with their flight, so much so that I fear nothing more at present than the attack of the populace. On June 22, the Emperor had an envoy before our council, who complained greatly in the name of the imperial majesty, asking what the military preparations of the cities mean, since they have not yet felt any harshness from him; he therefore asks them to desist and be at peace. For he intends to bring some disobedient princes of the empire back to obedience. He wishes well to the cities entirely. Moreover, he does not wish to harm anyone because of religion. With these and similar deceits, he wanted to appease our people, but our council, which senses what lies beneath, continues to fortify the city with soldiers. Camps are being prepared outside the city for auxiliary troops. The common people are entirely strong, as are most of the preachers.</p>

      <p>However, I thank you greatly, my father, for that most learned exhortation. I will show myself to be a Christian man, a Swiss, and, as much as I can, I will present myself as an example of courage and bravery to all. I will fight unceasingly by invoking the name of the Lord, who is the tower of our strength, and I hope that those who try to lift this burden stone will be confounded and torn apart, whose iniquity will perhaps finally be fulfilled. But if something must be suffered for the name of the Lord, blessed be the name of the Lord. For if we have received good things from the hand of the Lord so far, why should we not endure evil things? I am the Lord's, whether I live or die. He is my life, and to die is gain. Therefore, these troubles do not move me at all. May the Lord preserve this spirit in me! I know that we should expect nothing but afflictions in the world; yet I rejoice and exult in Him who has overcome the world, knowing that our reward will be abundant in heaven. But help us, together with the other brothers, by praying to God, that He may not hand over His inheritance into the hands of these most impious idolaters, lest they say: 'Where is their God?', but that He may show that He alone is God and that there is no other besides Him.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I am surprised that you have written nothing about the Swiss. For I know that our people are imploring their help humbly. I truly believe that the Emperor would change his plan if he heard that they would help us. Therefore, encourage them not to fail those whose destruction would also ruin them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell, and commend me with all the pious to the Lord through your prayers. Bernardino, Musculus, Cellarius, and Heldius, who are about to dine with me, greet you. In turn, greet all the brothers and my father-in-law, whom you should encourage not to be too anxious for us, since He who is the best and greatest is concerned for us. June 25, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger, the most faithful teacher of the church in Zurich, his esteemed lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
