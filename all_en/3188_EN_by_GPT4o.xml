      <p>Greetings. You know, dearest brother, the zeal of our brother Mr. a Lasco, and that he desires the matter of religion to be handled more purely in Poland than it has been so far by the Lutherans. But our Vergerius does not approve of that method in all respects, preferring that the confession of the Waldensians should prevail at the beginning, until it is possible to obtain better things. I suspect the same envoy is to be sent back to Poland in the name of the Protestant princes, to unite the minds of the Polish princes with those of the Germans. Therefore, you will encourage Vergerius, whom I prefer as an envoy over others, so that he does not hinder any good work or assist in a way that allows the otherwise crude Lutheranism to prevail even in Poland. For if Lutheranism prevails, it will be the end of sincere religion. For that leading champion of the Lutherans, Erasmus Alberus, now even in a book published against you and us, defends the use of images in the temple and other absurdities. Therefore, act wisely with our Vergerius, and respond to those last very extensive and troublesome letters of mine, I pray, promptly.</p>
      <p>Farewell and let us pray to the Lord to deliver us from evil. Zurich, 20th of May, 1557. In great haste.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
