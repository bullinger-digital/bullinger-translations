<letter xml:id="file12515"><summary><p xml:id="regest1">Blarer writes in haste. He has entrusted Bullinger's letter [No. 2464] for [Georg Fr√∂lich] to the Augsburg messenger [...].</p><p xml:id="regest2">- The servants of the Bishop of Konstanz [Johann von Weeze] boast that he has allegedly been treated by the [Five] Cantons like Emperor [Charles V.]. He is said to have confirmed over 18,000 people. It is also said that he spent 14 days in Zurich and was hosted there in the best manner and free of charge, which is very surprising.</p><p xml:id="regest3">- The councils of Konstanz and Augsburg will have informed the people of Zurich about the events and also about the Emperor's recruitment of troops (which he allegedly intends to use elsewhere). The situation calls for caution.</p><p xml:id="regest4">- Blarer is surprised that the messengers from Konstanz are reluctant to take letters [from Zurich], as they always show themselves willing to him; he also always gives them a tip. Did Bullinger refer to the city messenger [...] or to the butchers, whom Blarer also always pays?</p><p xml:id="regest5">- May Bullinger's commentary on Luke be as successful as his previous [Bible commentaries]!</p><p xml:id="regest6">- Count Palatine [Friedrich] wants to appoint [Martin] Frecht from Ulm for the reform of the University of Heidelberg. Therefore, Frecht would like to win [Johannes] Marbach [as a successor], but the people of Ravensburg also want him and have already written to Strasbourg about it.</p><p xml:id="regest7">- [P.S.:] Bullinger will surely be informed about the band of robbers [at Lake Constance], which also includes Confederates.</p><p xml:id="regest8">- Blarer is surprised that [Konrad] Hofherr has not written for so long. He should be urged by Bullinger to write to his [patron], the Augsburg mayor Jakob Herbrot, who is very annoyed about his ingratitude.</p></summary><body><div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1"><p>Grace and peace through Christ, etc. Dear sir and brother, in utmost haste: I have entrusted your letter to the messenger from Augsburg to deliver it to the city clerk. I hope he will do it.</p></div><div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2"><p>The servants of our bishop have boasted a lot about how highly and gloriously he was treated in the places, as if he were none other than the Emperor himself, and everything was free of charge. He is said to have confirmed over eighteen thousand people. It is also rumored here that he spent 14 days in Zurich and was hosted in the best manner, and finally released from the inn, which is very surprising to us.</p></div><div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3"><p>Regarding the events and how many soldiers the Emperor is recruiting everywhere, your lords will be informed by ours, as well as by those from Augsburg. However, some of my lords are quite confident that the Emperor intends to use all these preparations and soldiers elsewhere. But still, the situation is not to be trusted and must be watched carefully. We know that we are well accused of evil, and likewise that our enemies have enough heart and will to destroy us. May God direct it with grace and discipline us for His honor.</p></div><div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4"><p>That our messengers are unwilling to take letters surprises me greatly, as they behave quite differently. I always give them a tip and think they are well satisfied. I ask you to inform me in confidence who has shown themselves unwilling, whether it is the city messenger or the butchers, whom I also always pay.</p></div><div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5"><p>May the Lord bless your efforts in Luke with His spirit, so that you fulfill all the numbers of an excellent commentator here as successfully as you did before in others. The Count Palatine desires to appoint Frecht to Ulm to reform the school in Heidelberg. And Frecht would like Doctor Hans Marbach to come to Ulm, but the people of Ravensburg have also earnestly requested him and have written to Strasbourg about it.</p></div><div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6"><p>Given in great haste, evening of June 21. A. B.</p></div><div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7"><p>Regarding the new arsonist (robber), among whom are some Confederates, you will have good knowledge.</p></div><div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8"><p>I am very surprised that Curio has so persistently ceased and does not write anything to us. Tell him to write a letter as soon as possible to the Augsburg consul Jakob Herbrot, who is very annoyed by the man's ingratitude, as he never writes anything nor gives thanks for the benefits bestowed upon him.</p><p>To the highly learned Christian lord Heinrich Bullinger, my especially trusted, much-loved lord and brother in Zurich, etc.</p></div></body> This translation preserves the original XML structure and provides an English translation of the text, including the proper nouns translated into their modern German equivalents where applicable.</letter>
