      <p>Greetings. Why, I ask, my most esteemed Vergerius, do you send me that most absurd catalog of heretics? What pleasure or benefit do I derive from it? Indeed, why do you burden me with harm? For I waste precious time, which is lost to me while I read those rotten things. I have long since begun to feel a great distaste for those hoarse little pamphlets. Perhaps you subtly reproach me, thinking me unworthy to be listed in such a holy register of good men; indeed, I regret being excluded from that happiness. For why should I not call it happiness to be condemned by such a monstrous man, when otherwise the Lord has said in the Gospel: "Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me." "Because of me," I say, says the Lord. For who would doubt that he is insane, who wishes to be counted among the heretics condemned by Holy Scripture?</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I am well aware that I have not deserved so well of the recent Roman Church and its champions, that I should have been omitted by that centaur; I believe, however, that this was done by divine providence, so that I might speak with less suspicion of evil intent and desire for revenge, which you undoubtedly wanted me to say with that index you sent.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I have seen many mad and truculent people in this kind of argument, but none more insane, foolish, or cruel than this Polyphemus. For what he says, whom he names, against whom he rages, and whom he slanders, he knows as little as a brute beast knows the very reasons for which he condemns them. You would swear, if you weighed everything more precisely, that that Homeric Thersites had come forward for the sake of reviling and was quite successfully playing that role. For why does that Coroebus slander his most holy cardinal and his not uncommon friends? Why does he count Pope Pius II among the heretics? Does he not know that he is the author of the book on the acts of the Council of Basel? Certainly, he too is pierced by the spear of heresy. Even if he was not a pontiff when he wrote that book, does that sharp censor think that the material from which a pontiff is made can be sinful, so to speak, or profane? However, whatever business that Roman god of dung has, what, I ask, did Cardinal Friedrich Fregoso intend, whose name is also placed among the heretics by this man? What did the faithful supporter and defender of the Roman See, Ortwinus Gratius, do wrong, that he deserved to be numbered among the heretics for the bundle of things to be sought and avoided, which he compiled? Johannes Bozemius, a canon of Constance, preferred to leave this city, change his soil, and die as if in exile rather than remain in his residence, as they call it, and meanwhile obey the legitimate magistrate and listen to the preachers of the Gospel of Christ; now he receives this reward from that Rhadamanthus, to be buried among the implacable enemies of the Roman See.</p>
      <p>But this injury inflicted on private individuals will seem light if you consider what that scorpion dared against the very legate of Pope Adrian VI, and even against the Pope himself and the holy senate of cardinals, and against the anointed of the Lord, the most serene King Ferdinand, then the representative of the emperor, and against so many great Catholic princes of Germany. For he openly places in his index of heretics and heresies the legation of the papal orator at the Diet of Nuremberg, and soon also the hundred grievances of Germany. Moreover, the pope had entrusted his faithful legate, Francesco Cheregato, with an apostolic brief to be presented to the princes, and had given him written instructions on what to do with the princes. All these things are still circulated in print under the name and title of the legation; which this man strikes with anathema, thereby excommunicating the very See itself in its entirety. You know, my Vergerius, what I am thinking here. It is exactly what we read in the Gospel that the Lord said: "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?" Moreover, those hundred grievances of Germany were presented by the princes to the legate to be submitted to the pope; for the title of that work is: "The grievances of the princes and nobles of the Holy Roman Empire, which they presented against the Roman See and the entire ecclesiastical order to the orator of papal holiness at the Diet of the German princes at Nuremberg in the year 1522, begun and finished in 1523," and soon after the report by the orator of papal holiness at the aforementioned Diet before the representative of the imperial majesty (who was the most serene King Ferdinand) and the electors and other princes and states of the empire gathered there, and after the apostolic brief of the same Roman pontiff was brought into consultation and a response was consulted and concluded and given in writing to the same orator and papal legate in the name of the entire Roman Empire, and mention was made not infrequently of the grievances and burdens of the Roman Empire's nobles, who were oppressed more unjustly than is right by the clergy of the Roman Church, it pleased the princes and other orders of the empire to repeat and recount these very grievances, which they had promised to bring forward against the leaders of the Roman Church, a little more deeply and in detail by classes and as much as possible in order, and to give them thus described more fully to the Roman legate to be carried with him across the Alps, and what follows. Therefore, the matter now speaks openly, whom he condemned with that index of his for the crime of heresy. What else can I add to this than that through this slanderous man and others of his kind, what St. Peter, not a patron but a most bitter enemy of the Roman clergy, predicted would be fulfilled, saying: "There were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them, bringing swift destruction on themselves. Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping, especially against those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings; yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from the Lord. But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like animals they too will perish. They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done." The most holy apostle of Christ said these things so aptly and effectively in his place and time that he seems to defend our cause against that blasphemous mouth. We refer to this, that that unjust censor with amazing impudence spits on the conversations held at Regensburg and Augsburg, as well as the Bernese disputation celebrated at great expense and legitimately in the most crowded assembly of many legates and most learned men, and finally in the presence of the entire populace, with his saliva and filth.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he presents an irrefutable argument of reprobate blindness against himself when he lists ecclesiastical catechisms under heresies.</p>
      <p>It was not enough for these men to have obliterated and kept in darkness for several centuries that ancient and especially necessary discipline of catechizing in the Christian Church, unless they most unjustly hinder those who wish to renew it and, as it were, bring it back into use for the unlearned, and abundantly pour forth clouds of insults. O wicked attempts more worthy of infernal devils than earthly men. Of this kind is especially that which that Aethnean giant, plainly breathing infernal flames, even proscribes the very sacred Bible, the works of Robert Estienne, the royal printer of Paris, diligently printed. The impious rascal dares to curse the word of the living God; what wonder, then, if he tramples on the labors of pious men with his muddy feet?</p>
      <p>He should at least have spared the most noble order of Parisian theologians, many of whom, as I heard from Robert himself, did not disapprove of that edition. Perhaps to this Maeson, even the most Christian and powerful King Francis will seem not far removed from the stain of heresy, under whose privilege those most correct and best Bibles were published. But what can you do with those men, who, because of their contempt for the eternal word of God, appear to have been given over to a reprobate mind and have no regard for things or persons? For like rabid dogs, they sink their venomous teeth into anyone, even those who do not provoke them.</p>
      <p>It seems to be of no less iniquity that he adorns Erasmus of Rotterdam, Beatus Rhenanus, Simon Grynaeus, and many others who have deserved well of letters and the republic and are worthy of a much better fate with that execrable and abominable title of his. He drags some who have deserved nothing into the crowd of heretics by their hair for his insatiable lust for reviling, such as Jacob Ruͤff, a surgeon of our city, and Heinrich Vogtherr, a veteran soldier and noble painter living in Vienna, Austria, who have nothing to do with letters. Why, indeed, is Marsilius of Padua condemned by that censor? Surely because he wrote the "Defensor Pacis"; for he was a good man, a son of God according to that divine saying of the Son of God: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God." But to this censor and his cardinals, wars and torrents of human blood are more pleasing, by which they well reflect the nature of their father, about whom the Lord taught us in the Gospel and said: "You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him." Of the same kind is the condemnation of biblical prayers. Is he to be considered of sound mind who lists biblical prayers among heresies?</p>
      <p>"What, good God," I hear, "has it come to this, that prayers offered to the eternal God by the most holy servants of God and always held in the church for divine purposes must now be mentioned by this rascal in a book of heresies and heretics? What has truth to do with falsehood? What has Christ to do with Belial?</p>
      <p>Why did he not rather proscribe most of the absurd and expressly against true religion things in the "Hortulus Animae," which it is shameful to mention? To creatures is everywhere attributed with great crime what belongs to the Creator alone; the number of superstitions is greater than can be borne in the holy and purified Church of Christ." But to the reproaches of Christ, these blind guides are both blind and deaf.</p>
      <p>But even Lorenzo Valla, a Roman patrician, whom he should have spared for this very name, is also inserted into this catalog, especially because he showed in a published book that the donation made to Sylvester by Constantine was fabricated. But why does he not condemn Otto, the historian, Bishop of Freising, for heresy by the same reasoning? Why do many others, who have proven the same thing with irrefutable arguments, escape unscathed?</p>
      <p>However, that fierce Minos seems to have either ignored these for their manifold and varied reading and learning or to have slaughtered them all with one blow and one sentence. But what then? St. Paul says: "Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth, men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected. But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone." Certainly, it is read in the Gospel that he said to Peter, the apostles, and the whole apostolic order: "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who exercise authority over them call themselves benefactors. But you are not to be like that," etc.</p>
      <p>Peter, the abbot of Cluny, at no small expense, had the Quran translated from Arabic into Latin and commended this work of his to St. Bernard 400 years ago, expecting a reward as due to virtue from this work, nor did the work displease St. Bernard. Our censor alone wishes that book removed from the memory of men, which we do not approve of, but we think it should be used, as the blessed Jerome taught somewhere to Tranquillinus about the books of Origen and others; but he undoubtedly profited more in the culinary art and the writings of Apicius than in Jerome or the books of other blessed fathers.</p>
      <p>But what am I saying about the ancients, when he does not even know the men of his own age, whom he nevertheless condemned? For he could not name many by their own names, unless perhaps this was committed by the fault of the printer, which he was not unworthy of. He calls Otto Werdmuͤller "Wesduller," Thomas Blaurer "Blauret," both of whom are better and purer than they should have been defiled by the nostrils of this muddy man. He mentions the names of some in such a way that it appears he thought they were different authors, when they are the same names. He undoubtedly did not read the books of the authors themselves, but perhaps borrowed and had the names transcribed from the toothed papers of the inquisitors, so that the lips always have similar lettuces.</p>
      <p>Moreover, if the ministers of the Swiss churches deserve to be counted among the heretics because they requested in a published supplication to be granted legitimate wives according to the word of the eternal God, so that the infamy of fornication would not pollute both their ministry and their bodies consecrated to God, are not those rather, who abhor holy marriage and are infamous for their nefarious Venus, rightly judged to be burned with both heavenly and infernal fire? You know, my Vergerius, what the holy apostle pronounced about this marital or conjugal cause, saying: "The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry," and the rest. Again, you are not unaware of what he said elsewhere: "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral." For it is not unknown to anyone what God once decreed about the Sodomites, whom he utterly destroyed with fire sent from heaven because of their wicked deeds.</p>
      <p>It is indeed easy for anyone to cast the stain of heresy, especially if the reviler has wiped away all shame from his forehead; but it is not so easy to convict of such a great crime. The best part of those condemned in that index has long since been so commended and approved by sincere doctrine, whole faith, blameless morals, and singular learning and humanity, that the churches, of which they are ministers, and all who know them as men, marvel at the impudence and slanderous mouth of that censor and his kind. Nor is he immediately a heretic who contradicts the recent Roman Church, criticizes abuses, discusses new dogmas unknown to the ancients, or accuses the clergy of foul crimes, but desires to restore sincere doctrine, useful and sound church rites, and blameless morals. Children have long since learned that heretics are those who persistently slander and rebel against the orthodox faith and the Catholic Church according to the scriptures of God, who institutes all things for his own sake, and that for the sake of temporary advantage, etc.</p>
      <p>If it was so pleasing and seemed necessary to expose and proscribe infamous, harmful, or poisonous and pestilential books and to warn readers not to stumble upon heresies, upon vile and abominable things, and finally upon deadly snares of the soul, it should not have been begun with those men, to whom nothing is more ancient, sacred, precious, and dear than the orthodox faith, the Christian apostolic and Catholic Church, and finally the Catholic scriptures, but with a handful of rascals, with antichristians, with blasphemous sacrilegious and most wicked despisers, mockers, enemies, and persecutors of God and his word, with Epicureans, who deny the immortality of souls, who worship the belly as a god, who openly utter those disgraceful things and sow these impious words, that they do not know whether heaven or hell or angels or devils are present and certain, while they are granted to enjoy pleasures. Those sacrilegious Simoniacs or Canaanites, I say, those Iscariots, for whom Christ himself is for sale, and whatever is excellent in the church, should have been condemned. Those impostors who sell smoke, who under the guise of religion shamefully impose on many simple Christians with bulls, should have been condemned.</p>
      <p>Those vile, obscene, and foul little books, teeming with all impurity and filth, should have been condemned. And I greatly wonder how it happened that, when that censor saw and found so many authors and books in Germany, in France, and in England, he did not detect a little book written very Sodomitically and Amorrheically, and printed by a certain Curtius Navus in the year of our Lord 1538, almost in his own lap, in his very Italy, and almost before his eyes and in his very hands. The title of that Canaanite and Sodomite poem is: "Capitolo di messer Giovani della Casa sopra il Forno," nor do I think there exists a more disgraceful and impure poem in the world to the Christian name. Let the Priapeia of the most impure pagans, condemned, hissed, and exploded more than a thousand times, be silent; one ingenious in the Amorrhean art, Giovanni della Casa, has restored the matter to us by writing. Hence, he was rightly spared by this censor of ours, whoever he may be, who did not want to mention them among the impure.</p>
      <p>But not only I wonder at this, but every good person with me admires even more that the most illustrious prince of the Florentines, Cosimo, celebrated in the letters of many as a patron of good letters and studies and students, does not restrain such inept, barbarous, and disgraceful authors and does not suppress their books, so that they do not come forth into the public. For at the end of the book it is clearly appended: "In Florence." But the good prince undoubtedly does not know the audacity and wicked attempts of these men. For there is no doubt that he would not allow, if he knew, that so many good, learned, honest, and pious men of Germany, France, England, and also Italy should be condemned by that toothed paper printed in Florence, not indeed for a trivial matter, but for the most disgraceful matter of all, the crime of heresy, about which St. Jerome never thought it should be kept silent by a good man, so that I do not even mention that the insult to the ministers of the church is entirely connected with the infamy of the most pious and powerful princes and the most extensive republics. Hence, it would seem useful to me if good men in Italy were privately warned not to allow those rabid babblers to do whatever they want, nor to always connive at those things which may someday greatly inconvenience many. For he lives who judges justly, God. Live and farewell, my most esteemed Vergerius. Pray to the Lord for us, that he may bless our holy ministry. Zurich, in the month of June, in the year of our Lord 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Pier Paolo Vergerio, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
