    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for advice and comfort; since the plague seems to be retreating, he wants to stay in Basel, although the studies here are languishing, the lectures by Veit Ardüser and Simon Grynaeus are unsatisfactory, and only the support from Otto [Werdmüller] is helping him progress; he therefore wants to ask for advice again in the spring and expects great benefit from a stay in England. From there, John Hoker reports on the exposure of the fraud that was committed with a movable crucifix [“The Rood of Grace” in Boxley Abbey]; after it was displayed in Maidstone and at the royal court, it was publicly destroyed following a sermon by the Bishop of Rochester [John Hilsey]. Thomas Slythurst writes about the fight against the Roman church system, which is to be completely abolished by the next parliament. Thomas Otley mentions the decline of monasteries and pilgrimages and the transfer of all images of grace to London. That terrible things are also happening is shown by the report from Michael Drome about the execution of an innocent man for alleged murder. [John] Heron, [Baldwin] Norton, and others unanimously praise the situation in England. The brother [John] Butlers as well as Nicholas [Partridge] and [Nicholas] Eliott have sent or announced gifts. He has not yet been able to take care of the [books requested by Bullinger], but he has already sent him the “Orosius” as well as price information. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I give you immense thanks, most beloved patron, for those most kind letters which you sent to me via Mr. Butler the courier, from which I received both great advice and comfort, which were both most welcome and most useful to me in this state of affairs. However, I hope there is no need for flight, since our vicinity has been free from the plague for several days now; its strength is also waning in other parts of the city and has temporarily abated its former rage. Nor does the fear of this or the dread of death so vex me that I would decide to leave for this reason, but rather I dread more the pains of illnesses and the uncomfortable treatment among foreigners.</p>
      <p>But, as you say, the same God still lives and reigns, indeed He protects and nurtures me, who once protected me from this cruelty with paternal affection; I believe that the same Physician still has those most effective remedies at hand for all those who worship and honor Him with true faith and innocence of life. Therefore, I have altogether decided (if only this rage has ceased) to remain in Basel longer, although I do not see what great cause there is that would want me to stay there longer. For you would see that almost all studies here are astonishingly cold. In the disciplines, there is no one who reads anything except Veit Ardüser, who lectures on Euclid's Elements, but so slowly that he delays my course more than he advances it daily.</p>
      <p>Mr. Simon Grynaeus lectures on alternate days now on the catechism, now on the institutions of rhetoric, but since he has no certain author assigned to him in these, there is nothing certain for the listeners to follow; then with frequent vacations, he delays the studies of all the most. Certainly, to confess frankly what I feel, unless our Otto [Werdmüller] were to assist me so much with his friendship and private help, I would not see what benefit I would derive from the Basel academy.</p>
      <p>Indeed, everyone is in labor and with promises they tantalize the young, they are contemplating a new reformation of the university, but they advance nothing. Therefore, I think it best to spend this winter time there exercising myself in the reading of histories and the practice of writing, and with the new spring beginning, I will again use your advice on what I should do next. I have learned from the letters of the Oxfordians that England flourishes in every kind of study, which I believe will not be useless for my studies. For there, besides the knowledge of the disciplines, there would be the British language and many other things which, having been perceived by me, could help me not a little.</p>
      <p>But about these things elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The news I have received from England is this: John Hoker of Maidstone (which is a city in Kent), a man distinguished in both piety and learning, writes thus: “Here the Azotic Dagon is falling everywhere, the Babylonian Bel has long been broken: Recently, the god of the people of Kent, a wooden saint, a hanging Christ, was discovered, who could compete with any creation of Prometheus; for he knew how to nod his head, threaten with his eyes, shake his beard, bend his body, turn away from those approaching, and skillfully hear prayers. When the pitch-black monks fell for their cause, he was found in their temple surrounded by many curses, enriched with linens, candles, fields, urban and foreign gifts. A shrewd man, the brother of our Partridge, suspected the trick; he immediately removed it from the wall, the arts appeared, the impostures appeared, a marvelous and many-armed juggler. There were pipes hidden throughout the perforated body, in which a ductile iron was drawn by the mystagogue through small pulleys, with plates cleverly concealing the passages. Hence it happened that it deceived the people of Kent, indeed all of England, for several centuries with great profit. Having been revealed to my people of Maidstone (I rejoice for my homeland), it first gave a spectacle from the highest point, showing itself to the crowded people, some laughing sincerely, others pretending to be Ajax. From here the juggler was taken to London. He visited the court; the king himself greeted the new guest in a new manner. Courtiers gathered like bees; barons, dukes, marquises, earls were present and from afar for this spectacle, they surrounded, inspected, looked, saw. He acted, threatened with his eyes, turned away with his mouth, distorted his nose, lowered his head, bent his body downwards, nodded, refused; they saw, laughed, marveled, the theater resounded with voices, the clamor flew above the sky. The king himself was uncertain whether he was more pleased by the exposed imposture or more grieved from the heart that the miserable people had been deceived for so many centuries. The matter was reported to the counselors. A sermon was held in London after a few days; the Bishop of Rochester preached from the pulpit, standing opposite the Bel of the people of Kent, erected on the highest pulpit so that he could be conveniently seen by all. Here he revealed himself again, here the actor skillfully performed the play again; they marveled, were indignant, were amazed, were ashamed to have been so disgracefully deceived by an idol.</p>
      <p>When the preacher was now warming up and the word of God was secretly working in their hearts, he demolished the wooden trunk into the most crowded audience. Here a varied clamor of different people was heard, it was seized, torn apart, cut into small pieces, broken into a thousand parts, finally thrown into the fire, and here it met its end.” So far he.</p>
      <p>Mr. Thomas Slythurst writes in this manner: “The head of the Roman monster has long been cast down. Now the main columns on which this kingdom relied are being overturned everywhere, so that no opportunity for rebuilding may be given to anyone in the future. For the idle crowd of monks and friars is being driven out of their homes, not without an honest stipend, with which they may seek their livelihood. Now also the engines of the word of God are being applied by the most valiant ministers of Christ to remove superstition and impious opinions as a base and foundation. They shake vigorously; for the gaps and fissures of opinions, since they do not agree on their impious doctrines, threaten a ruin soon to come. In the next assembly of our princes and magnates, we expect a determined and complete expedition of all matters and opinions. Meanwhile, the most prudent men are consulting and deliberating on how these things may be done without tumult” etc.</p>
      <p>Thomas Otley, a most learned young man, describes these things thus: “The hooded retinue of the pope is decreasing daily. Few monks and friars are left among us; soon there will be none in all of England. No place for pilgrimage is left. All the saints and saintesses, whom unskilled men used to visit in various parts of England, are now in London” etc.</p>
      <p>Also, in the course of these most fortunate events, some horrendous deeds occurred, one of which is described by Mr. Michael Drome, about a twelve-year-old boy who accused his father of murder in court and won. He said he had seen him kill a servant, reported the place and manner in order, and said that the dead body was cut up and burned by him along with traces of blood. His mother and another witness, who had collected half-burnt bones from the ashes as more certain evidence of the matter, affirmed this. Therefore, the master was hanged as a murderer, but after a few weeks, the servant returned asking for his old master. The matter was thus revealed, that these things had been contrived by the impious counsels of the adulterous mother and the infamous adulterer, for which the impious son, with the cruel mother and the infamous adulterer, paid cruel penalties. These are the exercises of the world.</p>
      <p>Other most learned men and young men also write, namely Heron, Norton, and others, who all with one voice praise the most fortunate state of Britain. These are the things for which I know you are held in desire.</p>
      <p>The brother of John Butler sent me a ring as a pledge of friendship, our Nicholas sent a pair of boots. Eliott mentioned gloves in his letters, but I have not yet received any.</p>
      <p>There is no news with us. I have not been able to deal with the books now; for Mr. Butler is hastening his departure. I sent the Orosius, which I now assume you have received along with the price of others. I will inform you about the rest in the next letters.</p>
      <p>Mr. Myconius wishes you well. In turn, you will greet your entire family in my name, Mr. Theodor Bibliander, Pellican, Ammianus, Collin, Binder, if in such great men little Gwalther can do anything, and you will share these new wonders in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, esteemed patron, and always keep your Rudolf commended to you. October 3, 1538, Basel, from the house of Mr. Myconius.</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zurich, his patron and teacher, especially to be honored.</p>
