      <p>To Mr. Johann Konrad Ulmer, Bullinger sends greetings. I am responding rather late to your letter delivered 14 days ago; but you will forgive me for this; I could not do it sooner, nor do I see any harm in the delay.</p>
      <p>We greatly approve of your concern; however, we hope that through what we have given and are giving, nothing will be taken away from the truth, freedom, and the churches of God. We do not yield to the opposing party as if they were teaching more correctly, nor do we retract our own positions or depart from them even a little bit, nor do we betray our freedom to speak or to present our views in general out of fear.</p>
      <p>Indeed, no one has demanded those things from us, but only that we maintain peace with the adversaries to the extent that they do with us, and that the harsher writings on both sides, which have so far encouraged our common enemies, the Papists, and made many of our own anxious, be set aside. Therefore, we have given nothing more or different now than what our ancestors freely gave 37 years ago at that assembly in Marburg held in the year of our Lord 1529. Certainly, we would consider it inappropriate if we had imposed such conditions on those offering and requesting peace, from which they could have concluded that the desire to maintain and exercise contention was more deeply and strongly rooted in our hearts than the holy desire to cultivate peace. Thus, we have responded in such a way that we seem neither to have refused the peace offered nor, in the meantime, to have deviated even slightly from the sound doctrine of our churches or to have done anything against duty. In addition, in recent days we have also sent other letters to the same prince, which we believe contain more significant matters. We have attached a copy of this, with the condition that you return it promptly, etc. [8th?] August 1567.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the Elder. (To Mr. Johann Konrad Ulmer.)</p>
