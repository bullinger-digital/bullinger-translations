      <p>S. D. I specifically responded to each of your previous letters, especially regarding what my Jonas asserts concerning the question of the tortoise or chely. Namely, that he had no chely other than the one which was acquired for him by Lord Symbler and is contained in his account given to me in writing: however, he is wronged by the one who claims to have taken the chely from him. I have carried the owed money with me in my purse for a long time and still do today; however, I have not yet been able to find anyone through whom I could give it to Symbler. But within a few days, I hope to come to Augsburg and send it to Hieronymus Papius in Lindau through some merchant, who offered to be able to safely deliver it to you.</p>
      <p>I gave you the title of your sermons or books on grace with the dedication; I wish to know whether it has been offered to you or not; I would also like you to return it sometime, as I have not kept a copy.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the furniture of my Jonas, including the vessel, is still desired; it should have been sent, as Jonas says, either to Lindau or Memmingen; however, we are surprised at how it is retained there.</p>
      <p>If it is detained as a pledge... it must be endured; but if it has been handed over to someone and to whom, I pray that I may be informed through Symbler; for it is my intention to send him, namely Jonas, away from here and to test whether he still wishes to progress in his studies.</p>
      <p>With us, everything is in doubt, and not one in a thousand can set a method for the state of their affairs.</p>
      <p>We all look uncertainly to the end of the tragedy. Margrave returns with a strong army; the adversaries stand ready against him, but scarcely equally armed. What will happen, time will declare. The Papists eagerly await the arm of the Spaniards and Italians to their own and others' ruin. King Ferdinand and the bishops attack the pious more cruelly than ever before.</p>
      <p>In Lauingen on the 23rd of March, three suns were seen clearly and distinctly from six in the morning until eight; I described this sign in verse. Convey my many greetings to the friends and brothers you know from me. Hastily in Neuburg on the Danube, April 8th, in the year etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Fr√∂lich (Laetus) etc.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, dearest friend and brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
