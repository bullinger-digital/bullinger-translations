      <p>It is written from Augsburg that the camels sent by the Turk to the Emperor were three, laden with gold and silver, as well as with ornaments of gems, and furthermore, several Christians who had been held in chains for many years were released in favor of the Emperor.</p>
      <p>He was very courteous and familiar with the people of Constance, my former fellow citizens... In Frankfurt, when he asked the three electors, Saxony, Palatinate, and Brandenburg, to attend the inauguration of his son with the usual ceremonies and papal rites, and they affirmed that this was by no means permissible for them according to their conscience and the rule of God's word: "Ha," he said, "my son is also of this opinion, and I am sure that when I die, the mass will also have died." Would that he were not a false prophet! They write that he is to marry off his two daughters, one to the Prince of Ferrara, the other to the Prince of Württemberg, which to me seems unlikely regarding the Württemberg one.</p>
      <p>The fact that I am less inclined to believe that Brentius is dead is because my relative Scherer, who left here not long ago, did not inform us of this at all, even though the mention of the man came up more than once in our familiar conversations.</p>
      <p>If he was taken away by some sudden event, I will pray to the Lord to be gracious to him; for as far as men are concerned, he left behind an indelible stain among sincere and learned men, although he was adorned with many other gifts from the Lord beyond many others.</p>
      <p>We eagerly await your book, in which you respond to him, along with many others.</p>
      <p>Farewell; pray for me with yours and greet them. The day before the calends of February.</p>
