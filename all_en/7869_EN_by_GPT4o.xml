      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be multiplied to your love with all those who call upon the name of the Lord, amen. The Apostle rightly compares the heretical plague and contagious doctrine to gangrene. For just as infection and cancer devour living members by creeping, so does the heresy of the Antichrist corrupt the living members and sheep of Christ. Just as the beginnings of gangrene and infection are small and grow and spread by creeping day by day, so the foul plague of the Servetus-Blandratici has expanded its small beginnings infinitely. They have published two books, the first on the false and true knowledge of God, the second on the knowledge of the Antichrist, the kingdom of Christ, and the Antichrist. In these, they have spawned more than four hundred heresies, eggs of scorpions and vipers full of poison, of which I will send a catalog with refutation to Zürich to your [Excellency], so that they may be published under the censorship and judgment of your [Excellency]. Now, therefore, it is verified what the Apostle speaks of heretics: οι πλανςντεσ και πλανςμενοι [...].</p>
      <p>However, the works published by them in Latin and Hungarian, according to the measure of faith and the wisdom given by God, we refute with a very minimal and indeed childish style and speech, which is crude and barbaric.</p>
      <p>Since there are no learned and faithful printers in our regions, it has pleased us that the refutations of the heretics should not be lost, but if we have any that are to be published later, they will be entrusted to the faith and diligence of your paternity.</p>
      <p>I have established, as I said, a refutation of 340 heresies of the Servetus-Blandratici, which, having been refuted, I have decided to send to your [Excellency]. If therefore your [Excellency] promises the study, diligence, and faith of the printers through Threctius, a useful citizen of the Church of Christ in Kraków, I will shortly send everything to your [Excellency]. I have added to the Servetus-Blandratici heresies a refutation of the blasphemous Jews, Rabbi Joseph and others, who foully contradict the sacred Trinity and all articles of faith and evangelists like Julian the Apostate, mocking the eternal generation of the Son. All these are the foundations of the Servetus-Blandratici heresies. For these innovators, anti-Trinitarians, because of contradictions, call the greatest part of the New Testament apocryphal, where the mystery of the Trinity, the eternal deity of Christ and the Holy Spirit is confirmed. And they call the form of baptism in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit apocryphal and false. They reject the Gospel of John for the most part. Therefore, I will refute the blasphemies of the rabbis published in Paris, of which a copy was recently supplied to me by our brother and friend, the most useful instrument of God, Christophorus Threctius. Therefore, let your reverence inform me as soon as possible. For if the people of Zürich do not undertake the labor of printing, I will send it to Geneva according to the advice of Reverend Lord Beza, to whom I sent the work published against the Servetus-Blandratici, where all the sacred testimonies from the entire biblical body are collected about the one and only God, the Trinity, the Son of God, the Holy Spirit, the Mediator, the justification of the fathers from the beginning of the world and all the elect, the causes of salvation, etc., as these are recited in the title. I sent to your [Excellency] a small gift, a Turkish towel, with a disputation against the Francisco-Blandratici, may your [Excellency] consult it well and inform me without delay through Mr. Threctius, whether printing in Zürich can be done. I wish your [Excellency] to be well with all in the Lord.</p>
