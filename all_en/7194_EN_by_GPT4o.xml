      <p>We rejoice for many reasons, both for ourselves and for you, most distinguished men and dearest brothers, in Christ our Savior. For indeed, your letters have brought us many benefits, certainly very pleasing to us in every way. First of all, we are glad that your spirits burn with such sincere love towards us and that you value so highly the services we have rendered to you.</p>
      <p>Indeed, we in turn embrace you in the Lord with the most fervent love, and if we have rendered any service to you, we attribute it all to divine grace, and as for what remains, we offer you all our voluntary services freely and with all our hearts. Then we give thanks to our Lord God, who has given to the churches, so far apart from each other, Polish and Swiss, the same mind. For we gladly read in your letter that you, with your churches, not only approve but also subscribe to the confession of the Swiss churches, and we pray to the Lord that in this holy agreement we may all persevere in the orthodox confession until the end. Furthermore, we rejoice that the storm arising from various sects, especially from the blasphemies of the Arians, is now settled into nothing. Strive, brothers, to persist in prayers to the Lord, that He may grant tranquility, as much as we can hope for in these lands, solid and more complete. Strive to adhere to the pure and simple truth, but avoid questions and disputes that are dangerously curious and have more scandal than fruit and benefit. We highly approve of the most holy judgment of Emperor Constantine on this matter, which is found in Eusebius's book on the life of Constantine. To Alexander and Arius contending about the divinity of the Son of God, among other things... he says; and what follows there. Let it suffice for us, therefore, that we see in the apostolic and prophetic scriptures that it sufficed for the apostles and prophets. They taught constantly and simply that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one true and only God Jehovah, meanwhile not confusing them among themselves in the manner of Praxeas or the Sabellians, as if the Father himself is the Son and the same Holy Spirit, but they taught that the Father is the eternal Father and has a coeternal Son, and likewise the Holy Spirit, and that the Son indeed, not the Father, not the Spirit, was sent into the world, incarnated, crucified, died, resurrected, and received into heaven. For the Word of God assigns to each their properties, yet in such a way that the Father and the Son do not constitute two gods, nor do the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit propose to us three gods to be worshiped and adored.</p>
      <p>For the Word of God, which is the rule of believing and teaching, simply says: and these three are one, and the Lord Jesus says: "I," he says, "and the Father are one." For otherwise, the scripture pronounces: "Even if many are called gods to us, yet there is one God. Hear, Arius, the Lord your God is one God.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since we have been taught in this way most constantly and simply from the times of the apostles, it is truly religious to adhere to this doctrine... with a faith that is not curious, but simple and firm, and to retain the same in Christian churches and to abstain from the arguments of perverse men and those who daily invent perverse things... Or to what end does it pertain to further scrutinize and wish to know and fish out things by curious and faithless men, which have not been so exposed to us by God Himself in His Word. We exhort you, dear brother Paul Gilowski, whom we hear is endowed with great and many gifts from the Lord, to vigorously defend the simple doctrine of the Word of God against the... and fanatical men... as you continue to do... The Lord will never fail you with His grace...</p>
      <p>Our beloved brother Tretius has reported many things about your affairs to us, as he is certainly diligent and hardworking. We commend him to you as a pious, learned man, sincere in faith, and diligent in all things, whom we love very much in the Lord. Love us, brothers, and pray for us, just as we love you from the heart and supplicate the Lord for all your other churches confessing Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May the Lord strengthen you in all good. Zürich, August 14, 1567.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished men Paul Gilowski of Zator and the superintendent of the churches of Christ in Oświęcim, and to the most esteemed elders and ministers and dearest brothers.</p>
