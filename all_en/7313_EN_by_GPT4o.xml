      <p>Greetings. I received your letter last night, in which you inform me of the death of your most excellent consul Müller, a loss to be lamented not only by your republic but by all the pious and good. I am therefore greatly struck by this news; however, I pray to the Lord that He may provide you with another equally pious and prudent leader, although I know how rarely such individuals occur and how few of them you also have. Today, the son of Joachim Camerarius brought me letters from Beza, and since he gave me permission to open those he wrote to you, I unsealed and read them. And since they contain everything I could have written about, there is no need for me to be more lengthy. Farewell, then. May the Lord keep you and graciously assist His church, which is in extreme danger! Regarding that conflict in Paris, the royal envoy wrote to our senate in Solothurn in a grand and boastful manner that Condé was defeated, had lost great forces, and that the constable was indeed killed, but that not a single one of the Swiss, who had conducted themselves bravely, had fallen. But as no faith was given to those letters, so you will understand the truth from Beza's letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Bern, penultimate day of November 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
