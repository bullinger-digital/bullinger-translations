    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's book ["The Christian Marriage"], which he received through his wife [Katharina]. Returned home on February 4th [from his Augsburg mission]; while crossing Lake [Constance], they encountered the Bishop of Lund [and Constance, Johann von Weeze], but without any negative consequences. Asks for the intercession of the people of Zurich for [the people of Constance]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. When I returned home late, your little book sent to my dear wife was presented to me, and at the same time, it was indicated that a messenger would leave at dawn, which prevents me from writing anything now for our friendship, which you renew continually. Nevertheless, I give you the greatest thanks, both in my wife's words and my own, for remembering us so lovingly and for demonstrating with clear evidence how constant you are in retaining your former affection. At this time, we have nothing with which we can reciprocate your great benevolence and kindness, except to solemnly affirm that our spirit is as devoted and loving towards you as scarcely anyone else's, and we hope that it may be allowed to demonstrate this in reality according to the sentiment of our heart.</p>
      <p>I returned here on February 4th with, as they say, quite good omens, except that we encountered that ominous Bishop of London [and Constance, Johann von Weeze] while we were also crossing the lake with him sailing to Arbon. However, no danger threatened us from this, partly because we were not far from the port, partly because our ship was very well equipped, but mostly because we were most certain of the Lord's protection. We are very grieved by the fact that this cancer spreads so widely here and extends its orchards to the great detriment of our homeland, for we greatly fear this.</p>
      <p>You, with the whole church there, pray to the Lord that He may be graciously present to us with the most immediate counsel and help, so that we may not admit anything unworthy of us and our name, and especially that we, who have been preserved for many years depending on Him, may not be lost once left to ourselves. We are severely tempted by Satan, whom the Savior Christ may crush under our feet, which will happen when we have embraced true and solid repentance and our first love again.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my esteemed and dearest Bullinger, and forgive the less diligent writing due to your candor; for I am now exceedingly occupied. Thus, consider me among your most devoted and loving admirers. After you have conveyed my greetings to the best and most distinguished men Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Megander, and your other ministers, commend me to them as courteously as you can; and especially greet your most holy wife, whom my brother and sister and I also bid much health in Christ along with you and commend ourselves to you both in a Christian manner. March 10th, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother and among the foremost. Zurich.</p>
