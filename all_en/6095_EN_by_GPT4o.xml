      <p>Most Reverend Father in Christ, although I know that our Erastus is already writing to you extensively, I thought it would be more pleasing to you if I added some letters, rather than merely conveying greetings to you through this Zacharias, a pious young man.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in brief, know this, honorable father, that we need your prayers at this time, and indeed very earnestly; for we are called into a conflict by the imprudence of certain men, which I wish God would turn to good by His providence! From Erastus's letters, you have undoubtedly understood the matter more fully.</p>
      <p>I wish they were not the beginnings of great evils! I am sending you the remaining part of the sermons. Illyricus has written against me by name; whether you judge it necessary to respond to him, I wish to understand from you.</p>
      <p>If a response is necessary, I will do so modestly and seriously, as much as the Lord will grant, and I will do so with the intention of using his name as a mask and an opportunity to defend the truth.</p>
      <p>For since he is hated by many throughout Germany, most will want to read what is written against him in contempt of him.</p>
      <p>I would not want to be attached to his writing, but to handle the whole cause in my own method and refute it in its proper place. I ask you to advise me briefly on what you suggest.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus preserve you for the church.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray for us.</p>
      <p>Given at Heidelberg, April 5, 1564. Yours sincerely, Kaspar Olevianus.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Father in Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the church in Zürich, my honorable lord. In Zürich.</p>
