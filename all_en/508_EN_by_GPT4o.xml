      <p>S. Meanwhile, I have received two letters from you, the first of which, dated April 23, contains nothing significant to which I should respond, except that you wish to see what I have replied to Calvin regarding his declaration. I had indeed expected something from you for a long time, which you would suggest to me; for this, unless I am mistaken, I had requested from you. But, while you delayed longer, I could not delay any further without replying to him in the manner of which I am sending you a copy on the condition that you return it to me soon, as I have no other copy, and so that I have it if he (as he undoubtedly will) responds. It is difficult for me, inexperienced, to deal with such great men; yet I am not ashamed to confess what I believe and what I can grasp with my understanding. I wish to hear your judgment.</p>
      <p>Then you wish to see the ecclesiastical doctrines, which you may perhaps see shortly; for several forms are already printed; poor Apiarius is deprived of paper, so that it is not possible to print whenever he wishes. I have long awaited Metzler and supported a condition for him that is not inconvenient, which I could not suspend any longer, as the election of a minister was delayed not without danger to the church. Nevertheless, let him come, and we will provide for him in some other way. Thomas Hofmann has obtained a position, namely the diaconate in Herzogenbuchsee; he instructed me to express his greatest thanks to you in his name. In BÃ¤leren, I will carry out what you have instructed me as soon as I can make it known. These are in response to the first letter.</p>
      <p>To the latter dated April 28, the following seem to be responses: 1. Regarding the French alliance, everything is well, praise be to the Lord, as I have also previously informed you. At this hour, a senate of the dioceses is being held; I do not know whether delegates are being chosen for Solothurn or not; unless for other reasons, I certainly do not think anyone should be sent for this reason. 2. I sent your letters to Calvin, which I sealed with the method you taught, and I understood that he received them. I thought I had sent his letters recently, but they remained here; I now return them and express my great thanks to you. 3. I have the greatest thanks for the instruction against the French alliance; I see no argument omitted, the order is excellent, the divine persuasions are just and very strong. If these arguments can do nothing, no one will be able to dissuade more sharply. I will share them with those you wish to share them with; I think a copy should be retained; if, however, you wish it to be returned, I will send back a copy. 4. I conferred freely and privately with Benedict Martin alone. I find him to be of a calm and moderate disposition, so I have great hope for him. I present myself to him as friendly and humane; I hope he will be beneficial to this school.</p>
      <p>He does not fully understand the matter of the Lord's Supper and the sacraments; however, he is patient in instruction and not at all contentious, from which I hope he can be easily won over. You can therefore write to him, but not in a way that he understands there is any suspicion about him with you; he loves and esteems you greatly; therefore, your friendly letters will have considerable influence with him. 5. Musculus has already begun to read; he continues with his psalms; this has been granted to him so that he may complete his commentaries more quickly.</p>
      <p>All importunate matters have been silenced.</p>
      <p>These things hastily to you. For what I now signify is nothing. I bathe in warm water because of the scabies, which has miserably tormented me throughout the entire winter. Now the skin is so torn that only a little intact part appears; therefore, consider my brevity kindly.</p>
      <p>May your wife and children be well, to whom you should convey many greetings from me and my wife. Musculus, Eberhard, Haller, and Hagius, as well as Steiger, greet you.</p>
      <p>Iodocus has gone to some baths not far from the city. May the Lord protect and preserve you, amen.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 3, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Regarding the other letter, dear godfather, I have nothing special to answer you; as you yourself write, nothing is needed between us. I also thought it would not require so much; for while I brought it up with good words and promises, I was completely assured and still assure myself that it will remain so. I was not given a day to consider; I know well how urgent it must be. Now I am well satisfied; they also keep what they promised me. That the welfare of the church is so entirely dependent on me, I do not know; that they find no one at all, I do not believe. Yet I still do not know what my lords of Bern themselves intend. Perhaps they will let me go myself, if not, I will not oppose them; but I cannot and will not give up my claim to my lords of Zurich and put myself in this trap here.</p>
      <p>Whoever has not experienced the church and the Italians will experience it as well as I have; what everyone thinks, I do not know, I do not care, no one who understands the matter can hate me for choosing Zurich over Bern, yes, they will grant me good for having worked here so much this year. I am silent about the stipend, which is also a reason, I admit; for it will be too difficult for me every year to spend as much from my own as I had to do this year. That I then want a little house, where I do not need to be and all grace would be gone if I were to have a little house, I do not want. That I then want to give up my service to Zurich, I will not; they negotiated with me until I got everything I had. If they want to keep me here longer, they should let me have my service longer, although I would prefer to be there properly with letters and seals straight away. My calling does not sound further; then as far as my letter and seal sound; therefore, they do not bind me further. I have done my duty before God, as it was entrusted to me, what reward they now give me for it, I commend to God. My writing seemed very harsh to you, but yours seemed much harsher to me; for I thought I had written to you as a friend and that I have right and reason. If it is otherwise intended, forgive me.</p>
      <p>With this, they are commended to God.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and godfather in the Lord. Zurich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
