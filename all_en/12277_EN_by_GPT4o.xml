    <p xml:id="regest1">Abraham Klarer, whom Bullinger knows, was (whether rightfully or not) appointed as pastor by Herisau after Ludwig [Rösch] was called [to Sulgen]. The father [Walter] Klarer now wanted his son to be consecrated, but in consideration of Paul's regulations, the [St. Gallen] Synod was not prepared to do so, as Klarer is not yet firm enough in the Word of God and received the position against the regulations of the Synodal order. The father was deeply affected by this rejection and justified his intention by citing the needs of the Herisau church, the danger of nominating a monk [Jakob Stössel], and the approval of the now better-informed Vadian, as well as the support of Bullinger and Megander. He even disputes the article against itinerant preachers in the Synodal order and also warns of a church split in the Appenzell region if this article is not amended. - The relevant article is enclosed. Abraham's appointment is still pending until the judgment requested by Bullinger has arrived. - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Although I am reluctant to trouble your humanity, which is already more than sufficiently occupied, with my most foolish writings, most illustrious Bullinger, I could not refrain (as it seemed good to our synod) from writing to you about what happened to us these days through Abraham Klarer, a young man not unknown to you, who has been appointed as the pastor of Herisau (whether legitimately called or not, he himself should see), etc., which indeed was in need of a certain strict pastor, as the situation stands, after our Ludwig, a faithful servant of Christ, was called away; in which we were also anxiously laboring, as others may judge. Nevertheless, Klarer, having achieved his desire, remains. However, when presented by his father to our synod, he requested the laying on of hands in vain. For, as we understand, the blessed Paul forbade us to give votes to such as Abraham still appears to us. For Klarer is a young man, as your humanity knows, who childishly handles the word of the Lord (as those who heard him preach testify). And he received this office against the reluctant constitutions of our synod, which were accepted by us for pious and necessary reasons, which are as you see. Therefore, moved by these, we have so far refused to receive that Abraham into the fellowship of our synod. However, Walter Klarer, taking this decision of ours as unworthy of himself and his son, strives to excuse his deed to many, and first pleads the necessity of the Herisau church (but oh, what necessity!); then the caution, by which he provided that a certain papist monk might not creep in (which was easy, as it is said); finally, he wants it to appear that our Vadian did not dissuade this very much, but rather approved the counsel of the father, sanctifying his son for the evangelical office. However, Vadian, as witnesses testify, excuses himself as having been persuaded by Walter's words, because he promised so much and so great things about his son, and having heard the truth, changed his mind. Furthermore, the elder Klarer added that he conducted this business at the instigation of your humanity and the blessed memory of Megander. However, lest our law accuse him of error and even convict him, he rejects this article of our constitutions (which was enacted to restrain certain itinerant preachers, lest they impose on churches) as impossible to be observed with benefit by himself and the Appenzell churches, and threatens the division of the synod unless it is deleted.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we send this to your humanity to be judged and our whole business. For this reason, we have delayed the admission of that Abraham into our synod (others are powerful), until we learn the truth of the matter from your humanity, to whom (if such a calling, which Klarer enjoys, is approved) we are ready to subscribe, venerating indeed the authority of your humanity. We therefore beseech you, most illustrious Bullinger, that it may not be troublesome for you to make us more certain about these things. For we desire your counsel and opinion, by which, being taught, we may be able to do what is fitting.</p>
      <p>May your humanity fare well in the Lord, to whom we commend ourselves entirely. St. Gallen, August 29, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Valentinus Furtmüller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord, etc.</p>
