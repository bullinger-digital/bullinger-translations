    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer has received Bullinger's letter [No. 2767] with thanks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He is in a good spiritual condition and grateful to God for having shown him care for so long and having saved him from enemies so often! Now he is ready to die. He knows that he will exchange this miserable existence for eternal, heavenly rest.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The current dire situation troubles him greatly. The enemy behaves so boldly and brazenly, and the [Protestants] are so despondent! May God forgive His own, grant them a new spirit, and save them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Konstanz council sends the Zurich council a copy of the oath sworn by the five cities [Biberach, Kempten, Isny, Memmingen, Ravensburg] to Emperor Charles V. What a pity!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer must be brief this time, as he has much to do and visitors, and also needs to write to others. However, he wants to emphasize that he has nothing to reproach Bullinger for, as he knows well how much the latter is devoted to the people of Konstanz and strives to promote God's cause. Moreover, Blarer is aware that Bullinger cannot achieve everything with his own people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Konstanz council would like to make it clear to the people of Zurich (as well as those of Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen) what it expects from them. However, since it realizes that they do not want or are not allowed to undertake anything without the other places and is well informed about the sentiments of the other places, it will refrain from doing so and entrust itself entirely to God. It is said outright by some that the Confederates do not want to address the case of Konstanz or any other city at their future diet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Doctor Christoph [Klauser] has informed a pious Thurgauer in [Radolf]zell about the resolutions of the last diet and also reported how the Confederates intend to punish the [Swiss mercenaries who joined the Schmalkaldic League]. In [Radolf]zell, there is a cheerful mood. There and in the surrounding area, attempts are being made to arrest the captains who joined the [Schmalkaldic League]. However, God could soon put an end to this fun.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger should inform the current messenger [...] when the next diet dealing with France will take place.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] It is certain that the Emperor will approach the Confederates to persuade the people of Basel not to grant refuge to the young Duke Christoph of Württemberg, Count Georg [of Württemberg-Mömpelgard], and others. This will lead to something! Blarer has bad premonitions!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The news shared in [No. 2771] about Maximilian, the son of King [Ferdinand I], has proven to be false.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] A servant [...] of Captain Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz has come by the shortest route from Ulm to Konstanz. Many troops are said to be stationed around Ulm, and many Italians and Spaniards have already taken quarters in the city itself. The Emperor was in Geislingen [a.d. Steige]. In the meantime, he will have arrived in Ulm. He was seen riding a horse. So he is still alive and is finding out who bet that he was dead. He plans to spend four weeks in Ulm and receive treatment there. He will certainly stay there longer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] God will surely make everything right again, and perhaps even in this world. Trust in Him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Thomas Blarer and Konrad Zwick send their regards. Bullinger should earnestly pray for the people of Konstanz and send greetings to the good councilors and friends in Zurich, as well as his own household.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Especially trusted, dearest brother, I have once again received your faithful letter with great heartfelt thanks. May the dear God let His faithfulness and mercy reign over you and yours forever!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>For my part (praise and glory be to the Lord forever!), I am well comforted. He has let me live long enough with great care and many of His blessings, often pulling me from the jaws of my enemies. Whenever, however, and wherever He wills, may His gracious, most excellent will be done to me. I know that I will exchange this troubled, miserable life for eternal rest and heavenly security, and be blessedly delivered from all evil.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>But the common affairs, and that everything is going so miserably (both on the enemy's side and ours, they are all so bold, and ours are all so despondent) and so many pious hearts and children of God are miserably tormented because of this, that truly pains me. Oh my God and most faithful Father! Have mercy on us. Forgive our old and new sins. Save us with Your righteousness. Make Your holy name great among us. Give understanding, wisdom, and heart, that we may recognize and do in this heavy cross what is pleasing and honorable to You and beneficial to Your gracious word and gospel. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>My lords send your lords the oath sworn by the five cities to the emperor. There you will see lament upon lament! God be gracious to us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The reason I write little this time is due to countless tasks and foreign guests, as well as much other writing that I must now accomplish. In summary: We lack nothing in your faithfulness, love, and diligence towards us and the cause of God. But I sincerely believe that you cannot bring everything to where you would like. We will call upon the Lord God from our hearts and cry out to Him, that He may make all good counsel from His word effective through the power and strength of His Spirit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>What my lords always desire and request, they would gladly report to you, as well as to Basel, Bern, and Schaffhausen. However, since they see and experience that you do not want or are not allowed to act without the other Confederates, and they also know how the others are minded, they must refrain and entrust it to God. Thus, we stand exposed. We cannot know how and what will be acted against us. It is said, and some write it outright, that the Confederates have resolved at this diet that they will not take up the case of Konstanz or any other city.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>And a pious Thurgauer is now in Radolfzell. Doctor Christoph has told him everything that was handled at your diet regarding this matter, also about the punishment of the mercenaries and other things. There is great joy in Radolfzell, for they are seeking everywhere to arrest the captains and others who were attached to these estates. But the strong God can soon put an end to this mockery. He will do so if we turn to Him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Do not fail to inform me through this messenger when the diet with the French will take place.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>It is confidently expected that the emperor will approach the Confederates so that they may persuade the people of Basel not to harbor the young Duke Christoph of Württemberg, Count Georg, and others. This will then be a new unrest. Oh, what thoughts I have about this place! But the Lord will arrange everything rightly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>There is nothing with Maximilian, the king's son. It was also written here, but there is nothing to it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>A servant of Captain Marcell Dietrich from Ulm has come by the shortest route. He says that there are troops all around Ulm, and many Spaniards and Italians are in the city. The emperor was in Geislingen. He is now certainly in Ulm. He was seen riding a horse, so there is no doubt he is still alive; he is also making inquiries about those who bet on his death. He plans to stay in Ulm for four weeks and receive treatment there. However, it is believed that he will not leave Ulm soon for many reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>But the dear God will arrange everything well and perhaps even better in time than it seems. We will trust and believe in Him through death and life. He gives heart and a strong, confident spirit in His mighty support, so that we may also conquer in suffering and death and overcome this world with its princes in faith. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>My dear brother and cousin send you all good and kind regards. Earnestly pray for us with all the pious. Send all good lords and friends all good and many greetings, especially to your entire household. God be with you! Dated January 27, 1547.</p>
