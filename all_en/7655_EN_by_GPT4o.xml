      <p>Greetings. I received your letter last Saturday, most illustrious man and father in Christ to be revered, and I give special thanks to your kindness, for you have graciously shared your opinion on the catechism formula. The term "kelch," because it is in use in all reformed churches and is also placed in the Heidelberg Catechism, I have also retained in the words of institution and in the hymn composed on them; however, your opinion does not displease me, that it should be changed in the words of institution to the term "trinckgeschirr," which your German translation uses, yet saving your judgment; for I do not wish to engage in word disputes. For just as the term "kelch" is somewhat papistic, so the word "becher" among the unlearned, less accustomed to this term in this matter, will seem to sound somewhat profane.</p>
      <p>As for the hymn concerning the supper, after I submitted it to your judgment before that time and understood through letters that it did not displease you, I later communicated it to the ministers of the churches of Franconia, over which I presided, where they perhaps now use it. Therefore, if a change were made in it, some might be offended, since the rhythm itself would also have to be changed because of the disyllabic term. But I prefer to follow your judgment, if it pleases you, rather than insist on my own. I gladly send the double hymn of the Decalogue and Greyter's symbol; for I had only inserted it because of its long-standing use in our churches. However, I wish to retain the following symbol composed by Luther, which is sung honorably in all reformed churches and is sincere; for according to the second chapter of the catechism, this would lack its hymn if omitted; however, a title can be prefixed: "Der christlich glaub in gesangsweis"; I confess the previous title displeases me. And when Greyter's symbol is omitted, I would omit for the same reason also the Lord's Prayer marked with notes; for the text previously placed in its place contains only that.</p>
      <p>About new matters, you will hear from the fellow minister, the beloved brother, who is pious, sincere, and truly endowed with Christian zeal. From him, you will also learn the reason for my counsel in all things and my pious efforts.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Written hastily on November 1, 1568.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man adorned with every kind of learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father in Christ, to be greatly revered.</p>
