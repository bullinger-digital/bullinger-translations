    <p xml:id="regest1">Conveys the latest news about the fruitless negotiations between the young Duke Christoph of Württemberg and King Ferdinand I of Austria at the last meeting of the Swabian League. According to Bucer's opinion, "Satan is now raging in France." The Basel council is preparing the adoption of a confession of faith for the city and countryside. No new news about the ecclesiastical situation in Strasbourg. Greetings.</p>

      <p>At the recent meeting of the Swabian League, nothing was achieved regarding the execution of another alliance, as the young Duke of Württemberg, along with a large assembly of several kings, princes, and nobility, has begun, demanding Tübingen and Neuffen. Ferdinand opposes this, and in response to the young prince's demands, the king simply offers a dominion of Plüderhausen near Feldkirch, to which the duke objected. In turn, Ferdinand offers a dominion in Kempten in the Styria, which the prince of Württemberg also does not want, but he insists on his plan along with his supporters. Now, the league's position, if it were to be executed, is not to burden itself with the house of Württemberg, and Ferdinand believes he will come to terms with the house of Württemberg. Meanwhile, the young prince, persisting in his plan, causes a situation (out of God's order, indeed) that one can be certain of an impending war, and thus this negotiation is a reason to expect that the league will break. Therefore, the evangelical cities do not want to enter into any more alliances unless the religion is left unchallenged and their taxes and dues are allowed to follow as before without being questioned, so that they do not hold mass for it, etc. The appointed court does not want to relent on this. And this is now the second reason for the destruction of the league, which many good-hearted people rejoice over and many godless people mourn. For the pious cities are sounding out a new league, which perhaps will not be of great benefit to the aforementioned spiritual ones. Meanwhile, the leagues are quite close to Augsburg, waiting for the message sent to the emperor regarding the Spanish way of Ferdinand and the young prince of Württemberg. So much for the known recent news. On the Feast of the Purification, one expects a new description of the league cities, although nothing has yet been written to those of Memmingen. Whatever else is negotiated regarding these matters, I will write to you with the utmost effort, dear friend.</p>
      <p>From France, I have nothing certain, except that Bucer recently wrote in one word: "In France, Satan is raging today."</p>
      <p>Our council, considering how much harm discord and how much good concord brings, is with pious effort in this, to reconcile concord in the city and countryside with all its might, a beautiful plan, which you will hear from those you recently sent and will see soon.</p>
      <p>About the people of Strasbourg, I have not yet heard how they are regarding the reconciliation of their church. It is known that the Anabaptists are giving the papists a license to live very badly.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours. Greet Utinger, Pellican, Theodor, everyone.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 23, 1534.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his dearest friend and brother.</p>
