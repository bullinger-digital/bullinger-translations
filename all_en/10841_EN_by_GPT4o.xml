    <p xml:id="regest1">Urges Bullinger to participate [in the theologians' convention in Eisenach], as conversations bring more insight than reading; will be present himself despite illness and expects even more from the meeting, as it takes place without representatives of the authorities. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am more certain that this should not be omitted, that you should be present, as I think and consider it for a longer time. For you are the one whom God will use for great things and indeed is already using. You are young and yet have the authority of an elder, not only among the people of Zürich. There, however, you would hear others, whose reputation will thrive among future generations, and you would not hear them without benefit; for a short conversation yields more understanding on both sides than the reading of many months could reveal. The nature of the mind lives so much in conversation, which acquires something artificial in writing. Therefore, I beseech you, make an effort to be present with us. The body grows weary, broken by diseases and cares, and yet I will willingly be there. The matter will be conducted without magistrates, so it will be more sincere and free. The Spirit of Christ will be with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Give our greetings to Bibliander and Pellicanus.</p>
      <p>19th of April, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, urban pastor of Zürich, to be respected in the Lord.</p>
