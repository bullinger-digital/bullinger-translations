    <p xml:id="regest1">Against the demand from Lucerne and Schwyz that Zurich and Glarus should help the Abbot [of St. Gallen] regain his sovereign rights by pressuring the Toggenburgers to release the purchase document, Zurich protested at the Baden Diet [on June 12]. Consequently, it was presented with the alternative to either comply with the demand or agree that the Toggenburgers and the Abbot be summoned to Wil before the four protectorate towns and be persuaded to reach an agreement, with Zurich and Glarus having to prepare for legal proceedings in case of failure; the Great Council [in Zurich] will decide on this on June 27. Vadian is to return the pasquinade after reading it. Sent a detailed letter [No. 1007] through Antonius [...]; forgot to forward the greetings from the Archbishop of Canterbury [Thomas Cranmer]. Wishes to have the letter entrusted to Vadian [Cranmer's to Bullinger] returned; Vadian likely forwarded the letter addressed to Osiander [from Cranmer]. Requests news about the Emperor, the Turks, the French King, and the Pope.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus Christ. The matter you, beloved lord and brother, wrote about stands as follows: Lucerne and Schwyz want to help the abbot and support him so that he may remain with his rights, letters, and seal, and that what is taken from him may be returned. In response, they have approached my lords in Einsiedeln and asked them, along with those from Glarus, to request the Toggenburgers to release the purchase document and bring the response to the meeting held in Baden. My lords have objected to this; therefore, they have not sent anyone there, but have instructed their envoys in Baden to complain about the stubborn, defiant pomp and conflict of the two places: what is it, then, that one promises the monk so stubbornly against two places? Is a single monk dearer to them than two prominent places of the Confederation, which still have so much power and such reputation and merit? Much has been discussed on this matter at the meeting in Baden; however, the final decision is: my lords' complaint is included in the decision. In addition, the means have been proposed. It is requested once again that those from Zurich and Glarus demand the release of the purchase document from the Toggenburgers; or if they do not want to do this, then the four places should come to Wil on Ulrich's day, summon the Toggenburgers and the abbot there, and ask both sides to let the matter be resolved, namely that the Toggenburgers withdraw from the purchase, but keep the document, so that the abbot does not stand on his head. If the Toggenburgers withdraw from the purchase, then the four places should hear and consider the complaints of the honest people, how they might make unity, namely relieve some complaints and then also for the sake of faith. If they cannot be united, then they should remain with the purchase; but Zurich and Glarus should prepare for legal proceedings against the abbot. If Zurich and Glarus find something better, they are also willing to resolve it. - This proposal will come before the council and citizens tomorrow, on Wednesday, June 27. God protect us. Amen. This is what I know from your inquiry; I could not learn more. I do not know what will happen. But I hope in God, He will not abandon His own. Dated Zurich, June 26, 1537. - After reading the pasquinade, return the copy. I wrote you a detailed letter through Antonius. I neglected to forward the greetings, which my people, those of Hieronymus Canien, conveyed to you most dutifully; for when they were recalled, I diligently instructed them to do so. I am expecting the letters I entrusted to you, and whether you have sent Osiander's; also, what you have received about the Emperor, the Turks, the French King, and the Pope.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To D. Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>H. Joachim von Watt, mayor.</p>
