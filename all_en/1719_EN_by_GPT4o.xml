      <p>Greetings. As far as I know, I have never received any of your letters (my venerable and dearest Bullinger) to which I have not replied; but apart from those you recently sent through Funck, I have received none at all for a long time, so I could not respond to any, even though I would have anticipated the duty of writing if there had been anything that seemed worth communicating to you. I have long been convinced that you love me, and I believe you do not doubt that I, in turn, love you and hold you in the highest regard as a friend. Therefore, I think it will be easier to obtain from you, if I ask for something through our mutual love, that you give it, and hence it happened that, understanding how much it mattered to me, I earnestly requested you to send me those articles sent to you from Winterthur, which I now again, as earnestly as I can, request, swearing most solemnly to you that it will not harm anyone and that I will not discuss this matter with anyone but you. For I have already taken care of what was necessary to protect my reputation, and I did so with as little harm as possible (I wish it could have been none at all) to that good man, who also seems to you to be almost the best. You will easily find these articles if you search a little more diligently, since you maintain such a neat order in arranging your paper supplies, which I have noticed more than once.</p>
      <p>Hirsgarter certainly affirmed with more than one witness that they were not returned to him by you. So, my best and dearest Bullinger, grant this, whatever it is, to our friendship and make it so that I achieve the fulfillment of this wish through your kindness, considering me as bound to you as much as possible.</p>
      <p>Simplicianus indeed gravely wronged me, and even more gravely himself, contrary to the simplicity of a dove, without being provoked by any injury from me, but led by some evil influence, interpreting my zeal for the churches of Christ and my modest generosity towards His poor and almost all my actions in the worst way, so that no one with a little sense and fairness would not see that he acted out of jealousy and envy, fearing perhaps that his name and authority might be somewhat diminished by the public esteem and love with which many good people regarded me, which, however, was not necessary, as it would have rather increased and strengthened it if he had preferred to conceal his lack of self-control and internal disease rather than reveal it with such importunity, especially since I have always been ready to defend him vigorously against the calumnies of the malevolent, indeed, when I heard the best people express many desires about him, I excused him lovingly and candidly, etc. But, however things may be, I willingly and sincerely forgive him this harm for the sake of my Christ and pray for a better and more worthy mind of a Christian pastor, and I earnestly request you to send the articles by the first trustworthy messenger, and at the same time, freely point out what displeases you in them, although I had sketched them out for myself alone and in no order, intending to have the two principal leaders of the Winterthur church at hand to assist my unreliable memory, thinking nothing less than that they would ever come into anyone's hands, and yet, when Matthias Lutius, after we had parted, earnestly requested that I allow him to copy them, I could not refuse such a pious, learned man and so friendly to me, who, if I am not mistaken, used the services of a good young assistant (or supervisor, as they call it) to have them transcribed.</p>
      <p>When Hirsgarter learned of this and feared that I would be appointed in place of the late good Heinrich, he hoped that after obtaining a copy of this writing, he could place such obstacles that the efforts of the Winterthur people could not proceed, and therefore he importunately and as if by right demanded those articles from Lutius's good widow, as if they pertained to him no less than to Lutius, which, while Lutius was still alive, he would not have asked for from him, nor would he have deigned to look at them even if offered voluntarily. But the good man thinks he wants to achieve thereby that the appointment might not proceed; therefore, he presents such things to you and others, that (as I have been informed by pious, credible people) they were very dissatisfied with me and said to themselves (since they believed everything he said): they would not have believed that I was so inclined, with more words, etc. But I do not take this at all amiss from you; for one speaks as he is informed. Indeed, it was alleged to me, and truly by honest, upright people: if I had wanted to accept the appointment, the good Hirsgarter had brought things to such a point that they would have opposed it with force in Zurich, if it could not have been otherwise; but it was considered better that I be dissuaded by you and others for other reasons. All of which I knew in time and, as soon as you wrote me the first letter about it, I received letters from pious people from Zurich and Winterthur the next day, all of which I wanted to keep to myself and, amidst the fresh emotions of others and mine, let nothing be known.</p>
      <p>How well the Lord has protected me, that I did not remain in Winterthur until the death of the good man; for, speaking humanly and conjecturing, I would have come into the vocation; then I would have had to be a martyr and first learn from Hirsgarter, which I never expected. My faithful God has been there for me; to Him be praise forever. For no greater suffering could befall me on earth than if I had to serve a church alongside such a hypocrite, where I would now have to suspect, remain silent, and grasp that he was not of one mind with me. But enough of these things. It is well, since I do not feel your mind alienated from me. I wish Hirsgarter had not alienated the minds of many good people in Winterthur with his ill-conceived efforts. May the Lord graciously forgive him; for I know how important it is that pastors maintain their authority intact among the sheep.</p>
      <p>For the sermon you sent me, I am very grateful to you, who, like a fruitful olive tree in the house of the Lord, continually make me a partaker of your sweetest fruits, and here it pains me greatly that I, barren and a completely dry wood, have nothing with which to reciprocate. Therefore, I will say once and for all, it is not my, but divine recompense to repay this perpetual generosity of yours towards me, and I will diligently call upon the generosity of the heavenly Father through Christ in my prayers. To whom I also earnestly and repeatedly beseech and implore you to commend me with sincere and faithful prayers.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my esteemed and dearest brother, and always maintain your old love for me. May your household be greeted respectfully.</p>
      <p>Greet all your ministers in the work of the Lord very reverently with my words, whose holy patronage I hope and uniquely desire to be aided by before the Lord. My Funck and that elder Jacob with the others commend themselves to you greatly.</p>
      <p>We have no news or hear anything credible, except that the Turk is causing great damage. He sent the king 17 beautiful Turkish horses; he gave them to him; they passed through Solothurn. But this will cause a great outcry against the king, as if he were indeed one with the Turk against other Christians, as has happened before. May God have mercy on this miserable, wretched state and soon deliver us from all evil, amen.</p>
      <p>The day before yesterday, someone came from Basel, who is considered a respectable, truthful man; he says for certain that the French have captured Schertlin and found much treachery behind him, therefore he is held in severe captivity and must endure a harsh trial; his house and all his goods and possessions in Basel have also been seized.</p>
      <p>But however truthful it is considered, I cannot believe it at all; but if there is something to it with the arrest and imprisonment, it may happen for other reasons and perhaps be a private matter; I would be reluctant to be persuaded that he is unjust on account of the king.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing about where Margrave Albrecht is now. I have read the entire peace capitulations; it is a wonderful thing; but it is clear that it will be poorly kept from the beginning, etc. I have not yet heard that the preachers in Augsburg and elsewhere have been expelled again, although the emperor has reappointed the previous government set by him. God help, what will come of this! It seems not unlikely that all of Germany must be completely devastated and become Turkish; for the godless life and state in all parts will have no end, and everyone adds fuel, so that the fire of divine wrath becomes greater and unquenchable. May the loving, faithful, strong God preserve His own and us also among them. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Biel, September 16, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your A. B. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable brother and incomparable friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
