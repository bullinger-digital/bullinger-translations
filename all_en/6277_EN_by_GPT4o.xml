      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, all your belongings have been faithfully delivered to us.</p>
      <p>I return everything as you instructed.</p>
      <p>We must indeed fear that the plague will spread more widely and cause great destruction not only among you but also throughout all of Switzerland and Rhaetia; thus, this evil is growing everywhere. But what shall we do? Our sins certainly demand some scourge... I assure myself of nothing else; if it happens with you, it will continue and come to us as well, although it is not more than... miles away from us.</p>
      <p>And as they previously kept watch at the gates and wanted to block the way of death, they have now stopped doing so, and they walk daily among us, coming from the midst of the priests. And this for several months now, so that God visibly shows His power and thereby gives knowledge to my teaching and preaching. For the people of Chur have long been dissatisfied with the city of Chur for not keeping better watch. Therefore, their watch has been of much use.</p>
      <p>They have set up a quarter of a mile outside with halberds; but they have poorly guarded it.</p>
      <p>If it is time with us, it will also come; so far, it has not been time yet. This one thing I fear, that a delayed punishment will come more severely.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on Samuel, my friend, and his wife, and also on all the pious who call upon the name of the Lord. I had heard the same from Carlinus, which Hochholtzer writes, and I would have warned you about these things, except that Carlinus adds, they have service from the Genoese for 3 months, and previously the rumor was that they should be used in Naples and not in Spain.</p>
      <p>The rumor was false that all were slain.</p>
      <p>But we hear that the Italians, who were with them, were destroyed because they devastated some field with their raids and were overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>I send what the legate had translated from Italian into German for my sake; you keep it, there is no need to return it. Meanwhile, the Venetian Senate writes very amicably to our lords and promises extensively.</p>
      <p>However, our people had already written before and complained that some of ours, who were doing business in those parts, had been thrown into prison in the name of religion.</p>
      <p>They excuse the deed and promise our people impunity in the Venetian dominion, provided they behave modestly. The diploma is extensive, sealed with a lead seal, and I was amazed that it could be obtained from the Venetians at this time. - The legate is here somewhat sad, as it appears.</p>
      <p>He has not yet undertaken anything; for he did not bring the money promised to the Rhaetians and sees that without money he cannot do much, indeed rather lose the king's cause. Meanwhile, some from Rhaetia, who have been absent for a long time, have gone to Milan to summon him, if they can. It is also said that Hercules' son Rhodolphus is in Milan, to whom Philip pays a thousand crowns annually.</p>
      <p>I write to Hercules and warn him about everything that pertains to religion; let him consider to whom he joins himself and how fierce they are as enemies of religion.</p>
      <p>Mr. de Bellievre appears to be a candid and upright man.</p>
      <p>Yesterday our bishop dined here in the city. I also attended the banquet.</p>
      <p>He asked me when my Response would be completed, and as far as I understood from him, for we talked a lot, he wanted the Spaniards to be treated as they deserve.</p>
      <p>I jokingly said that I dedicated this Response to him, namely the bishop. Thereupon he said: "For God's sake, I beg you, do not do it; you put me in great danger.</p>
      <p>Treat the Spaniards and them as you see fit; you will not have me against you" etc. He complained a lot about the fathers, that they forbade the marriage of priests and drove them into many evils.</p>
      <p>We discussed a lot about the article of justification before we sat down, in the presence of Mr. Tscharner.</p>
      <p>He said he agreed with me.</p>
      <p>I added that the scholastics speak differently about penance and that the council approved the scholastic doctrine; therefore, if he spoke like that in Trent, he would be condemned as a heretic. He laughed and replied: "That's why I did not want to go to Trent" etc.</p>
      <p>The man is quite humane, but carnal and greedy. He diligently reads your book about councils.</p>
      <p>Now he is going through Cardilli's writings against ours and yet admits that they make too much noise about it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, even if my Response, which I give to the Spaniards, is quite sharp, there is no danger here etc.</p>
      <p>I know that the bishop would secretly like to suffer that I have well felt their shoes. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, and since it seemed good to God to chastise you, do not omit any occasion to write, so that I may know in what state your affairs are; for as this plague worsens, ours will not come to you so frequently.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there is a danger that our letters may soon be cut off. But if that should ever happen, let us embrace each other with the same spirit as before, even unto death.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect you and yours from all evil. Amen. Chur, September 18, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>I have enclosed these letters with yours, so they would not be lost; for I sent them all together with the legate's courier, whom I ask you to order to return; for I doubt whether ours will continue to come to you frequently.</p>
      <p>The legate sends you his most cordial greetings.</p>
      <p>Gorgius Carlinus is not present now; when he comes, I will convey your greetings to him, which will be most welcome to him. To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, lord and honorable father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
