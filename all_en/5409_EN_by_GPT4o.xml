      <p>Venerable and most beloved friend, let this inform you that I indeed received your letter written in Zürich on the twenty-second of the past month of June. And I give you the greatest thanks, because you not only do not hesitate to send them to me, but also deign to write to me about what new things are happening with you now, and, as far as you hear, what the outcomes of these matters might be. As for the Council of Trent, it should be regarded not otherwise than as an indication of some conspiracy or plot against the Protestants, rather than as a cause of any synod of faithful Catholics simply convening in truth, so that they might, as much as possible, root out the abuses that have crept into the churches of Christ. I am also affected by no small grief when I hear that you, who profess the gospel in Switzerland, are unable, with your sound doctrine and good examples of living, to attract your confederate comrades to the worship of the gospel; who still resist your efforts for the reformation of religion to such an extent that now it is suspected that the matter will soon come to enmity or war.</p>
      <p>As for the state of affairs in France, (and especially concerning those things that are happening in Paris and Rouen) it is certain (as you affirm) that we can be informed about them here as quickly as those who live in Zürich. However, regarding the truth of the events that are taking place in the upper provinces of France (such as in Orléans and Lyon), we only learn with certainty after a long interval of time. We English, however, still (thanks be to God!) live our lives quietly and in much peace.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the queen now seems to be considering and doubting about the evils that might perhaps threaten us, lest any misfortune might befall the kingdom through negligence or sloth: that is, lest some foreign prince (if by chance the tumult, which is still in France, were to be settled) might be incited by the Roman pontiff or some foreign papists adhering to him, to find something with which to exercise enmity against her, since indeed she takes occasion, by the authority of her majesty in the council of parliament, and with the consent of the whole region, to reject his usurped power, the continuation of superstitions, abuses, and idolatry that had previously crept into the Catholic Church. For the queen indeed has a great number of both soldiers and ships now prepared for the defense of her kingdom, if need be. My wife, along with the children, thanks be to God, is well, and she thanks you for remembering her in your letters, and sends her heartfelt greetings to you and your wife: whom I also ask you to greet in my name; and also Lord Ludwig Lavater. Farewell and take care of your health.</p>
      <p>In London, on the last day of July, in the year 1562. Yours, Richard Hilles.</p>
      <p>To the most learned theologian and my dearest friend, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, let these letters be delivered in Zürich.</p>
