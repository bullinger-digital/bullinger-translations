      <p>Greetings. I ask you, Bullinger, to have this man of patrician order, learned, pious, and now a consul of the Republic of Augsburg, along with his colleague, recommended to you for the common religion of Christ and the pursuit of piety, indeed due to the affinity of dangers, because the affairs of the papists are not yet as deplorable as they seem to the careless in the meantime. Luther renews the fight against them. Be vigilant, do not despise anything, lest they oppress the unguarded and drowsy. The Roman pontiff has postponed his council to another year, because this time is not very suitable for accomplishing matters at will, and yet it is proclaimed to our detriment, as he will undoubtedly strive to pierce us with that weapon whenever the opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>I bid the professors and fellow believers to be well.</p>
      <p>Bucer has gone to Augsburg these days.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>13th day before the Kalends of June in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Capito.</p>
      <p>I ask you to recommend these men to Consul Röist and your council; for they are worthy of our services.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and upright man, pastor of the Church of Zurich, to be respected in the Lord.</p>
