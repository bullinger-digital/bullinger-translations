      <p>Most observant sir, greetings. I have understood, as I arrived here on the 3rd of this month, your well-being and how you have written several letters to me and some to Padua, and such letters have not reached me because I was on the road... However, from the beginning, I have written to Alessandro, my brother, that he should ensure the delivery of those letters. And I am certain that he will do so. Furthermore, we have learned that in the Venetian territory, namely in the Bergamo region and in the Bressanone area, several soldiers have been recruited, approximately 350 to 400, in the name of the king.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing special to write. Such soldiers have been recruited in the name of the King of France and in the name of the Guise family.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it is a common matter that the Venetians are giving the King of France 1,400,000 crowns to exterminate the Huguenots. May the merciful eternal God be gracious to His own and grant them peace and grace through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I can say nothing else for now, but if I hear any other news, I will let you know. Also, be informed that I have settled myself and on the 5th of January have taken another wife, namely the one whom Doctor Hieronymus Bersino had previously married.</p>
      <p>I hope to see you in a few days; then we will be able to speak sufficiently with each other. May the grace, peace, and mercy of our most merciful Lord God always be with us through Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>
      <p>From Chur.</p>
      <p>Entirely at your service forever, Francesco Bonetto, exiled for Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man, Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zurich, his most revered lord, personally.</p>
