    <p xml:id="regest1">The bearer of the letter, who has received a good testimonial from his compatriots residing in Geneva, has requested a recommendation; Calvin would like to write more extensively on this occasion, having been prevented for months by the ecclesiastical reconstruction, but he lacks the time for it. The death of Leo [Jud] has affected him; since last year Grynäus, Capito, and others have also died, it is all the more urgent to promote the younger generation, as the Zurich council is successfully doing. Since Bernardino [Ochino] of Siena and two other [Italians] consider this young man worthy of promotion, but resources are scarce in Geneva, Calvin asks Bullinger and his colleagues to advocate for him with the council.</p>

      <p>When the bearer of my letter requested a recommendation from me, I did not doubt that he was worthy, since he had a testimonial from pious and trustworthy men of his nation who are here with us. But what troubled me was that amidst these occupations, which now constrain me, I am compelled to write to you more briefly after such a long interval.</p>
      <p>However, given your kindness, I hope you will not find it difficult to grant me pardon and allow this excuse of mine: especially since you can certainly conjecture that I am not seeking an empty pretext, nor am I negligent in not writing more diligently and copiously. For I think you are sufficiently persuaded of how much I value you, how greatly I respect you, and finally, how sincerely I love you. The reason I have been silent for so long is that, when I returned here, I was so overwhelmed for several months in restoring matters that were utterly scattered and collapsed, that I could not turn my mind elsewhere. Later, when I thought the opportunity had passed, I preferred to delay until another new occasion presented itself. Now, while there is a reason to write, I wish I also had the time and leisure. But at another time, I hope, it will be given, and I will gladly use it.</p>
      <p>The death of our Leo, as it was rightly mournful for all good people, has deeply afflicted me. For he always showed me a singular affection of love, and when I consider how great a loss the church has suffered in the death of this man, I cannot help but be gravely moved. Last year was more than sufficiently disastrous for us. For it took from us Grynäus, Capito, and many other distinguished men along with Leo. Therefore, we must make every effort to raise new seed, so that the church does not remain destitute. In this matter, since your council has not ceased to render excellent service from the beginning, I hear it has recently made a new addition. With this hope, we have decided to send this brother to you. For we have very modest schools and the resources of the treasury are limited. Nor do I dare to press our people too much in this regard: for I see that they have a sufficiently willing spirit, but their hands are tied. Nevertheless, I do not commend this man to you lightly. For Bernardino of Siena, a distinguished man, and two others who are well acquainted with his character have seriously testified to me that he is an excellent young man and one upon whom the kindness of your council should be bestowed.</p>
      <p>I therefore ask you to receive him for my sake, and to assist him with your authority before the council. Nor would I wish you alone to be entreated in this matter, but also my other venerable brothers, to whom you will convey my greetings. May the Lord Jesus always guide you all with His Spirit and confirm and increase His gifts in you.</p>
      <p>Geneva, November 6, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious minister of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my esteemed brother and most integral friend.</p>
