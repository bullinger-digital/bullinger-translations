      <p>Greetings and Peace. Four months ago, I entrusted a letter to a certain brother, which he had undertaken to deliver to you; however, he returned it much later (citing some excuse, which I do not know), and I have kept it with me until now, so that I might send it to you on this occasion, even though it is otherwise old, so that you might have at least this testimony of my feelings towards you and not think that I have been completely forgetful of you in such a long silence. Now, indeed, I am sending you that very letter, so that you may know what outcome the matter of Mr. Hooper has finally reached. Without a doubt, my mind hesitated for a long time as to whether I should write about this man, who is very dear to me. But when I considered that the lapses of the prophets and apostles are not rashly recorded in the sacred writings for the perpetual memory of men, I immediately cast aside all hesitation, not doubting that you (with your piety and prudence) will bear the brother's weakness in a Christian manner and will admonish him of his duty on this occasion, if it seems worthwhile. In the meantime, I have no doubt that this incident will eventually turn out for the good of the church; for we are accustomed to know ourselves better through such means and to humble our souls more before God, and to become more accommodating and equitable in the service of our neighbors. And indeed, Mr. Hooper is now conducting himself so faithfully and diligently in his ministry that all the pious rightly rejoice. You will easily learn the rest from the one who delivers this; for he, as I believe, has observed all of Mr. Hooper's affairs more closely than we have, since he has been in Gloucester and has lived for some time not far from Oxford. From him, you will also understand the state of the church and indeed of this kingdom. Therefore, I will now end my writing, not doubting that our Martin will also make you more certain of our affairs.</p>
      <p>When I returned from there to Strasbourg two years ago, Johannes Burcher gave me a piece of a certain cake to taste, a cake, I say, which he said had been sent to him in Zürich by a certain friend, the kind I would like to be sent to me at the next Easter fair in Frankfurt, and I ask you to procure one for me there, which is not seasoned with too many spices, and send it to the house of Adrian Eding in Frankfurt, indicating the price, which I will arrange to be paid here to Stomphius or in Frankfurt, to whomever you wish, by which you will have done me a most pleasing favor. If I can in turn be of service or gratify you here in any way, you will find me always most ready. Please greet all the brothers for me, whom I mentioned in my other letters, and farewell in the Lord, my lord, whom I will always respect, to whom I commend your ministry with your whole family from the heart. London, 14th of August, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, Johannes Utenhove.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
