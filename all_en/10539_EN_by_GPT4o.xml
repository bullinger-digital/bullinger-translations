    <p xml:id="regest1">Had to write a letter of recommendation for the pastors of Gachnang [Konrad Wolf] and Schlatt [Hans Ulrich Seiler], who are traveling to Zurich, as they do not know Bullinger; the two wish to obtain Zurich's support for the pastor of Wängi [Johannes Buchmann], who was expelled by the Commander of Tobel [Dietbald Gyß von Gyßenberg]. Greetings and a request for help. Also recommends two men who came to him after the completion of the letter and also asked for a recommendation.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>Today, these brothers came to us, the pastors of the churches of Gachnang and Schlatt, men who, if I am not mistaken, are both good and pious, asserting that they are about to set out for Zurich and are already prepared for the journey. However, they did not want to leave even a nail's breadth unless I first recommended them to you in writing, as they are unknown to you. Indeed, they seemed to be of the opinion that they would make the journey much more successfully if they came equipped with my letters of recommendation to you. The good men had so persuaded themselves of the influence our authority would have with you, no matter how much I resisted. And after they had long and much contended, what was it, I ask? They said they had undertaken this journey not on their own behalf but in the name of a certain brother who, for several years now, has proclaimed Christ with great faith and constancy, although meanwhile afflicted and greatly harassed by extreme poverty, namely the church in Wängi near Dürnten. Not long ago, the Commander in Tobel, a man of sheer impiety and a mere servant of the devil, removed him undeservedly from the province of preaching the gospel and stripped him of the priesthood for an unknown and innocent cause, burdened with eight children, to whom not even a penny is left, from which he might even buy a rope. They consistently affirmed that the resources of the pious man had been so contracted into a narrow space, adding after much that they had been moved by pity for the man and had undertaken this journey chiefly to inform you and other brothers of your kind there, hoping that help would be provided to the wretched man through your efforts, in whatever way it may be done, whether from public alms or otherwise, so that at least the necessities of life may be sustained for some time with the children, who are almost emaciated to death. Therefore, having understood the piety and concern of the good men for the poor brothers, I could not but comply, and willingly. I therefore set my hand to the tablet, writing this in recommendation of him at once. They themselves will explain the whole matter to you more fully and in order with words in person, since it is not possible for me to be longer now.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and do what you can and should, which is your humanity and your willing disposition towards all brothers, so that at least during this winter time, he may stay with you.</p>
      <p>On the third day of January, which was the first Sunday of the Circumcision in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>And when I had already finished these letters, but had not yet sealed them, behold, two others are present, stuck in the same mud, who demanded the same effort from us and, by Hercules, with no labor, soon obtained what they sought. (Hence it is that I have added this conclusion to the former.) Whom I likewise commend to you as much as I can. What they expect to be done by you or in what matter they need your help, they will report to you in person with their own words.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Lüthi.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, first preacher in Zurich, his friend and brother, to be especially respected.</p>
