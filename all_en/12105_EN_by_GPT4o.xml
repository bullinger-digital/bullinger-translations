    <p xml:id="regest1">The Zurich school leaders have not only done much for the church and the gospel, but have also exemplary ensured that the prospective pastors are educated in philosophy and languages. Werdmüller presents Bullinger with the present [two] books on the method and benefit of moral philosophy for evaluation before their publication, as they should only be published with the approval of the church, and since Bullinger, in addition to his theological works, himself pursues studies in rhetoric, philosophy, and other fields, he possesses the right judgment; particularly in comparison to Plato, Aristotle, and Claudius Ptolemy, Bullinger's profession is to be praised, because he proclaims the salvific gospel unknown to the pagan philosophers, bravely exercises the bishop's office despite all difficulties, and promotes the study of languages, rhetoric, and philosophy so that barbarism does not find its way back into the church; Bullinger thereby acquires fame with posterity. Werdmüller thought it good to present this writing to Bullinger due to his prominent position in the church, his unique eloquence and education, and his care for the church, so that it may be made known to many under his famous name.</p>

      <p>To the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my uniquely esteemed lord and father, Otto Werdmüller wishes eternal happiness.</p>
      <p>While many things have been divinely instituted by the leaders of the Zurich college for the glory of God and the benefit of the church, nothing is more distinguished than the fact that not only is the pure doctrine of the gospel publicly presented, but also those consecrated to this office are imbued with philosophy and honorable disciplines from a young age. For it can be convincingly shown by not insignificant examples and reasons that it is appropriate to apply the knowledge of languages and philosophy, which encompass the liberal arts, in the explanation of sacred scriptures, about which we will also speak shortly, as far as the present matter is concerned. It is therefore most fair to embrace all the authors of such a distinguished institution with the greatest favor and to extol their wisdom and piety with countless praises. However, the occasion to speak about the other college leaders will be at another time.</p>
      <p>But now I write to you, most esteemed lord and father Bullinger, who protect the necessary and most arduous province of the whole church with the utmost faith and diligence, and I hand over to you these books on the method, dignity, and use of moral philosophy to be read and judged before they are published, so that they may not come to light unless approved by the church, of which I wish to be a part. For since you yourself have joined the studies of eloquence and philosophy and the knowledge of many things to the religion you profess, you are accustomed to judge rightly and think honorably about all kinds of good arts, nor do you omit anything either publicly or privately that you consider conducive to promoting honorable studies. Therefore, if it is fitting to adorn Plato, Aristotle, Claudius Ptolemy, and any of the wisest with praises, your profession is certainly to be celebrated with even greater words, first because you announce to all in writing and speech the gospel unknown to the pagan philosophers, in which the eternal salvation of men is placed, and bravely execute the office of bishop, than which there is nothing more dignified in the world, through so many dangers, and then because you do not cease to propagate far and wide the studies of languages, the arts of speaking, and the knowledge of philosophy, lest barbarism invade the church again, and by this name you also bind posterity to you with immortal benefits.</p>
      <p>Since therefore by the kindness of God you have attained the most honorable position in the church, as you ought most of all, singular eloquence and erudition, as you are most able, and finally that mind and piety, as you sincerely wish to consult the church in the best way, it pleased me to offer these writings on Aristotelian Ethics to your humanity, to whose judgment we willingly acquiesce, so that (if you hope they will be beneficial) they may be communicated to many under the illustrious title of your name.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and may Christ long preserve your dignity unharmed for the promotion of good letters. Zurich, 1544.</p>
