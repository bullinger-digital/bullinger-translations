      <p>Greetings. I write this, most excellent man, so that you do not think I have completely forgotten you. I am now entirely focused on completing my third Decade; because many other tasks are pressing upon me, which I cannot dismiss, I am compelled to devote whatever time remains to the Decade. I mention this so that you know the true reason why I write less frequently. Furthermore, nothing worthy of note has occurred; such is the vanity and uncertainty of letters and messages, even from the most distinguished men, that I am often reluctant and ashamed. Therefore, I write later and almost only about confirmed matters, even though I receive many things from friends in the meantime. From Italy, we have no certain news other than that there are serious factions among the cardinals; however, it is thought that Cardinal of Ferrara, the leader of the French party, excels; but because the Imperialists are very prudent and not few in number, those who know this kind of people more intimately predict that a pope will be elected from Italy, especially from the Florentines, who will favor the Cardinal of Ferrara. Some entirely promise that Pole will be crowned. Whoever is crowned, nothing will be crowned but the devil's face.</p>
      <p>A German infantry army is being assembled shortly, unless it has already begun to be assembled in Germany. The Bavarian Prince Wilhelm has ordered his mercenaries to be ready to march into battle at any hour they are called; however, it is uncertain where these legions are to be led. The future commanders are believed to be the Counts of Fürstenberg and Hohenzollern. Some think they will be led into Switzerland, others into Hungary, others into the Piedmont region for the restoration of the Duke of Savoy; others think they are being hired to maintain tyranny in the cities. I do not know what they hope for again from someone's death. I believe all these things are done with deceit. May the Lord protect us. In the Württemberg region, some troops of cavalry and cohorts of infantry are hiding... they think the entire army is to be led to Rome to crown some pope. I believe the pious should be vigilant and pray. Farewell and live happily. Zurich, February 1, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
