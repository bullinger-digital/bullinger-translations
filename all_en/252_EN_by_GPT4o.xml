      <p>Greetings. Since I wrote to you more extensively the day before yesterday, most esteemed father, I now have nothing to write except that you should deliver this guarantee to Valentin Mentzer, which I have also obtained from the lords, so that he may be able to travel free of taxes with his belongings to the church entrusted to his faith. Farewell. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for a long time with all your family.</p>
      <p>On the first of September, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
