      <p>Greetings. In the assembly of the people of Glarus, dearest Bullinger, various matters were discussed; however, the main points are these: the more honorable part of the people elected Beldius, whom you know very well. Regarding the alliance with the French, then the Imperial, it was decided thus: in these times of widespread turmoil, they do not wish to enter into any alliance with a prince unless the Swiss alliance is first solemnly sworn and the oath restored, and then to follow what the majority of the sworn members declare. Furthermore, the games of cards and dice, which had been banned for several years, were reinstated and restored to their former harmful state, by the votes of those who were displeased that Beldius was preferred over others for the highest dignity of the people. For some peace-breakers, the way back to the homeland was opened, with the danger to life removed, but the penalty for the guilty was brought to the senate; what the senate will do is still unknown. These are the main points. Now I will briefly mention the state of my affairs. Many, as you know, are indignant about my calling, which is divine and right, and I do not yet know whether I can or cannot be separated from them with honor or peace. Such madness has seized some; certain people, whom I have hitherto considered very friendly, have almost turned into wolves and dogs.</p>
      <p>Satan has also added, to hinder me, a new tragedy of my long-extinguished troubles and calamities, so that necessity has now compelled me to conduct a legal case for my reputation and life. The matter has begun; I do not know the end of the trial. But not at all broken, I know the serenity of conscience and, fortified by the letters of the most illustrious senate of your city, I will bravely await the outcome of the matter. I will inform you either by letters or in person what the senate of Glarus has decided in that matter of mine, which is being revived by certain malevolent people.</p>
      <p>Some have devised a plan to keep me as the pastor of the church, while others want to expel me and brand my reputation with a new mark. We belong to the Lord; we will stand and fall by His judgment.</p>
      <p>On the second of this month, I was with Beldius, explaining to the best man, as it is said, the beginning and end of my business. He himself recalled you from the series of events, adjuring me by the love of our Christ, to commend him to you as an orphan and deserted by all his friends, being solitary; for his numerous family has been taken away, and he is the only Beldius in this people, finally even deserted in the election by those to whom he had entrusted not only the safety of his body but also of his life and soul, having secretly shown almost openly the enmity of his mind. If any more serious matter and business should arise, that he may have access to you and be able to obtain advice and consolation from the other best and most prudent men of your city. Finally, he urged me with great entreaty, even giving his word, to act as an intercessor with you, my sweetest patron, in this matter. Therefore, what I promised, I have done, nor do I doubt that your most complete humanity is ready to show acts of charity to a good man and a prince now among his own. Certainly, he is not deceitful, but smooth and straightforward.</p>
      <p>From Augustinus Dalpius, a very good man, you will understand much. I know you are overwhelmed with the greatest matters today; therefore, I will end.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Jesus Christ, our Lord, together with all yours, the church, brothers, city, and countryside. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Schwanden, May 4, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know, Laurentius Agricola</p>
      <p>As I was about to seal the letters, someone came informing me that Beldius himself was appointed as a delegate to the Baden assembly, to whom I entrusted these; perhaps he will meet you, etc.</p>
      <p>Whether Augustinus Dalpius has also descended to you, I do not know, perhaps prevented by this inclement weather; he had planned to attend the holy synod, etc.</p>
      <p>To the man of the highest learning, prudence, and honesty, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Evangelist of Zurich, his most complete and dearest lord and friend, etc. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
