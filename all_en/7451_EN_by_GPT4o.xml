      <p>Greetings. I received the letters from Heidelberg, I am sending them, namely the letters of Mr. Zanchi, along with another peace formula; for two are being circulated. This is the latter; which one is genuine, I cannot easily say. Once you have read this, you will return it; I assume you have seen the former.</p>
      <p>It is written from England that everything is safe in England and Scotland, the papacy has been universally outlawed, the Queen of Scots, the murderer of her own king, has been deported to an island, to which those who are soon to be executed are taken, magnates, etc.</p>
      <p>In the Netherlands, intolerable tyranny is being exercised. In Germany, cavalry and infantry are being prepared to restore the Prince of Orange and to curb the insolence of the Spaniards. From the Palatinate, it is written to me that Duke Casimir, on April 8th at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, dispatched a lord who arrived in Heidelberg (letters were given to me on April 21st, in which these things are contained) and reported that the troops of the league are still fresh and healthy at Orl√©ans and around there.</p>
      <p>Prince Casimir is in Paris for the king, to pay his respects and take leave. The queen has offered 500,000 francs to the troops of the Black Riders, now that they are soon to depart, and the king would like to see them leave in groups. They do not want that, but rather to leave with the whole company, not tearing the banners from the poles until they reach the Moselle. And as the messenger departed for Paris, the queen received a post from her daughter from Spain, over which the queen laments greatly; for the king in Spain is said to be mortally ill, with little hope for his life. It is also said that the son, whom he had imprisoned, along with some fellow captive lords, has been freed through treachery and has escaped to England, etc. If that were true, it would cause a great commotion, etc. May God do according to His divine will, who has never forsaken us, and may His name be made great throughout all the earth.</p>
      <p>God be with you eternally. Greet for me the mayors, Pontisella, Ganthner, and all our good lords and friends.</p>
      <p>The foolish emperor, as he sees where it will lead, has scheduled a day in Trier, wants to execute the Prince of Orange with the Duke of Alba, whom the Dutch call [duck yourself to the gallows].</p>
      <p>The Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Written in great haste very quickly. April 30, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man in all piety and sound doctrine, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
