      <p>Greetings. When we set out from home, Farel and I had planned to come to you as well.</p>
      <p>In Bern, the plan was changed for this reason. We explained in the council that there is now some hope of providing aid to our miserable brothers, because the king has recently issued an edict in which he shows much more deference to the Germans; for he first equates them with the natives. Then, by a special privilege, he allows them to live according to their religion. Additionally, the Sorbonists, who are instigators of cruelty, have less authority and favor than before. The timely death of Castellan, who suddenly died of a burning fever, was also advantageous for us. The king seems so intent on war that he does not hesitate to subordinate the misguided zeal, with which he previously burned, to his own interests.</p>
      <p>We truly believe there are many things that can be granted to them by you without any loss at this time, and it cannot be that in this varied and complex war, even if there is no treaty, they do not have many intertwined interests. How necessary it is for us to care for our pious brothers, their unworthy condition reminds us and urges us more than enough to help them as much as we can; for the king, as if having fulfilled his indulgence towards the Germans, does not cease to harshly oppress his own. Furthermore, because many opportunities could slip away from us due to ignorance of the matters being handled, it seemed prudent to anticipate, so that you and the Bernese, being warned, would take up the matter in due time.</p>
      <p>Now, because it has been known from many experiences that not much is achieved through letters, we asked the Bernese senate to send a delegation to testify to the king that this cause is being seriously pursued, and not only to grant this to your prayers, but to be inclined and diligently committed to this from the innermost sense of the heart. The response was that the senate does not yet consider the time ripe. For letters had recently been brought from the king, where he not only arrogantly denies what the four cities had requested, but also rebukes them fiercely, because they do not consider him to be a Christian and merciful prince. It was also said that letters would soon arrive from which it would appear whether the king had changed his mind. However, the consul promised that the senate, as soon as an opportunity was presented, would not neglect this cause. Among other things, the senate also advised against going to ZÃ¼rich, so as not to incur unnecessary expenses. This indeed grieved us, because we would have gladly discussed other matters with you, and our visit would not have been unwelcome to you. However, lest we seem too hasty, we preferred to be deprived of the joy of seeing you and the benefit of conversation than to attempt something that would harm the cause. Now both Farel and I beseech you and the other brothers, indeed rather all the pious who labor in France for the testimony of Christ implore you through our voice, to be diligently attentive to all opportunities.</p>
      <p>Although it is enough to have reminded you, their anxiety, under which we know they groan, compels us to add some vehemence to our prayers. However, since what would be desirable cannot be obtained in any way, moderation must be applied so as to offend the king's mind as little as possible. The last forty-seven chapters of the edict are: if four or five can be obtained, some tolerable mitigation, the brothers will not think they have been badly treated. One is that on feast days, individuals with their families must attend mass, and not only approve that sacrilege by gesture, and contaminate themselves with impious and perfidious simulation, but that the Sorbonist articles be recited by the priest, and thus all subscribe to the execrable blasphemies. It is commanded that there be strict inspection of this matter. Therefore, it should be requested of the king that honest men, who lead a peaceful life without offending anyone, not be curiously observed, nor be subject to the meticulous demands of the priests.</p>
      <p>The king adjudicates to his treasury the goods of those who come to us, that is, to places, as he calls them, manifestly torn from obedience to the holy see: indeed, he orders possessions sold to be seized from the hands of buyers. It should be requested here that it not be considered a crime if anyone, otherwise not noted by any accusation, voluntarily moves elsewhere without tumult, because it is not allowed for him to live in the kingdom due to conscience: provided he only takes refuge in a friendly domain. But this must first be pursued that a delegation be decreed: afterwards, what should be requested will be seen.</p>
      <p>To your letters, which were delivered to me when I was already mounted on my horse, I respond only that I had a just cause for complaint, especially brotherly with a brother. Consider what we expected from you in our troubled affairs. Consider also how far the response you gave was from our hope, you will indeed recognize that there was some cause for our grief.</p>
      <p>Do you wonder if I complained moderately and placidly that we were less liberally assisted than we had promised ourselves?</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I easily endure, if the letters have any offense, that they remain buried. The booklet I send about the main matter, as I hope, will suffice. However, you may freely express your judgment through me, if it seems appropriate.</p>
      <p>The father-in-law of my brother was to come there with me. But when God placed an obstacle for us, he writes to his son's teacher to retain him until the end of the year; for a short time remains. Meanwhile, it will be the master's task to treat the boy, who needs a bridle and stricter discipline. Farewell, most revered man and brother especially esteemed by me. Greet the brothers and fellow ministers very much in our name. May the Lord govern you with His spirit and protect you with His defense. Amen. Marquis of Vichy and Normandy and our other companions send you many greetings. In Basel at the inn, March 13, 1552. Forgive that I used another's hand: for I dictated from bed.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin in my and Farel's name.</p>
