      <p>Even though there is nothing of particular importance, dearest brother in Christ, that I should write to you now, I did not want to send off our John here without my letter, which he himself would have taken very badly. As for the matter of true religion, blessed be the Lord God, whose glory shines upon us more and more each day. We have now again changed the rite of public prayers and even the sacraments themselves and refined them according to the standard of the word of God; but we hate those harsh institutions of Christian discipline worse than a dog or a snake. We want to be children, indeed even heirs, but we shudder at the rod. Stir us, that is, our leaders, through the spirit that has been given to you for the study of discipline, without which (I say with regret) the kingdom will be taken from us and given to a nation producing its fruit.</p>
      <p>But there is one thing, my dear Bullinger, that I deeply wish to be taught. I read in your book on the Lord's Supper in the fifth decade these words: "Since it is not a public or general assembly when four or five communicate with the sick, those who say that the supper can be arranged for the sick if others also dine at the same time say nothing." What if, in a gathered public assembly, only three, four, or five out of many hundreds (with all others refusing) wish to receive the sacrament of the Eucharist, is it not permitted to do so with others present, or with them leaving the temple? Why then should the sick be deprived of this benefit? I wish to be more fully instructed on this matter when you have leisure. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe with us for a very long time for the glory of Christ and the edification of His church. Windsor, England, October 5, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your brother in Christ, Ric. Cox.</p>
      <p>To the dearest brother in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>"Cox."</p>
