      <p>Greetings. The reason for my delayed response to your kind letter was the expectation and the procrastination of the Polish affair to the point of tedium; for I did not want to intrude my trivialities upon your most sacred studies before I had anything certain, although your kindness towards me, which you continually affirm with letters full of friendship and the vigils of your writings, reminded me daily of my duty and gratitude, nothing of which could be more pleasing or important to me. Therefore, I intended to combine both matters at once, so as not to disturb your occupations repeatedly. Thus, in these days, Hector Vadianus returned to us from Poland, to whom our late Vadianus had entrusted your business with the Poles. I immediately met the man to inquire about the situation. He replied that he had left no stone unturned; however, since it is certain that the person with whom you have business is now in Italy, the friends have postponed the matter until his return; therefore, all attempts have been in vain; in the meantime, he has shown such integrity and faith to the man that nothing is to be feared from him in terms of danger or loss. Furthermore, I asked Hector to inform you of this matter in his letter, which he most willingly agreed to do; but as the messenger was about to leave, he was not at home and will return the next day, where you will finally understand everything in more detail. However, I could not refrain from sketching out these matters, however insignificant, with this messenger. If only they were such that they could give you full hope in this matter and testify to our concern and diligence, most kind Bullinger. Farewell, our ornament and of the entire Church of Christ. The ministers of our church join me in wishing you many blessings. Please also convey my greetings to Mr. Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, and Frisius, the best and most learned men. St. Gallen, October 22, 1551.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kessler, your most observant. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most distinguished doctor among the Zurichers, my most esteemed lord.</p>
