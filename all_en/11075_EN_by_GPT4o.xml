    <p xml:id="regest1">Capito writes that Luther is confident regarding the concord; Margrave John and Elector Joachim of Brandenburg are inclined towards the Reformation, as is Duke Heinrich of Saxony, much to the displeasure of his brother Georg. In Worms, a day convened by [King] Ferdinand against [the Protestants] has assembled; after a peace agreement between the Emperor [Charles V] and the Frenchman [Francis I], danger looms. Myconius recommends the [from WÃ¼rttemberg] expelled [Wolfgang Steyrer]; according to his report, [Erhard] Schnepf is enforcing the reintroduction of images in a manner that would even displease Luther. Can hardly forgive Megander for believing suspicions against him.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Capito, when he writes to me, usually asks me to commend him to you. A few days ago, he mentioned that Luther is in good health and is very hopeful about the concord, and that the contentious people have ceased all contention with him. He added that Johann, Margrave of Brandenburg, has fully embraced the gospel, and Joachim, his brother, the Elector, allows it to be preached in the principal cities and has granted priests the right to marry. Heinrich, Duke of Saxony, brother of Georg, has opened the door to the gospel. This grieves Georg, who is in his eighties, so much that he is now considering taking a wife to disinherit him. Furthermore, the princes and cities have gathered in Worms against us, with Ferdinand's involvement; a tumult is expected sometime after a truce has been made between the Emperor and the French. So much for these matters.</p>
      <p>The person you see in person will be diligently commended to you. He will tell you when he was expelled by Schnepf. I am of the opinion that Luther would be displeased if he heard of his violence in reinstating images where they had once been abolished by public authority, since he once held a middle ground, although I do not believe I could ever be persuaded of this myself. Grynaeus and Carolostadius have also recommended him to Leon. I therefore think he is commendable. As far as conjecture suggests, he seems to be a not bad man. He is miserable, at the very least, and therefore worthy of being helped as much as possible. If there is anything, therefore, from which you can do good, please do so.</p>
      <p>Megander, whom I have hitherto cherished as a most dear brother, almost considers me a traitor. This is a crime I have pursued throughout my life, so much so that a friend who once deceived me here could never again be cherished by me as before. This matter grieves me greatly. But in the meantime, I can do nothing else. But God will be the judge of my soul. He listens to suspicions and believes them, which I do not think is out of piety. I remain silent until the time comes; then I will brotherly teach him how he has been most wrongly deceived about a friend. Just a little about this matter to you alone, so that I may more easily bear the rest of the burden.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your wife and children.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 22, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most worthy Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the people of Zurich, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
