      <p>Grace of the Son of God be with you.</p>
      <p>Anna Vogler, recently returning from your Alps, indicated that she would soon return to Zürich, namely at the end of this month. Hence, I could not refrain from writing to your kindness, most learned Bullinger, from whom I have received so many letters over the years, which almost exceed the number of two hundred, which you have sent to me, a common man, not to say unlearned and barbarous. From this, I gather that your kindness towards me has always been (even if you do not know me by face) most well and piously disposed. However, I saw you before in Premgarten, indeed I greeted you briefly, when I was returning with the Bernese from the war unfortunately concluded, namely in the year 31. For we stayed a few days in your town, while the peace treaties were composed with the malevolent people. I heard you then and Gervasius, your colleague, preaching publicly in the month of November. From then on, I neither saw nor heard you; but our friendship has intervened through letters for so many years and has stood firm, which I hope will neither perish here nor in the future. And although last year a certain traitor, in whom I placed too much trust, wanted to misuse your writing to consult his own affairs, to diminish Vogler's reputation (but now it would not be worthwhile to write more about the traitor's insolence) and to succeed in the prefecture of Zellenberg, the man's wife, understanding the imposture, has long been peacefully quiet; henceforth I will act more cautiously. Rumors of war from the enclosed note.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, greet your brothers and sons-in-law. Hastily in Rappoltsweiler, November 23, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Matthias Erb greets you, our Johannes Wolff.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich and theologian, his esteemed lord.</p>
