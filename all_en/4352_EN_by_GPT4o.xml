      <p>Yesterday, a man named Georgius Caesar visited me. He told me at length how you have done him much good and helped him with advice, so that his sick wife was taken into the hospital, where Doctor Gesner visits her every day. However, he has three children whom he must also support, along with himself, with a long and detailed account. In short, he asked me for a contribution as well.</p>
      <p>I asked him if he had a letter from you; he said no, he had not been so bold as to request one from you; but he intended to return to Zürich soon. Since he made himself quite suspicious to me for several reasons, he achieved nothing with me, and I did not want to give him anything, but I told him I would write to you in the coming days; so I want to inform you, if he is dealing with legitimate matters, that you should give him 1 florin on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I kindly ask you to pay the money promptly with great thanks. If it is as he claims, he is indeed to be pitied; if not, he is a remarkable, cunning, and deceitful adventurer; he can tell so many quick lies, he seems to know almost everyone in all countries. It did not seem convincing to me that he was dealing with legitimate matters; but if my suspicion is wrong, may God forgive me, I will gladly share the contribution with him as mentioned; he should consider it a favor; for my income has greatly diminished. My dear brother-in-law Peter Schär wrote to me about the great uprising in France; the Duke of Vendôme, King of Navarre, has many horsemen and a large peasant force that continually gathers, visiting monasteries, refusing all obedience to the king, but demanding that the Duke of Guise, especially the cardinal, be removed from the court; they have also sought him, but he escaped them, etc. Then Musculus wrote to me from Bern that up to 40,000 are now gathered in France; it is said to be a great uprising throughout all of France.</p>
      <p>It is said that things will go very badly; the king, with the help of the pope and several other potentates, will suppress this uprising with great bloodshed. All this is in God's hands; let us pray that a good outcome follows.</p>
      <p>The many preparations, including cavalry, that have been made in Germany have been a remarkable adventure; each one has made a fool of the other, and none dared to trust the other; they have led each other into great, heavy expenses. Now everything is scattered and dispersed; those in Saxony are disbanding, and the same here; for the cavalry on the Danube was nothing other than Duke Wolfgang of Zweibrücken, the Count of Bitche, and the one from Sulz being with Count Karl of Zollern in Sigmaringen to fetch the kitchen; it has caused a wide and loud outcry. So in Württemberg, everything has also calmed down again, for everyone was warned to be ready at any moment as soon as they heard the drum; yet it is now a private matter. But the world must stand in fear and terror more and more, where there is no need for it; a rustling leaf must make them despair. The powerful cities, Augsburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, etc., know that the princes are not favorable to them, do not trust them; therefore, what they hear leads them to expenses, and hence some evangelical cities also bind themselves with some papal, spiritual, and secular princes, like Nuremberg, Augsburg with the Duke of Bavaria and the Bishop of Salzburg, also previously with the emperor, which causes great displeasure among other cities and princes, and thus everything is mixed up, a torn, tattered matter; none sees the other, and it is becoming more and more apparent that everything in Germany is heading towards conflict and destruction, there is also nothing certain, as there is neither trust nor faith among the Germans anymore. The German nobility also has serious days here and there, and the summons are so very serious and vehement, as if their utmost ruin lay in some past matters. In the Hohenberg district, they held a serious meeting on March 19, to which my dear brother-in-law Peter Schär was also summoned; he then had to ride back to the noble knights after the meeting. It is still all in the dark, why it is so; he does not write me a word, although I earnestly asked him to reveal to me what is appropriate for him in this matter, therefore I can well assume that these are matters that should remain hidden for the time being. It is believed that this Pope Pius IV will cause great trouble for Germany, yes, if God allows it; he has many and great opportunities to cause all sorts of mischief through evil practices and treachery, speaking humanly; for his mother is related to the Ems family, supposed to have been his father's sister, therefore the Ems family here is behaving with great pomp; he wants to make them all princes and lords, and one of the Ems family is in the legation to the emperor on behalf of the pope, whom he wants to assist in all matters concerning the coronation and council, and not leave anything undone, only that they should truly come together, so that St. Peter's chair may be restored and his ship maintained, as if they belonged to St. Peter in some way.</p>
