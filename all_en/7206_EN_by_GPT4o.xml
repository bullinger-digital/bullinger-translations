      <p>S. P. D. We were indeed affected with great joy when we understood from your letters, most illustrious man, that you, with your kindness, would take in Gedeon, the son of the late lord Gallitius, who for a long time, with a very brave and steadfast spirit, and even in the early years at the risk of his life, propagated the gospel. If I were not certain of these things, I would not have worked so hard for his son and been a bother to you. However, there is no need for you to fear, my lord, that if this succeeds, we will send others; it will be enough for us that this one has achieved his wish. And this regarding Gedeon. I have communicated those new matters to the preachers and the most honorable lord consul Willius, and also to lord Carolus. We all give you the greatest thanks for your labors. Lord Carolus promised that as soon as he has something certain about that synod, he will communicate it to you, my lord. We give the greatest thanks for your kindly promised efforts to me and my son, and if the Lord grants life, we will not be ungrateful or forgetful. Lord Zanchius reported to me that Lentulus succeeded him at Clavenna; therefore, at the first opportunity, I will remind him of his duty with my letters; now he can conveniently fulfill it.</p>
      <p>The most honorable lord consul Willius and lord Carolinus send their most loving regards to your kindness. I also wish you to greet lord Ludwig, your sons, and your other esteemed sons-in-law, my most honorable lords. May the most merciful Lord preserve you safe for us for a very long time.</p>
      <p>Chur, 25th of August, 1567.</p>
      <p>Johannes Pontisella, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zurich church, my most honorable lord.</p>
