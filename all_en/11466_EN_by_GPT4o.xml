      <p>Greetings. I beg you to take better care of your health. You disregard this weakness and make no end to your labors. A complete purification of the whole body is necessary, which can be best applied at this time, along with a gentle evacuation of the head and a careful diet throughout the winter. If you choose to ignore this, you disregard the church, whose service you withdraw from. I see that in this age, everyone errs in this matter, believing that taking care of oneself is superfluous, as if caring for oneself makes one less useful to the church than by being cared for. Therefore, I beg you to seriously consider this and diligently execute it soon, so that you may completely repel this illness at first, and then preserve yourself from it with diligent care. If this is not done, as you see, everything else lies in ruins for you. Let us therefore maintain this piety towards our homeland and the church, and do not believe that I advise you under a false pretense of duty; true charity and genuine zeal for religion urge me to do so.</p>
      <p>Regarding the bigamy you inquire about, this matter has also greatly troubled me. I asked Bucer himself. He denies that he, Philipp [Melanchthon], or Luther are aware of any guilt in this matter; they have done and advised everything that is right before God. However, the rumor arose in this way: Outside of marriage, Hesse loved two women; between them, a rivalry arose, in which the one who had been in love longer, in her anger, dared to boast that she was his wife. This foolish girl's boasting spread. What the true situation is, I do not know, as I could not find out from anywhere. I know that we are miserable because of such examples and even more miserable because we agree so coldly among ourselves in the greatest difficulty of matters.</p>
      <p>Regarding church discipline, I beg you not to believe that anything is being rashly instituted or attempted by them; the only thing sought is whether there is any mutual and closer friendship among the churches, by which the gospel we hold can be better left to posterity and more strongly opposed to adversaries. Everyone thinks very kindly of all of you.</p>
      <p>I beg you, by the love of Christ Jesus, to preserve yourself for this time with care and diligence, and to consider the public cause of religion with all your heart. May the Lord our God look upon us from heaven. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers for me; I pray to the Lord that they may all be well in Him. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your S. Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, beloved brother in Christ.</p>
