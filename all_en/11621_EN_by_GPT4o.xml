    <p xml:id="regest1">There is nothing to write, but in the near future, disaster looms; Bullinger should pray with his people for their small church, which the Prince [Georg von WÃ¼rttemberg] does support, but rather negligently manages. Vogler will report more details.</p>

      <p>The Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Last year, if you remember, most learned Bullinger, you gave me the opportunity to write to you whenever the occasion arose. However, since I now have nothing worthy to inform you about (although the present age daily gives birth to something, I do not know what kind of disaster it will eventually reveal; for it indeed nurtures a monster), I beseech and implore you to pray most earnestly with your brothers and the church for the power of the divine to free us from Satan. We and my brothers have a small church under a certain monarch, which has been promoted so far, under whom now almost everything is administered freely and more leniently.</p>
      <p>About our situation, Vogler will report. Farewell in the Lord, dearest and most learned brother.</p>
      <p>In Riquewihr, 23rd of October.</p>
      <p>Yours truly, Erb.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and truly pious Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
