      <p>In Strasbourg, things are bad; the Interim is being established in 4 churches.</p>
      <p>The imperial majesty has ordered some Spaniards, stationed in the land of WÃ¼rttemberg, to move towards them, and to take on 4 companies of landsknechts. They have come near Reinhausen by Speyer, but there, and before they could reach Reinhausen, they turned back and were dismissed. It is suspected that this must have happened due to illness or some other significant reason.</p>
      <p>Finally, I must open my heart to you, in utmost secrecy. I notice and see that the French are frightened, discouraged, and are discussing something that may be burdensome for them and for all of us.</p>
      <p>I also see: if the emperor advances, Strasbourg and, as is to be feared, more will be open to him. The poor people of the See and others are holding up well. I cannot write more, as much as I would like to. I wrote the previous part 8 days ago and have been waiting for my servant until now.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, the 17th of December, in the year 1549. G[abriel] Arn[old].</p>
      <p>[... dear esteemed lord ... Hein]rich Bullinger, to be delivered.</p>
