      <p>The main reason for sending this message was the barrel, which is nowhere to be found, even though I sent instructions and money to Mr. Jacob, the pastor, in Schaffhausen to send it after me. But I am not unwilling to incur the expense of this message now, so that in the meantime I may visit friends and extract letters from them, especially from you, dearest Bullinger. Therefore, first of all, I would very much like to ask you to use your authority to assist in the matter concerning the barrel itself.</p>
      <p>I would not buy as much clothing, books, and furniture for nearly a hundred gold coins. If by chance it is still stuck there (which I can hardly persuade myself), urge that it be sent to Schaffhausen; if it is not stuck there, write to that pastor, so that he does not fail, but sends it to the town called Tuttlingen; for there is my duke's prefect, who will take care of transporting it here. I know how important it is for you to use your authority.</p>
      <p>The gout does not leave me, so that I could not go directly to the duke in Stuttgart, and God made it so that he came to me shortly after. What can I say, he behaves excellently towards me; he invited me to dinner twice, dealt with me kindly and graciously for a long time, more than I dare to say. He immediately gave me a gift of a hundred gold coins, ordered a cart of wine and wood to be given, and assigned a house to me, and said: "When you have consumed these, let me know; for I will not fail you, but will take care to establish something certain for you" (so he said and had also written before he came here from Stuttgart).</p>
      <p>I handed him your letters with my own hand, which he read in my presence, and I recognized that they were dear to him; for a conversation about you arose, and he spoke of you with honor.</p>
      <p>Molineus met him in Heilbronn and is going to come here, as the prince himself affirms.</p>
      <p>The Diet in Augsburg is going to take place at the time of the Three Kings; but I do not think the Emperor will be present; Ferdinand and Queen Maria will be there.</p>
      <p>The Cardinal of England, who was sent as a legate to the Emperor for peace and also for English affairs, stayed in Tilly at the command of the Emperor himself with the cardinal in Augsburg; the Emperor, of course, does not want to appear eager for peace, but to be asked for it. I suspect that he will be a legate with the cardinal at the next Diet, which I would not like; for with his incomparable hypocrisy, he will deceive some (but I will not be far away), which openly evil and impious cardinals cannot do.</p>
      <p>The Duke does not have such bad hopes for the kingdom of England, although he knows that Winchester is now rampant. I think you have heard that our Martyr has reached Strasbourg safely, thanks be to God; I have already praised him to the prince as of better note.</p>
      <p>Albert has still gathered a third army and does not cease to harass the peasants. The Duke of Brunswick recently seized a fortress from him, whose name is...; for he forced it to surrender and hanged the prefect.</p>
      <p>The matter concerning the electorate has been settled. Augustus has obtained the dignity; but it will return to the sons of John Frederick, Duke of Saxony, if he dies without male heirs; so far it is said he has none.</p>
      <p>I hardly have anything else to write. I hope to be present at the Diet, which you should keep to yourself. You write to me about all matters and above all persuade yourself, Heinrich Bullinger, that I contend with your own family and even with your sons in benevolence, love, and piety towards you.</p>
      <p>God knows I write from the heart.</p>
      <p>When I had written thus far, behold, Charles Molineus entered the hypocaust and thanked me, who also said he would now write to you. I am certainly glad he has arrived and would not have wanted him to stay in Strasbourg on our account, who had recommended him, lest we seem to have recommended someone frivolous. I conclude and ask you to commend me to our Lord God in your prayers. I bid farewell to the fellow ministers, sons-in-law, and other brothers. Take care (I ask you from the heart) that the letters, which pertain to both legates, are safely delivered to them; address each with a German inscription and commend them most diligently to the host of the Stork. Write how long the messenger will remain there waiting for a response from you. Be careful that he does not leave unless Laurentius of Cremona, who stays with Mr. Gwalter, has added his own. If my other letters have reached your hands, I will retain them until I either send another messenger or someone happens to come by chance. May the Lord Jesus bless you.</p>
