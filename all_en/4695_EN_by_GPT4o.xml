      <p>S. D. I received your letters about the stabbed papal legate, indeed repeated or written a second time; however, I do not think that it was done, if it was done, by the authority and command of the princes. I did hear that two bishops came there, but they were not received amicably and left again with the matter unresolved; but since there are various rumors, I do not know what I should believe to be true or as truth. If you have received anything about these assemblies, let me know.</p>
      <p>I hear that all the orders have subscribed anew to the Augsburg Confession presented to the Emperor in 1530, but with a certain preface.</p>
      <p>They say that all agreed except for the Saxon John Frederick the Younger. It is said that the Palatine and the Hessian argued for a long time so that the sacramentarians would not be condemned; some say they succeeded, others deny it. They say the confession is being printed in Jena and Leipzig.</p>
      <p>If you have received any certain news from WÃ¼rttemberg, let me know. I am returning the writing of Mosci; I agree with you that it is entirely fabricated; as always, they adorn their whitewashed wall with lies. Mangold gave two batzen, indeed forced them on me unwillingly; there was no need for such concern. I gave them to a boy of Pellicanus, whom I had already satisfied before; thus, there was no need to send any money, and I am indignant that you did, as if it were true. The inhabitants of the Val d'Aosta have again repelled the soldiers of the Duke of Savoy sent against them, reportedly killing 800 Savoyard soldiers. If his forces are thus diminished, the threat to the Genevans will be lessened.</p>
      <p>The assembly at Neuburg between the Savoyard and the Bernese has ended; another is scheduled for May 18 in Basel. Eleven mediators were chosen from the eleven cantons; the Savoyard wanted the French and the Spanish to be mediators; but the Bernese opposed, so that, unless he agreed to those eleven chosen, the matter would have ended unresolved.</p>
      <p>You may be certain that the artillery was sent to Bregenz, let me know. I truly trust nothing in this matter and fear some sudden evil; impiety and superstition do not know peace; they grieve and gnash their teeth because so much is taken from their affairs, and perhaps life, unaware of repentance, requires a rod on both sides. May the Lord have mercy on us! I have not reread this.</p>
      <p>Farewell with Matthias and all good people.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 7, 1561.</p>
      <p>I received the booklet sent by our Calvin; I am surprised that you have not yet read it in full, as you have had enough time. Perhaps you did not want to.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer, residing in Winterthur, his esteemed and dearest lord and brother.</p>
