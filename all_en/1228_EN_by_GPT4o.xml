      <p>Greetings. On March 26, I arrived in Basel with all my belongings, hopefully under good (as they say) auspices. I remember what you wrote to me in your last letter, namely that you have urged me with many arguments, and indeed very strong ones, not to devote myself to civil law. But I do not see what persuasion can be brought against necessity. There has been no help from anyone for a year and a half now. I am abandoned, despised, and trampled upon everywhere as a stranger and foreigner, which I certainly would never have expected from evangelical men. I am very grateful to you, who have offered your support so that I might be received into the city there, which would be a great benefit to me if there were anything else to hope for from there. I am not so wealthy that I can sustain myself for long on my own resources (as they say), even if I cut back on many expenses. Therefore, it is necessary for me to accept that Fugger's benefit. However, if in the meantime any ecclesiastical or scholastic position arises, I will accept it.</p>
      <p>I might perhaps be able to repay Fugger and I know he would not take it badly; for he is not in need of me. I ask you, if you can withdraw me from here, that is, from the study of law, not with words, but with deeds, do not hesitate; for I would prefer to spend whatever remains of my life in another occupation. This briefly and in the evening, more another time. Farewell, my brother, and keep me in your thoughts.</p>
      <p>From Basel, March 30, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Naogeorgus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and humane man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, doctor of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
