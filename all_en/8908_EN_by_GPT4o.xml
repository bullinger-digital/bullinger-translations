      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir. Last week I wrote to you in haste, through a lady from there, who is married to you, with letters to my gracious lord of Saxony from Paris, in good hope that it has reached you well. This alone, as I have such an honest, certain messenger. I had intended to have the letter from Augsburg for you, but nothing has come of it.</p>
      <p>We have been informed that the Duke of Alba is again strongly arming against the Protestants; they have hardly any rest. A distinguished man has come here from there, who is a count's councilor and official; he says for certain that Count Montgomery, who injured King Henry in the tournament, is said to have conquered Rotterdam and another city, without harming the citizens, and the Spaniards have surrendered. We also receive letters from Lyon and Augsburg, stating that the Turk and the Pope have both passed away, undoubtedly both having gone to one place. May God the Lord grant grace for the increase of His church and the salvation of the poor oppressed Christians everywhere. The priests, monks, and countless others do not want to allow the king in France to turn to the apostates of the Roman whore, lest he be quickly infected. May Almighty God grant him and his kingdom good, for the salvation of their poor souls.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend myself to your grace. Amen. Your willing servant always, Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned sir Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, faithful servant of the Christian church, my honorable, beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
