      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, I received letters from our Augsburg friend Hoser along with a booklet by Brenz, delivered by Leonard Schnider, who is now also from Augsburg and, if I am not mistaken, has also set out for Zürich. However, after his departure, when I was unpacking the bundle, I found this letter addressed to you, and I was angry with myself for not having opened everything before the messenger left. But what is done cannot be undone, although it is fortunate that I still find the people from Zürich, who adorned the wedding here three days ago with their presence, now departing, through whom I have taken care to have these letters delivered to you.</p>
      <p>I would have sent along Brenz's booklet, if Hoser had not written that a copy was sent to you by Mr. Engelbert.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most esteemed and best brother in the Lord. Commend us diligently to the Lord. March 12.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed and very dear brother. In Zürich.</p>
