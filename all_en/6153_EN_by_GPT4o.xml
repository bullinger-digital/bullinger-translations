      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, I am so distracted that I do not know what to do.</p>
      <p>The Philippists are present, very well-prepared, and they are spreading their ideas. What will happen, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Those who are military and of lower status incline towards Philip's side because they understand that with peace concluded in France, there is nothing for them to do. I think it will go like this (these things to you): The king's envoy will let the others delay and not interfere further with his affairs and will arrange for the meeting of the league, which the others will request, to be postponed, meanwhile seeking money and playing all his affairs in such a way that he hinders the others once. I think if he takes this course of action, he will, with God's help, break the other practice, which is otherwise very strong. Meanwhile, we preachers will also do our part.</p>
      <p>I have given a sermon at the beginning, through which many people's hearts were opened, who now openly cry out that I am French, although I have clearly spoken many times, I tell them not to make an alliance with one or the other, showing no more than the reasons that hinder us from making an alliance with one who so fiercely persecutes our religion, and yet I made no mention of Philip by name. But thanks be to God: only those who openly covet Philip's money cry out, and they are not of such authority that they should not be disregarded like a barking dog; but you can imagine with what difficulties I struggle and what remains to be endured. I would very much like for some of yours to write at least modestly in favor of the cause. But if they absolutely do not want to do so, let them at least write to the Council of Chur; but I do not see what prevents them from advising the Council of the Three Leagues not to enter into an auxiliary alliance with Philip, since such an alliance is suspect to all good people, etc.</p>
      <p>I ask you, reverend father, to write what hope there is from yours, what is happening in France, what is happening in Germany. Farewell with all yours and commend us to God in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Chur, May 29, 1564.</p>
      <p>The council has ordered me to send you their greetings.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father in Christ, to be honored. Zurich.</p>
