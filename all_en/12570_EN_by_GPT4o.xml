    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich not only regularly receives heartfelt letters from Bullinger, but also gifts, namely once again the writings ["The Christian Marriage", "The Old Faith" and "Hope of the Believers"]. Frölich hardly knows how to thank him, as he is neither as talented as Bullinger nor can he reciprocate with money. Bullinger's book gift was also delivered to him by the eloquent Zürcher Hans Vogler [the Elder]. Frölich and [Johannes] Haller were able to spend friendly moments with him, even though they were often interrupted due to the war events. Now that Vogler is leaving, they will miss him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Regarding [Hans] Welser, he prefers not to write anything. One day, perhaps, he will report incredible things about him to Bullinger. Bullinger should therefore not dedicate his commentary on Matthew [correctly: Luke] to an individual [namely Welser], but to the entire council, if he indeed wants to honor [the people of Augsburg] in this way.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The army [of the Schmalkaldic League] is being mustered and counted in Donauwörth. Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] is supposed to arrive the day after tomorrow. He is leading 24,000 infantrymen and 6,000 cavalrymen and is accompanied by nine princes. Frölich will soon provide their names. Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony is also present, although he cannot fight due to his body size. The enemy [Charles V] is still waiting for his Italian infantry. Now that the [Schmalkaldic League] has gathered their cavalry, they will commence the battle without delay.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [Ambrosius] Blarer sent Frölich an elegant pasquinade [created by Sebastian Lepusculus] on Charles V, born in Ghent, as well as a poem by Rudolf Gwalther about the oath the Landgrave took regarding the upcoming war. Frölich thanks Bullinger and Gwalther for these documents. He will pass them on to the Landgrave.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The city of Füssen with its castle, the fortress and pass of Ehrenberg, the bishop's seat Dillingen, the entire Allgäu, and the Margraviate of Burgau are still held by the [Schmalkaldic League]. Additionally, a troop was sent into the territory of the Bishop of Constance [Johann von Weeze], including to Meersburg and Markdorf, to subdue the area. All the opponent's tricks have been exposed; especially those of the clergy, including the Abbot of St. Gallen, [Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The [people of Augsburg] are composed. If only they do not become too reckless!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings to Mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab], to City Clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], to [Rudolf] Gwalther, to the colleagues, as well as to [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and the whole family.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [P.S.:] Bullinger should pray for the [people of Augsburg], as Moses [once did for the people of Israel].</p>

      <p> Greetings. Besides the fact that you love me dearly and frequently adorn me with your most delightful and elegant letters, Bullinger, you also bestow gifts upon me, especially gifts more precious than any metal, namely your sacred writings, which you have so happily produced for the preservation of the true bond of marriage, for the defense of our most ancient faith, and for the consolation and revival of dying men. And you do not consider it enough to have given me so generously once, but you repeat the gift, knowing that your previous gift was piously taken from me, oh most generous giver, oh perpetual pledge of friendship. How and by what means can I either repay or at least show gratitude (for which neither my spirit nor my fortune suffice)? And unless your love and generosity towards me answer for themselves, I must remain perpetually ungrateful. How much, I ask, do you think your gift has been further adorned by the bearer and presenter of it, namely Mr. Hans Vogler from Zurich, a man eloquent and pious, who presented this book of yours to me not so much with elegant words as with a most unblemished demeanor? With him, and Haller, our common friend and brother, I lived most familiarly for several days, although the frequency of our conversations was greatly interrupted by this turbulent age, resounding with arms on all sides. Nevertheless, we parted not without the closest bond of friendship. I owe you, dearest brother, immortal thanks. Regarding Welser and our other leaders, there is nothing I should write. Indeed, the truth could be turned against me. However, I will one day present to you incredible and astonishing things before the lord duke. You should dedicate your Matthew not to any private individual here, but to my magistrate, if you wish to be so abundantly honored by us. </p>

      <p> Regarding our expedition or rather forced defense, there is nothing I can write now. The army is being reviewed and the soldiers are being counted at Donauwörth on the Danube, where the Landgrave is expected daily. I am certain he will arrive the day after tomorrow with many troops. He has with him 24,000 infantry and 6,000 select cavalry, and nine princes, whose names I will inform you of individually soon. The Elector of Saxony, although corpulent and unfit for battle, will be present. Matters will be conducted seriously and manfully, with hesitation and sloth set aside. The enemy has not yet hastened towards us, as he does not yet seem sufficiently equipped. He eagerly desires his Italian infantry, etc., who are his hope. We, having our cavalry, without which it has been less safe to confront the enemy, will delay no longer. May the Lord prosper our undertaking! Amen. </p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p> Our Blaurer sent me a most elegant and truthful pasquinade on Charles of Ghent, and also the Landgrave's oath in this most pious expedition, authored by our excellent Rudolf Gwalther. I will not conceal any of these from the Landgrave, and if necessary, I will urge him, although he needs no spurs. I owe you and him, namely Gwalther, immortal thanks. </p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p> We still hold the occupied city and castle of Füssen, the fortress and pass of Ehrenberg, Dillingen, the bishop's seat, the entire Allgäu, and the Margraviate of Burgau. We also sent a legion to the territories of the Bishop of Constance, including Meersburg and Markdorf, to receive them into submission. </p>

      <p> All the adversaries' tricks have been exposed, especially what and how much each of the priests contributes to the emperor for our ruin - among whom the Abbot of St. Gallen is also named. A marvelous revelation of hearts is taking place. </p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p> We here are undaunted. Would that we are not too audacious! May the Lord temper our passions and grant some allowance to human frailty. </p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p> I can write no more now. Convey my greetings to the mayors, the city clerk, Gwalther, and each of your colleagues, brothers in the Lord. May your most honorable wife and the whole household fare well. August 2, 1546, hastily and drowsily. </p>
    </div>

      <p> Yours, G. Laetus, etc. </p>
      <p> Be like Moses, praying for us. </p>
      <p> To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, incomparable friend and brother. Zurich. </p>
