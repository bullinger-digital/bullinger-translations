    <p xml:id="regest1">Is grateful for the kindness shown during his visit to Zurich, which he hopes to repay one day. Accepts Bullinger's decision regarding the future of his brother Christian [Hospinian] and will inform him about it. He is concerned about his sister [...], the widow of [Johannes] Rhellikan. The children wanted to provide a quieter life for their mother [Margaretha ZÃ¼st], who is old and chronically ill, but due to a purported shortage in the [Basel] hospital, they were unable to secure a benefice for her, and in Zurich, there seem to be reservations against people from the countryside; an application submitted at the right moment might have a chance of success, but as an outsider, Hospinian cannot wait and observe; therefore, he asks Bullinger to inform him if there is anything he can do about it; in case he is unable to act, he would let his brothers act on his behalf, especially he would turn to the mayor [Johannes] Haab, but he would like to follow Bullinger's advice rather than his own discretion in this matter. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>How you feel towards me, most esteemed Bullinger, is not only benevolent but also humane, as you have beautifully demonstrated both in the past and recently when I was with you in Zurich. There is nothing that pains me more than the fact that I have not yet had the opportunity to show my dedication to you. For you would undoubtedly have seen, if not a greater, at least an equal willingness. I (as I ought to) give and hold eternal thanks for the honor you showed me during our first friendly meeting and then at the most pleasant banquet, striving to ensure that, if I can gratify you in any matter, you will find nothing lacking in my duty and diligence.</p>
      <p>I am very pleased with your decision regarding my brother Christian. I will encourage him to comply with your wishes.</p>
      <p>As for my most miserable sister, the widow of the late Rhellikan, it is uncertain what we should decide. Our mother, as you know, is a woman very frail due to her age and almost always ill. Therefore, she needed a quieter and more peaceful life than to be troubled with such ailments.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we wanted to relieve her of this burden and provide our sister with daily sustenance. But our fellow citizens, citing the shortage of their hospital, refused to sell to us. However, in Zurich, we were hindered by the discourtesy of the same people (as far as I understand), who, as they conduct themselves properly towards their superiors, have never learned to do so in their fields, vineyards, and homes, where they have spent their entire lives. Although we have not yet completely abandoned all hope. For it might be possible, as it seems to me, that once the mutual animosity has cooled, your senate might finally hear our petition.</p>
      <p>This, therefore, will depend on the opportune moment. However, since I am not there, I cannot observe the moments and inclinations of the times. Therefore, I beseech you, my Bullinger, as soon as you think we can achieve and obtain something, let me know. For if I cannot be present myself, I will act (with Christ's guidance) through my brothers and send letters to those whom I think will promote our business, especially to Mayor Haab, who seemed to me to be a very humane man. In all these matters, I will follow not my own, but your advice.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily in Christ with your wife and children, whom you should greet on my behalf with due respect.</p>
      <p>Hastily, from our Augustinian college, on the 16th day before the calends of September. Yours sincerely,</p>
      <p>Johannes Hospinian.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man in divine and human letters, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Zurich church, his lord and brother in Christ, to be respected.</p>
