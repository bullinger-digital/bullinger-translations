      <p>[...] for ours, hindered by the storm, could not come. What needed to be written, he sent through the Zurich city messenger, who was at his sermon on Sunday and can report on it. I urge ours to go to all lords idly.</p>
      <p>But if they do not want to do it unanimously, as they indeed do not do it, and the precious and disobedient life gives sufficient indication that it will not be done, they should be content with one lord; the reason being, one cannot serve two opposing lords well. This would divide the minds, create factions and parties, and if we were to be attacked by our enemies with war, one would look here, the other there, there would be no unity, they would strike each other in the lands as before, the enemies would come, take peace, etc.</p>
      <p>In this sense, I said many things with examples proposed and repeated from ancient and recent memory.</p>
      <p>You know that the Goths came to Italy, the Vandals to Africa, then to Rome, the Turks to Hungary, the Saxons to England, the Franks to France. Everything is full of examples; what happened in Siena in our memory is known, etc.</p>
      <p>Angusola is with 70 horses in the Confederation, has been at the land assemblies in Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden himself, as they were discussing the French alliance; he did not advance the French.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, someone from the domestic staff of the envoy came by post from Fribourg. The envoy invited Mr. Tscharner and me to dinner; he was very sad.</p>
      <p>I only understood: it did not go according to their wishes in Fribourg. This will greatly hinder those here; for ours are looking to the Confederates.</p>
      <p>The envoy would gladly write to you; but he is very busy, so much so that he is gradually wasting away from thinness, and he solemnly affirms that he does not have enough time left for a whole month to mount a horse and walk for an hour or two for the sake of his health. How indignantly he took the actions of the Glarus people, you will understand from this writing, which you should either keep or tear up; for the instruction of the Glarus envoys, who are sent to Fribourg, has been returned to me, etc." - Request for reliable news "about Swiss affairs."</p>
      <p>In Chur, on Tuesday, the calendar was not at hand, in the year 1564.</p>
      <p>I pray to God to fully restore you to us, which we already hoped had happened.</p>
