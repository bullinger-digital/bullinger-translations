      <p>Greetings, esteemed brothers.</p>
      <p>You may have heard about our synod, which was finally convened by our people, driven by the audacity of the sects. A place was given to some of the principal heretics, among whom the most pernicious is Melchior Hoffman, who has driven countless people in Lower Germany to madness. For their sake, we have published a refutation of his errors, or rather, blasphemies. Our Leo (Leo Jud) has a stronger stomach, so he can read things that are not particularly pleasant. If he is inclined to satisfy his curious mind by reading our commentaries, especially the last part, I greatly desire him to write his judgment on that last part. He knows the cause, the treatment of free will, and the mystery of election. Since it entirely agrees with what our common teacher of holy memory, Zwingli, taught on this matter, I will easily approve it to you. However, if I have satisfied you regarding the sin against the Holy Spirit, I would like to know. The rest is Catholic. I hope that henceforth, as much as can be done in this Babylon, the ecclesiastical matter will be more rightly established.</p>
      <p>You know the Pope, I suppose, has sent his legates with the imperial ones to the princes of our league, who require consent for a general council under these conditions: That the council be celebrated freely, but in the manner hitherto observed; that we promise beforehand to abide by what will be decreed there by the majority; that if any do not come in person or by legates, the rest who have gathered have the right to proceed in all matters of the council; that if any refuse to obey the decrees of the council or dare to oppose the Pope in any way afterward, the rest will assist the Pope in restraining such. He names Bologna, Piacenza, or Mantua as the place, as any of these cities is closer to us Germans than to any other transalpine peoples. You see the most holy mind dedicated to convening a council. O Emperor, how your father plays with you. In no diet, where the council was discussed and promised by the Emperor, was freedom and celebration in Germany not both demanded and promised. Now the Pope demands that before the causes are examined, before we know who will convene in the council, we accept that we will abide by what the majority decrees there. But by this pact, if we reject these conditions, the Pope will elude the Emperor with some pretext, to whom he promised the council would be held. For although he knows he can easily obtain our condemnation in the council, he does not doubt that his own tyranny will also be circumscribed, and he cannot bear or undergo this risk.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that you have written nothing to us at this fair. I wish to know that you are present with the wretched there, whom the Immontani oppress against all the laws of the leagues.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, dearest brothers. Capito, Hedio, my companion, and all the rest send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, July 11.</p>
      <p>M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>Dear Leo, Schwenckfeld also met with us. More on this matter another time. Here we have an abundance of enemies of the Church of Christ, although they indeed wish to be more than of Christ.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and vigilant bishops of the Church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, Leo Jud, Conrad Pellican, Theodor Bibliander, their esteemed superiors.</p>
