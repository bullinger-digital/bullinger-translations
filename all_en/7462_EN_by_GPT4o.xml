      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write at the moment, dear brother, except that I have received what you sent. However, the episcopal pacification, which I sent to Mr. Haller, lacks a beginning; I think you have forgotten it in your haste; therefore, please send the beginning. Marvelous rumors are spreading from Italy; if you have any confirmed or certain information, please share it.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing certain from France. There are those who claim that the king has executed several papists who refused to accept peace; he has also sent infantry and cavalry to Lyon to compel them to accept peace. It is said that the German cavalry, who are returning home through Alsace, have been dismissed, which seems dangerous for that nation; therefore, it is said that arms are being prepared to prevent their passage. Whether these things are true or not, I will not say. We have nothing from the Palatinate and elsewhere. We are expecting news daily, especially regarding the affairs in Flanders and Brabant. It is reported that Duke Alba is raging most cruelly with his Spaniards. May the Lord restrain them.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 14, 1568.</p>
      <p>If you wish anything to be sent to you regarding the prophets, let me know. Greet the councilors, Gantner, Pontisella, and all other friends.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
