      <p>Philipp writes kindly.</p>
      <p>Would that he wrote freely and clearly.</p>
      <p>But it is more to be lamented that hostility prevails among us.</p>
      <p>It is well that the Lord has hardened me against threats and terrors. I am also certainly convinced that Beza will be no less steadfast and resolute.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, brother and fellow minister to be respected.</p>
