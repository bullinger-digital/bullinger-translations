      <p>S. I have and give you, Lord and brother Bullinger, most beloved in Christ, immense thanks, for you have so faithfully advocated for the cause of that most miserable girl, about which I had written, before your most holy magistrate. The same thing happens to you as to us and our predecessors, the prophets and apostles: if it falls so, they indeed hear you, but they do not listen. Although perhaps they have a reason in this girl, if she was most shameless and pretended (as you write) to be weakened by Studler's witchcraft. Certainly, unless this were affirmed by your most honorable magistrate, I would hardly believe it; for she is (unless I am mistaken) innocence and simplicity itself, who has been seen to rejoice in childish things, not in manly ones, and to hate vanities and blasphemies. However it may be (for the hypocrisy of the people of our age is great), my prefect has long supported her and did this partly out of Christian charity, partly out of love for the name of Zurich, which I always extol both with him and others (as I ought). But indeed, expecting anything but such a response, I gave him far different hope, especially since your citizens, who were here at the fairs, had testified that all the girl's words were true. Here I thought everything was safe.</p>
      <p>It is to be lamented that we all almost prefer to fail in distributing alms than to exceed; we do not seem very concerned about the tribunal of our Lord, before which we will eventually stand and hear the final sentence, according to whether we have been benefactors or malefactors towards the poor and afflicted. Even if a cart had been sent and the lame one carried away, the ecclesiastical treasury would not yet have been exhausted. But what are these things to you, who equally bitterly grieve and deplore the fate of the poor as I do. I have deliberately postponed the response until now, as I was still waiting to see what our magistrate would respond to us after receiving letters from yours. But neither the prefect nor I have been informed of anything so far.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we have arranged, since she knows very skillfully how to handle flax and hemp, that she be transferred by the prefect to the house of some good man with this plan, that, because she so greatly desires to return to you in Zurich, when the weather becomes milder, we collect alms here and there and hire a cart and make her achieve her wish. And behold, while we await better weather, against all our expectations, the miserable girl begins to gradually stand on her feet and, leaning on crutches, to progress a little, and now she can walk without crutches in such a way that we hope she will soon go where she wishes. We give thanks to the Lord, who has restored her among us, whose most holy name be blessed forever.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the entire family of the prefect believes the girl to be chaste and that perhaps there is a mistake in the person, as often happens. Her age also speaks otherwise; for she does not seem to be born so old as to be suitable for unchastity. I certainly did not want to tell the miserable girl that she was ill-spoken of among you; for why should I add sorrow to sorrow? But if she ever arrives to you, undoubtedly, if she has committed anything, she will be accused; if not, she will be received as innocent. I judge her to be in poor health, who perhaps will not be fit for the endurance of greater labors.</p>
      <p>Therefore, she will need the clemency and mercy of your magistrate, to which we do not doubt you will also strongly urge him to provide. Farewell in the Lord happily with all yours.</p>
      <p>In Basel, the day after the remembrance, in the year of human salvation 1560. Yours, Johannes Hospinianus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man in sacred and human letters, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and brother to be respected. Zurich.</p>
