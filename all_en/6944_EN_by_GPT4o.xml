      <p> Greetings. I am sending you this cheese, honorable lord and godfather, as a token of whatever gratitude and goodwill I have towards you; if you wish to enjoy it pleasantly, consume it soon while it is fresh. Of the remaining smaller ones, send one to Mr. Gwalther and the other to Mr. Wolf, as their names are inscribed on them. I ask all of you to kindly accept these small gifts until I can express my goodwill to you with a more ample and generous gesture. Meanwhile, continue to love me as you have done so far. I also pray for you to have the most prosperous years and every blessing from the Lord. I will write about other matters at another time; for I do not know when you will receive this. I have entrusted them to the steward of KÃ¼ngsfeld, who will send them to you when he can. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Steiger, Diesbach, Gravenriet, Manuel, and especially your Zehender send their regards. Bern, November 12, 1566. </p>
      <p> Johannes Haller, always and forever yours. To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my honorable lord and dearest godfather. </p>
