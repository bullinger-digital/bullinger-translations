      <p>Greetings in our solid salvation in Christ. I received your last letter, written on February 17th, with great joy, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, along with a single copy of your sermons on the Last Judgment. You mentioned sending two copies, one of which I was to offer to your consul Fuchs in your name. I am very grateful to you both for the booklet and for the duty of writing, which, despite being occupied with so many and such great affairs and concerns, you never neglect for long. May the Lord abundantly repay you for the countless benefits you have bestowed upon me from the inexhaustible horn of His riches, with great interest. Amen.</p>
      <p>You are not unaware of what has been achieved in the defense of your consensus on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper among certain people here, for whom nothing is sufficient unless it is excessive. I am exceedingly grieved by such irritable tempers, which no dangers or offenses to the churches can deter from continuing as they have begun, so persistently. May the Lord Jesus Christ, the Prince of our solid and eternal peace, bind the hearts of all the ministers of His church with the bonds of His love, so that they may earnestly strive for the things that make for peace! Our incomparable theologian Calvin suffers such envy among many, whom he obscures with his light, that he is beginning to be regarded by them as most heretical and even to be denounced to others, especially because of the booklet on divine predestination he published, in which the most unjust interpreters find some things to attack with affected and elaborate slanders. Meanwhile, he endures everything with great and unbroken spirit, undoubtedly emerging victorious by enduring patiently, yet not abandoning the most honorable defense of the truth.</p>
      <p>We hear of very dangerous disturbances arising in Geneva; however, it has not yet been possible to learn clearly by whom or for what reasons, although I eagerly expect to understand this from friends there at any moment. I do not doubt, however, that you will have more certain information before you receive this letter of mine.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and remember us in your fervent prayers of true faith to our common author of salvation, Christ. Greet your household with all the brothers and friends, especially Rudolf Gwalther, Pellican, Theodor, Wolf, etc. Our people, Consul Fuchs with Jacob the Elder and Funck, your dearest fellow minister, send their respectful greetings to you. Farewell again. June 7, 1555.</p>
      <p>Truly yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Our Σψερτ(linus) writes how fiercely they have twisted and turned in the Passau agreement, so that it is not kept straightforward and pure as it was originally agreed upon: firstly, that it should only apply to the estates and not to the cities and individual persons of nobility or others; also, that it should only extend to all those who adhere to the Augsburg Confession, and then they should help each other to root out and utterly destroy all other sectarians, such as Anabaptists, Schwenkfelders, Zwinglians, etc.; also, that the agreement should only include those who have adhered to the Augsburg Confession up to this time, and not at all those who will join in the future; also, that anyone, for the sake of religion, might leave with wife and children, possessions and goods, from their authority without hindrance; this would be a great disadvantage to the cities, which have nothing but taxes, levies, and hindrances.</p>
      <p>But thank God, when this was sent from Augsburg, the sound part finally decided that before they would accept a disputable, practiced, colored peace, they would rather have none at all. I do not know how it has been handled since then. May the dear God keep us with His faithful, fatherly, and strong hand in grace! One can well sense, among other things, how restless the devil is and what he would like to do against the Confederates who adhere to God's word. May the Lord protect us and keep us in peace fatherly, amen!</p>
      <p>Now someone comes from Augsburg (though I have no writing of it) who says credibly and consistently that the Passau agreement has been established and sealed by the emperor and king. If it is true and is upheld, it is indeed a great and extraordinary act of God's goodness towards ungrateful Germany.</p>
      <p>To the very illustrious servant of Jesus Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, a friend as if his incomparable brother.</p>
