      <p>It is most certain that the envoy of the Governor of Milan, in the name of his prince, the King of Spain, came to the Rhaetians at Chur and requested, in the name of his prince, that a public assembly be convened at the expense of his prince, in which discussions would be held about forming a friendship, neighborhood, and alliance between the Rhaetians and the Duchy of Milan. Thus, a day for the assembly was set and held.</p>
      <p>In that discussion, the Spanish prince promised very splendid things and, in return, requested that the Rhaetians grant him several thousand soldiers for the defense of the Duchy of Milan, when necessary, and also grant passage through Rhaetia from Italy to Belgium and back again to Italy; likewise, if any flee from the Duchy of Milan to the Rhaetians, they should be captured at the governor's request and sent back to Milan. And although there are many other points to this treaty, these, however, have raised not a little suspicion among good men. Therefore, some Rhaetians opposed the king's attempt, and from here, men who love religion and peace wrote to the leaders of Rhaetia, finally wishing to prevent any harm from coming to the German Protestants, urging them to carefully consider what they are doing and to ensure that the treaty they are now making does not conflict with the previously established Helvetic and Gallic treaties, nor should they promise soldiers to the Spaniard, who might someday misuse them not only against the Germans but also against the Rhaetians themselves; for it is not forgotten that in 1525, when the Rhaetians were serving King Francis at Pavia, the Spaniards invaded the Valtellina, which caused the Rhaetians to be recalled, deserting the king, who was captured, and the Swiss army suffered a great defeat.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is also possible now that he might request soldiers, whom he would keep in the Duchy of Milan, meanwhile either by himself or through other allies of the Rhaetians, he might afflict them, and soon draw the sword against them.</p>
      <p>Now, since it is also known that a mutual treaty was arranged by the Cardinal of Lorraine between the Pope, the Spaniard, and the princes of Italy, who have pledged themselves to the defense of the Holy Roman See, and the papists openly trust in the Spanish forces and threaten that he will soon come and bring back the rebels to the obedience of the Holy Roman See, the Rhaetians should be cautious that, while they open the passage to the Spaniards, they do not open a passage against the German evangelicals and eventually even against themselves, especially since those aware of papal matters report for certain that the Roman pontiff will soon send his envoys to the evangelical princes and republics with the acts of the Council of Trent, requesting that they receive them kindly, and... will diligently exhort them not to reject them; but if they continue to be rebellious, they will certainly be deprived of all their privileges, and their territories, bodies, and all their possessions will be subjected to the plunder of all those who wish to invade them, and thus proceed against them according to the decree Ad abolendum, etc. Hence, the more prudent can easily gather that the pope's allies are contemplating the execution of the Council of Trent, and since it is known that the pope is particularly hostile to the evangelical German princes, cities, and Swiss republics, and some whisper that the Bishop of Constance is contemplating something, to restore everything to its former state by bringing all those in Swabia and Switzerland back to obedience, the Rhaetians should be very careful that the Spanish request for passage does not someday lead to the destruction of Germany and Switzerland, and also Rhaetia, etc.</p>
      <p>As a result of these and other warnings, the Rhaetians have responded that they will indeed enter into a treaty, but with all previous agreements and old treaties taking precedence over this new treaty, and then they do not wish to hand over fugitives because of religion, indeed they request that all Rhaetians coming to Milan have their religion free and unpunished, and indeed they will grant the king passage from Belgium to Italy, but not from Italy to Belgium; thus they will also grant soldiers for the defense of the duchy, but with certain conditions, etc. With this moderation of the articles, envoys were sent to the governor in Milan; however, this moderation displeased him so much that he recalled the envoy from Chur to Milan. But as he departed, he left his secretary in Chur and said he would easily persuade the prince to strike a treaty under these conditions, and thus he would soon return to Chur after the Easter holidays. Up to this point, this matter has been brought, which is becoming more and more suspicious to good men, especially since at the recent assembly in Baden, the envoy of the same king proposed articles for forming a treaty with the 13 Cantons, which they accepted for deliberation and will respond at the assembly to be held in Baden in June. But the envoy among the Rhaetians confidently affirmed that the 13 Cantons had already agreed. However, it has been indicated by the letters of some that this is most false.</p>
      <p>May the princes and republics everywhere be wise and beware of the pope's snares.</p>
