      <p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and peace in the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>Do not be surprised, distinguished man of God and my lord, that you have received no letters from me for such a long time; for I have deliberately remained silent for so long, as I could only trouble you with my letters. What could I have written except sad things, which you could only have heard with indignation and anger. Therefore, I thought it better to labor and be anxious alone than to make those like you, especially you, who are burdened with such great concerns for the church of God, participants in my sorrows and tedium. I will not weave a long story for you now, but will only briefly explain the essence of the matter. Camillus, who wishes to be called Renatus (would that he were reborn to God!), has disturbed and almost scattered our church. But the Lord, who frustrates the plans of perverse men, did not allow the evils he had conceived to progress to the point he had intended, but with a merciful hand and help, he came to our aid. For when four visitors sent by the entire synod came to remove the causes of dissensions, all their fury, which Camillus had stirred up and made enemies against me, turned against me alone as the source of all evils, as they said, and they tried to find so many sins, so many errors in my doctrine that it is hardly credible to anyone. For Camillus had collected a heap of one hundred and twenty-five errors (as he thought), not in one month or year, but from the forty-fifth year to that very hour, to which he had prefixed the title: "Errors, absurdities, scandals, contradictions of Augustinus Mainardi from the 45th year onwards," and he had divided it into particular subjects as if into troops, adding a letter at the beginning full of curses and very biting. As for my life or morals, although I am a sinner and worthy of correction in many things, they did not dare (thanks be to God) to make mention. I responded, as I knew how, and alone to those things that were objected to me. They left confused, all who had attacked me.</p>
      <p>Camillus, since he did not know how to respond to those things that were objected to him, nor did he dare to deny that all were true, could not prevent himself from appearing as a heretic. He was forbidden from sacred reading, both private and public. After the departure of the visitors, since he continued in asserting the errors, which he has as many as grains of millet, after the usual fraternal correction and admonitions were made, because he wanted to be obstinate in his own opinion, unwilling to listen to the church, he was excommunicated before the whole congregation on July 6th. He had already gathered a church of some Anabaptists. He cannot be led away from these errors, especially by them: one, because he calls into question the immortality of our souls and truly believes that the human soul dies with the body, but does not dare to affirm it openly; for he sees how odious it is, the other, because he affirms that the baptism, which we all received in the kingdom of the pope, before the truth of the gospel shone upon us, is the baptism of the Antichrist, not true baptism. I omit many things; I do not want to burden you with so many. - Moreover, Lelius wrote to us on your behalf, asking that we send to you a certain Johannes Lucidus Samotheus' "On the Elucidation of Times" purchased from Venice. As soon as I received his letters, I immediately took care to send it to you, which you did not receive much earlier than now, due to many impediments, but especially the plague, which raged in Chur, where, alas! our Blasius, a faithful minister of Christ and dearest brother, died and passed away. There is also a rumor that Lord Comander was seized by that disease, and it is not known whether he is alive or has also passed away. We here in Chiavenna are still free from that contagion, but we are in great fear.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us. Pray for us, man of God, and commend the desolate Chur to your church's prayers. Command, if you wish anything, man of God; we are yours, and all ours are yours.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name the most illustrious men, Lord Pellican, Lord Theodor, and Lord Gwalter, I beg you. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. In Chiavenna, August 4, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Augustinus Maynardus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man of God, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Church of Zürich, his revered lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
