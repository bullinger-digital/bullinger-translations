    <p xml:id="regest1">Cited from a letter by Capito, who wants to hold the Zurichers to their promise to engage in dialogue with the people of Strasbourg, as otherwise the exclusion of the Swiss from the Concord is threatened; the refusal of a meeting would be in no way justifiable. Zwick has repeatedly reported to the people of Strasbourg about Bullinger's assurances. Suggests inviting Bucer and Capito to a convention in Basel to prevent future accusations. Requests a response and the sending of what [Konrad Zwick] left behind.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ.</p>
      <p>From the letter of Capito sent to me at this very hour, I felt compelled to write to you, as I happened to catch this woman just as she was about to leave. "We have asked you," he says, "to ensure that the people of Zurich do not fail in their promise. Now, however, you write that they will stand by their promises and respond to us fairly. But you do not explain what they intend, and whether they wish, as they promised, to meet with other Swiss evangelists to make themselves available to us in Konstanz or Basel. If you had not assured us with hope that you would take care of this, we would have arranged for them to be prepared by another means. For you recognize, Zwick, what harm could arise if the Swiss brothers alone are excluded from that general concord of the churches, especially now, when they have raised such hopes about themselves. When we are asked in that great assembly by the princes and church leaders: 'What about the Swiss church leaders?', what will we answer? Shall we say: 'We left nothing untried to call them together somewhere for every reason, and they had promised to make themselves available, and if they did not, they bound themselves to sacrilege. Yet we could not persuade them by any means, neither by ourselves nor through others, to stand by their promises and allow us to meet somewhere about this cause and examine it in common as before the Lord, and this, when they had written to us long ago, unprovoked by us, that the book written to the Monasterians, learnedly and piously, expressed their mind and bore witness to their spirit,' etc.? We all know that no promises can stand against God, but to deny a meeting so earnestly requested and so often promised cannot be pious, unless we, who request it, are either impious or utterly unfit to deal with the cause of Christ with them. However, we hope that they judge neither of us, and although they may desire many things in us, while they grant us, as we trust, the zeal for Christ, they should indeed be encouraged by that against all that they might fear from our meeting, even by that splendid promise of the Lord Jesus: 'Where two or three are gathered in my name,' etc. [Mt 18, 20]. We now send what true love demands and how easy, indeed eager, the apostles themselves were to make themselves available, to those who bore it, let alone to those who so earnestly sought it. Christ, our salvation, also knows well, Zwick, how sincerely we thirst for the salvation of these churches. Moreover, to speak frankly, we are certain in the Lord, if they would deign to hear us, that we would agree so far that it would bring great momentum to illuminate the glory of the Lord," etc.</p>
      <p>From this, brother, you hear what they want, what they seek, what they urge so often. They may remember what you wrote back to me, namely: "If there is anyone else whom I esteem, to whom I wish well from the heart, whom I embrace or to whom I am well-disposed and favor, it is Bucer, and no ordinary reasons prevented our coming, which otherwise would have been most desired. When he returns from Hesse, let him call us to Konstanz again, but on the condition that the people of Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and St. Gallen are also called, and if we do not come then, let him accuse us of sacrilege," etc. I gave this to be read when he returned, which he stored in his deep mind, now urging the promise, which I also wanted to recall to you here. I realize well, it will not be good to write much in the future when they want to make manuscripts public. What I wrote to them that you would stand by your promises and respond fairly, they have from these words: "I wrote to the people of Zurich what you ask and want to be done. Bullinger replied, telling me to be assured that they would keep what they promised to Capito." I clearly wrote nothing else about your promise. From this, you hear that my response did not satisfy them.</p>
      <p>But they will continue to write and complain without pause, avoiding the meeting, you might and should consider, if you want to have a convention in Basel, whether it is not appropriate to invite Bucer and Capito to you, just so they cannot justly complain and cry out that you do not want to speak with them amicably about the matters. For if you then invite them just as well, nothing would be taken from your opinion. Perhaps they would also become somewhat more cautious from a true colloquy.</p>
      <p>Given in haste - the woman wants to leave - January 10.</p>
      <p>With the next messenger you find, write back and send what the brother recently left with you.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
