    <p xml:id="regest1">Recently wrote to [Kaspar] Megander and asked for the support of the esteemed [Zurich] church to preserve order [in the Neuchâtel unrest], so that the church discipline, established with much effort, would not be destroyed, the implementation of which met with resistance from some, as Megander himself could observe [from 1534 to 1537]. Some [such as Claude d'Aliod and Pierre Caroli] were appointed to church service, although not suitable for it, but could be removed again; others [such as Claude de Glant and Alexandre Le Bel] wanted to satisfy their ambition in the church; finally, there is an attempt to destroy the unity [of the clergy] and to abolish the correction of fellow ministers; the opponent [Jean Chaponneau] equates public and private offenses and wants to allow only a silent admonition contrary to the scripture, whereby the individual would be spared to the detriment of the church [see above No. 2022f]. Megander, an expert on this type of people (who, because they have thrown off the yoke of the papacy, now cannot tolerate any regulation), will have already reported to Bullinger and his colleagues upon receiving the letter; if not already done, they should consult on what to do; they have often helped [the people of Neuchâtel], who are grateful for it and wish [the people of Zurich] the blessing of Christ. Greetings to the church servants and teachers.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Recently, I wrote to Megander to request the support of your esteemed church in Zurich to help us maintain discipline among the brothers here, whose authority is of great importance to us, and to ensure that what has been established with much effort does not fall into ruin. I know how difficult it has been to establish some order so that confusion and disorder do not replace the holy assembly, and that everything is done properly. Some, who only wanted to follow their own will, were displeased with the establishment of any order that would compel them to conform, and even more so with the implementation of what had been established, as Megander saw for himself, but as was fitting, he did not want what was good to be hindered by those who protested. There were attempts to undermine what contributed to the edification of the church.</p>
      <p>Some were introduced into the ministry improperly and, aided by the wicked for some time, they lingered, not without damage to the churches. But finally, with Christ's favor, they were expelled more disgracefully than they had entered. Others, driven by ambition, attempted to seize the churches. One could hardly believe that so much could be devised and attempted to open the door of the church to evil. But here too, Christ was with us. Finally, as others attempted various things, it seemed easier to them if correction was removed and admonition silenced, so that those who are kept in office, and proceed as one body, though differing in morals and life, indeed even in doctrine, would be scattered. Therefore, one from our assembly began to oppose: if only he were as vehement and zealous in condemning and eradicating vices as he is in trying to take away from us what is good, which all the French churches observe, so that all brothers are corrected if they sin in such a sacred function, if they act to the ruin of the church and the detriment of the word. This adversary of ours, making no distinction between the public and private person, between secret and open sin, between the ruin of one and many, opposes us to the detriment of many, and while he twists scripture wrongly, he is injurious not only to us but also to the apostles, indeed even to Christ himself, while he allows no correction to be pious unless it is secret: here no account will be taken of office, age, power, ruin, or edification, but only of the person, as if in admonishing a minister, the concern should be more for the minister than for the church, and not more for the edification of the church than for the care of one. But such minds must be borne, which wish to look out not for churches but for persons. If indeed this seems so, he will live comfortably there: he is a friend, so let it be. I believe Megander, who knows these men inside and out, who bore the papal yoke reluctantly and now seem to have achieved being above all laws, with the name of those cells of charity, has indicated to you and your colleagues, if the letters have been delivered to him. But if this has not been done, please consider with your fellow ministers what you judge should be done according to Christ. And while we owe much to this church, in what duty have we not been assisted by you? You will add this for Christ's sake, who, as he was the cause of the beginning of all duties and has made us endure until now, so he will make us gratefully wish and pray for the best for you always, and although we can never be equal in returning, yet, as Christ knows, we wish to deserve well of such a church, since it has always deserved so well, indeed excellently, of us. With this settled, we hope to have peace, in which may he who is our peace keep us, both among ourselves and with all, for the edification of all and the progress of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Such, my most learned Bullinger, and with you all who minister in the word and preside over letters. Neuchâtel, 20th December 1544.</p>
      <p>Your entire Farel.</p>
