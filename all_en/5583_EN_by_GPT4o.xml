      <p>S. D. I can hardly express to you how much I am in mourning over the deplorable state of affairs in France.</p>
      <p>The king has sent letters in which he praises the virtues of Guise and the Swiss, whose magnanimity and unbroken strength have defeated, routed, and scattered all the Huguenot forces, even though they were very well-prepared.</p>
      <p>He adds that Prince Condé has been captured and that nothing remains but to destroy the remnants.</p>
      <p>Similar reports are being written to the 7 Cantons by the captains of the Swiss.</p>
      <p>Letters are also being brought from elsewhere: the constable has indeed been captured, but is dead, Andelot is gravely wounded, and the admiral has also fallen; a few have escaped from the flight and reached Orléans, where they are now to be besieged, slaughtered, and soon all who call upon the name of Christ are to be destroyed.</p>
      <p>And although I know how great the insolence of the enemies of Christ is and how often their praises are in vain, your last letters, sent at the end of the past year, which also contained that our forces have been routed, have nevertheless frightened me.</p>
      <p>Now, too, a rumor (though uncertain) spreads that Guise is seeking new soldiers from the 7 Cantons to bring aid to him and the kingdom against the English.</p>
      <p>If this were true, it would appear that our situation is not yet as deplorable as the opposing side boasts.</p>
      <p>You would therefore do a most pleasing thing if you would write to us as the situation truly is, whether fortunately or unfortunately; for we greatly desire to know the truth itself.</p>
      <p>Also indicate whether you have received the Polish letters with the document of Gregor Paul, and what you think should be answered to them; for I sent those letters to you a month ago, which I also wish to be returned to me.</p>
      <p>I hurried, for I have not yet shared them with others. By the grace of God, I have completed the response given to Brentius; when it is printed, I will send you a copy.</p>
      <p>I wrote this hastily because I found someone who is now about to depart directly for Bern and is already leaving.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Jonville and the other brothers; ours greet you together with all yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother, and love us always in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 15, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed and dearest lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
