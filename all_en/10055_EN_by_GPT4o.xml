      <p>To Ambrosius Blarer, the most faithful doctor of the holy church of Constance, Heinrich Bullinger wishes grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I wrote, dearest brother, several years ago, through private exercise, some things in imitation of Lactantius on the origin of error and the one true supreme God, His providence and worship, also on many false gods and superstition, to which I have now returned and revised some things, after seeing that our efforts were not entirely displeasing to the faithful from the origin of the masses. And I did this all the more willingly, as the papists frequently impose upon us the sacred and long-observed religion of past centuries, so that they may be refuted by the calculation of times and the authority of those writers in whom the most foolish place their trust. For if they were wise, it would have been more than enough to have disputed against the most vain superstition long ago, even from the oracles of the prophets and apostles, so that they would not need our instruction at all. But the wretched either cast doubt on the sacred or the envious attribute corruption, and finally they flee to the so-called catholic and most ancient rites of the church as to a sacred anchor. Yet in this matter, they sin no less than when they twist, tear, and utterly trample upon the very words of the Lord God, since the sacred church of the faithful has never worshipped saints, nor had images, nor been initiated into those rites and ceremonies, by which they meanwhile wish to appear entirely Christian. This we will clearly demonstrate in this little work of ours to the glory and praise of the God of heaven and our Lord Jesus Christ, who, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, will reign as the one and only true God forever, amen. This effort of ours, now indeed recognized after almost five years, but certainly begun in the very ardor of youth with a burning spirit for God, I dedicate to you alone, sweetest Ambrosius, so that you may have it as a worthy token of friendship and fellowship, a little work, namely, by which we defend the glory of the one God and our Lord Jesus Christ, through whose ineffable love we have come together in Christian fellowship; for you are not one who needs our instruction, being yourself most learned in the highest matters and to be admired equally for your faithfulness and courage in vindicating the glory of God, as is also testified by the most constant church of Constance, most renowned for its faith, patience, purity, and love. And now farewell, and as you do, teach piety and love us, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>From Kappel am Albis, the fourth of June, in the year of the world's redemption 1528.</p>
