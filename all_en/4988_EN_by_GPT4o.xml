      <p>S. Today, my lord received news from the court in France of the following content: On the 5th of this month, the discussion began in Pontoise, a small town not far from Saint-Germain near Paris. Firstly, the Duke of Guise was appointed to protect everyone from injustice and to defend the colloquium. He also received the preachers very amicably and offered them all good things, to the extent that he promised them that harm would befall his own body before he would allow any harm to come to them.</p>
      <p>The words are good, but the state of the heart is known to Him who knows all hearts. Accordingly, a selection of the faithful was made, and 12 preachers were appointed for the discussion, among whom the most prominent was Mr. Beza. They were escorted from Saint-Germain to Pontoise by the Duke of Guise, where the place for the discussion was arranged in a distinguished women's monastery. There, a throne was made for the king, upon which he sat; to his right stood the King of Navarre and other princes after him, on the other side the king's mother and after her the cardinals of Lorraine, of Tournon, and others. The preachers were given a seat opposite the king.</p>
      <p>Between the old queen and the cardinals stood the Sorbonne theologians from Paris and a remarkably large crowd of people from all walks of life. When the preachers entered, Beza, after making his reverence, began to briefly explain why they appeared there, whereupon they all knelt down and prayed aloud, asking God to send His spirit and grace to this action. After the prayer, they stood up again, and Beza delivered a beautiful oration, in which he briefly touched upon all the contentious articles, and when he finally came to the article on the presence of Christ in the sacrament and said, among other things, that they were as far apart as heaven and earth, the Sorbonne theologians began to knock, shuffle, and murmur, so that no one could hear anything more, which displeased the old queen and likewise the cardinal of Lorraine, and they were ordered to listen quietly; they would be heard willingly later. Thereupon Beza concluded his oration with such composure and courage that everyone was amazed; after this, they knelt down and prayed again. The cardinals, while he spoke, stood with uncovered heads, and both times, while they prayed, the old queen knelt down and prayed with them; the king, however, remained seated.</p>
      <p>After Beza's oration, the cardinal of Tournon began to speak on behalf of the theologians and strongly admonished the king to remember the honor of his ancestors and that he bore the name of the most Christian king, and therefore should not be led away by any speech from the true Christian faith of his forefathers, also indicating much of what would follow from it, and carried on so long that the old queen interrupted him and said: "Sir, it is not about that now, but that we bring forth from the pure word of God, which should be our only rule, what is right or wrong; for we are here to hear both sides and to thoroughly consider the matters ourselves. Therefore, respond to the speech you heard from Mr. Beza." To which he replied that the speech was long, and therefore they could not respond to everything; they requested, however, that the articles be given to them in writing; then they would give their appropriate response.</p>
      <p>This was granted to them, and thus this act was concluded. What they answered and what followed further is not yet known; but it will be heard soon. There is no mention of Mr. Martyr; for he could not yet have arrived at that time. This news only reached my lord today; otherwise, I would have written it to you with yesterday's messenger, who also only left today. With this, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Greet my lord commonly along with all yours. Given in Bern on the 25th of September 1561. Your willing Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>This news was written to my lord by Mr. de Monceaux, who is a Briton, but has lived behind my lord for some time and still has a dominion behind him, who is now at the court. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger, his dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
