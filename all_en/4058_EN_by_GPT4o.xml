      <p>Greetings. I received your two letters, dearest godfather; those which you addressed to Mr. Gessner, I made sure to deliver to him immediately. I have nothing to write now, except that those who come from France report for certain that the persecution, through the work and instigation of the Guise family and the anointed ones with the cursed chrism, the mark of the beast, is progressing. The Lord, who has powerfully restrained the king, can also dispel and turn that unfortunate little bird into flight through some hawk. I am now fully occupied with writing letters and sending them to Frankfurt, so that they may be carried to friends in various nations. I am sending you and Mr. Gallicius our recently published Sermons on Jeremiah. I believe I have sent you and Gallicius our catechism; if I have not, I will still send it. Kindly accept these from me.</p>
      <p>If I otherwise gladly gave gifts, I would not have it; also consider that they are a strange and for you a suitable gift. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet the consuls, Philipp, etc.</p>
      <p>Commend me to the legate and greet him most amicably; I will write to him if I receive anything worth mentioning from the fair.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 25th of August, in the year 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>On the 20th of August, Ferdinand departed for Vienna after the conclusion of the Diet at Augsburg.</p>
