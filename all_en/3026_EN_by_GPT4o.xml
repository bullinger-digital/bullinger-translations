      <p>After sealing the letters, our noble prefect, a doctor of law and lover of piety, returned from Frankfurt am Main, having completed the prince's mission, and brought back this news, etc. The ministers of the church in Frankfurt had a rather serious debate about free will and predestination, but they could not reach an agreement. It seems likely to me that the French church there contended with the German one. Margrave Albrecht is lying mortally ill in Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>Doctor Marckbach from Strasbourg visits the Palatine churches and dismisses all the so-called Zwinglian heretics, being an imperious man, and he threatens us. But we regard his threats and his concord equally, etc. There is a certain chancellor of Margrave Albrecht, Peter Osiander, who writes against Sleidan. Some bishops of Mainz held a meeting; what was done is unknown.</p>
      <p>The people of Strasbourg are trying to send away their priests; for the years for which they made a pact with the bishop are now ending. If this happens, we will say the camel has danced.</p>
      <p>Blessed Gerung, the preacher of Thomas, met me yesterday; he is taking his relative with him to Strasbourg, who has lived until now by begging; I have often advised him, etc. He does not agree with all the ministers.</p>
      <p>Thus, everyone abounds in their own opinion.</p>
      <p>Erb.</p>
