    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Vadian was informed by Johannes Stumpf's letter about the problem with Ägidius Tschudi. So now, people who have proven to be anything but helpful should be spared! Vadian believes he knows that Tschudi is a paternal cousin of the Abbot [Georg Tschudi] of Kreuzlingen, with whom he has a brotherly relationship. Additionally, since the time he was the [abbatial St. Gall] bailiff of Rorschach, he has been very friendly with Abbot [Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee] of St. Gallen. Consequently, he has long been granted access to all the premises of this abbey, and thus he was allowed to inspect their library as well as the depository located in Wil more than once. He was also permitted to use the library of the monastery of Pfäfers. In this way, he has long been able to view all the medieval sources of these monasteries with the permission of their abbots! He naturally has a great interest in history in general (if only he would show this for the Holy Scripture as well!), even though he wishes that others besides him would devote themselves to the Middle Ages. He has always treated Vadian kindly and repeatedly assured him of his helpfulness, so he probably would not refuse him if he were to advocate for Stumpf or any other person now. However, Vadian thinks it would be better (Bullinger should not be annoyed about this) if Stumpf himself were to write to Tschudi. Therefore, he encloses a draft of a possible response for Stumpf, with which he will certainly succeed in appeasing Tschudi's anger. For through such a letter, Tschudi will probably understand what Stumpf would be capable of if he (Tschudi) expressed his displeasure with the pen instead of exercising restraint. But if someone other than Stumpf were to write to him, he might be led to think that [the Protestants] had become fearful and embarrassed, and he might even hope for who knows what from a polemic. Stumpf prevents this by following Vadian's advice.</p>

      <p> Greetings. From Stumpf's letters, I have understood everything regarding the issue with the Scudo. Thus, we are sometimes inclined to be lenient towards those to whom we are bound by their constant services! The Abbot of Kreuzlingen, his brother, I believe, is a paternal cousin. However, our Abbot, since the time he served as the bailiff of Rorschach, has become very friendly. He has long been admitted to all the inner sanctums of the St. Gallen monastery, having examined and explored the library more than once, and has been a diligent inspector of the ancient documents stored in a certain repository in Wil, as well as in the monastery of Pfäfers, where he has long seen whatever could be considered of medieval antiquity, with the great favor of the abbots. He is a man naturally devoted to all antiquity, as you know (and I would indeed wish him to be as learned in the Holy Scriptures as he is thoroughly in the profane ones!), but he prefers that labor to be others' rather than his own. He has shown exceptional goodwill towards me. Often making great promises, so that I do not doubt that he would not unwillingly admit me acting in the name of Stumpf or any others. However, with your permission, I would say it seems far more advisable to me that Stumpf himself undertakes the matter, to whom I submit a draft, which if he uses, I would not doubt that he will greatly reduce the ardor of that ill-affected temper. For he will see what Stumpf could have done if he had indulged in writing and not rather, for his humanity, chosen to restrain himself within moderation. If another were to write, he might conceive hope from our fear and broken spirits and promise himself something from some faction; which Stumpf will abundantly avert if he complies with my advice. </p>
