      <p>Greetings and best wishes. The day before yesterday, a certain merchant delivered to me a packet containing two letters from Mr. Georg Laetus, one addressed to you and the other to me, along with an attached booklet. This booklet contains a wonderfully described story of a certain learned man in despair, translated either from a Latin or Italian original, as the elegance of the style and the clever and concise sequence of the narrative easily prove. I congratulate the city of Padua, which nurtures such learned and pious men, so skilled in the pure doctrine of Christ, with Mr. Vergerio, the bishop, leading them all. The book is indeed worthy of being printed, as it could deter many from wavering in their profession of the gospel during this storm of persecution with its horrible example, and encourage many more to face death rather than renounce the truth. The weakness of human flesh is more inclined to fear and fall when life is at stake, no matter how forcefully it is struck, and it is not without reason that martyrdom is so highly commended by the proclamations of all churches. For there are few who persist with fearless minds through tortures and torments that end in death, and there is no surer proof of manly faith than the willingness to die for Christ.</p>
      <p>You will read the booklet and share it with the brothers (if it has not been seen by you before), and then, when you wish, return it. I wanted to send along the letters written to me by Laetus, so that you might understand the spirit he holds towards you and how much he respects you. Indeed, there was a certain clause in Haller's letters about Laetus's wickedness, revealed by Schertlin's son, to which I do not know how much credence should be given. I have never seen Laetus nor have I ever learned from anyone what kind of person he is. I favor him for this one reason, that he is not unlearned, but more so because it is known that he is exiled for the sake of piety. Farewell.</p>
