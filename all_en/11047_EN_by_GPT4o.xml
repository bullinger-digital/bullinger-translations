      <p>My friendly, very willing service beforehand, dear lord and friend.</p>
      <p>If (Since) Master Simon Grynaeus from Basel, my good lord and friend, sent you a booklet along with writings from me, which happened a long time ago, I assure myself therefore my very friendly and trusting request according to the same writing and desire, to inform me of your opinion (thoughts) on this matter. For if I could earn your favor and knowledge, I would be willing.</p>
