    <p xml:id="regest1">How can Frölich match the conscientious correspondent Bullinger? He neither wants to write something meaningless nor remain silent out of negligence, although silence would be possible due to the many state affairs; yet, he gladly breaks his silence towards his friend Bullinger. - To the great joy of Frölich and the [Augsburg] council, Johannes Haller has arrived accompanied by [Hans] [W]ilpert [Zoller] and Huldrych Zwingli [the Younger]. They were received most kindly. They dined with the mayors [Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser] and were shown the armory and the library. - Haller will stay with Frölich until his employment is finally settled. He should not be sent to Kaufbeuren or any other place. He belongs in Augsburg, where he should remain as a sign of friendship with the people of Zurich! Frölich will stand by him at all times. - The [Augsburg] council has paid for the accommodation of [Zwingli the Younger and Zoller] and also covered the travel expenses of the latter; Frölich will take care of those of Haller. - Frölich also believes that the [Protestants] in their proceedings with [Duke Heinrich of] Brunswick should be careful not to bring upon themselves a similar punishment as Ahab and Abimelech. However, Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] will know how to deal with victory and revenge, even if [Heinrich] is not executed but sentenced to life imprisonment, as imperial law distinguishes between [nobles] and persons of lower status. - The [Brunswick] war is over, as Frölich had briefly reported in a letter [No. 2285], which hopefully was delivered to Bullinger from Constance. Since then, Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] has moved on and persuaded Duke [Franz I of Saxony-]Lauenburg and the Counts of Oldenburg and Schaumburg to submit. He has also captured the strongly fortified castle of Count [Otto IV] of Rietberg, similar to Wolfenbüttel. In Frankfurt, the future [of the Schmalkaldic League] will be discussed. - Greetings to [Hans Rudolf] Lavater, city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], and the scholars. Bullinger will receive a gift.</p>

      <p>S. To your abundant, pious, and diligent letters, Heinrich, dearer to me than life itself, I truly do not know what to respond; for to write nothing at all would be negligence, but to produce something torn and inept would be stupidity, although in these days, due to excessive occupations in the affairs of the republic, there would be ample reason for silence. But what sleep could be so sweet, so necessary, that it should not be broken for the sake of a unique and excellent friend?</p>
      <p>Lord Johannes Haller has arrived here, accompanied by Hilbert, a patrician of Zurich, and Ulrich Zwingli! Good God, with what alacrity and how much joy did he fill my heart, indeed, the entire Augsburg council! We have therefore tried to treat them kindly. We dined in the houses of our consuls. We saw the armory and the library as well. There were still very splendid buildings to be visited. But indeed, my occupations prevented me from making time for this. I hope these excellent men will consider these small gestures kindly. Lord Haller will stay in my house and share my table until a permanent residence and position are designated for him.</p>
      <p>He will not be sent to Kaufbeuren or other barbarians. For why should he, who was given to us out of singular friendship and sought after so much, be shared with others? Haller will be ours! Ours, I say, as a perpetual pledge of friendship between the people of Zurich and Augsburg. Nor should you doubt that he will receive from our people the rewards worthy of his labors and virtues. Indeed, as much as my modest means allow, I will never fail him.</p>
      <p>The expenses incurred by Haller's companions here in the inn were paid by our magistrate. He also gave your knight an honorarium and travel allowance, with which he can live on his return to you. As for Haller's travel expenses, I will sponsor them in due time.</p>
      <p>You think wisely and piously about what should be done with the captured tyrant of Brunswick, so that we do not fall into the punishment of Ahab and Abimelech. Nor do I think the Landgrave is so foolish as not to know how to use victory and take revenge on the enemy.</p>
      <p>However, I predict that the tyrant himself will not be executed but condemned to perpetual imprisonment, which, by the force of the laws, is considered in place of the death penalty. For the imperial law makes a distinction between illustrious persons and those born in a humble place.</p>
      <p>I hope, however, that he will be a perpetual example to those like him. The war has come to an end. I recently wrote to you the true basis (facts), albeit briefly, with good hope that it has reached you from Constance. Since then, my gracious lord, the Landgrave, has moved further. He has compelled the Duke of Lauenburg, the Counts of Oldenburg, and the Counts of Schaumburg to make peace with us and sign agreements. He has also advanced to the Count of Rietberg's castle, which is as fortified as Wolfenbüttel. They have surrendered it to him, so that everyone is returning home. In Frankfurt on December 6th, it will be discussed what further actions will be taken.</p>
      <p>Greet for me Mr. Mayor Lavater, Mr. City Clerk, and all my kind scholarly lords. A memento will come to you in due time.</p>
      <p>In haste, November 20, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely and sincerely, G. Laetus, etc. Chief Scribe of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man in virtues and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant ecclesiast, friend and brother, etc. in Zurich.</p>
