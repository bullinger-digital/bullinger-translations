    <p xml:id="regest1">[Heinrich] Stapfer is allowed to stay with [Leonhard] Hospinian, although the accusations against him were not unfounded. Bullinger dismisses doubts about the loyalty of the Zurichers to the confederation, but like the envoy [Hans Edlibach], he wishes for a peaceful resolution [of the Arsent trade]; he has also written to Mayor [Jakob Meyer] in this regard. The division of the Bernese church shows that Bucer insists ruthlessly on the adoption of his doctrine, while Luther, who hopefully does not approve of this, remains silent. Megander returns to Zurich; Myconius will already be aware of the new version of the [Megander's] catechism.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>It has been done, esteemed Myconius, as you ordered, with the boy Stapfer; he is not forced to return to Karlstadt, he will stay with Hospinian. However, the points of accusation brought to us, although quite serious, were not entirely unfounded and fabricated. The matter will go well if he continues in the study and diligence he promised us. I beg you by the Lord, that you also have him recommended to your care.</p>
      <p>Regarding those who are beyond the Elbe mountain, they have reported the most unfounded things, whoever said they were barely restrained from running to you. I wonder who spreads such rumors, as I do not doubt they have dreamed nothing of the sort. Certainly, they favor the Basel people excellently as the rest of the Zurichers. I do not care what the suspicions of many ominously predict about the Zurichers. I firmly believe that if it must ever be and one experiences the seriousness that it cannot be otherwise, I hope Zurich will act as it should and its honor before God and the world will be preserved. Those who reluctantly descend into the arena and are little irritable, add: and are sparing with promises, usually remain more implacable and are more generous in fulfilling them. Believe me, the commitment of ours towards yours is intact.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, they will seek fair conditions to the very end, by which they can prevent war, nor can I condemn this. It is easier to disturb the quiet than to pacify the disturbed. I say nothing now about the envoy, who, like the others, fears war. I also fear, especially since I know what we are like. I pray to the Lord that he avenges that injury in another way, which can happen if yours are steadfast, prudent, and pious. What I hope from ours, I have said; I have promised nothing either now or in previous letters. Nor should I or can I promise anything. I clearly see it is dangerous to write letters about such matters. But so far to friends. I also gave some of this to the consul the day before.</p>
      <p>As for what I hope for regarding concord, there is nothing to write. However, I see the illustrious Bernese church, torn by Bucer's excessive zeal, in great danger. No concord is to be hoped for unless we approve everything of Bucer and accept his ways of speaking. I now remember his post-festival, which you once wrote that we would soon have more trouble with Bucer than with Luther. However, I hope Luther does not approve of Bucer's zeal. It is not enough to have said: "The minister gives the sacrament of the Lord's body to the one who asks," which the ancients said, unless we speak thus: "The minister with the sign presents to you the body of Christ." We are not heard saying: "The body of Christ sits at the right hand, the whole efficacy of Christ is received by faith in the supper"; it is necessary to say: "The whole Christ is in the supper, God and man, but in a heavenly manner and invisibly." Meanwhile, the Basel confession is pretended; but what sense they give to it, I do not know, as new words are so often poured out. Luther writes nothing, nothing is answered to us about ours; we are neglected. Meanwhile, Bucer continually tests our churches with new plans.</p>
      <p>Megander will come to Zurich, leaving Bern. You are not unaware of what has been changed in the catechism. May the Lord protect his own and his truth!</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and greet with my words Mr. Grynaeus, the most esteemed lord, and the others. January 23, 1538.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed lord and brother, Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant overseer of the Basel church.</p>
