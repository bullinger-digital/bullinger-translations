      <p>Your letter, reverend father in Christ, was delivered to me on the fourth of this month around lunchtime; therefore, I could not copy the German version now; I will send it back in 8 days, if I live, and I ask you to consider this delay favorably in the meantime. I was very pleased to hear about the state of the Scottish kingdom.</p>
      <p>I wish Froschauer had brought with him copies of the Apology of the Council of Trent against me; certainly, the book is already in the hands of the adversaries, and Balinget, when he was in Feldkirch, inspected it, but he could not wrest it from the hands of the one who had it.</p>
      <p>He copied the title, which is as follows: Apology of the Indiction of the Council of Trent made by Pius IV, the supreme pontiff, against Johannes Fabricius Montanus, authored by Caspar Cardillo Villalpando, a Spaniard from Segovia, doctor of theology.</p>
      <p>Therefore, reverend father, I earnestly and respectfully ask you to procure this Apology for me from Froschauer.</p>
      <p>But I hear that an Italian has also written against me. I wish I could have had it now during these autumn holidays; for afterwards, the burden of sermons and market business will occupy me.</p>
      <p>I did not know that the Englishman Smith was still alive.</p>
      <p>The bishop of Constance, Cardinal of Ems, a priest, a man not unlearned, passed through here, who, after a friendly discussion about religion, gave me as a gift a booklet by Smith, printed this year in Cologne.</p>
      <p>The title is about the baptism of infants against John Calvin and about the works of supererogation and the merit of the death of Christ against the same Calvin and his disciples.</p>
      <p>There is frequent mention of Bullinger, Zwingli, and Musculus in that booklet.</p>
      <p>I assume you have had the book for a long time.</p>
      <p>I glanced at some things; the writer seems to have no brains, most are rotten and sewn together from pure lies.</p>
      <p>I rewarded this priest with my speech about the council, as he, among other things, inquired from me the reason why we avoided the Council of Trent.</p>
      <p>About the council, nothing here, he came from Rome, he narrated the French affairs corruptly and falsely, as they are commonly spread in Rome.</p>
      <p>What was written to Martinengo about the Kingdom of Naples and the band of robbers, he affirmed to be true and even named the king voluntarily.</p>
      <p>He added that the Florentine soldier is being forced to send someone in the name of Philip against the robbers; the same is written in Bellinzona.</p>
      <p>But we have nothing yet about the council; I know Martinengo, if he is well, will not fail in his duty; I will write again to Martinengo.</p>
      <p>About Pergula, I have been able to get nothing for a long time; but neither has Julius, the minister of that jurisdiction, for a long time; I cannot wonder enough.</p>
      <p>What happened in Venice with the assassins of Count Bergamo, who was killed a few months ago by a gunshot in the temple, you will understand from the attached note.</p>
      <p>For certain, it is written from Venice to Balinget (I inspected the letters myself) that a large part of Constantinople collapsed due to an earthquake, two-thirds are said to have fallen, and the Turk is lying mortally ill (I do not know whether from the horror of this earthquake). These are the things we have now.</p>
      <p>The plague is said to have settled in a wilderness in Prättigau, called Tschuders, and is working considerably; otherwise, no one dies of this disease in Pünten, as far as I know; for in Malans and Zizers, where it once set in, it has subsided again.</p>
      <p>I hardly believe that it will jump over to us in Chur; but it is miserable to hear what unfriendliness is shown in these lands towards those to whom this plague comes to house and yard, etc.</p>
      <p>If I have anything about the council, I will not fail to inform you. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>I pray to God that He may preserve you safe and surviving for a long time for His church and our common fatherland.</p>
      <p>Chur, October 4, 1563.</p>
      <p>I have read the Glarus acts, as they were written to our people, in full.</p>
      <p>Balinget gave the complete history, indeed in Italian, but you have Julius and others who can translate it; it is especially memorable.</p>
      <p>There is no need for you to send it back.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Heinrich Bullinger, reverend Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and honorable father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
