      <p>Cracow, 16th February 1558.</p>
      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I am certain, my esteemed lord and friend, that you eagerly await my letters, through which you can be informed of my whereabouts and the purpose of my endeavors. Here in Cracow, I am attempting to introduce the art to those who brew beer, of whom there are at least five hundred. However, I have been hindered by a privilege, which I am expecting daily from Vilnius.</p>
      <p>For although the royal majesty has granted it to me, it could not be signed by the royal hand and sealed with the seal of the kingdom in my presence. For the day after the privilege was granted, he departed for hunting and does not intend to return before Lent.</p>
      <p>It seemed more advisable to me to travel to Cracow and to test what future hope there might be for the art here, rather than to spend all this time in idleness in Vilnius. Thus, I find some here who oppose and do not consider it possible, and others who eagerly desire to experience the art. The only impediment is the delay of the privilege.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I expect it daily: for immediately after my departure, the royal majesty was returning to celebrate the funeral of his deceased mother, and I entrusted my business to be faithfully completed; namely to Mr. John Mantzinsky, a noble Pole and secretary of the Palatine of Vilnius.</p>
      <p>He promised to diligently ensure that as soon as the royal majesty returned, it would be signed and sealed with his hand and the seal of the kingdom. This Mantzinsky studied good letters in Zurich in the year 47, which gave me hope for his faithfulness and diligence. He knows Mr. Theodor and your kindness well: and sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>And so much for my affairs thus far.</p>
      <p>The word of God and the gospel of Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, are taking deeper roots day by day. Nor do I hear of any learned person who does not abhor the errors of Luther.</p>
      <p>Mr. John a Lasco works fervently in the vineyard of the Lord; and nothing is more emphasized than the purity of the Lord's Supper. They have their assemblies and sacred sermons, but in the houses of the nobles.</p>
      <p>I have seen no purified temple, except in Pinchów alone, where the word of God first took root. For the brave hero of Pinchów, Nicholas Olyeßniczkius, certainly worthy of great praise, was the first to oppose the antichrist and the papists.</p>
      <p>The Palatine of Vilnius has sacred sermons, baptism, and the Lord's Supper in his house, to which many citizens of Vilnius come. He alone among the princes of Poland bears the heat and labors of the Lord's vineyard.</p>
      <p>However, he is ill-reputed for patronizing the Jews, from whom he allows himself to be corrupted by gifts, as they say. If this is true, it will certainly cause no small scandal to the word of God.</p>
      <p>Would that he could be admonished, so that he might be able to consult for himself and the gospel of Jesus Christ!</p>
      <p>Much could be written about the Polish and Lithuanian people, their customs and rites, which I defer to my return to you. However, I have decided to add this about their religions.</p>
      <p>In Poland, there are Jews, papists, and evangelicals: in Lithuania, besides these, there are Armenians, Tatars, Russians, Turks, and Muscovites. The Tatars acknowledge God as the creator of heaven and earth, but in addition, they worship the sun, moon, and stars. The faith and religion of the Turks are known to you.</p>
      <p>The Armenians, Russians, and Muscovites have the Greek religion and faith: they recognize the Patriarch of Constantinople as supreme, happier than the papists in that they retain communion under both kinds and the marriage of priests. Also, they perform their sacred rites in no other language than the old Ruthenian.</p>
      <p>They admit painted, not sculpted images in their temples; but with candles affixed, they venerate and adore them just as the papists do. The temple is divided into three parts: the upper, middle, and lower.</p>
      <p>They call the upper part the Holy of Holies, like the Jews: there no one but the priest and deacon enters. In the middle part is the congregation, which is pure from the conjugal duty: in the lower part sit those who have been joined in carnal union that night, who are not allowed to enter the middle of the temple until the priest has led them. They pray standing, and like monks, bowing their heads to the very ground: they sign themselves in the manner of the cross, repeating the words, Gospodi pomiluynaß, which is Kyrie eleison, and they sign and bow themselves abundantly. If anyone mocks their rites, they immediately expel him from the temple and sweep and cleanse the place where he stood.</p>
      <p>They bury their dead with great clamor and lamentation, dressing them in new shoes and clothes; at the head, they place two tankards, either of wine or beer; moreover, they receive letters from the priest and a half groschen from their own; they present the money and letters to St. Peter, so that the gatekeeper of heaven may immediately open the gates for them.</p>
      <p>They admit no sermon, no doctrine, and cling to their rites as tenaciously as the papists. In Muscovy, God has raised another Luther, or rather Zwingli.</p>
      <p>He admonished them of their errors: and for the sake of truth, he was captured and should have been burned, had not the great lord of Muscovy prevented it. For when his accusations were brought to him by his bishops, he did not judge him worthy of death, and ordered that he be released from prison; who, once released, came to Lithuania with other monks who had joined him. He was very kindly received by the Palatine of Vilnius.</p>
      <p>Finally, called by the Duke of the Ruthenians, he promotes the very truth among that nation.</p>
      <p>He published his confession, entirely consonant with our faith in all respects. Someone promised to send it to me, and if he does, I will either bring it to you or send it. We owe the highest thanks to almighty God, who, through his holy spirit, without any human doctrine intervening, has also opened the kingdom of his son and the truth to the Greeks. For he is utterly ignorant of the Latin language, and any other in which it pleased God in our time to reveal his son. These are new things.</p>
      <p>The Tatars invaded Russia a few days ago, and plundered and devastated over five hundred villages and towns. They took captives with infinite booty to the number, it is said, of thirty thousand, men, women, and children. They returned unharmed, and this nation is not moved by this at all.</p>
      <p>On the fourth day of December past, on our journey towards Vilnius, I saw a marvelous sight and form of the sun. Nor did I see it alone, but also my fellow travelers, Mr. Wilhelm Barlow, and Mr. Georgius Niger, son of Franciscus Niger, saw it together. On that day, we left our lodging before three hours. While riding, now towards the south, now towards the west, now towards the north, a great splendor arose in the form of the rising sun, and that from the clouds: for the clouds had covered the sky. Finally, with all the clouds dispelled, the sun rose in a clear and serene sky, which sent rays towards the west like a comet; on either side appeared a column under a dusky hue, except that some splendor shone on them towards the sun in the manner of a rainbow. They ended towards the west in a pyramid, and this sight did not easily vanish; but it lasted firmly for three whole hours. This certainly reminded me of the coming of the son of God, whom I surely hope will come soon. May the Lord grant grace, that we may repent and await him with confidence! Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Your Burcher.</p>
