      <p>Greetings. Deputies from the individual chapters of our German-speaking region have appeared, with representatives from five chapters requesting that the dispute among our preachers be settled, while three urged that the truth revealed and obtained in the Disputation be upheld, and that all preachers be bound by oath to prevent such occurrences in the future. All were dismissed with the response that the Senate, along with the Council of Two Hundred, intends to address this matter and set a date, namely Thursday after St. Andrew's Day, to hear everything related to this issue.</p>
      <p>For this day, the writings of your Senate are also reserved, which have greatly advanced the matter and have considerably unsettled the Bucerites. We will pray to God to grant an outcome worthy of His glory and beneficial to us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, everyone. Sulzer is indignant about Megander's letters. Keep me in your thoughts.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, on the 26th day of November in the year 1544. Entirely yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, primary pastor of the Zurich church, his ever-respected lord and patron.</p>
      <p>Zurich. Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
