      <p>Dear Sir and beloved patron, on the 10th day of July, a message came to us from the princely camp from a distinguished soldier, to whom the princes also gave a recommendation letter, stating that the war is completely settled and that the artillery of the Landgrave, along with 5 companies of soldiers, will be transported and escorted to Strasbourg. However, the princes set out on the 9th day towards Stuttgart. There, the Duke first intends to occupy the land and secure the offices. What he will undertake further, we will surely hear. It is expected that he will then move with some cavalry to Dweil. The report of the peace: The costs incurred will amount to 6 tons of gold for the princes, and the royalists are to return Mumpelgart to the Duke, for which he had borrowed 1 ton and 30 thousand guilders, and furthermore, in this matter, neither party shall seek any claim against the other, nor shall anyone be harmed in matters of faith between them, the parties. If I receive similar or more reports from Dweil, or otherwise, I will send them to you without delay, and may God bless you and your companions. I wish you a spa treatment, though I do not know if I will still be able to bring it or not. God be with you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Stein, 11th of July.</p>
      <p>Your willing Georg Wimpfer.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my gracious, dear patron, to his hands.</p>
