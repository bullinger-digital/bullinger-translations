      <p>Strasbourg, March 3, 1554.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt that the news of the disturbed and afflicted England has reached you, esteemed Bullinger. The cause, beginning, and outcome of this, will be explained to you by the bearer of this letter, whom I urge you to receive kindly; for what you do for him, I consider done for Christ. He is a man as learned as he is pious and religious, now a refugee from the English on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. I pray that you will grant him the honor of your house and hospitality; for he will not stay with you longer than it takes to discuss the controversial questions in religion with the learned. He is quiet, content with very little, so much so that I cannot sufficiently admire his frugality in living. What I write will be confirmed by experience. Nor will he be a burden to you; for he has means by which he can support himself.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he has produced not a few testimonies of his doctrine. There are extant learned and pious sermons, which he delivered before the late king and princes. You, my Bullinger, will learn by experience what kind of man he is, to say nothing of other things. Therefore, I pray, do not let him be deprived of your assistance.</p>
      <p>And, to mention a few things that you will be glad to hear, it is reported that the seditious have slaughtered three hundred priests. At the beginning, they enjoyed good fortune; finally, I hear that their leader was captured.</p>
      <p>Among other things, it is written (though the rumor was uncertain) that the Duke of Suffolk conspired and was with the seditious. I hope this is false. Furthermore, I heard that the queen beheaded Anne, his daughter, along with her husband. I speak of that Anne who was declared queen. However, whatever I hear, I will write. Now forgive the brevity; for this messenger will report everything to you. Farewell. Your son lives and is well by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>You know me.</p>
      <p>To the esteemed friend, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
