      <p>S. The Seven (Septempagici) have proposed to us as follows: firstly, concerning the money of the Emperor, which the consul of Lucerne and Constance brought to the Swiss; they excused themselves strongly, asserting their right against anyone who contradicted. The excuse was accepted, as it freed many minds from fear and evil thoughts. Secondly, whether they also intend to retain the custom of our ancient fathers, by which they render justice to anyone seeking it from the Swiss; for thus they are said to have spoken. This article is interpreted in various ways; I await a resolution. Thirdly, whether they are willing to consent to the council, etc. To the first, the response was: if they show the author of the injury, they will act with him according to the law; they indicated no one except a certain unknown person, who spoke thus at the sign of the Raven. They reserved the remaining articles for common consultation. We must pray that the Lord may deign to be present with His spirit in future consultations.</p>
      <p>Besides these, there are much more cruel things that follow: It is known to me that the Emperor was asked in Lower Germany or in the Netherlands, wherever he was, why he left Swabia without leaving a sufficiently strong garrison, and he replied that the things he was to accomplish in the Netherlands were trivial; once these were settled, he would soon return from where he had left, and would reduce Upper Germany to such a state that it could no longer raise its head; for he would demolish the cities so that none would be walled, would lead colonies, and would have garrisons everywhere ready and perpetual for any movement, which could not be resisted, and in this way would tame the German ferocity, so that in the future the nations, which the Germans have almost disturbed throughout the whole world, would be quiet. Having accomplished these, he would do the same with the Swiss; finally, he would also attack France and reduce it to a province and show in this way what it means to be a good emperor. I cannot doubt this plan; God knows the outcome. Let us beware, which will happen when we have rightly devoted ourselves to the Lord. It is said he is still in Brussels and collecting money, for which reason the people are said to be very restless and are contemplating some sedition; but in the meantime, they are forced to count.</p>
      <p>The French aid has returned from Scotland to France. The English continue in reformation. The wedding at Torgau has been completed, with about a hundred thousand thalers spent by Augustus and his brother Maurice. The princes have strongly advocated for the acceptance of the Interim, but nothing has been done yet. There were 4500 knights there. The Dane has promised much. Maurice and the Brandenburgers are said to be besieging Magdeburg; may the Lord be with them as before. The Saxon cities are languishing.</p>
      <p>Hamburg and Switzerland stand firm, Bremen defends its freedom, still holding the counts Albert of Mansfeld and Oldenburg. The Bishop of Strasbourg repeatedly requests to execute the Emperor's mandate delivered to him, but the people of Strasbourg are waiting, expecting something from μηχαρισ (the machine). May the Lord also be with them.</p>
      <p>The most wretched Cat has indeed ordered his people to establish everything according to the Interim; but no one obeys except Johann Lening, the pastor of Mulsingen, who also tries to persuade others to do the same, a most treacherous apostate, who was also an assistant and supporter of pseudogamy. Dionysius has fled secretly. Many counts and nobles have sought refuge in exile with the Queen of Denmark, in case Maurice attempts anything. Behold again the traitor. The miserable thing is: the King of Denmark has a brother, the Duke of Holstein, who serves at the Emperor's court and for little. If the king were to die, what do you think would happen? Such are our affairs, that if our Lord God were to die, we would all perish.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with yours and the brothers Theodor, Pellican, Gwalther, Otto, etc.</p>
      <p>(A certain good and pious man writes in these words: All mouths cry out that destruction threatens the Swiss, especially because they do not agree among themselves. From Worms, where he has been preaching up to now)</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, Antistes of Zurich, his very venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
