      <p>S. D. For a long time, I have not sent any letters to you, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Since you have been afflicted with a quartan fever for a long time, I did not want to add trouble to trouble; therefore, I wrote nothing, but I have repeatedly sent messages and greetings through friends traveling from here to you. Now, however, since I understand that you have recovered by the grace of the Lord, I am beginning to resume the duty of writing. There is nothing to write about our affairs, as you are not unaware that we are well and living in our former tranquility by the grace of God. We hear that you are also well and progressing in piety, indeed endangered by the restoration of the Duke of Savoy, but hoping for the best in the mercy of the Lord. Just as He was able to overthrow the most powerful King of France, who was plotting great things against the pious, He will also be able to preserve the church of Geneva, even against the will of other powers. However, the Lord must be prayed to, that He may always be with us and keep us from evil.</p>
      <p>We have nothing from Poland at the moment, but from England, the same things that you have also undoubtedly received. What is happening in Saxony will be narrated here by Mr. Maternus Eccilius of Wrocław, who is intimately familiar with the affairs of Wittenberg and also of Philip. I commend this Maternus to your piety; he seems to me to be very good and a lover of piety. The same brought letters from a certain minister in Heidelberg, in which he informs me that a serious contention has been stirred up among the learned about the Lord's Supper, and that Count George of Erbach, who acts in place of the Elector while he is or was with the Emperor in Augsburg, made his confession on this matter before the learned, that he does not believe the bread to be the body of the Lord nor that it is eaten either by the mouth of the body or by the impious, and that most of the learned approved this confession, but that Mr. Tilmann Hesshus singularly opposed it and among other things said that he could not communicate either with Calvin or with Bullinger, to which the Count replied: therefore, if these two men are in heaven, I see that you do not wish to enter heaven out of hatred for them.</p>
      <p>I do not care about your excommunication; truth is more important to me, etc. But our Maternus here will report more copiously on this matter.</p>
      <p>You know that the Diet of Augsburg has ended, and nothing was obtained by our people from the Emperor. On the contrary, he revealed his heart more openly than he has in any previous diets, declaring himself to be of the so-called Catholic religion, and unwilling to change this religion, nor to grant anything contrary to it, much less to be the author of any change by the Catholic estates in their religion. However, he says he wishes to stand by what was once granted at Passau and in the Diet of Augsburg held in the year 1555, etc. The Catholics have obtained permission to expel from their territories the worshippers of the true religion: yet, so that they do not despoil them of their possessions. However, to me, those who are expelled from their homeland, where they could live honorably, seem sufficiently despoiled of their wealth, as they cannot live so elsewhere, or can only do so with great loss. Therefore, the Catholics have obtained more than they have been allowed so far, etc.</p>
      <p>As a result, the evangelical princes have left Augsburg with the most hostile minds. The Emperor departed with the Bavarian on August 21.</p>
      <p>But perhaps you have heard this before.</p>
      <p>The more boldly the prince of this world opposes Christ, the more the strength of Christ prevails in His members. Let us therefore be strong in all dangers, praying to the Lord that He may never forsake us. For thus we will be sufficiently equipped and robust.</p>
      <p>Farewell in this, venerable brother, always esteemed and beloved by me. May the Lord bless you and your family.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name the most esteemed lords and brothers, Mr. Théodore de Bèze, Mr. Pierre Viret, the ministers and other colleagues, as well as our special friends Mr. Jonvill, Mr. Budé, Mr. Normand, Mr. Bade, and others.</p>
      <p>Especially our brothers and colleagues greet you. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 17, 1559.</p>
      <p>Bullinger, yours from the heart.</p>
