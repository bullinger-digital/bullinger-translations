      <p>Greetings in Christ, reverend father. In what state my affairs are, you see from the letters written to your assembly. I have almost despaired of restitution, and I can no longer sustain myself without condition. Now it is the second year that I live at my own expense. There are those who advise me not to urge restitution any longer, but to see if I can have a position with you. Indeed, I would accept any position, if only I were called. Therefore, if you can help me in this matter, which I do not doubt you wish to do for Christ's sake, I ask you to do so.</p>
      <p>I am hindered by the burden of the body, so that I cannot fly here and there and seek a position, nor is it possible for me to seek a position among the Lutherans, much less among the Papists or heretics. Only the Swiss remain, whose churches I can serve without offense to my conscience. If they desert me, I am deserted; if they accept me, I am accepted. Concerning this my petition, I pray that you deliberate with those who have the right to call in your place, and that you write back to me. At the same time, I would also gladly have a copy of the letters which you wrote on my behalf to the elector. Therefore, I earnestly request that you kindly send it to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, who wishes to keep you safe for a long time for His church. Amen.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 8, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Johannes Matth√§us from Schmalkalden, doctor of theology.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety and doctrine, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and brother in Christ.</p>
