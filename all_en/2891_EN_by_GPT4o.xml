      <p>Greetings. I know that our Froschauer will report everything in detail about German affairs, and I have no further information, except that Duke Brutenus is reported to have passed away; however, I have received no information about his successor, who it will be. May the Lord grant such a one who will profess the pure truth concerning the doctrine of justification with holy simplicity and restore that somewhat troubled church to tranquility and peace. The action of the Tugins (people from Zug) disturbs many, and not without reason, as it is unprecedented even among the most cruel persecutors of the name of Christ. But if, as with the Waldensians, it achieves a similar outcome, for a few burned books, there will soon be many others, and in place of the burned ones, from the ashes (...) the Lord will raise others with interest. I wish to be informed about this matter, and as for the efforts of the adversaries of Christ, it is well that they became known in time, with the Lord thus providing, so that no one would be overwhelmed unexpectedly. Our people are indeed seriously vigilant everywhere, but in vain, unless He, who alone can do all things, guards the city. Let us flee to Him with prayers and urge repentance. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 11, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
