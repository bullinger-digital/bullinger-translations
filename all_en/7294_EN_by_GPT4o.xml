      <p>S. D. I am very anxious; for today marks the 14th day since I sent you a letter, in which I included letters from Mr. Johannes Haller and Mr. Erastus written about the Brunner case, and I also replied to yours. I entrusted my letters to be delivered by Johannes Pontisella the Younger; he delivered them to the house of Florian Gerster the butcher (to Fluri Metzger's house, where he was to give them to a man from Chur, who promised to deliver them well). Now you neither mention the letters nor return them, which makes me fear they are lost.</p>
      <p>You know who it was to whom you gave your letters and who usually stays at Fluri Metzger here in Zurich. Inquire and inform me in your next letter, so that the matter can be resolved.</p>
      <p>Please kindly greet Captain Carli for me and truthfully inform him that there are great lies being spread (with permission to report); for Zurich and Bern have forbidden, by honor, life, and property, to join this campaign. Glarus has also forbidden it; Basel did not send anyone in the previous campaign because they did not want to fight against their own beliefs, and now they have not sent anyone either, but have strictly forbidden it. Schaffhausen sent people before, but they want their men back home, and now they are not sending anyone and have also forbidden it.</p>
      <p>This is certain and true. Some from Glarus have run over the prohibition; therefore, there will be a Landsgemeinde (assembly) on Sunday. I cannot write anything certain about Appenzell.</p>
      <p>I have written to my gracious lord of Sax and requested his grace to send the latest news to Captain Carlin, which I have sent to his grace; I hope his grace has done so.</p>
      <p>Last week, those from Bern (as they have scheduled a federal assembly in Baden for November 16) sent my lord the latest news, enclosed and copied here, to which I have added in my own hand what was reported to me late from Geneva. Show this to my lord Captain Carlin, also to my lord mayors, and greet them faithfully.</p>
      <p>Lady Margaretha, Duchess of Parma and Regent of the Netherlands, has sent here an embassy, a nobleman, to negotiate for the passage of her and her people through the Confederation; he is scheduled to go to Baden on the day, waiting here. He publicly stated at the Rüden (where I was also present) before my lord mayor and some of the councilors: the war in France has arisen because the king, persuaded by his people, wanted to hold the Council of Trent in France and that he and some princes have united to force obedience on those who do not accept the council, as otherwise the empire would be badly governed by foreign people, etc.; the nobility has risen with the Prince of Condé. Also, the king has recruited the Duke of Alba for Spaniards. The Duke of Alba does not want to give them; for he needs them himself; but he wants to send 1500 horsemen from the Netherlands. However, the nobility is not very willing to join; they favor the Prince of Condé more, wanting him to win, so that they would also have freedom in the Netherlands from the Spaniards, etc. Yet he cannot know what the response is, which was given to the Duke of Alba only on October 25, before he left. He says, however: if they are already moving, there will be no goodwill from the majority; and if I understood correctly, they should also move to Champagne, freely accompanying the 4000 Swiss. However, I do not say this for certain, etc.</p>
      <p>With this, you have what is currently available here in terms of news. Write diligently what you have.</p>
      <p>Farewell. November 7, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>There is a street rumor here of a great skirmish happening near Paris; involving Swiss and French. May God grant peace and grace.</p>
