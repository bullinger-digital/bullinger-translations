    <p xml:id="regest1">Received a letter from Simon Grynaeus about the problem of church discipline, also read Bullinger's letter to Berchtold Haller from July 6, 1531, as well as the confession of the Bohemian Brethren, and now presents his opinion, which is contrary to Bullinger's: The power of excommunication should not lie with the magistrate, but with the church or an elder council appointed by it. He also expresses concerns about equating the Christian church with the people of the Old Testament. Excommunication should not consist of a governmental punishment, but in the suspension of fellowship, including that of the Lord's Supper. If he, Jud, can no longer serve in the church of Zurich because of this conviction, he is prepared to take up another profession.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ.</p>
      <p>The Church of Christ is not established by the votes of many, dearest Heinrich, when Simon Grynaeus, a learned and pious man, informed me by letter, I gave you his letters to read, as I usually do, so that you might consider with me what should be answered to him in a serious and very difficult matter. I have indeed understood that you were somewhat offended by this opinion, which pleases me greatly, not because Grynaeus or the brothers in Moravia thought so, but because it closely aligns with the sacred scriptures, the example and deed of Christ and the apostles. I am sorry that you are offended, whom I have loved from the heart for several years, now more than ever, and yet I cannot reject what I judge to be true against my conscience. In the meantime, I have read what you wrote to our Berchtold about excommunication and the church, indeed clear, learned, and concise, as all your writings are, but they do not so much oppose our opinion as they also provide support.</p>
      <p>And first, I do not concern myself with the definition of excommunication. What the matter is, is sufficiently clear from the words of Christ and Paul. Nor do those seem to have erred much who called it ecclesiastical censure and discipline, which we today (as well as the church) lack not without the disgrace of faith and Christ. And yet Christ and Paul clearly teach that the Church of Christ has pseudo-Christians and false brothers, who deserve to be excluded, not killed. But here, I think, we agree.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore speak according to your division about whose excommunication it is.</p>
      <p>As for the power of this being given or to be given to the magistrate, what kind it is, I have not yet seen proven by you, at least not firmly. And since the matter of the church and excommunication is almost the same, let us speak of both mixed together.</p>
      <p>I believe excommunication is given to the church by Christ. However, the magistrate and the church are very different things, not indeed so that they can never come together, but by their nature separate and distinct things, if not by scripture, certainly the matter itself cries out. For there was a magistrate when there was not yet the church of Christ. And it was pagan and plainly tyrannical when the apostles gathered the church in Jerusalem and preached repentance in the name of Jesus, indeed it attacked the church as shown sufficiently in Acts 4 [1ff] and 21 [18ff]. Christ teaches that excommunication is given to the church in Matthew 18 [15-18], Paul in 1 Corinthians 5 [1-5]. Now I do not deny, as kingdoms are separate and distinct and each has different offices and duties (for one is over things and bodies: Romans 13 [1-7], 1 Timothy 2 [1-3], 1 Corinthians 6 [1-6], the other over souls), yet both are from God and ministers of God, so it can and sometimes does happen that someone can pass from one camp to the other and be in both at the same time. An example is in Joseph, Nicodemus, the centurion, Demas. For although they held earthly magistracy, they were nevertheless co-opted into the church of Christ. They can and, if possible, should also be taken from the church into the magistracy. Now nothing prevents someone from being in both orders, as is clear from the preceding.</p>
      <p>After this distinction, let us return to excommunication. Excommunication, therefore, is of the church or of the elders, to whom the church entrusts it, who are also called the church because they represent it. That such overseers of the church of Christ existed is sufficiently clear from the letters of the apostles, men elderly, mature, and serious, noted and approved for their innocence of life and morals, as you learnedly cite from Tertullian, whose opinion I greatly approve. They preside over the church in these matters, which pertain to the discipline of morals, finally to correction, to settling controversies and civil causes, which are not capital or otherwise pertain to the magistrate. For these are reserved for the magistrates and rarely occur within the church - because "the law of life and spirit" etc. [Romans 8:2], if they do occur, they are subject to such a law, who reject the yoke of grace. And the church punishes some things, which the magistrate perhaps would hardly consider sins, such as adultery and usury and the like. To them, I say, the church entrusts excommunication, not to the magistrate, unless the magistrate becomes entirely Christian and within the church of Christ. For to entrust excommunication simply to the magistrate, whatever he may be, is nothing else than to betray the kingdom and doctrine of Christ. And you rightly add: "If it is gathered in the name of Christ." But now see, my Heinrich, whether our magistrate, whom I take as an example for the time being, is gathered in the name of Christ. Consider what most of them are like: swine, dogs, enemies of the name of Christ, enemies of piety, enemies of justice and the republic, enemies of the word of God and its ministers, and that openly. If they win by votes, scoundrels, so far from being punished, they are even planted and dare everything with impunity. Therefore remember your words: "Not every assembly is holy." But the holy church of Christ is gathered from the pious and faithful. I call faithful and pious those who at least profess to trust in Christ, do not openly and manifestly contradict in word and deed. The church is spiritual, not because it consists of spirit alone, but because its members are led and governed by the spirit of Christ or certainly ought to be led and governed, in whom the spirit of Christ fights against the flesh and vices. But we have papists, impious, stubborn, obstinate, vile men, mockers, enemies and persecutors of Christ and the gospel in the church, who with mouth, heart, deed, evil arts secretly and openly most shamelessly by force, fraud, sails, oars, hands, feet, night and day do nothing else, meditate, contrive, than to destroy the kingdom of Christ, they freely say they do not believe our gospel, they call the evangelical doctrine heresy and the doctrine of the devil. I am silent about their vices, with which they are soaked. Now fix your eyes on this church and consider its face, whether it deserves to be called the church of Christ, in which such scoundrels are, indeed reign.</p>
      <p>Here, my Heinrich, do not think that I speak these things from emotions or a desire to slander or from hatred of anyone, or because I consider myself holier than others. For I am conscious of my weakness, my impurity, I do not reject them in my mind, I seek their salvation, I ask that they too may come to the knowledge of the truth. But I think it concerns the glory of God, it concerns the glory of Christ, as long as they are such, and that openly, they should neither be admitted into the church of Christ, nor tolerated in it, much less allowed to excommunicate others or preside in the church of Christ or cast votes in church matters, for the church of Christ has nothing in common with these scoundrels, nothing with the impious (I always mean the impious who openly contradict Christ in word and deed; for I know there are also impious in the church, but they are not manifest; they are hidden from us until they reveal themselves), but they are to be rejected, not admitted, but to be regarded as heathens; indeed they were never in the church of Christ. I do not understand that there should be evil in the church in such a way that evil should be in the church, but that they are in the church, that is, they join themselves to the members of the church. Nor can they be comprehended by our judgment, what kind of hypocrites and dissemblers they are. But when they become manifest, they should no longer be tolerated in the church, but excluded, until, overcome by shame, they promise a new life. Then, even if the members of the church sometimes fall sick and fall - "For a righteous man falls seven times and rises again" [Proverbs 24:16] -, yet this does not happen from stubbornness and impiety, but from frailty, they soon recognize their fall, are covered with shame, admit correction and receive discipline, repent and grieve. But if any are so obstinate that after one and another admonition they continue to transgress, for the example of others they are excluded from the church and regarded as heathens - and certainly it is no light matter to be cast out of the church of Christ. I say from the church, not from the city nor from the senate nor from the court or guild, not from the republic. For one can be a citizen or senator who is not in the church of Christ. But if, like the prodigal son, he descends into himself with weeping and signs of repentance and returns and humbly asks for forgiveness, the bosom of the holy mother church should be open to him. Mary Magdalene, Zacchaeus, Matthew, Peter sufficiently show to whom the church of Christ should be open: Those who have indicated by certain and undoubted signs that they are held by the desire for Christ and a better life.</p>
      <p>If indeed the fault is such that it should be punished by public laws (which rarely happens to the pious), he is handed over to the one who bears the sword. For I think excommunication is a milder discipline than to befit the magistrate who bears the sword. And there are some things that can be corrected without the sword, 1 Corinthians 6 [1ff], by the elders of the church. Now if some from the magistrate have seized the word of God and have entered into the fellowship of the church, who prevents them from being accepted into the number of elders to whom excommunication is entrusted?</p>
      <p>But if the entire magistrate has submitted his neck to the yoke of Christ, which I think is more to be wished for than to be obtained, I do not object to him reciprocating and supplementing the church, but not as a magistrate now, but as elders. For the magistrate has a different office and does different things. In this way, the church remains constituted with each kingdom having its jurisdiction safe, intact, and unharmed. The magistrate has his laws, his rights for the republic, which he presides over, and the church has its laws, the word of God, sacraments, exhortation, discipline, excommunication. The tribunes of the people and the courts have their constitutions in contracts, in sales, purchases, the craftsmen have theirs. Each is free in its own, as far as it is not prohibited by the laws of Christ or the magistrate. Those who are outside, outside the church of Christ, however wicked, are not to be despised by those who are in the church nor rejected in mind, but to be pursued with all benevolence, to be drawn to Christ by the example of our life, our innocence, justice, faith, humility, gentleness, tolerance, charity, to be provoked by benefits, to be helped by anxious prayers to God, that they may be converted and live, until God enlightens them with his light, draws them with his spirit, so that they may come together with us into one body. When we obtain this, thanks are to be given to God, whose kingdom is expanded. If we do not obtain it, we will admire and revere the hidden judgment of God, to whom we must leave them. If this method were observed, my Heinrich, the great man of holy memory Zwingli would still be with us, the remaining brothers strong and pious, the republic of Zurich would be safe, the Five Cantons milder and gentler, the church would be purer, more fervent, holier, more constant, all offices and ministries in the church could be handled more worthily, provided and administered, the poor could be cared for more faithfully. Now everything is confused and disturbed. The senate appoints unworthy people to the churches, moves the unlearned and ignorant to bishoprics, defrauds the poor, overlooks crimes. From which consider yourself how much offense is given to the adversaries. In that first church, the apostles appointed curators of the poor to the presbyters, not the magistrate of Jerusalem: Acts 6 [1ff]. Likewise, when a dispute arose about circumcision and foods, the apostles decided, not the senate: Acts 15 [1ff]. Now we depend entirely on them and cannot obtain that what is discussed in synods reaches them. And what we rightly and holily establish, should it proceed less if it displeases them?</p>
      <p>And here I want to resolve at the same time what I still have ambiguous about the church of Christ, namely, that the external church is the same as the Jewish or Israelite (I speak of the external). For that does not seem to me. I have no doubt about the internal. I will give the reason for my doubt. When the apostles preached in Jerusalem, they did not co-opt the Jewish synagogue into the church of Christ, indeed the synagogue excommunicated them, as is in John 9 [22.34]; 16 [2], also in Acts [8,1. 21,27ff and others]. What would have happened if they had indiscriminately counted everyone (like us) into the church of Christ because they had been the people of God. But from Jews and Gentiles they gathered a new church for Christ, the old one having been rejected, and to this all the prophets about the rejection of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles pertain. Moreover, our church fits more with that which was before than with that which was under the law, as can be gathered from the comparisons of the churches which the apostles have: 1 Corinthians 10 [1-4] about baptism, also in [1] Peter [3,21], also Matthew 8 [11]: "They will come and recline with Abraham" etc. And Genesis [6,1-4], where it is said about the sons of God that they desired the daughters of men and took them as wives, sufficiently declares how displeasing to God that mixture of the sons of God and the sons of men is. For there by the sons of God I understand those who, led by the spirit of God, walked innocently before God, by the sons of men, those who, led by the desires of the flesh, lived for the world. But then there was no certain and collected church as later under the Jews and apostles, but they were dispersed, whom Christ came to gather and in this he sent the apostles to collect: John 10 [3f]. Nor do I mean only the Gentiles, but also the Jews, nor does this my opinion conflict with this, that the church has always been and will be one and the same from the beginning of the world to the end, the internal one, not the external. For the external has been varied in wondrous ways according to the time. Moreover, the church of Christ is more perfect, noble, holy, and excellent than all, as it had a more excellent administrator and sponsor, as Paul says. Who, as he is separated from sinners, so it is fitting that this one be clean and pure, purged from all filth.</p>
      <p>"Nor indeed," you say, "are we all Christians who are counted within the church of Christ" etc. If you examine these words exactly and diligently, my Heinrich, they will work more against you than for you. For with the same words I can also truly say: Not all are Christians who are counted within the senate. What then will you do with those who harbor adultery, usury, which you wish to be extinguished, in their bosom and suffer from this disease themselves, which you wish to be healed? - "If you inquire about the exclusion or punishment of him who has sinned, he will fear lest he be strangled by the same noose which he would tie for him." Therefore he will dissemble beautifully. In short: I will use every word by which you strive to take excommunication from the church and hand it over to the magistrate to prove that it should be taken from the magistrate and given to the church. For the more the senators are wise, and at the same time worse, and the more authority they have, the more they harm and strive with more tricks, they suffer from worse diseases than the simple common people. This is not to be feared in the elders of the church and approved men. No proof is needed, since we have not obscure examples of this matter daily. - You also say: "What if one or another from the magistrate degenerates or acts with deceitful plans? Let him be removed from his position and a more sincere one be substituted in his place." Are you serious about this, Heinrich? You see daily good and approved men being cast out of the senate by scoundrels. So far from being able to expel the bad, nor is it allowed to us, perhaps it is not even expedient, to remove the worst from the magistracy. But if anyone from the elders of the church were to act deceitfully, we could change him without difficulty and substitute another in his place. I do not say this, my Heinrich, to despise the magistrate. I have learned to obey all magistrates from the doctrine of Christ and the apostles. But when they are Gentiles or even worse than Gentiles and enemies of the gospel (as we almost see today, for thus our sins deserve), I think it absurd, against the institution of Christ and the apostles, to entrust anything to them, much less excommunication. But I know that we must obey them, even if they are enemies of the gospel, as long as they otherwise rightly perform their office. For this Peter teaches.</p>
      <p>Moreover, about the manner of excommunication, Christ is sufficiently clear in Matthew 18 [15ff] and Paul in 1 Corinthians 5 [1ff]. I also agree with what you think in this matter, except that I do not want the magistrate to be the church. For what the church excommunicates are lesser things than to bring the excluded into danger of life. But if the crime is such, let the magistrate use his sword against him. For the law is not made for the just. That excommunication should be an inseparable companion of the supper, I do not quarrel about this. But this is certain, Christ gave the sacraments to his church. And the bread of thanksgiving is the food of the faithful and those who are in the church of Christ. If anyone now does not belong to the church of Christ (about which enough has been said above) nor has yet been received into it, or if anyone expelled has not yet been reconciled, he is not to be admitted until the church is assured of his repentance and he has been incorporated and united into the church. I am not concerned about the interval or space of time, as long as he comes like the prodigal son, Magdalene, Zacchaeus etc. and is reconciled to the church first. For as long as he is expelled, he should not eat of this bread. Nor do I think this word should be lightly treated: "Let a man examine himself, and then" [1 Corinthians 11:28]. Not that the examination pertains to him alone, but it should also be known to the church by certain signs, to which Christ referred: "Whatever you bind" [Matthew 18:18] and Paul about the reception of the adulterer after repentance.</p>
      <p>Augustine, such a holy and learned man, captured in error for nine years, is not immediately received by the church, however much he sprouted from a holy root, however much he exercised himself in sacred readings. It is such a great thing to be inaugurated into the church of Christ, to become a member of the body of Christ, a dwelling of the Holy Spirit, to be counted among the sheep of the Lord's flock, which are redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ. For however much God knows his own, he always manifests and makes known his own by certain signs to the praise and glory of his name, so that they cannot be obscure, faith shows itself, the light of good works shines in the pious, in the impious again impiety reveals itself, and although sometimes the impious hide themselves among the pious in the church, they nevertheless bear fruit in their time, by which they can be detected, they reveal themselves by their fruits. Therefore I say it is a great thing to be counted in the church of Christ and to be taken into the fellowship of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into the fellowship of the apostles and prophets etc. About which John speaks in that whole epistle, which you have now undertaken to treat. Who in the whole epistle does nothing else but show what is fitting for the members of Christ.</p>
      <p>Nor do I want to make a monastery or Pharisaism out of the church like the Anabaptists, with whom I have never had anything in common, but I abhor them with all my heart, especially those whom I have seen and heard so far, contentious men and plainly scoundrels. But neither do I want there to be in it gray lice and such filth and excrement, which no one would suffer to be numbered among good citizens.</p>
      <p>Therefore, to finally conclude, I ask and beseech you by Christ, our savior, that when you read this disputation about the church, you do not quickly and rashly explode or reject it. Weigh the sacred scripture, carefully compare the doctrine of Christ with the institution of the apostles and the first church. You will see that this does not differ a nail's breadth from it.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I say freely, I cannot think otherwise, unless I want to speak against my conscience (from which crime may God keep me). I know it is written otherwise and has been observed for many centuries both by the ancients and the moderns. But no man's authority should be so great that for his sake the truth is abandoned. Nor do I meanwhile condemn their zeal and labor. I know that all, as many as are zealous for the glory of Christ, have with one consent aimed at this, that they might propagate the kingdom of Christ as widely as possible, but yet meanwhile some have indulged too much in allegories, some in emotions, some in their own age, some in contentions (which cannot be denied). God has used their error for his glory and our confusion and example.</p>
      <p>Someone may perhaps say: This is to disturb the church, this is to introduce schism into the church. I answer with Elijah: He disturbs the church who seeks his own glory, not that of Jesus Christ, who loves and follows his own invention against the institution of God. He divides the church who calls men away from God and draws them after himself, whom he ought to have brought to God, who, conquered by the truth, does not yield, but stubbornly persists.</p>
      <p>Nor do I write these things to rashly and inconsiderately innovate anything, but that, the disease being known, which is the first step to health, remedies and medicines may be considered, so that the body may be repaired in such a way that neither the concussion of the body nor the dissolution of the members may occur. If we have followed the word of the Lord and have knocked with the most ardent prayers, he himself will find and show ways that we may someday have a holy, pure, and Christ-worthy church. Meanwhile, I will not fail you, who are zealous for the glory of God, as far as my smallness allows. Moreover, if this opinion is less approved by you, you are no less dear to me, indeed I will pray to God all the more that he may not allow you to slip anywhere, that he may be with you in all things. And certainly I am sooner about to depart than to plot even a little against you. Each stands by the grace of God. As long as it will not be whole for me to see these things or to consent to them or to minister to the church, I will provide for myself by some honest and honorable work. And I know it will not be to the detriment of my faith, even if I lived among the Saracens. Therefore I will labor in the church of Christ, whatever it may be, until God calls me elsewhere, more willingly doing this if it will be reformed according to the norm of Christ, which I do not doubt will happen as surely as I have faith in Christ. But meanwhile to minister the most sacred body and blood of Jesus Christ to the unworthy and impious, who with mouth, heart, and life contradict Christ, this indeed is what burns me not a little. May God have mercy on us and purge all filth from his church.</p>
      <p>Farewell perpetually. May the Lord direct your course and your ministry to his glory. Consider my poorly arranged prayer (which I should rather call loquacity), my Heinrich, a man eloquent and articulate, kindly. I have not reread it. Pardon the mistakes.</p>
      <p>Reread and consider more diligently the booklet of the brothers in Moravia, and the clearest light will come.</p>
