      <p>Dearly beloved son, I am not very strong; therefore, do not mind that I write briefly, I also have little time. The miserable affair that you have presented to me and asked for advice on how the accused and denounced person should conduct themselves is indeed difficult and distressing for me, and so constituted that I am too inadequate to advise on it. For if I were to advise him to step aside, the disgrace would remain upon him, he would lose his position, and his wife and child would be in disgrace and misery. Then he might find people later or even now who might say,</p>
      <p>"Had the matter come forward, it could have been resolved, as it is not so great in itself," and whatever else people might say. If I were to advise him to stand firm, await the accusation, and prepare to defend himself, etc., but he were then found guilty in the proceedings, as he might suspect, and I had advised him to imprisonment and even more severe consequences, since the articles are not insignificant, then I would have advised him poorly, and people would say he had received bad advice.</p>
      <p>Since the matter is thus constituted, I cannot advise anything; for I point out to him: he knows best whether he is guilty or not; he knows well that a bad matter cannot always be passed over with strong denials, and that God also does not let such evil things go unpunished, etc. If he knows himself to be innocent, he will not let the disgrace remain upon him, etc. If he knows himself to be guilty, he can well think for himself what will follow; therefore, he can give himself the best advice.</p>
      <p>May God have mercy on him and give him comfort and guidance along with improvement in his suffering. May God protect us from all evil. Amen.</p>
