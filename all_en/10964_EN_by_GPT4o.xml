      <p>Show my lord Röist, mayor etc., from me the news: here nothing special, except that some days ago several mercenaries passed through Constance and from the Rhine Valley a man named Rudolf Brocker also has some mercenaries, but few, in Milan for the emperor; in addition, from other places, men are moving towards the prince. Furthermore, Mr. Eck von Reischach, bailiff of Bregenz, has verbally indicated to someone that many travelers intend to go to the emperor in Milan through the Adige Valley. The emperor also has about 20,000 guilders for oats for feeding in the Adige Valley and wherever necessary, etc. There is also a rumor, but I do not know it thoroughly, that Wolf Dietrich von Ems and a man named Schnabel from Bregenz have returned home; they are said to be wounded. A rumor, as if some harm has befallen them; what, that may not be public.</p>

      <p>To my lord Röist etc. To Master H. Bullinger</p>
