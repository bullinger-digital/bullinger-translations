      <p>The character of S. Vogler, as it was, was sufficiently demonstrated by our Theodor Myconius, so you could know everything from him; moreover, the father himself has long since noticed what it is like, so it is superfluous for me to tell you about this after him. However, since you ask again, I will say what I feel: Due to excessive flexibility, it is too uncertain; for just as he can grasp everything almost instantly, he can also settle nowhere, but follows whatever the present impulse of the mind has taken. Therefore, he needs a certain, perpetual, and firm guardian, and he also needs not the exercise of all kinds of new arts, but of certain and more serious ones, through the encounter with which he will learn the uncertainty of the mind, almost as mobile as a reed. Also, this is a fault in him, that he neither believes nor notices the one advising him. Furthermore, I have told the father my judgment on what he should be exercised in most afterwards. I would not suggest a new art; it would be a new matter for deceiving the father.</p>
      <p>But in those studies, in which he has begun well, I would compel him to progress, and here I would prescribe not a different subject, but one and the same, until he understood that he had made progress in it, and at the same time, I would propose daily certain precepts about morals, constancy, faith, and truth to be meditated upon in certain and illustrious examples, and I would equally declare the opposite of those with equally illustrious examples. If this discipline cannot recall and contain him, I would bind him to the plow for a whole two years. These are a few words about him. If only either the father or he who brought him to me, Hospinianus, had told me as much about his character as I now tell you; I could have taken better care of the young man, although he mostly erred in my absence.</p>
      <p>I see that Theodor accepts no benefit from me; what benefit do I say? He even bears no slight indication of a benevolent mind towards him, thus excluding me from every duty of humanity.</p>
      <p>The news that Bucer writes to us from Regensburg, you have here through Myconius. These were brought today. Thus, you can see how much care these men have for the republic.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. You will pray to Leo to write diligently to Besserer of Ulm, Hartman[?], who is gravely ill, and to console the excellent man with letters; this Frecht requests. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>The last of March.</p>
      <p>Your S. Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed brother, Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
