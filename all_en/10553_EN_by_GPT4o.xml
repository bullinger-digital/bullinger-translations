    <p xml:id="regest1">Through Capito, who has returned from Basel, he has learned of Bullinger's apology for his absence from the Constance meeting; he is pleased with the promise of a conversation, but it cannot take place now due to his journey to Swabia. At the upcoming Imperial Diet, the devil's cunning should be countered with biblical teaching, according to which the real communion with Christ is offered through the office of the Church. The statement that Christ's body is not graspable by the senses, but only in the spirit through faith, agrees with the Bible and the Fathers, satisfies the moderate Lutherans, and corresponds in substance to the Zurich Confession [No. 482]; however, it is not sufficiently expressed there that the Lord himself offers himself in the sacrament through the minister. Bucer has explained the relationship between the sign and the signified in his "[Defensio] contra Abrincensem"; misunderstandings can be cleared up by adhering to the words of the Bible and the Fathers. He urges the cultivation of Christian friendship, as he himself has demonstrated through his visit accompanied by [Bartolomeo] Fonzio. Bullinger does not sufficiently show in his writings how much he owes to others who were also taught by the Holy Spirit; Bucer, on the other hand, wants to bring to light the consensus of the Church through the centuries. The world is under the impression of the Church's disunity, instead, joint efforts to protect the truth are needed. Bullinger should study the Fathers, Scholasticism, and Aristotle's Organon to prepare for the defense of Christ's cause at a council - Luther and Philipp [Melanchthon] will hardly be able to do so -; the publication of his [commentaries] is less urgent. The opponents are already arming themselves. The reason for his candid remarks is his concern for the Church. He cannot respond to Bullinger's remarks on the "[Defensio] contra Abrincensem" now. Greetings. Recommends having Konrad [Ge√üner] study with [Simon] Grynaeus.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, esteemed and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Our Capito returned from Basel yesterday and tells me that he sent your letters to me, but the carriage carrying them has not yet arrived. He mentions that in those letters you apologize for not coming to Constance and try to placate me as if I were angry about it. I confess, my dear Bullinger, I was somewhat disturbed that the meeting I had so often and eagerly sought did not take place. But how could I be angry with you, who so sincerely advocate the cause of Christ? Although it pains me more that such slight clouds of certain words prevent you from being recognized by most of the Catholic Church as agreeing, and you think they dissent from you. Moreover, my dear Bullinger, things are well as long as you promise a meeting. If only I had known this a few days earlier! I must return to Swabia sooner than I can now meet with you. You know, my brother, how eagerly Paul visited even brothers across the sea, so that neither speech can equal the mind, nor writings the speech.</p>
      <p>The Imperial Diet is imminent, where we do not doubt the cause of the Eucharist will be discussed. For Satan has been trying to infiltrate through this crack for many years. There we wish to thwart the efforts of the ancient deceiver (the devil), which I do not doubt will happen if we are not reluctant to feel as Scripture teaches and to speak as it usually speaks. Scripture teaches that the true and real communion of Christ, by which we are flesh of his flesh, etc., is offered through the sacraments by the ministry of the Church. And it expresses this in such a form of words that it says the minister forgives sins, regenerates, clothes with Christ, washes away sins, offers the body and blood of the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>However, lest anything impious or absurd be established by these words or at least not sufficiently guarded against, I think it can be achieved with these words: The body of the Lord is not food for the stomach, it is not touched by sense or reason, it can only be perceived and felt by a mind imbued with faith. Thus we agree with Scripture, with the Fathers, with the sense of all the saints, we will approve ourselves to the good, restore authority to ourselves in other matters, and free the Church from this pernicious dissension. In this way, all who preach Christ in the cities of the empire have agreed, it satisfies the principal and better Lutherans. Therefore, nothing remains but for you who teach Christ among the Swiss to agree as well. You agree, as far as the matter itself is concerned, and you also express this sufficiently in the confession. But in this explanation, you reveal that you do not yet recognize that in the administration of the Eucharist, the body of the Lord is said to be offered because it is truly offered by the minister as well, but ministerially. You do not admit that the Lord himself is primarily presented and given here, but through the sacrament and by the minister.</p>
      <p>You want the bread to be called the body of the Lord here because it is a sign of the body. But no one contends that the bread should be called the body, which can only be done abusively, just as it is a misuse if you say: water is Christ or the Holy Spirit, even if Christ and the Holy Spirit are offered in baptism. Two things are given in the sacraments, but one for the sake of the other, the sign for the signified. The principal signified is therefore what the words evoke the mind to, which encompass both the sign and the signified together and lead from the sign to the signified by a solemn synecdoche in all speeches where something invisible is offered through a visible sign. But why do I waste so many poor papers? I have explained these things sufficiently against the Abrincense, as far as the Lord has given me to explain them. The sum is that what we feel the same in general should be deduced into specifics and expressed in the same words, but those used by Scripture and the ancient Church; finally, we should dispel the mists that might be cast upon the simpler ones due to the abuse of these things so long ingrained, with words that can instill no suspicion that we do not attribute to the ministry of the Church and the use of the sacraments as much as Christ the Lord attributes to these things.</p>
      <p>I would like to discuss this matter and many other doctrines extensively with you so that we may solidly conspire in the Lord. For why should it not trouble me in letters and in person not to be greeted otherwise than as Bucer in the cause of the Lord and agreeing, but afterwards different things are spread, and you yourself write to me that you doubt my faith? If profane friendship has open hearts, what should befit the Christian one! For this reason, I had undertaken such a long journey at my own expense when I came to you with Fonzio. There it was fitting to expose everything freely. Excellent brothers, you know it is not possible in the polity of Christ for everyone to be his own, nor will it excuse us that others rage. Often the greatest enemies could conduct war for the Roman Republic in concord, one deferring to the other. What should be rightly required of us?</p>
      <p>I read your writings, my brother, where you explain things that were explained before you not only by the Wittenbergers but also by our own, Oecolampadius, and especially those writers of the greater nations. But there is no mention of these, even where you follow their opinion, nor of the ancients, except very rarely. We could say nothing true in these matters unless the Holy Spirit suggests it. If now he has given it to others before us to propose to the Church, why do we not have this honor for him, the author of all truth, to testify that he has also previously deemed the world worthy of this gift? I too have sinned in this matter in my commentaries on the evangelists, but not so much by will as by necessity; there was no time to survey everything. I am now writing, when there is leisure, on the epistles of Paul. Here I observe more religiously what was not allowed there. In this, I strive to show the consensus of the Church through all ages. Neither the Fathers nor the Scholastics wrote without judgment, as we often contemptuously dismiss both.</p>
      <p>The world feels this and therefore has less faith in us, as it often sees mere calumnies or certainly hallucinations, when we seem to thunder mere oracles. But would it not be better for us to conduct everything with care and diligence so that no one can blame or even oppose them? Indeed, it is another task - to certainly extract the truth from those things that have occupied the world and also to defend it against various appearances of truth - than is commonly believed. We will feel it when it will be necessary to meet. I would like us to be prepared for that. The Spirit is indeed a gift and work, but it never exercises it through the lazy. But what is enough in divine matters, in the business of the salvation of the human race?</p>
      <p>You are highly esteemed by me, my brother, for this reason, that you read the Fathers not without judgment, and that you daily cite them more accurately. You have not touched on Scholasticism due to your age, and in some things, you seem to be lacking that more certain method of demonstration from first principles or those that are consistent with first principles. Therefore, with your talent, your nature, your candor, and finally your clarity in writing, I would greatly wish for Aristotle's Organon to be more diligently examined by you and Scholasticism to be at least once traversed. I consider Luther to have completed his task, although due to the vehemence of his genius, he would not be of much help in a more serious examination of doctrines if there are wicked adversaries. Philipp is in very poor health, and there are no others, either among those who are already famous or those who are emerging, to whom I would dare to entrust the cause of Christ to be defended in a council. I now entirely hope that at some point religion will be publicly discussed. Therefore, I earnestly ask you: Diligently learn the principal controversies, see for yourself what the Scholastics teach, arm yourself from the Fathers. Even if you do not hurry to publish your other works, it will harm the Church less. I do not say this because I do not wish for all your works to be published or fear that you will surpass mine. For the way I have undertaken to treat Paul, namely to explain the arguments more fully and show on what means they rely, then to show the consensus of the ages in doctrines, and that too in more detail, your summaries are preferable. Therefore, do not think that I wish to divert you here so that you do not instruct me. I look to the public, I desire you to be prepared for the cause of the whole.</p>
      <p>I know, if anyone else, what men Germany has, who are emerging, so that I can perhaps somewhat know what strength each one displays. I am also certain that the principal hope of the papists is that soon those who are formidable to them will be removed. They are also daily exercised against us. Certainly, the Bernese and other disputations should not make us proud. They now handle the Scriptures and have learned to present their own with other colors.</p>
      <p>Because I truly love you exceedingly, I therefore speak so freely with you. If you do not take this well or suspect something else than what I profess - as this evil somewhat prevails among you, to immediately suspect the worst as caution - you will do what I do not expect from you. The Lord knows that I am acting here for the cause of the Church and yours. We have no reason to fear for ourselves in the empire, as long as we agree. You alone are to be considered violators of the sacraments, and that truly grieves. It also grieves that so many, not yet understanding what is at stake in this controversy, so disturb the world and ruin the good. But enough at last. I will consider the time for a meeting as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>I remember what you noted in the book Against the Abrincense. Now there is no time to respond to those, but I pray you to carefully examine the reason for each thing I wrote. I wanted to give a taste in that little book of handling the cause of Christ in a council against the papists.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and diligently greet Bibliander, Leo, Pellican, and the others on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, January 29.</p>
      <p>Your Bucer.</p>
      <p>There is also something else I ask of you, my brother, as much as I have grace and favor with you. Conrad, this excellent and most studious young man here, is making wonderful progress in languages and all kinds of studies and fears he will be assigned to teaching children with you. He is truly born for greater things. Therefore, I earnestly beseech you:</p>
      <p>Ensure that he can spend some time with Grynaeus and be imbued with logic and mathematics as well. These sublime talents should not be wasted in schools, nor do they benefit there, being engaged in greater matters. He is wonderfully innocent and extraordinarily studious. Help him if you can. Certainly, certainly, we must see to it that we educate men for the Church who are capable and can silence the contradictors.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the truly excellent servant of the Lord Jesus, Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed colleague.</p>
