      <p>S. D. Recently, I believe I made a mistake when I wrote that I would inform and communicate to you with the enclosed letter what I had received from various places brought from Frankfurt. For when I later gathered and requested various writings, I found the letter on the table among the letters and the pile of letters, which I had intended to send to you; therefore, you have the same enclosed here, although it is now outdated. I received and read your last letters and was horrified by the history of the committed murder; but I believe the Lord revealed the assassin so that he could not harm more people. Those who plot wars against the innocent without conscience rightly see such tragedies happening in their homes. May the Lord convert them!</p>
      <p>The evangelical cities have strongly urged the 7 Cantons to desist from their undertakings, but without success. They were told not to take our people with them, and in the evangelical cities, it is forbidden by the highest authority. It is certain that on October 13th, the entire community of Glarus convened and unanimously decreed that no one should embark on this military campaign. This was attested to me by those who were in the assembly, including Amman Beldius himself. And since the people of Schaffhausen are also recalling their men from France and have prohibited anyone from departing now, the envoy Bellevreus came there in recent days, pleading for soldiers; but the senate did not want to respond, requesting a delay.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will not say what the response was. Everyone is instructed to hope well, that they will remain by their prohibition. However it turns out, it is an impious military campaign. Now, there is a new rumor from Lucerne that new troops are to be recruited by 5 Cantons for the King of Spain; thus, the efforts of Rollius of Uri and Angusola have been realized. If this is true, these men want to drain all of Switzerland and betray it to the enemies. Therefore, I would strongly consider that if we were wise, we should resist them. But perhaps the judgments of the Lord proceed in this way.</p>
      <p>I have no news beyond what I last wrote, except that a man from St. Gallen, who came to Geneva, just told me that he saw many musketeers heading to Montbéliard to gather troops there, to which Duke Wolfgang of Zweibrücken is to come with 5000 black horsemen and 3000 foot soldiers, who will head straight to France to Conde with a violent expedition. Yesterday evening, two nobles also arrived from Heidelberg, who report that Zweibrücken has gathered many horsemen and foot soldiers and is hastily heading to France; again, the Rhinegrave and Margrave Philipp of Baden are gathering 3000 horsemen for the King of France, but they can hardly find them. Thus they say. I see the grave wrath of God hanging over the world and all the more severe because it is less observed by us. Therefore, everyone should be encouraged to faith, prayers, and repentance. I can write no more now; for two whole days, I have not left the house, lying down; I hope for better. Business and cares are killing me. May the Lord be with us. I am sending the letters you requested; I did not find more.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord for me. Greet all our friends and consuls in order, including Friedrich von Salis, with whom you may share the news that seems appropriate.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 15, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at Chur at St. Martin.</p>
