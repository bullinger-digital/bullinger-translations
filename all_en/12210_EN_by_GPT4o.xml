    <p xml:id="regest1">Renato thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received] and for the [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio”] of the [Zurichers]. Regarding the Lord's Supper, Renato [and his fellow pastors] teach almost the same [as the Zurichers], for they also recognize nothing else in the Lord's Supper than a remembrance of the death of Christ, through which man is taken from the power of darkness into the kingdom of light. Those who teach otherwise have no chance with them. - Allegedly, the influential Peter Finer is supposed to visit Bullinger soon. Bullinger should warmly recommend Renato to Finer, especially since his son [Johann Jakob] is now acting as Commissary of the Valtellina with the Prefect [Jörg Beeli von Belfort]. Bullinger should also lay the matter of the Gospel on Peter Finer's heart. - Nothing serious is to be expected from the Council of Trent. Allegedly, there are still only three cardinals [Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, Marcello Cervini, and Reginald Pole] there, who, under the pretext of the council, take care of their stomachs and make the inexperienced crowd believe that it is not their fault if the religious [matter] is not settled. - In Italy, piety is thriving well. - The brothers send greetings and congratulate [the Zurichers] on their confession. At some point, Renato will visit Bullinger. - Renato is not a preacher in Tirano, but a schoolmaster in the Valtellina town of Traona, which does not prevent him from confessing [the Gospel].</p>

      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Camillo Renato wishes peace and grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have received your letters, and with them, I have also received your confession. I wish you to know how grateful I am for the gift, as much as a Christian man can consider such a gift valuable, and even more so because your views on the Lord's Supper align closely with ours. We teach our people in such a way that, in this regard, you could say Camillo is Bullinger and Bullinger is Camillo. Therefore, do not doubt that you are approved by me, or rather, that all who have reached the same understanding are approved. For in the Supper, which we have recently begun to celebrate as instituted by Christ and practiced by the apostles, we recognize nothing except the remembrance of Christ's death, through which we have been transferred from the tyranny of Satan and the power of darkness into the kingdom of light. So, do not expect to gain anything from us if you think and teach otherwise. We will explain this more fully when there is more leisure, and we will inform you more certainly. For now, I write only this to you because we have heard that Lord Peter Finer, whose friendship we have just established here, will soon come to you, a man of great authority and, as I hear, very devoted to piety. I earnestly ask you to commend me to him as much as possible, and not only that, but also to support the cause of religion and those who publicly profess it, especially now that his son is acting as the Commissary with the Prefect of the Valtellina. - Do not expect anything serious from the Council of Trent. They say that three cardinals are still staying there, indulging their appetites under the pretext of the council, as they usually do, and will show the ignorant crowd that it was not their fault that the matter of religion was not settled. You know the nature of these men, you know their ways. Matters of piety are proceeding very well in Italy, and we hope for the best outcome; let us pray that it happens as soon as possible. The brothers send you greetings and congratulate you all on such a confession. Greet the Church of Zurich for us; I will fly to you at some point. Farewell, and that in the Lord. I am not a preacher in Tirano, but a schoolmaster in the small town of Traona in the Valtellina; yet we do not remain silent. Chiavenna, 15th of May, 1545.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious minister of evangelical truth, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed brother in the Lord, in Zurich.</p>
