      <p>Your messenger urges me to respond if I wish to do so, as he is ready for the journey. But since he has arrived at an inconvenient time and I am about to ascend the pulpit, I will give you this brief note. I am sending back the torn parts to you so that you can see and touch what I have done; no one has seen them; however, I have communicated the argument with the author and the previous index to my colleague. We have sent someone to inform Mr. Pontisella of the matter. Now they themselves must see what they will do. Gantner, a seditious man and another Rottmann, are trying to bring our synod before the Thusis court, where he recently went with his accomplices. But the one who was previously a supporter of Pontisella will now be his adversary; for Pontisella now recognizes and recently confessed to Mr. Consul that Gantner is a true liar, as if this had not been known for a long time. When the honor of God was at risk, they were not moved to war; but now, when the honor of men has been somewhat injured in the conspiracy that G[antner] stirred up, they wish to take revenge. But believe me, my most esteemed father, Gantner is daily attracting and recruiting disciples who oppose us with all their might, so that we may be expelled; they are thus deluded by this trickster. Now at last the play or tragedy will be dealt with from the beginning if he wishes to pursue this controversy. He wants to preempt our synod, which will be immediately after Trinity.</p>
      <p>Farewell. The rest another time. It is surprising that Mr. Lavater was so captivated by the most false blatherings of this man that he almost believed, leaving aside the aim of truth, which I had sent to you, that an injustice had been done to Gantner.</p>
      <p>On the last day of April, Ascension Day 73. Chur. Your most obedient Th[obias] Ic[onius].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father.</p>
