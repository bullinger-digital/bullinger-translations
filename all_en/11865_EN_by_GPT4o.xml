The Last Anointing is rooted in papist superstition and binds grace to the signs; here too, people want to return to human inventions that were previously fought against. Baptism should be administered by church officials; midwife baptism is not supported by the example of Zipporah Ex 4 [24-26] and is unnecessary; Bullinger trusts - despite Augustine's differing opinion - that unbaptized children will be saved; Marcion allowed women to baptize, but the Apostle [Paul] kept them away from church offices. There should be freedom in the use of bells and burial rites, as long as no superstition is associated with it. Certain people want to prove themselves as faithful students of Luther by introducing new ceremonies. He condemns the Zurich theologians as godless seducers, but his letter [above No. 1797, 67-82] is private, and they will not respond in kind; from Lower Germany, it is heard that their reputation is undamaged.</p>

      <p>On excommunication. I completely abhor the zeal for innovation: for experience itself, taught by both the old age and my own time, shows me that more harm than benefit arises from it. The Apostle used excommunication once, and it was not so frequent in the early Church. Certainly, the Lord seems not to have bound His church to any prescribed method. It is enough if there is public discipline in the Church, which restrains the shameless from sinning, however that may be done. I have no doubt that the best French brothers are not driven here by a bad spirit. I have seen what Mr. Calvin argued in his "Institutio" about excommunication, and I do not think he would deny that moderation should be applied, and times observed, so that the peace of the Church is not violated: in which the wheat must especially be spared, lest it be uprooted along with the tares. There are enemies of the Word who would wish for nothing more than for us to restore excommunication. For they do not vainly hope that in this way our Church will soon be split into countless sects. I would rather have some church than none at all. Mr. Johannes Oecolampadius labored long and hard to restore excommunication: he restored it, but what is it in which the church of Basel surpasses others? Nor do I think it should be contended at all, as you say: "it is difficult to introduce or impose greater and harsher things on those who reject the lesser and milder ones." I wish you would read the judgment of Saint Augustine on this matter, in the book against the Epistle of Parmenian, 3rd, Chapter 2. Meanwhile, I fear that not a few are concerned about the restoration of excommunication, with no other plan than to exercise tyranny and relieve their bile. I think all these ways should be resisted, lest they throw the Church, stripped of its freedom, into the impious servitude of men.</p>
      <p>On the examination before Communion, I can say nothing other than that it is a preparation and perambulation of auricular confession, which the Church has scarcely had anything more deadly. To what end, I ask, is there a need for these innovations invented by the sick-minded? From what, I pray, scripture will they prove this Examination of the presbyters to us? What example of the Apostles do they have for themselves? Saint Paul, after the Lord's Supper was restored from the institution of the Lord, says, "let a man examine himself," leaving the examination free to each one's own conscience, which they defer to the priest. The disciples celebrated the most perfect supper with the Lord himself. Who is read to have been examined beforehand? In the sacred feast, several thousand are found in the Acts of the Apostles. Who examined them individually? Therefore, those who impose such innovations on the Church are following human inventions. If confession is brought back, the Supper will be circumscribed by such limits that few will be future guests, and the supper of thanksgiving will become a torture of consciences. The Lord has given us enough of examination and testing, who commanded ministers to teach diligently and each to examine himself. To carry the viaticum to the dying and those about to be executed has its root in Papist superstition. I know that somewhere among ancient writers, peace was given to the dying: but this was not handed down to us by any prescription from the Lord nor by any apostolic example. Thus grace will again be affixed to signs. These have come to us from human inventions: those which we once so greatly opposed, we now bring back of our own accord.</p>
      <p>Baptism is a public ceremony of the Church, or a public action. Therefore, it should be administered by a public minister of the Church. What others babble about the baptism of midwives, let them see what they say. Certainly, the circumcision of Zipporah, Exodus 4, is related by all interpreters to contempt, or rather neglect, of circumcision. For the Angel wanted to punish the neglect of circumcision (thus). But when an infant, already brought into the light, departs by premature death, so that it is not allowed for the parents to bring it to Baptism, who does not see that there is no neglect here? Therefore, the example of Zipporah proves nothing here. Moreover, the Lord commanded to circumcise the infant only on the eighth day. But how many do you think expired within those eight days? They expired, therefore, without the sacrament. But this was not to their detriment, because neither neglect nor contempt was added. For even females were saved without circumcision, like Sarah, Rachel, and the rest. Therefore, if contempt of Baptism does not occur, infants who depart without baptism do not seem to be damned. I know what Saint Augustine felt about them being damned, but only lightly. I truly believe they are saved by the covenant and because of the promise. Since there is no danger to the infant, why do they dispute about the Baptism of midwives? The Apostle removed women from ecclesiastical offices. But Marcion, with his followers, as is found in Epiphanius, ordered them to baptize.</p>
      <p>Significant, useful, and non-superstitious signs of bells, true piety leaves free to the churches, to be ordered according to utility and necessity. Funeral and burial rites among the ancient fathers were very simple and without superstition. But to want to prescribe to each church by laws and prescriptions what seems proper to a few, conflicts with ecclesiastical freedom.</p>
      <p>But I see what it is: Once we strove with all our might to eliminate Papist rites from our churches. Now you will find those who strive with all their strength to impose Lutheran ceremonies on each church, so that they confess themselves to be disciples of Luther, from whose fullness all have received. A not very pious and convenient [effort].</p>
      <p>Moreover, Luther completely rejects and condemns us, that is, the ministers of Zurich, as godless seducers, as those who have no piety and drag the churches entrusted to our faith to hell with us. And he did this with such fury, such confidence, and importunity, that those who have hitherto approved everything of Luther, struck by this preposterous judgment of a furious man, condemn the Papal recklessness of the man. You ask what we will do? We do not wish to repay evil with evil: according to Christ's rule, we do not wish to offend the weak. The letter is private and of a very sick-minded man. We understand sometimes that we are not ill-spoken of among the churches of Lower Germany. Therefore, since our doctrine and innocence, by the grace of God, are more illustrious than can be obscured by such a charge, the day of the Lord will reveal all things. Farewell, on the 22nd of November, 1543.</p>
      <p>BULLINGER.</p>
