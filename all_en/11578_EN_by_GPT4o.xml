    <p xml:id="regest1">He does not want to withhold the latest news from him. The troops of [King] Ferdinand [I.] are attempting to capture Buda and are encountering strong resistance; the damage they are able to inflict on the fortifications during the day can be repaired by the Turks at night. There is concern about a large Turkish relief army, which is superior to Ferdinand's troops; it is expected that the besiegers will retreat from the plain to the hills; the rumors of the immense strength of the Turkish troops could be a ruse of war, but it is certain that the Turkish army - as reliably reported from Venice - comprises approximately 200,000 soldiers. Many fear that after the conquest of Hungary, the Turks might turn towards Austria and its capital Vienna, unless the Emperor reaches an agreement with the estates assembled in Regensburg regarding Turkish aid, which will be difficult to achieve given the current circumstances. The Regensburg religious discussion has ended without concessions being extracted from the opposing side; this is not achieved through human abilities but granted by God in kindness. The opposing side was particularly dismissive in the treatment of the Eucharist, but everyone knows that the teachings and practices the Papists want to adhere to have crept into the Church as human doctrines and traditions; they equate the authority of the councils with that of the Scripture, thus valuing the human no less than the divine and falling into false views like the doctrine of transubstantiation and practices like the elevation of the host. May God guide people to the right understanding. The world sees through what the Papists want; they should finally allow the Church to be renewed according to the apostolic model. Now the Emperor's judgment remains to be awaited. In Thuringia and Saxony, arsonists are once again causing havoc; their instigator [Duke Heinrich of Brunswick] is already known to the Emperor. Some are raging against us not only with fire but also with sorcery. [Philipp] Melanchthon has put his dream of the hyena into elegant verses [MO X 576, No. 187; MO XX 685-687], which Vadian is happy to send to Bullinger if needed. Christoph von Landenberg has been outlawed [by the Imperial Chamber Court in Speyer] due to his feud with Rottweil. Greetings, also to [Hans Rudolf] Lavater.</p>

      <p>Greetings. From the recently received letters of the merchants, we have learned the following, which, although you may already know from other sources, I did not want to keep from you, lest you be uncertain. First, know that Hungary is ablaze with war, and indeed a terrible one. Ferdinand's army has surrounded Buda and is pressing with great force. On the other hand, the people of Buda, equipped with all kinds of weapons, are inflicting great losses on our forces, and their daily and nightly sorties are causing significant harm. Whatever our forces manage to destroy and tear down from the walls and ramparts (with which the town is fortified) during the day, is all repaired and restored by night. Therefore, there is despair about capturing the city, and there is fear of the Turkish army, which, having left Gy≈ër many days ago, is threatening the siege of Buda with a large force of cavalry, infantry, and artillery. Our forces are indeed in great fear that if they persist in the siege, they may be forced to endure the worst, surrounded by the enemy's strength and numbers. Although there are more than 25,000 in the siege, Ferdinand's army is considered weaker than to withstand the Turkish forces. Therefore, it is believed that our forces will soon move to the higher regions of Pannonia, where it is elevated by hills and forests; for in the siege and the plain around Buda, nothing can be safe or secure for them. As you know, there are indeed excessive war rumors, and part of the strategy is to instill terror by exaggerating the number of enemies; however, it is certain that the Turkish army, which is destined for Buda, contains about 200,000 of the most efficient soldiers, and this has indeed been reliably reported from Venice. The remaining fear revolves around the possibility that after liberating and freeing Hungary, the Turks might aim for Austria itself and its metropolis Vienna, which many believe will happen unless the Emperor finally devises a plan with the estates gathered in Regensburg, so that aid can be sent to our forces from all sides; how easy or rather how difficult it is to achieve this in such a state of discord and turbulent affairs, you can judge more accurately than I can report. - As for religion, the colloquy in Regensburg has indeed ended, but nothing has been obtained or achieved from the adversaries in those doctrines that pertain to the pope's kingdom and sword, furthermore to the retention of the dignity of sacrifices, and finally to the gain and profit they have made so far. For these things we will not easily achieve by any industry, vigilance, fairness, or truth, unless the gracious divine spirit, who alone recognizes the truth willingly, finally imparts it to them. You know the saying: The charioteer is carried by the horses and does not hear the reins. They were most obstinate in the matter of the Eucharist, namely that it should not be entirely granted to the people as it was instituted by the Lord, that transubstantiation should not be denied (I use their own words), then that Christ should not be excluded, not worshipped, carried around, that this gift of theirs should not be held in contempt. These are indeed the dogmas of the old, true, and undoubted faith, which, as everyone knows, have crept into the schools first, then into the halls of the popes, and finally into the churches by the laws of these councils, confirmed by conspired councils. For they equate the authority and faith of councils with that of the Scriptures, that is, they value the human no less than the divine. And they insist, I suppose, as if we must believe, that since Christ said he would be with us until the end of the age, we should have him enclosed in his own gift and indeed in the bread, with a locatable presence. If this is the case, I see at once that nothing should be refused to these conjurers, who can bring down the moon from the sky and, when it pleases them, insert and insinuate the creator, hired by Venus and drunkenness, into their creation. But this is in jest, although it is no jest that we are ill-spoken of by the nations because of these dogmas, who, as I have often heard, among other reproaches, use this one, as if by enchanting and bewitching we elevate our deity. But let us leave the nations; let us pray to the Lord, the truth and the way, that he may guide their minds with his light, so that they may not continue to attribute to their own interests and passions what they owe to truth and piety and indeed to the old church of Christ, and indulge themselves in inventing and devising new dogmas and rites of religion without any just, indeed sordid causes. For the world sees and the farmers now have a clear view of where their studies and efforts tend, what they are stirring, what they are plotting, what they are seeking, what they are aiming at. Let them finally allow the errors and countless monstrosities of avarice to be removed, so that the church, which is the body of Christ, may be better and more similar to the old, true, namely apostolic church, in doctrines and rites. Now we await the judgment of the Emperor, the most gracious prince who has promised nothing for the sake of peace. May Christ grant us that it be holy and pure. Amen. - In Thuringia and Saxony, arsonists are once again causing havoc, which I am indeed more surprised by, as I have heard from many reports that the instigator of this monstrous robbery is known and has been reported to the Emperor. And not only with fires against us, but also with sorcery, some are raging; in this way, it seems, they are pleased to burden our cross, which we bear out of love for the churches. But Satan is like himself, whose studies are so liberal among Christians. Melanchthon has described his dream of the hyena, the Libyan beast, in elegant verses; if you have not yet seen it, I will gladly send it. This is what I had to report, which I pour into your bosom according to my custom. If you have any more certain information, please let me know, I pray. They say that Christoph von Landenberg, the outlaw of the Rottweil rebellion, has been proscribed; I would prefer him to be pacified. Farewell and greet your people in my name, especially Mr. Lavater. St. Gallen, the 15th day of June, the year 1541.</p>
      <p>Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the holy church of Zurich, to be revered.</p>
