      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>In these days, I have published the last part of my sermons on Jeremiah and also a brief explanation of his Lamentations. Since I know that I have given you all the previous parts, just as I believe I have given you a copy of all the editions I have ever published for more than 34 years, I did not want you to lack this present one. I will also send two books on councils, which are currently being printed, as soon as they are completed; they will be witnesses to your descendants of how much I have loved you; they will see the mementos given to you by me. Perhaps I overwhelm you with my untimely and abundant gifts; but what is done with a friendly spirit, I know well, you receive with a friendly spirit, etc. It is said that the Duke of Florence, Cardinal of Ferrara, Cardinal Tournon have died, and Cardinal of Amiens is ill. The French king's envoy in Solothurn writes to me that the bull for the continuation of the council brought to France by the estates has been rejected; they do not want the continuation, they demand a legitimate one, they want the pope himself to be present. The assembly announced for the 20th of this month has been postponed to May of this year.</p>
      <p>The assembly is now being held in Freiburg by the Bernese, Freiburgers, Genevans, Valaisans, etc.; the envoys of the Valaisans are hastening from there to Baden.</p>
      <p>Bern has arranged for 300 hand cannons, 1000 francs, and numerous cassiodolabras to be prepared for themselves. The King of France was placed on the throne with the queen mother on his right and Navarre on his left; next to him stood Cardinal Lorraine and with the mother Duke Guise, the cardinal's brother. Many French are setting out from Geneva to France; the king has dismissed the army; there is hope that France will be illuminated by the light of the gospel. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord to protect us from evil, so that the devil cannot do what he would gladly do. Some rumor is spreading about the city of Metz; if you have any information, let me know briefly.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 10, 1561.</p>
      <p>May Matthias be safe.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer in Winterthur, most esteemed lord and his dearest brother. Winterthur.</p>
      <p>Memory.</p>
