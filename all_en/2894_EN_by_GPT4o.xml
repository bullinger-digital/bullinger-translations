      <p>C[oelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ Jesus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I received with the letters the book, which you sent to me as a gift, my most friendly and esteemed Bullinger, both of which are a most welcome gift to me after such a long interval; for I am greatly refreshed by your letters and I become more learned and instructed in piety by the books. Therefore, for both gifts, which are most pleasing and delightful to me, I give the greatest thanks I can. Regarding my son, who greeted you, you are correct; for I diligently instructed him to greet you reverently in my name, as I was unable to write at that time due to my occupations. Concerning the favor, which you write that you did not bestow upon him, you have indeed bestowed the greatest favor if you gave him, as you usually do, salutary advice upon his departure. For these are to be referred to those riches and those treasures which can never perish. Therefore, there is nothing for which you should say you have erred here, as you have conferred the greatest benefit of your love towards us. Farewell, my most esteemed brother, and consider me in that number in which you have held me for the past 12 years and henceforth. My wife, children, and son-in-law, who is taking my daughter to the Swiss baths after a year of illness, greet you. Greet your wife with your sweetest children, your son-in-law whom you have at home, and your relatives and friends.</p>
      <p>Basel, 17th of the calends of May 1556.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my most esteemed lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
