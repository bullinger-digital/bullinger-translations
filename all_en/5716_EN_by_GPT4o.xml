      <p> Greetings. I am well aware of the waves of business that overwhelm you, honorable lord and dearest brother, which is why I do not willingly trouble you with frequent letters, and when I do write, I do not press you to respond promptly; I leave this to your goodwill. However, since Guillaume Gallus, a truly excellent man, requested a letter from me to you, at least so he could converse more familiarly and greet you, I could not deny this duty. Therefore, kindly receive him and encourage him to remain steadfast. He stayed for some time with our Gwalther; now he returns to his homeland. If you have the leisure, I pray you respond to those letters I sent to you earlier. I received letters from Poland dated near the end of March, and from these, I learned that those Italian scoundrels have stirred up and are increasing great dissensions; for some of the ministers, more out of ignorance than malice, are beginning to defend their side, so it would be worthwhile if you wrote a little more diligently about the cause of the Trinity. At the same time, unfortunate and grave calamities are reported. The Muscovite made an incursion into Lithuania and, having captured Polotsk on its borders, is said to have slaughtered and taken captive over 70,000 Lithuanians. Signs are seen in the sky, which terrify the already anxious even more. May the Lord have mercy on them! From Italy, through the work of Count Martinengo, we have that Cardinals Morone and Navagero, restored by the Pope, have been sent as legates to Trent, March 15. Louis of Avila came to Rome from the King of Spain to the Pope and was received into his palace with great pomp, and the wise suspect various things about that legation. He adds that the King of France has recalled his orator from the papal court, which greatly grieves and is suspect to the papists, that 14 Turkish galleys unexpectedly made an incursion on the coast of Orbetello and took a rich booty and many captives, that there is not a slight disturbance arisen in Venice due to some suspicion of treason. Many other things of this kind are reported, such as this: that the Elector Palatine, having set out to reform the churches, was thrown from his horse on that very journey and dragged by the horse to his death. From this, the Lutherans say, it is evident how hateful Zwinglianism and Calvinism are to God. I, however, have only this rumor, nothing certain about the prince's death; I hope it is nonsense. If they report the truth, yet the Lord lives. In this, farewell eternally along with all your fellow ministers, especially with our Jonville. All of ours send you and yours the most friendly greetings. Various uncertain and unfortunate things are reported from France. We expect more certain and better news from Jonville. </p>
      <p> Zurich, May 1, 1563. Your Bullinger. </p>
      <p> Our legate has not yet returned from the Basel assembly. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the Geneva church, my honorable lord and dearest brother. Geneva. </p>
