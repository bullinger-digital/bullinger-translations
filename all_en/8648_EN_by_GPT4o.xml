      <p>Greetings. I give thanks for the letters you sent to me, dearest relative. I am returning them; I have kept what you wanted to be copied. I lament greatly the madness of many people; these things certainly precede a certain destruction. Ciserius, who returned from Italy four days ago, told me yesterday what you will read in the letter written to our Mr. Parkhurst; for I am sending this and several letters written to our sons and to some men in England, from which you will understand the arguments of all the others. I share these with you so that our writings to those men may all agree; you will return everything together with the letters to me from our Stettani in the evening through this your servant, which I am also sending. I hear that Jacob Andreae, that fateful man, was in Montbéliard and it was decided that whoever does not subscribe to the Augsburg Confession within 3 months will only change... together with our Mr. Tossanus. What if Ferdinand, upon the death of the Württemberg prince, occupies that entire domain? The judgments of God are wondrous. I cannot certainly recount to you what was done in the Aarau assembly; for I have not often found the treasurer at home when I sought him. Other friends report nothing certain. Today I finally hear that the whole matter has been presented to the senate; when I find out, I will inform you. Yesterday, wheat came to 12 (...?), which distresses me beyond measure as do other serious and dangerous matters. May the Lord be merciful and gracious to us and bless you and yours and keep you from all evil. I am now entirely occupied with writing letters to be delivered to Froschauer, who will depart either on the 29th or 30th of this month.</p>
      <p>All of mine send greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Most hastily in Zurich, August 25, 1571.</p>
      <p>Would that you soon return to us safe and sound. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my friendly, dearly beloved lord and brother-in-law Mr. Rudolf Gwalther in Urdorf.</p>
