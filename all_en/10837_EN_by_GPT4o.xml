      <p>My friendly greetings and all the best to you.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, I have well understood your friendly letter. To that, I inform you that whatever I can do for you in honor and good, I would like to do for my particularly dear lord as mentioned above.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, let me inform you that your desire to come to me regarding the matter of the girl is not necessary. I will now write to Heinrich Lochmann that he should appear at my place in Lenzburg on the 26th of this month; for we will now settle his matter concerning his wife. However, I will send him a special messenger. If it is important to you, you may also come. Whatever good I can do in this or other matters, I will do for you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the French, my lords have not yet written to me whether they will grant them passage or not.</p>
      <p>I cannot write you any more news; for I know nothing else, except that God has his hand firmly over us as a gracious God, praise be to God.</p>
      <p>If it is very important to you, you may come earlier.</p>
      <p>Nothing more, may God keep you in his care.</p>
      <p>Given in Lenzburg on the 18th day of April in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Greet the bailiff of Kyburg and Master Leu for me.</p>
      <p>Your always willing servant,</p>
      <p>Bitzius Haller, chief bailiff of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my particularly dear lord and brother.</p>
