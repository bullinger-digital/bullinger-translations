      <p>Greetings. I received all your letters, most esteemed man, with singular joy, as they contained a special indication of your benevolence towards me. For having deigned to instruct me more fully about the case of Mr. Brunner, I give you my utmost thanks and will continue to do so as long as I live. I did not know he was so obstinate in a matter that others indeed consider trivial, but which is serious and of much importance in reality. I thought he had introduced something different merely for the sake of argument, not that he was defending that opinion with such tenacity. When he first approached me and had lunch with me, he recounted various things that had happened to him in Bern; but he did not even touch upon the action with Mr. Haller, saying only that he had responded to some doubters that he would subscribe to no confession more than the Zurich one, but with the appendix, as far as it is consistent and consonant with the word of God. Suspecting no harm, I understood these things simply; now, I see not obscurely what poison lies beneath, and I am better able to guard against it thanks to your warning. It is strange to find a man who is the only wise one and more perceptive than all others; it is even more remarkable that he approaches the papists and the Lateran Council to the extent that they accuse and detest us as empty and vain representatives of divine worship (so to speak). Either he agrees with few and none with gravity, or he disagrees in vain. Certainly, it is a fine head that has not conformed to that confession, from which no one can honestly dissent, although almost all Christian churches embrace it most eagerly. I see what will happen (if he remains in Maienfeld or is accepted; which, however, is not yet certain): As soon as he wishes to be enrolled in our register, the Engadiners will demand that he subscribe to the confession of the whole synod. He will have to do this without any ambiguity; if he refuses, he will be refused. Hence, a new schism and new disturbances.</p>
      <p>But if he wants to be one of us, we will be persistent authors for him to change his mind in this opinion and join the common consensus of all good people. If he does not do this, it will certainly be pleasing to the Engadiners to expel him from the Three Leagues, who otherwise think that he favors outsiders here more than enough.</p>
      <p>What we did, sparing neither labor nor expense to retain him, we certainly did with good intent and considered it most important that he should not be compelled to make such a shipwreck of his family affairs. May it turn out well. These things about Brunner, who has so pricked himself with his own acumen that there is hope he will be more cautious in the future. Regarding the military and French matters that were written, I reported to Mr. Consul Willi, with whom even the smallest things written by you are always of the greatest weight. The entire senate eagerly expects such news from you every week, marvels, and wishes for it. Particularly, Mr. Willi ordered me to give you the greatest thanks for this service, which can never be praised enough, let alone repaid, and there is no doubt that the spirits of good men are moved by these and other things. Indeed, the previous ones you sent so inflamed the minds of the consuls that they most steadfastly and ardently repressed the departures of many with other recent legates. For on the 22nd of October, the day on which a minor assembly was held here for that purpose, it was publicly proclaimed throughout the city by the crier and trumpet, according to the common decree of the Three Leagues, that no one should depart under penalty of losing life, limb, honor, and property, and wife and children should not be sent away. Many, bearing this appendix with difficulty, attempted everything to remove it; but it remained unscathed and was thus published.</p>
      <p>There were those who said: "I was about to leave because of my wife, so as not to be perpetually subject to curses; but since this public decree would bring this evil upon me, I prefer to be a miserable man at home alone than to be abroad in many ways and not without the annoyance of others."</p>
      <p>The captains and some others, bearing everything indifferently, were forced to leave the city and not to incite anyone with their noise. But it was almost the case that they were called privately into the senate to be forbidden from continuing in their purpose or to face the penalty of treachery thereafter. But not all the senators were Willi's; the worse part prevailed, and many gratify the French in many things. Publicly, however, the first impulse was repressed until it is deliberated anew what should be done next. For the legate requested that a greater assembly be held. But our people replied that if he wanted it to be held, he should ensure it is convened at his own expense. Therefore, it was announced at the expense of the French to be held here in Chur on the 1st of November. Then we will hear what will happen. It cannot be said how much the French legate hastened; he wished to preempt all delay. "The matter," said the interpreter, "admits no delay. To arms, to arms! The enemy has the walls," etc. He also approached me to persuade me that it was not religion but rebels and traitors being attacked. I caught him with his own words and snares and slew him with his own sword, affirming that no other enemy was being attacked except religion, and I proved this with many arguments. Finally, when he had urged me to cultivate peace, he departed not without an adjuration that I would not fail peace as far as the word of God permitted. Would that France, having cast aside the fear of arms and servitude on both sides, would sincerely consider those things that make for peace to be held and preserved! The rumor is consistently spreading among us that much damage has been inflicted on our Rhaetian soldiers and that Captain Herdli has fallen with many others. Some report 500, others 4000. What is more true, time, the mother of truth, will reveal. These things to you more verbosely than perhaps was necessary; I ask that you consider my loquacity kindly. I do not know whether any of ours will depart in this rainy season, but I will seal and see. I return 2 other letters and have immortal thanks for them.</p>
      <p>Andreas VÃ¶geli, about whom I wrote recently, died immediately the day after we left him; he was a learned man but utterly given to drunkenness. I think Brunner will succeed him unless he refuses, I think, because of the meager stipend.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul, Mr. Pontisella, and Mr. Gantner and all the others send their regards to you. Farewell, most excellent and holy father, the pillar of the whole world and the most sincere defender of true religion. May God preserve you eternally safe for all of us and your most prudent congregation.</p>
      <p>Chur 67. 28th of October.</p>
      <p>Your dignity's most observant Tobias Egli.</p>
