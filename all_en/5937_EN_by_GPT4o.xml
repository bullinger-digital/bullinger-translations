      <p>From the letters given in Rome on November 2. In the past week, the Roman pontiff dispatched three legates: the most reverend Mr. Geriam to Emperor Ferdinand, the most reverend S. Crucis to the King of France, and the most reverend Viscount to the King of Spain. It is believed that these most distinguished men have been sent to make a final attempt to persuade these princes to agree to conclude the council and to convene in one certain place, where it will be decided and concluded that the decrees of the Council of Trent are to be observed inviolably, and to act, as is fitting, on the deprivation or execution of deprivation against all kings and princes, and finally against cities, republics, and peoples who have been declared heretics and condemned by the sacred council with the approval of the pontiff. Cardinal Lotharingus, who came here from the Council of Trent, is thought to be the architect of these plans. He also obtained from the princes of Italy two legates to be sent in the name of all the princes of Italy to the King of France to demand vengeance, especially that the blood of Duke of Guise, shed for the entire Christian republic, be avenged on the guilty parties. The head of the legation is said to be the most illustrious Mr. Franz von Este, uncle of the Duke of Ferrara, etc.</p>
      <p>Send this back, but regarding the affairs of France, there is no need to send it back.</p>
