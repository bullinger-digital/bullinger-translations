    <p xml:id="regest1">The boy Balthasar Kuchimeister, recommended to him by Bullinger, is indeed well-behaved, but as a student, he is very ignorant. Myconius cannot use him even for minor clerical tasks; nevertheless, he is still undecided whether to send him back home. Letters seem to have been mistakenly sent incorrectly to Bern and Schwyz. Myconius is concerned about what will follow after the Peace of Kaaden. In Paris, a learned Evangelical was burned; through his sermon at the stake, around four thousand people were converted. Greetings. Myconius is awaiting Theodor Bibliander's translation and interpretation of the Book of Nahum.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Regarding the boy whom you recently recommended to me, you should know that his character is more than commendable, and he is simple, which is why I have not yet sent him away with his mother. Although he himself did not want to leave when I gave him the choice. In his studies, for the time he has been attending his teachers, he has made satisfactory progress. Otherwise, he knows nothing except what he has seen at his mother's. While being taught, he often makes mistakes due to excessive eagerness. He is of no use to me at all. I am, however, in doubt whether to send him away or not. I need someone who can properly arrange food and drink at the table and from the table, who can sometimes write letters, indeed, even take dictation occasionally, and who can diligently take care of things and words to be conveyed elsewhere. I cannot hope for such a person in him for a long time yet. What should I do then? I would gladly serve his good father, and I wish the boy very well. However, he is of no use to me because of his age and inexperience. Thus, I am stuck.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, they say that this scribe has made some mistake regarding the letters to be sent to Bern and Schwyz. If there is anything, please let me know.</p>
      <p>After that peace was concluded, I am not simply worried for us. You will divine.</p>
      <p>A good and learned man was recently burned in Paris, steadfast in the Lord until death. Upon hearing the condemnation, he was almost mute until he reached the stake. Then he began to preach about the Eucharist with a long and effective sermon, so that, as those who heard it say, about four thousand people were converted. He feared that if he had spoken earlier, his tongue would have been cut out, which is why he remained silent for a time. I think the king is as you once described him.</p>
      <p>Farewell always with Utinger, Pellican, and Theodor, whose Nahum I have been expecting until now, but in vain. Lord Grynaeus indicated these days that it has been published, otherwise, I have not yet seen it.</p>
      <p>Basel, in the month of July, in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, learned and pious, and very dear to him. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
