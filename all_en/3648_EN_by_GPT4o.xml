      <p>Greetings. Very dear brother in Christ, indeed even father (since, as far as it depends on you, you give birth to us in Christ), the book you sent to me and the one I received from you have given me both the material and the boldness to write to you. We receive many and all of your volumes that you send to the world; but among all others, the book you wrote on the Apocalypse of John has particularly delighted us, especially since you wrote and sent it as a relief and comfort to all the exiles of the Lord Christ, driven from their homelands by the Roman harlot as if they were the impure stepsons of Phaedra, taming many monsters in exile like Hippolytus. I consider it my duty, since I am one of the exiles among the candidates for the kingdom of Jesus Christ, to acknowledge the giver and to give thanks for the refreshment and joy of my spirit drawn from it, since we, the poor disciples of Christ, cannot repay. May God, our Father, who adorns the miserable bride of Christ with the gifts of His Spirit in these times, preserve you and your fellow ministers, your dear and our brothers, safe for us and increase His talents in you, well and faithfully invested for the enrichment of the church, until the Roman merchants see their lamentable poverty, waste away from seeing it, and be confounded by a fruitful confusion for their salvation (if God wills to be prayed for it) before they are eternally overwhelmed by Christ, the avenger of His church.</p>
      <p>May our generous God, our Father, grant this to us and give more abundantly to those who have, not only to you but also to us through you. Furthermore, we receive your writings and testimonies of eternal life with a joyful and grateful heart, as they are true and more precious than all the treasures of the pope, and in return, we send you ours, namely, that you may receive them as testimonies of our faith and hope in Christ, rejoicing in the increase of His kingdom, just as we receive yours with the greatest joy.</p>
      <p>I played with a brief poem on the certainty of future joy after reading your Apocalypse, and because that book vividly depicts for us the glory in the resurrection of the pious, both certain and ineffable, as well as the damnation and confusion of those who now seem to be the lords of things and now tyrannize us in horrendous ways, I could not restrain myself from singing a triumphal hymn of faith in Christ the ruler with all the elect, insulting with pious confidence all our enemies, the world, sin, death, the devil, and his satellite the pope, now as if seeing with my eyes their eternal rejection and the most glorious victory of Christ and all His members. However, my little book, printed with another intention, as I first sent it to the beloved brother in Christ, Calvin, has been stuck for three years in Frankfurt, where it was first in the custody of Lord a Lasco (who was also the advisor for its publication), with not so many copies sold, whether due to my fault or the fault of the poetry, I do not know; about 800 copies remain there, the sale of which has been undertaken by Petrus Dathenus Casletanus, minister of the church in Belgium there. Therefore, my plan is, since the printing costs have greatly worn me down, to seek your support and recommendation among known booksellers, so that they may be sold at any price. But since I do not wish the Cyclops to be rashly and undeservedly recommended by you, I have sent a copy to Lord Calvin for you to read if you have the time.</p>
      <p>You may not be bored by the reading, if you happen to enjoy seeing the Roman crow. I will await here whatever help and effort you can provide, not doubting your willingness, in which I will also be secure. I return to your Apocalypse; in it, I see that you hold the opinion that the Antichrist will not be defeated by any man, but by Christ alone at His final coming. Although, most learned man, you easily defend your opinion, and if I wish to correct it, I may not unjustly seem to want to teach Minerva, as they say, yet I hope this is far from your integrity and sincerity, that you cannot bear if someone disagrees, and that you will not hate the dissenter, especially if I profess why I disagree, no less amicably than freely.</p>
      <p>It seems to me that from the many singular punishments of impious men, kings, cities, or nations, which God's justice always eventually inflicts, even if temporarily, and from the very Apocalypse of blessed John, it can be proven that the Roman church will suffer some notable calamity and temporal devastation, indeed from God, but not without human agency. For Saint John clearly and expressly prophesies this about the ten horns of the Roman Empire, which will hate the harlot and make her desolate and naked, devour her flesh, and burn her with fire. The prophet attributes this vengeance not to the person of Christ, but to the horns of the Roman Empire, which you yourself seem to acknowledge in that place; you show that vengeance was fulfilled in the old beast through the horns; therefore, it follows that in the new, that is, in the image of the beast, that devastation or desolation will be fulfilled through the horns. For as the desolation of the old has no type in the new, which you acknowledge, John especially attributes that vengeance to the perfidious harlot, that is, the apostate church, sitting on the beast, that is, the Roman Empire; for the harlot sits on it, the other, that is, the second beast rising from the earth, is. The horns of the beast will strip and desolate that very harlot; meanwhile, the beast itself or the feet of Daniel's statue, although clay, because they share the nature of iron, remain to be crushed and broken by the stone cut from the mountain without human hands. But what Saint Paul's prophecy seems to ascribe to Christ Himself in person, the abolition of the Antichrist, does not conflict with this opinion; for if the brightness of Christ's coming is understood as the brightness of today's gospel, by which the Antichrist will also finally be revealed to his destruction by the horns, that is, by other princes who still fornicate with this Babylonian harlot, the opinion falls into the same; if, however, the brightness of Christ's coming is understood as the final coming to judgment, Paul does not yet conflict with John; for the Antichrist, that is, the spirit of the Antichrist, can still be a survivor even after his kingdom is destroyed, as the papist men mixed in our churches sufficiently teach, who, although they lack the kingdom of their head, still remain Antichrists, let them burst asunder for us. I thought these things could be written to you, venerable master, with your peace and a better opinion. Farewell.</p>
      <p>We send greetings to all our beloved brothers and sisters. Hastily in Manslacht, July 16, 1558.</p>
