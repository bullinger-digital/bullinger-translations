      <p>Greetings. See, I have not yet responded to my promises; it is because I think it is not necessary. I hope you are well with the brothers.</p>
      <p>This is my housemate, a man very eager for your name. He recently wanted to speak with you when you were here, but business prevented it. You will now give him even half an hour.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Christ, who may guide you in His will. Amen. Greet all the brothers, greet your wife.</p>
      <p>Your Simon Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his patron and dearest brother.</p>
