    <p xml:id="regest1">Wants to lend him the desired works of Luther. Albert Krantz, whose unpublished writings found no buyer at the last [Frankfurt] fair, has written five or eight books, but only the "Saxonia" and the "Germania" or the "Dania" are available in print; if more are published, Gast will inform him. News from a letter: Emperor [Charles V] is said to have presented five articles at the Diet [of Speyer], demanding the restitution of the tyrant [Duke Henry] of Brunswick[-Wolfenbüttel], assistance against the Turks, and the branding of the French king [Francis I] as an enemy of the Empire, and suggesting the prospect of seeking a compromise between the [religious] parties; the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] is ready to account for his religious policy and has brought an evangelical preacher [Albert Hardenberg]; the Saxon [Elector John Frederick] and Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] did the same [in the latter case Dionysius Melander], but the Emperor will not allow them to preach in a church; he is probably not willing to seriously negotiate about religion; according to another rumor, the English [King Henry VIII] is supposed to support him with troops against France. Greetings; the news can also be shared with Vadian. Announces the sending of Oecolampadius' sermons on some Psalms.</p>

      <p>Greetings, most excellent and learned Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The books of Luther that you wanted are not available with us, but if you need them, I will lend you mine through a trustworthy messenger; for I have all of them.</p>
      <p>You are laboring in vain over the chronicle of Albert Krantz. Many of his works are not yet published, and the printers did not want to buy them from a certain merchant at the last fair, they are so stingy. He wrote five or eight, if I remember correctly. We only have "Saxonia" and "Germania" or "Dania"; the remaining books are not yet published. Perhaps they will be published soon, and I will inform you about this matter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Diet, it was written to me: “There is a rumor among us, and not entirely unfounded (as I think), that the Emperor has already proposed five articles at this Diet. The first is about restoring the tyrant of Brunswick by the Protestants, the second about providing long-term assistance against the Turks by the entire Empire, the third about recognizing the King of France as an enemy of the entire Empire, the fourth about presenting both parties with the heads and brief writings of the dissensions, so that he might later be able to reconcile them among themselves; the fifth was not clear to me. The Archbishop of Cologne, equipped with the best advisors, is ready to speak on the matter of religion if asked; he also brought with him an evangelical preacher, just as the Saxon and the Landgrave did, although the Emperor will not allow them to preach in public churches. Some think the Emperor will not act seriously on religion, but has proposed these things so that our people do not think he is doing nothing. Also, there is a rumor that he is allied with the English, now enemies of the French King, with 15,000 selected foot soldiers and 4,000 horsemen. Surely, with these preludes proceeding, we will have a restless summer.” This was written to me. More soon.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and greet Theodor, Pellican, and Mr. Vadian in my name, with whom you can also share this information. March 7, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>Soon you will receive Oecolampadius' sermons on some Psalms.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich. Zurich.</p>
