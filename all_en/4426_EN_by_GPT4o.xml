      <p>There were legates sent to Constance: a certain Italian papal envoy, Bolwyler from the emperor, and the bishop of Laibach. They requested from the bishop to allow a coadjutor to be appointed for him from Emps, as he is worn out with age; however, neither the bishop nor the chapter could be persuaded to consent so far. Therefore, it is believed that the pope will summon the bishop and the chapter to Rome; for they are considering all means to impose this. Why? You know that Amisum, the castle of the Empsians, is opposed to Reguscis, and under the bishop's authority are Arbon, Majorau, Ã–hningen, Kaiserstuhl, Klingnau, etc.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is no mention of a council; but if this is imposed here, it will be beneficial for many things against the Confederates, especially against us. At the upcoming assembly to be held in Baden on September 8th, we will hear amazing things. May the Lord be with His faithful and break the arm of the antichrist, etc. Milyagrius resides in Basel with his wife and children, awaiting the return of the princess, if perhaps the light may shine. If not, he will write to me; I will write to you in return.</p>
      <p>Here, there is such a crowd of the poor and students that they cannot be provided for here.</p>
      <p>There are many things that fill me with sorrow. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In great haste, August 30/31?, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
