      <p>Greetings. Today, your son finally presented himself to me, asking if I would like to send any letters to you, so that I could not bestow any benefit upon him on your behalf. Although I only returned yesterday evening from a journey, which I undertook for the sake of my mind and other matters with my companion Gwalther through the Bernese countryside, so that he could not reach me more conveniently. However, you do not despise a good disposition of mind when a good work is hindered by just causes.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write, but I did not want to neglect the opportunity, especially since this messenger is offered as very reliable. I am more eagerly awaiting your letters, in which you will inform me of the state and institutions of the city of Strasbourg; for various things are being rumored here.</p>
      <p>Constance and Lindau still persist; what will happen next, the Lord knows, whom we pray to be with them. Those cities cannot be occupied by the Emperor without great inconvenience to Switzerland; but it is like telling a story to a deaf person if anyone tries to warn the Swiss.</p>
      <p>It is certain that Duke Maurice, a miserable man otherwise, has summoned all the nobles and commoners from Saxony to Freiburg to consult about the Interim, whether they want to accept it, having so far rejected the practiced religion, but they unanimously responded that they would rather shed their blood than abandon the accepted religion. Thus, the Emperor achieved nothing with his Interim in Saxony. The captured Duke of Saxony steadfastly denies the Interim; the Duke of Pomerania, the Prince of Prussia, the Saxon and maritime cities, along with the King of Denmark, most stubbornly reject the Emperor's Interim. This is what you mentioned because of the widespread rumor, which asserted that all those had defected. Let us pray to the Lord to be eternally with his own.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 3, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother. Basel.</p>
