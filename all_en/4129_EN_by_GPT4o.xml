      <p>Greetings. Through Haller, our godfather, you advise, my lord and dearest godfather in Christ, that I should commit my "Loci" to the press, now that they are finally completed. This advice was anticipated by the printer, who, a few weeks ago, sent his brother-in-law here and received them from me while they were still almost warm, and took them to be submitted to the press, so that it may happen that they will come to light at the upcoming spring fair in Frankfurt, unless the Basel censors cause delays and hinder the process. May the Lord, in whose hand all things are, turn this edition to good and direct it to the benefit of the churches!</p>
      <p>As for the dedication of it, I need your advice. The sacramental controversy prevents it from being dedicated to just anyone.</p>
      <p>Our Lelio urges for the second time that I dedicate it to the most serene King Maximilian of Bohemia. I do believe the things he says about him are true; however, there are things that hold back my modesty from doing it easily. Wilhelm, the deacon from Heidelberg, when he was here, implored me to dedicate it to the Elector Palatine; there are those who hope it will benefit the English churches if I dedicate it to Queen Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>Thus, I am stuck in doubt as to which way to lean, so I ask you to share your advice with me, and then send me the titles by which such magnates are usually addressed; for I am ignorant of them. Otherwise, by the grace of the Lord, I live quite comfortably with my family, except that old age occasionally brings something new unexpectedly, like the African wind. Last autumn, I entered my 63rd year, which they call the climacteric year.</p>
      <p>Perhaps this work of "Loci Communes" is the last offspring of my old age. May what is good in the eyes of the Lord be done. Amen.</p>
      <p>I am now engaged in explaining the Epistle to the Galatians. Pray, I ask, to the Lord, that through His Spirit, He may grant me to understand the true meaning of the apostle. Farewell very well, dearest godfather, and forgive me for sending you letters so rarely.</p>
      <p>Through Mr. Haller, what might be lacking here is abundantly supplied.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you and yours, especially Johannes Heinrich, your son in Christ. Greet all your fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 21, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus.</p>
