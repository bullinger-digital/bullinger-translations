      <p>S. P. I received your letters along with Vergerius's writings and booklets, all of which I was very pleased to see; for in this tumult of wars and occupations, there is nothing that refreshes me more. Therefore, I cannot but give you infinite thanks. If there is anything new, you will be able to read it from the memorandum inserted here. We will hear the rest later; for the king is preparing a great army, and meanwhile, the Emperor, who is dying, is waiting for his son, who is not yet in Geneva, but is attempting the passage, as I hear from our people, and his aim is to immediately descend from Italy into Germany to seize the empire. Hence, the Roman king's dealings with the princes, and you can be certain that these things are not done nor hindered without our knowledge. As for the Ulm assembly, in which the Emperor promises to be present in person, these are Spanish arts. With this stratagem, he wishes to keep the Germans under the rod, fearing the arrival of the lord, whose person is in good faith deplored and a mere corpse. Our assembly has ended, and because our soldiers are beginning to hasten, I am compelled to head towards Solothurn and Freiburg. From there, I will write to you more often and expect something from you in return. The King of England is better, yet still lies in bed. Lord Vergerius writes that he will return shortly; it would indeed be very pleasing to me if I could see him before he seeks his mountains. Farewell and love us. Given at Baden, June 28th.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bas[safontaneus].</p>
      <p>Lord Cardinal of Belley wrote to me from Rome; he is well and loves you.</p>
