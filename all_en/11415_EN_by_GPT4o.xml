He who digs a pit for others falls into it himself.</p>

      <p>Heinrich Bullinger to his Johannes Stumpf.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Indeed, dearest brother, I do not believe that what happened with the bailiff (of the R端ti Monastery, Hans Habersaat) in these days was done with malicious intent. For before it was certain where the matter should be legally decided, and immediately after the event itself, when the bailiff first came here, he told me that Georg M端ller, a man, as you know, of excellent character, thought it would be good if what you now write has been done, should be done immediately, and that because of the ferocity and importunity of those ominous birds. Nor did it displease me then, nor does it displease me now. I do not think it will be to Martin [Manhart]'s detriment, in the opinion of the most distinguished council, that after that event, about which there will be a legal dispute, it was admitted. Moreover, as you request, I will be vigilant to the best of my ability and will make the best of these matters known to trustworthy individuals. But if the flesh, according to its nature, has lied, we must not despair of divine constancy, truth, and protection.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all yours. Remember this: He who digs a pit falls into it himself, etc. 13th of March, 1540.</p>
