      <p>Greetings through Christ Jesus our Lord, amen, etc. My benefits, venerable lord, with which I have thus far treated you as my most beloved patron, are very small, indeed almost nothing, if they are compared with your generosity and munificence, which have always been and still are magnificent and splendid towards me.</p>
      <p>I experience no ordinary joy when I understand that my small gifts, although very modest, are considered as much [...] and that my willing disposition is considered rather than what is given.</p>
      <p>These literary gifts of yours are indeed most pleasing to me, both because of their subject matter, which is useful and necessary in this almost deplorable age, and because they are given by my most revered patron, as testimonies of your kind and paternal disposition towards me.</p>
      <p>For this and all other benefits, I give your kindness immense thanks. If I can reciprocate in any way to you and yours, I profess my utmost effort. I will also fervently pray to the Lord to bless your holy labors for the glory of His name and the safety of the church. May the Lord Jesus Christ, reverend father, keep you with all good things, and I ask that you keep me commended.</p>
      <p>Given on the 11th day before the calends of April in the year 1572.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Johannes Bluntschli, minister of the church in Ottenbach.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man of exceptional learning and integrity, Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the city of ZÃ¼rich, my lord and most revered patron.</p>
