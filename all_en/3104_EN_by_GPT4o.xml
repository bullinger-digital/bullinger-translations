      <p>Greetings. I had hoped that through this messenger I could inform you of something certain regarding the printing of your Commentaries on the Apocalypse. But even now I cannot, which pains me greatly, and I know that this delay torments me more than it does you. On the 20th of this month, the school authorities met; it was unanimously agreed that they should be printed. Only a few of them, who could only understand the German preface, feared something, I know not what. The matter was brought to the senate the next day. Since the senate was not well attended, this consultation was postponed to a larger assembly. Thus, we are stuck again. I would gladly send everything back to you; I am so indignant that such a small matter is being handled with such difficulty, contrary to the custom used until now. I urge that if they do not want to print, they should at least declare it. But almost everything here is done this way, and this alone is killing me. I hope that it will be proposed again to the senate next Monday; then we will have a definite answer.</p>
      <p>I am returning to you what you recently sent. There are those who think such writings should be suppressed, not published, so that none of our people may also learn such exactions. The victory that the other writing proclaims is nothing but an incentive for Turkish fury. We have nothing new, except that Mecardus writes from Augsburg on January 9th that Margrave Albrecht of Brandenburg has died, whose fate many, namely the bishops of Franconia and Nuremberg, greatly mourn. Who succeeded Mr. Lavater, I still do not know. If only it were someone pious and wise! All of ours greet you, and I am very glad that there was harmony and unanimous judgment about your writing. My mother and wife greet you. We also wish your entire family well. I am not writing anything to my brother now; you will greet him in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 22, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and dearest compatriot. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>January 22, 1557.</p>
