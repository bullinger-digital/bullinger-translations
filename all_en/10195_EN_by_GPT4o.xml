    <p xml:id="regest1">Concerned that the people of Zurich want to submit to the Swiss arbitration court in the mandate dispute, he asks for Bullinger's advice on what should be done now. He welcomes the imminent publication of Bullinger's commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, reports on the war-weariness in Bern, and inquires whether Bullinger can recommend a teacher to Bern. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If I had not received consolation from you, the fact that your cause has been entrusted to such a perilous jurisdiction would have greatly disturbed me and others. You are the only one who has pointed out the disadvantages that could threaten us all due to the vigor of the treaties and that jurisdiction. Therefore, please indicate what we should now take care of or do. There will be more prudent people, unless one should completely distrust a man.</p>
      <p>I am glad that you will enlighten us about the Romans, and I wish we could obtain commentaries on the entire New Testament from you. The ministers of our field are as greatly delighted by your works as they desire to use them. Therefore, whatever you can provide for the common benefit of the ministers and churches, do not hesitate to give, and lend the gifts given to you by the Lord. I write without flattery. But when will I see you in Bern? All hope is lost. Nowhere will there be so much peace that it would be safe for you to visit us.</p>
      <p>Our people greatly fear the calamity of war and will not easily be persuaded to consent to war unless they are extremely provoked, and if we attempted anything in the assembly, the entire gospel would become odious. The elders prioritize any kind of peace over the gospel. The younger ones, initiated into the magistracy and wealth and large possessions, will not easily put themselves in danger. Therefore, you must consider everything so that the latter does not become worse than the former. The discord and ill will of many among our people and yours frightens me more than the enemy. Whatever needs to be taken care of among our people, we will not fail.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we have written to you regarding an assistant teacher for our school. If you have someone suitable for this position, send them. It will be necessary for them to know how to teach the elements of languages to the children.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell, and may your wife, children, and entire family, as well as your colleagues and Pellicanus, be well.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the day of the Innocents.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. H.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, his dear lord and brother.</p>
