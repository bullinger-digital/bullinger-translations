      <p>God with us. The envoys of the Swiss Confederates from 7 places, from Schwyz and Zug, appeared here in Zurich last Monday before the councilors and citizens, presenting 3 articles: 1. To prevent the emperor from having a reason to seek war against us and impose something on us that is too burdensome, they request that we offer ourselves, if there is anything concerning us regarding religion, we are willing to appear in a general free, Christian council and submit to its decision; with this, the emperor can be dismissed. 2. That we do not deny those who have claims against us a proper and fair right. 3. That we wish to abolish slanderous words and anything that might sow discord. In particular, some people from the places have accused others of being traitors, who have taken money from the emperor, etc. If they show those who have taken money, they want them punished; if not, they should be punished for lying. They have thus reported 2 women and 1 man here, etc. To this, they offered much honor, goods, and loyalty, etc.</p>
      <p>My lords are entirely united (by the grace of God) and have bravely responded, they wish to deliberate on it and give them a friendly answer; with this, they have been amicably dismissed. Now that they are also sending envoys to you and writing to your lords, I think it might well come to pass that a friendly day is arranged for the 7 places and a general response is sought. But if Bern, yours, and others are not affected and do not write, I think my lords will answer for themselves, as they consider it honorable and appropriate. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, 24th of October, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] B[ullinger], yours.</p>
      <p>To his dear lord and brother Mr. Oswald Myconius, pastor in Basel.</p>
