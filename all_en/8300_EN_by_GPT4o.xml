      <p>S. P. It was not necessary for you to thank me so much, honorable lord and godfather, since with that token of my respect I wished to signify nothing other than the eager devotion of my heart, to which I confess I owe all that I have. I give you and yours the greatest thanks for receiving this small token with such gracious minds. I truly rejoice from the heart and pray that you and especially you are so well and feel so much the benefit of the bath from the grace of the best and greatest Lord, as we all wish from the Lord with common prayers. Meanwhile, I send what I have received from Glarus and Basel. My brother meanwhile reports nothing but a prosperous return and sends you many greetings. I have informed my neighbor, your owl, the diligent guardian of your house, of this message, and she herself will write to you what she wishes. Meanwhile, we are most ready to take good care of all your affairs.</p>
      <p>Farewell, honorable lord and godfather, and give many greetings to all yours in our name.</p>
      <p>Zürich, June 26, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Wolfgang Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zürich church, my lord and godfather, to be honored with the greatest reverence.</p>
