    <p xml:id="regest1">After a conversation with the city clerk [Ryhiner] about Hans Rudolf Lavater [and his mission], Meyer advises that the matter should not only be presented orally to King [Ferdinand] but also submitted in writing; [Ryhiner] will gladly provide Lavater with further explanations at the next assembly in Baden. It once again becomes evident that the cities have so far done too little for the higher education of the youth, so that such tasks can hardly be managed; this is not meant to diminish Lavater's undisputed abilities. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Increase of faith, divine grace, and my friendly, willing service beforehand, well-learned, honorable, beloved lord and friend.</p>
      <p>I have received your letter concerning my dear lord and brother, Herr Hans Rudolf Lavater, and have discussed it with my godfather, the city clerk, who is no less inclined than I am to serve him from the heart. However, it requires a bit more, that he not only be instructed to speak with the king but also that all proceedings be drafted in writing in the form of a supplication by your city clerk, and after his presentation, the same be handed to the king, which will then be submitted to the court councilors for deliberation. This is said to be a common practice at court. Nevertheless, our mentioned city clerk will report further on the matter to the aforementioned Herr Lavater at the next assembly in Baden, should he come there, as he will then hear from him orally. Here you see, beloved lord, how necessary it is for our cities generally to draw the youth to the arts with better diligence than we have done so far, so that such and similar matters can be well managed, which otherwise, when one comes to court, must be entrusted to strangers. Not that I despise my pious, dear lord, Lavater, as if he could not do it; but if this dear man had been drawn to it in his youth according to the skill (aptitude) that is innate to him by nature, he would gladly surpass a highly learned doctor. One should begin diligence with the youth; the benefit will follow from it. What I could do and promote for such a useful work with you and us, I would not spare myself; likewise, you will always find me willing to serve my aforementioned lord Lavater and you.</p>
      <p>Commending you faithfully to the grace of God, greet Master Leo Jud, the Pellican, and the brothers generally for me.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, the 8th of March in the year 1538. Send my greetings to Herr Lavater.</p>
      <p>Your Jacob Meyer.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the Lord's word of the Christian church in Zurich, my beloved lord and friend.</p>
