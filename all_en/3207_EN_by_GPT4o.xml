      <p>S. Regarding what you write about the English brothers with your own concern, the advice is pleasing, and I have carefully discussed it today with Mr. Levero, and he does not object, especially since so few families are granted a place in Bruges. Our Jungius hopes for more from the people of Aargau, who seem to live less narrowly. However, he will suspend the whole matter until their arrival, as they support the brothers with both advice and their resources. We do not cease to recommend them to our people, and we hear that this is being done so that at least more can stay with us besides those who have been received so far; for we almost cease to hope that the opportunity to engage in trade will be granted, not without our grave sorrow, as we know this hardness is unworthy of those who have professed Christ for so long and we judge it as an unmistakable omen of the Lord's impending judgment.</p>
      <p>Regarding your commentaries on the Apocalypse, you need not be concerned; a copy was presented by Mr. Oporinus to Mr. Borrhaus and me, and I have read most of it diligently, as much as business allowed, not with the intention of taking it upon myself to critique your writings, which I had already presumed to be in harmony with the truth, learned, and pious, but so that I could bear witness to them more clearly if anyone were to attempt to hinder them, and therefore I instructed [Oporinus] to proceed, and I do not think anyone, provided they are not completely distorted in judgment, will be offended, and it is not fitting to delay for the affected offenses of the impious. The delegation proceeded to the French, for which we pray to the Lord, that it may be guided by His spirit and bear the fruit of the increase of Christ's kingdom. Today, a man came to me with his wife, claiming to be the brother of Haller, to whom I would have liked to render service for the sake of the brothers, but somehow what he reported seemed to fit poorly. Nevertheless, he acknowledged a small favor candidly and refused the meal I offered him and his wife, whom he claimed to be noble. I wish to know if they have such a brother wandering elsewhere, for so often do outsiders deceive us that sometimes we are not sufficiently helpful to those to whom it was most fitting.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours. In Basel, on the very day of Pentecost in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
      <p>In Basel, print the Apocalypse.</p>
