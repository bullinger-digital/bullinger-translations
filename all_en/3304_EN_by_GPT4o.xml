      <p>S. When I had sent a reply to your letters, one received on June 5th from the barber, the other from your son on July 30th, to Lord Agninus in Frankfurt, namely on the evening of the 5th of this month, when I had already committed myself to nightly rest, Froschouerus brought your letters dated in Zürich on August 28th. Therefore, I am compelled to add to my previous letters and the present ones.</p>
      <p>You are concerned about health; I rejoice in the Lord and give thanks for your piety, and believe me, Bullinger, that the extension of life to me, a seventy-year-old, I attribute to your holy prayers to the Lord, and I often openly testify this among friends who visit me occasionally. I also, if only with a spirit as fervent and elevated to the throne of grace (which is Christ, sitting at the right hand of the Father) as nearly every hour I join you in prayers to the Lord, not for the riches of Croesus or the length of life (for I have lived abundantly), but for a happy departure from here, and there is good hope in Him that with your prayers assisting me, our prayers will be heard. As for today's health, by God's pious grace, you still see my hands somewhat fit for writing. I reluctantly hear about the wars raging everywhere; for I fear they will break into miserable Germany, whether the King of the French or the English ultimately wins. I hear you fear the same.</p>
      <p>For it is not entirely vain, what is commonly said, that there is always some evil because of a neighboring evil. May God protect His little sheep and the children of peace. Amen.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received your sermons on the Apocalypse when I wrote this; however, there is no doubt that I will receive them when Froschouerus, on his return to his own, passes through us. Therefore, I give you immortal thanks for them; I also give the same thanks for the homilies on Jeremiah dedicated to me, unworthy and undeserving. The fifty gold coins that Froschouerus has now brought me from you, I indicated in my previous or larger letters, which you will now receive, to whom I intended them, namely to you as a small subsidy for the expenses you have to incur for the sake of your sons being nourished among foreigners for the cause of pious studies.</p>
      <p>Do not disdain, I pray, the smallness.</p>
      <p>I can write nothing certain about the colloquy; indeed, I have no good hope about it.</p>
      <p>I pity Melanchthon, that he has fallen among such listeners and interlocutors. However, I wrote a few things about the same to Rodolphus Gualterus, who will not hide from you what they are. I am surprised that he has not written to me now; I fear he may take it badly that I have delayed the response to his letters, admitted with yours on June 5th at the barber's, until now. Please indicate to him the reason for this delay, as he was informed by me in other letters outside the time of the fairs, unless I wish to send a private courier, I do not know through whom I should send. If, therefore, he is indignant about this, I pray he may remit that indignation.</p>
      <p>For I love and esteem him no less than you, most esteemed Bullinger, whom I pray that God may keep safe for us for a long time to illuminate the church of His most beloved Son, Christ Jesus, our reconciler and savior. Amen. Farewell in the same with the whole house, wife, children, sons-in-law, and grandchildren, if the Lord has given you any, most happily.</p>
      <p>From Worms, September 6th, in the year etc. 57. Always and perpetually yours, Wolfgang Waidner.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the greater church of Zürich, his lord and father according to the spirit, uniquely and perpetually to be observed, etc.</p>
      <p>Philippus, together with Peucer and Eber, came to Worms. The theologians of Weimar, Jena, Magdeburg, and Hamburg, who wish to appear as defenders of pure Lutheranism, have decided in the colloquy to accuse Philippus as suspected of Zwinglian, Majoristic, and adiaphoristic heresy and to urge him to clear himself of it. However, we hear they have been admonished not to delight the papists with their intemperance and to afflict all the pious with grief. They have been quiet.</p>
      <p>They also urged that all Zwinglians, Osiandrians, Majorists, and adiaphorists be excommunicated and expelled from Germany.</p>
      <p>Philippus writes to Kayltonus the Englishman from Worms that he is being severely accused by the defenders of bread-worship. The papists contended that the evangelicals themselves should acknowledge the church; otherwise, they would do nothing; but at this petition of principle, with everyone protesting, they have been quiet and ceased.</p>
