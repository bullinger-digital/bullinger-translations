      <p>Greetings. Although I have nothing worthy to write to you, I did not want the bookseller to return to you without a letter of my trifles. Therefore, I write this, if nothing else: From Italy, we hear that the King of France is superior everywhere, the army of the Roman Pontiff is harassing Florence, the Castellan of MÃ¼s (an old enemy of ours) has been killed by poison by the Spaniards themselves, because they thought he was more pleasing to the people than should be tolerated (!). "A royal matter is a crime," he sings, you know. I wish to know whether the bookseller is preparing or seeking some books for a friend, about which I wrote to you before. Traversus, beginning to be better by hand, now writes to you. Farewell in the Lord, most excellent man, with the whole family, and do not cease to love your Philippus. From Chur, on the 19th of November, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours in all humanity, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all the pious.</p>
