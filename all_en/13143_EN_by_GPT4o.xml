    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frölich is glad that Bullinger has received his last letter [No. 3078?]. If he remembers correctly, it contained an important message. Now he is very pleased about the letter from Bullinger, transmitted to him by Christoph Froschauer [not received]. A man as esteemed as Bullinger does not need to thank Frölich for the loyalty and favor shown to him, especially since he would not know how to adequately repay such a friend, given to him by God. However, Bullinger can always count on Frölich, even if heaven and earth were to pass away!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Imperial Estates have completely entrusted the council question to Emperor Charles V, who in turn leaves the resolution of religious questions entirely to the Council of Trent. Pope Paul III would also approve of this, as long as his power to interpret the Holy Scriptures and the council's decisions is not disputed, as long as only the cardinals remain entitled to elect the pope, and other such claims are not questioned. However, there is no agreement on these already old conditions. And as long as they are not granted to the pope, the latter does not want to convene a council. Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo has long been in Rome and has presented the pope with the choice between peace and war, namely war, if he does not immediately order the resumption of the council in Trent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Furthermore, the emperor's confessor, Pedro de Malvenda, is said to be working with others to draft an "Interim." By "Interim," a provisional arrangement is meant, which the Protestant churches are to adhere to until the council [has decided on the contentious religious questions]. One can well imagine what kind of "Interim" the theologians, or rather murderers, tasked with it will produce!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] As much as concord is beneficial to the Swiss, it is a thorn in the side of the enemy. However, few believe that this concord is so strong that a donkey loaded with gold would not cause strife among them. The big questions that the scouts are secretly investigating are whether the Swiss are preparing for war, whether they are expecting auxiliary troops from King Henry II of France, etc. However, it is almost certain that the Inner Swiss will abandon the other allies. The baptism of the king's daughter [Claude] could offer the Confederates a good opportunity to come closer, unless it does not happen because of the Roman character of the baptism ceremony. For if delegates from the Protestant places were to participate in the baptism, they would partake in idolatry. But if they were to reject the king's honorable invitation, they would offend him. Frölich is really curious about what the Confederates will do now, although they may not consider the ceremonies around a baptism to be decisive.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Johannes Haller has written Frölich a long and friendly letter, which he would have answered if he were not so busy that he hardly finds rest. Bullinger should therefore apologize to Haller on his behalf. It is particularly pleasing that both will now serve the Zurich church as colleagues! Haller admonished Frölich to beware of the dogs and not to fall into the traps of bloodthirsty people, so that he can continue to be of use to the community. Unfortunately, the Augsburg state no longer requires the services of the insignificant Frölich, and instead recruited others, namely traitors who risk everything. The godlessness of the superiors has twice prompted Frölich to request his release. A third time he pleaded with the councilors not to expose him to the wolves any longer, as he could no longer be of service to them. But they did not want to listen. He would completely despair before the impending catastrophe if he did not know that strength and salvation lie with God. Everything else will be told in sequence by the trustworthy messenger [Froschauer].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Zurich pastors hereby receive the book that Johannes Pedioneus wrote about the [Schmalkaldic] War to the shame of his homeland and the truth! A refutation is attached to it. Frölich would be pleased if this were published as soon as possible, after Rudolf Gwalther or someone else has revised it stylistically. Frölich is willing to cover the costs and only receive a few copies as compensation. An excellent poet [Thomas Naogeorg] has briefly and appropriately put these ungrateful people in their place with his pen!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings, also to Haller, to his family, and to all colleagues.</p>

      <p>S. I am glad that you have received my last letters in good faith. If I am not mistaken, they contained something of some importance. In return, I received your letters through the courier Froschauer, which was more than welcome. There is no need for you to thank me for my loyalty and goodwill towards you, as these are far less than what would deserve favor or gratitude from you, an incomparable man and most desirable to me. I frankly admit that I cannot adequately repay such great friends, whom I have by the grace of God. However, do not doubt my spirit and willingness to please, my most distinguished Bullinger! I will be yours forever. Even if the sky falls or the elements fail, I will steadfastly adhere to you.</p>

      <p>The matter of the council has been completely entrusted to the Emperor by the Imperial Estates. The Emperor, in turn, entrusts the resolution of religious matters entirely to the Council of Trent. The Pope would not refuse this, as long as his power to interpret the scriptures and councils, the election of the pope by only the cardinals, and such prerogatives remain intact and unchallenged before the council begins, which he has long demanded from the Emperor, threatening that unless this is entirely granted to him, he will not hold the council. Therefore, the struggle continues to this day over this article. The Cardinal of Trent has long gone to Rome to announce either war or peace to the Pope: war, indeed, unless the council is convened in Trent as soon as possible.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Moreover, it is not entirely unfounded that Malvenda, the confessor, and others are working to create an "Interim." The "Interim" is called a formula according to which our churches are to be governed in the meantime, until the council is held. What kind of "Interim" this will be can be gathered from its creators, namely the murderers.</p>

      <p>It is very beneficial for the Swiss to be in concord, but it is unpleasant for the adversaries, although few believe that there is complete agreement among you or that the concord is so firm that a donkey loaded with gold could not cause discord. There is indeed a great secret inquiry by some spies as to whether the Swiss are preparing for war, whether they are expecting auxiliary troops from the French, etc. In this, they are almost certain: five cantons will defect from the others. The baptism of the French king's daughter would provide a convenient occasion for meeting, unless the Roman ceremonies stand in the way. If you send delegates to attend the baptism, you will partake with idolaters; if you refuse the offered honors, the king will take it badly. I am eager to know what you will do, although perhaps the ceremonies around baptism do not seem to matter much.</p>

      <p>My lord and brother Haller has sent me a long and delightful letter, to which I would have replied if I were not overwhelmed with so many tasks that there is hardly any time for rest. Therefore, I ask you to excuse me to him. I congratulate you and him exceedingly on the most holy fellowship and the beneficial ministry to your church. Haller reminds me, among other things, to beware of the dogs, lest I fall into the snares of the bloodthirsty, to be of use to the republic for a longer time, etc. O my Haller, this republic of ours has no further need for the insignificant Laetus! They have indeed taken on others, namely those with red caps, upon whom everything stands and falls. I have twice indignantly requested my dismissal because of the impieties of the leaders. A third time I earnestly prayed that they would not let me, who can no longer be of service, continue to be endangered among the wolves, but send me away. Yet I could not even obtain this, thus seeing the calamity and destruction before my eyes, I would be consumed if strength and help from above were not at hand. The rest will be recounted in order by the excellent courier, to whom, as you should and usually do, give credit. He will recount everything in order.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Finally, you, the Zurich brothers, will receive the book that Pedioneus wrote about the German War, and the notes he has branded both on the homeland and on the truth. You will also receive here an apologetic letter, which I would like, if it is possible, to be published as soon as possible, but only after it has been reviewed and refined by Lord Gwalther or someone else. I will gladly pay the full price, just to receive a few copies. There is a certain distinguished poet who will soon wield his pen worthily against the ungrateful man.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell and greet Haller with his household and the other brothers individually. December 17, 1547. Forgive the carelessness and haste.</p>
