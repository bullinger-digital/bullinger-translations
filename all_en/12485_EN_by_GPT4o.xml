    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius recently sent a letter [No. 2428] through Heini [Spät?]. Since Emperor [Charles V] left the German [Netherlands], everything has been quiet. As Junker [Heinrich von] Ostheim reported, upon his arrival in Speyer, Emperor [Charles V] avoided the clergy waiting for him outside the city by entering through another city gate, which the deceived clergy only realized two hours later. In such a manner, [Charles V] cannot win over the German [Catholics].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [In Basel] people are eager to know what judgment will be passed on the fratricide [Alfonso Diaz], because some who came from Innsbruck suggested he would be presented to the infamous [Charles V] in Regensburg. Pope [Paul III] views this cruel murder as a success.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Myconius is not yet aware of the response from the Swiss Confederates to those from Constance regarding [the request of the German] Protestants. The majority seems to have received it favorably. Only the [Five Places] wanted to first submit it to their [authorities]. [King Francis I of] France has communicated the peace [of Crépy] with Emperor Charles V [through his envoy], but according to the papal legate [Albert Rosin], this peace is not lasting. The powerful apparently do not know what they are doing! Perhaps Bullinger can provide more details.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings to [Rudolf] Gwalther, whom Myconius admires for his translation [“De providentia sermones X”] as much as the author [Theodoret of Cyrrhus].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The enclosed [letter] is intended for the Mayor of St. Gallen [Joachim Vadian].</p>

      <p>S. I wrote very recently through Heini. In the meantime, nothing has happened worth writing about. Since the Emperor left Germany, everything has been quiet. Incidentally: Ostheimer, a noble man, told us these days that when the clergy of Speyer heard the Emperor was approaching, they left the city in great numbers to receive him. However, when he learned of this, he diverted and entered through another gate with a few people, spending two whole hours in the city before the deceived clergy realized what had happened, which they did not interpret well: for the sacred crowd was quite irreverently disregarded. I then said: "If he acted like this while he was in Germany, he did nothing that pleased, no matter what his intentions were."</p>

      <p>We here are eagerly awaiting what judgment will be passed against the fratricidal robber. For some who were in Innsbruck think he will be sent to Regensburg to the Emperor. A remarkable deed, if you consider the Pope and his followers; cruel and atrocious, if you consider the matter itself. Let us see, therefore, what place we have with him and who his disciples are. Let us therefore more diligently apply ourselves to what the Lord has taught us, so that we may become great with God, with whom I have long ceased to doubt that this one is cursed.</p>

      <p>I do not yet know what response the people of Constance have received in the name of the Protestants from the Swiss, except this: The majority did not respond unfavorably. Only the Pagans wanted to refer the matter to their own. Furthermore, the Frenchman indicated how he is now in the highest peace, and the papal legate said that peace between the Frenchman and the Emperor will not be lasting. Those magnates do not know, I believe, what they are doing. If you have anything more certain, please share it.</p>

      <p>Farewell in Christ with all your saints. I have Gwalther's booklet in my hands. I admire both the author and the translator almost equally. Please greet him diligently.</p>
