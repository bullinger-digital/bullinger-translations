      <p>Your letters, my dear Calvin, written in July, I finally received in August. I am responding to them later: for now, I am overwhelmed with business, and I am almost consumed with grief because of the destruction of the churches in Upper Germany. Recently, even Konstanz has fallen, surrendered itself to the King of the Romans, and received 800 garrison soldiers. The best citizens, among whom are Blaurer the Consul, Zwick, Labhart, Hurus, and many other notable ones, have left their homes and properties and fled to Thurgau. Master Ambrosius, compelled by the wickedness of the citizens five weeks ago, went to his sister in Thurgau and has been hiding there until now.</p>
      <p>He endures unspeakable hatred. Now even Master Thomas Cos. and his brother, an incomparable man, have gone to him. Now indeed, the evil also threatens us. We are waiting to see what the enemies of the truth will attempt against us either this winter or in the spring. May the Lord be with us and strengthen us in His holy truth, so that we may not admit anything unworthy of our profession. Pray for us. Our people are still eager, fearless, and steadfast, ready to face any dangers: but unless God watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain. Our sins, bloodshed, ingratitude, greed, contention, envy, and other similar things weigh us down, all of us who bear the name of Christ: and we deserve that the Lord should awaken us with a scourge. Yet He is merciful and gracious if we meet Him with true faith and holy prayers. If it pleases Him to deliver us from this world, He will free us from countless evils and grant us eternal life.</p>
      <p>To Him be glory forever. Pray for us and greet all the brothers. Master Bibliander, Gwalther, Pellican, Werdm√ºller, and finally all the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 15th October 1548.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
