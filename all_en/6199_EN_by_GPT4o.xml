      <p>We in Württemberg have had a small war, caused by the abbot of Zwiefalten, who does not always act in a good Württemberg manner nor entirely comply with the rules, and wants to replace the new abbot; for after he refused and did not want Württemberg (which should be the protector of the monastery) to muster the poor people of the monastery, of which he has a considerable number, as is customary at times when the land is mustered, the duke sent over 300 armed horses there on the morning of Tuesday, July 6th, and drove all the peasants of the monastery from 37 villages, belonging to the monastery, to the usual assembly place, where the old duke had previously also mustered them, like sheep, and compelled them to enter. However, the abbot made his escape with some horses and much money.</p>
      <p>God knows what will come of this. The peasants have sworn, and the riders returned the same Saturday. God grant that nothing worse comes of it! For the abbot boasts of a treaty, through which he was reconciled with Württemberg during the Schmalkaldic War by the then imperial majesty; he refers to this, etc.</p>
      <p>From the king of France, there is little hope anymore for the sake of the gospel, and it is expected that he will support Savoy against Geneva and others. Also, the hired soldiers from the Duke of Alba expect no luck, and the child has another father than is claimed; therefore, everyone should look out for themselves and make friends with God and discuss all matters with Him; that will be best. Regarding Brenz, whom you wish to know about his pardon, I have learned that the duke has given him a small castle, a nobleman's seat, not far from Bülach, but Brenz found some deficiencies in it, which he asked the duke to remedy; however, it has been improved so much that he said Brenz could well make use of it.</p>
      <p>I have not been able to learn more.</p>
      <p>The book, about which I once wrote to you, has been suppressed; I hope to obtain it again; then it will be shared with you. All Schwenckfeldian books are being printed in several volumes.</p>
      <p>The first has already been published; Württemberg requested it from a count; he sent it to him, and I was mentioned before the duke like Pilate in the Creed; for the prince was informed that I had it printed; this is true, for I did not prevent it, but otherwise, God knows, I am not at all to blame for it.</p>
      <p>In Esslingen, it is dying very violently, so that Württemberg has cut off all access and trade with them, how Christian that is, God knows. Oh, how far we are still in this and other matters from Christian faithfulness and love, etc.!</p>
      <p>Hitherto my Schärus.</p>
