    <p xml:id="regest1">Capito, who has made significant contributions, will personally report on the successful outcome of the Bern Synod and the resolution of the Megander dispute. He wishes to have his letters addressed to Zwingli returned and again requests guidance for the study and interpretation of Exodus 7:1-11:10. The collection from the Synod is intended to benefit the preachers who have fled to Zurich. To Haller's regret, the Synod records will not be printed by Froschauer. Bullinger is asked to burn Haller's letters regarding the Megander dispute. Inquires about Zwingli's "Annotationes" and asks whether Rhellikan will be recalled to Zurich. Diethelm Röist would be the most suitable mediator between Zurich and Bern.</p>

      <p>Greetings. How sacredly and successfully the matters of the synod and Megander have been conducted among us by Master Capito, dearest brother, he himself will report in person, and in a few days you will see the printed excuses.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I would like to earnestly request that my letters, which I wrote countless times to Zwingli, be returned to you through Capito's efforts, just as our brother Zuickii indicated that the letters to the people of Constance were returned. For I wrote many things that could be turned to the worst part by an unjust reader. Therefore, I sent him the decrees by which our magistrate abolished pensions, which I would like to be restored if they still existed. But in the meantime, words would fail if I had to describe to you how well everything turned out. We never knew Capito until now. We were 220 brothers gathered for four days.</p>
      <p>Finally, regarding the matters to be resolved from the next letter, namely the plan of my study, and how that place in Exodus concerning the hardening of Pharaoh's heart should be addressed before the people, please send it.</p>
      <p>The brothers also send the collection of the entire synod, which we entrust to you and the brothers Leo, ministers of the word, to distribute to those who are exiled in Waggental and other places. Just let us know who, how many, and how large the families are, so that if they are in greater need, we can distribute something.</p>
      <p>As for why the acts are not sent to Christoph to be printed, it is because some, as they are among all, have the word to say, "they are printed by the bears, they have no quarrels on the tapes," and I don't know what else, since I know well that Christoph is so pious and honest, also innocent in this matter like a sheep, that rumor was so harmful. Therefore, advise the man most dear to me. However, Capito can conveniently excuse himself to our senate with letters.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I have learned from experience how whole, faithful, and sincere your mind is towards me, since you have responded so precisely to everything. I would like this one thing from you forever, that you burn what I wrote about the Megander case. Finally, indicate whether there are any remaining annotations of Zwingli to be printed.</p>
      <p>Farewell and reply to this message of ours.</p>
      <p>January 16, in Bern.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. Haller.</p>
      <p>I hear that Rellican is seeking the position among you. If he is accepted, write to me. For I fear he cannot be kept in this position with us for much longer. To restore the friendship of both cities, no one would be more pleasing, indeed more suitable, than Röist, who, if he were sent to us once, could do much.</p>
      <p>To the dearest brother Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned ecclesiastic among the Zurichers.</p>
