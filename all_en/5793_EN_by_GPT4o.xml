      <p>S. In recent days, one of our citizens from Feldkirch came up to us, an honest fellow; he reported how another from Feldkirch came to him in a place he knew well, because he had once served here in Chur.</p>
      <p>He told him how he recently came from France, was under the enemy of the Count of Ringen, had suffered with the others, namely that the Count of Ringen along with 22 of his banners were defeated and completely scattered.</p>
      <p>Haec ille; but I dare not believe it until I have confirmation from you.</p>
      <p>Dr. Tobias Egli writes from Davos that some of their pack animals came from the Swiss area of Steinen; there they heard that there was a battle, and the Huguenots were victorious.</p>
      <p>One from Bellinzona, related to the honorable mayor Ambrosi, also heard that a great number of people were slain.</p>
      <p>What is true now, we desire to learn from your reverence.</p>
      <p>T[uus] F[abricius].</p>
