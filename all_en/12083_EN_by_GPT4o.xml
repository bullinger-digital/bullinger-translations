    <p xml:id="regest1">Enclosed, Bullinger receives a letter indicating the situation regarding the son [Felix Lavater] of the [Zurich] treasurer [Hans Rudolf Lavater]; the Augsburg councilor [Hans Zangmeister], to whom Blarer entrusted this matter, is an exceptionally good person. It pains Blarer that the nephew [Josua Bullinger], son of Bullinger's brother [Johannes Reinhart], has been enticed to St. Gallen; had Blarer known about it earlier, he would have at least delayed this foolish endeavor. Hardenberg wrote from Strasbourg that he had sent Bullinger the [“Epitome”] by Johannes a Lasco; Blarer would also like to read it. He does not dare to detain his brother-in-law [Heinrich von Ulm], [to whom he entrusted this letter], who is returning to [Grießenberg], any longer. In Ulm, the city assembly is supposed to convene on November 24. The Württemberger [Duke Ulrich] has captured and tortured citizens of Esslingen. Bucer greatly regrets the dire state of the churches; if only it were as easy to treat as it is to diagnose. Certain people - though not Bucer or anyone Bullinger would know! - think it would be good if everyone conspired to condemn the Zurich church. Greetings; more soon.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You receive here a letter, from which you will understand the situation regarding the son of your treasurer. The senator and a very good man in Augsburg, to whom I had entrusted this matter, is taking care of it.</p>
      <p>Your nephew from your brother has embraced another master of the arts in St. Gallen and is no longer with us here. It has troubled me greatly that he allowed himself to be enticed to St. Gallen; if I had known in time, I would certainly have, if nothing else, at least delayed these foolish endeavors.</p>
      <p>Hardenberg wrote to me from Strasbourg that he had sent you the Institution of the Eastern Frisian Church, authored by Mr. Johannes a Lasco; I ask you, my brother, to send it to me to read as well, when it is convenient.</p>
      <p>I do not dare to delay my brother-in-law, who is hurrying home. The assembly in Ulm will be on November 24.</p>
      <p>The Württemberger has thrown some citizens of Esslingen into prison, and then also inflicted some unknown force on others. Bucer greatly laments the very miserable state of the churches of our age, as it truly is; and if only it were as easy to remedy as it is to recognize!</p>
      <p>Some write to many that it seems advisable for everyone to conspire to condemn the Zurich church, etc. But, as God loves me, do not suspect anything, nothing of the sort has been written to me by either Bucer or anyone else known to you by face, etc.</p>
      <p>But farewell now with all yours, to whom I commend myself. All of ours greet you. More soon.</p>
      <p>In Constance, November 19, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the Zurich church, my venerable and dearest brother.</p>
