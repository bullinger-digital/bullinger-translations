      <p>Dear and highly trusted, dear lord and brother, I have written to you several times, among other things, that as soon as our dear Haller arrives with you, you should let me know the same by your own messenger, if it cannot be done otherwise; for I intended to make myself available to him, as he has requested of me. However, something else has come up since then, which would not fit at all or only with great inconvenience at this time, and I have been advised against it by some good friends for various reasons, especially since the four evangelical cities of yours are meeting with you at this time; for it might very easily happen that a useless person becomes aware of my presence and spreads such news to Constance, whereby I would fall into suspicion, as if I might otherwise be practicing something, as I am already suspected, as if I were engaging in various dealings here and there, as it has also been falsely reported by my ill-wishers that Schärtlin's servant and others are in contact with me. Therefore, I am careful, as best I can, not to give anyone reasonable cause for suspicion in these matters, and not only I, but also my family, who are already quite rebellious and in danger, must pay for it. I have therefore considered it better to inform you and dear Haller of my opinion regarding my calling to Bern in writing, and then you can present the same to the envoys and messengers from Bern on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I want to ask you both as friendly and diligently as possible to present and handle it according to my Christian trust, and also to ensure that the messengers bring it to their lords; if it seems better to you that I write to the messengers myself, I am not opposed to it, but I believe it is just as good and sufficient if it is done through you, as if I handled it in writing or even orally with them. However, the matter of my calling to Bern is, in the depths of my heart and in truth, as follows:</p>
      <p>Firstly, I consider this calling from God, as well as from Bern, as significant, although I must also think that it might not be entirely sincere on behalf of dear Haller, as I hear that he is seeking to return from there and therefore insists that I or someone else come there, so that he may be released and allowed to return.</p>
      <p>But regardless, and even if the matter here is entirely legitimate and sincere, the love on behalf of Bern and the great necessity on my part require that I do not conceal my shortcomings and burdens in any way, so that neither they are deceived nor I am overburdened beyond my ability without their benefit and with great detriment to myself.</p>
      <p>My shortcomings are primarily these: Firstly, I do not possess such skill, understanding, or other abilities that are of great necessity for this excellent, very extensive administration of this office, as it should be according to its requirements, and it is truly not to be found in me, which the pious people of Bern might be seeking in me, perhaps due to Haller's or others' imagination. I do not write this, as often happens, out of humility, thinking less of myself than I am truly endowed; for I know well that everyone should and must recognize their talents received from the Lord; for how else would he trade with them and gain much without recognizing in truth that I should rightly consider and regard myself as too insignificant for such an excellent service in view of my small abilities.</p>
      <p>Secondly, I am not well-suited for the fact that I do not have the language (and yet this people particularly values a preacher speaking in the vernacular) in a large community, as I have not been understood by many in Constance, where there are not as many people, on the days when gatherings were well attended and the church was full, and therefore I have never preached in the churches in Augsburg, but only in the preaching house, where one must gather closely together, and similarly, I have had to preach in the barefoot monastery in Ulm, where there is a small church, because my voice could not carry in the parish churches.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, even if there were no lack in the two aforementioned points, which is truly great, I have now reached such an age that I must expect to decrease more and more in memory, vigor, and other strengths of body and mind from day to day, and have no hope of increase or improvement. Therefore, I would soon succumb to such great labor and various toil, care, and unrest, which I have never had even in better and more capable years, and thus become useless not only to those in Bern but also to all others, whereas I might otherwise still render my possible decent service to a small community for several years, speaking naturally and humanly, with fruit and benefit from God's grace.</p>
      <p>And although I know that it is entirely possible for the Lord God to make the old, weak strong and vigorous, and the completely ignorant and foolish wise and prudent, I also know that He does not always want to perform miracles in such matters without necessity, and that it is often presumption and temptation of God when one undertakes greater and more difficult tasks than one is capable of, unless there is great necessity, which I do not see in this case, especially since the excellent and very learned man Wolfgang Meuslin is now also present and without any position or calling, and is several years younger and much more capable in all things related to this matter than I am, who has also been suggested to those in Bern by you, as you have previously written to me, and he would undoubtedly allow himself to be called to such a position (as he is also obliged), to which I would then also strongly and best I could encourage him, with the firm hope that he would not refuse. If there are any concerns about this man regarding his teaching, especially concerning the sacrament, one should rightly have such concerns about me as well; for I have no lack in his confession, as he has made it known in his commentaries on Matthew and otherwise, and I must fully agree with him with my heart and conscience in all things, which I must rightly confess here, so that it may not be said later that such things were not expected of me, and that my teaching did not correspond to the assumption made of me. And since we are of the same teaching and he is much more and higher gifted in all other matters related to the subject than I am, I must acknowledge that he should be promoted much more rightly than I, and also with much more benefit and fruit for the church.</p>
      <p>I would not fail to suggest to you, so that nothing may be found wanting in me and I may keep my conscience clear and justify myself before God; for it is truly the case with me that you would do wrong and injustice if you do not promote this man to the best of your ability, and if I could do so as you can and had to choose between Müslin or Blaurer for this or another prominent position, I testify with God to the highest that I would take no suspicion in doing so nor look around or consider in any way, but would prefer Meuslin to Blaurer many times over, if both were known to me in terms of their gifts as they are. So much now briefly about my shortcomings.</p>
      <p>These are the main burdens. 1. Firstly, the size of the community and consequently also the amount of work, not only in the city but also in the countryside; I have experienced in Württemberg what a toil and great burden it is to sit as a target for every pastor and others, to hear their concerns and advise and assist or at least comfort them. I truly knew no more to do or to suffer than I endured in the aforementioned principality and several other places, where I came many years ago and am now so much older and less capable. You yourself, as the understanding one, can easily assess how the Bernese piety with Sophoy and their other territories is all 2. very extensive and what a toil it is to visit all these churches. 3. Also to be occupied with the marriage court. 4. Also with the schools, and as I am particularly informed now, that they also want to establish public lectures and arrange other things beneficial to the matters.</p>
      <p>It is also particularly burdensome to place oneself in such a discord, which is still all green and very difficult, as I hear credibly, that the tension regarding the sacrament is still entirely unresolved and therefore causes some displeasure and bitterness among many in the city and countryside.</p>
      <p>In summary, it is undoubtedly the case at that place, as dear Haller himself writes about it, that there is much and great work, which, however, is too much for an old man, even if he otherwise had the skills, which I truly do not have, and especially when one has no one or very few people with whom he can find much help and advice and thus lighten his burden, as I have been credibly informed that outside of Haller, who is soon to be called back to Zurich, there is nothing special to be found among the other dear and good church servants in the city, who are also all unknown to me, "you may well, (since it is somewhat hot) refrain from doing so." which I truly do not mention to belittle the faithful men, but only to report and highlight the burdens that arise in this matter, so that you may see that I would not willingly proceed and act in this matter without great cause, so that I would not lead myself or others to a harmful obstacle.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I have left aside my private and personal concerns, which I could humanly consider as highly burdensome, of which there are also not a few, for I should and would gladly bear them with the help and grace of my God in patience.</p>
      <p>Now, all this, my dear and beloved lord and brother, together with our Haller, bona fide and according to my entirely brotherly trust, present to the envoys from Bern as diligently and faithfully as possible on my behalf and do not conceal anything in all this, but act according to the rule of love and do not desire to burden me beyond my ability and the church in Bern with my service more than to gladden and build up, especially since you have such an excellent, learned, and very capable man at hand, whom you (in my judgment) would do great wrong to, and also not consider the churches of Christ as you should, if you do not promote him to the best of your ability.</p>
      <p>However, I will gladly and willingly serve the lords of Bern or yours, or whoever is concerned with it, if I am called to a small place and to the service of such a church that is more suitable to my abilities and gifts of body and mind.</p>
      <p>Also, kindly and serviceably ask the envoys on my behalf to diligently present this my well-founded and truthful statement to my gracious lords, an honorable council in Bern, along with my further Christian, humble offer, that in case my excuse is not accepted, but my insignificant service is desired, I will make myself available to them for my person, without wife and child, and serve the church there for a month or two, three approximately, as best I can, so that the church may inquire about my and I about the church's situation, and whether I am suitable for such an office and strong enough to bear this heavy burden, and then further act according to the state of all things for the praise of God and the welfare of souls, to which everything should be directed.</p>
      <p>And help me, for the sake of all love, to cry out and call to the Lord God from true faith, that He may enlighten us in this excellent and very important matter with His fatherly favor and not allow that anything here is undertaken or acted upon from human temptations, but that everything is done according to His guidance, in the direction and power of His Holy Spirit, for the edification of His churches.</p>
      <p>If Haller would like to be with me himself and perhaps have a conversation with me about the matter, as it may be convenient for him, I will come to Winterthur at the day and hour he will appoint me, and wait for him there at the Crown; he should let me know without delay. I would like to be with him for a few hours; but if it seems better to you otherwise, let me know.</p>
      <p>Kindly convey my entirely Christian willing service to my gracious dear lords, the envoys from Bern, along with my humble offer of all that I could now or later show and prove to them and a whole praiseworthy Christian city of Bern for their serviceable pleasure and promotion of something good. I will call upon the Lord God with faith and from the depths of my heart, that He may guide and lead this matter through His Spirit, so that we may feel His good gracious will towards us, and that we and His believers may be gladdened and improved.</p>
      <p>However, the aforementioned statement of my burdens should only be understood in the case that I would be entrusted with the steering wheel in this ship and given it in hand; otherwise, if Haller remains there and is the rightful pastor or if Müslin or another more capable than I am is called and appointed to such a position, I will then not burden myself so much with the matter and will more easily allow myself to be a deacon and common ship's servant; this is truly my heartfelt earnestness.</p>
      <p>What dear Haller means, that I should be with the legates and him right now, would not be possible for me, as I have so much on hand and am in a very miserable household; so disorderly have I packed my books and dearest household goods, which are of little value to me, in barrels with other clutter in haste, that I must now sort them out again with difficulty and protect them from damage, in addition to having to take care of some other matters of great necessity, all of which, if I remain upright, can be done in a few weeks.</p>
      <p>Given on the 25th of November, 1548.</p>
