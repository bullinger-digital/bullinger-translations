    <p xml:id="regest1">The instructions of the school authorities were communicated to Gwalther by [Johann Jakob] Ammann, and he is to present his concerns to this authority exclusively through him. Bullinger expects a prompt report on the conditions in Marburg, as possibly Wolf, Wick, and [Haller] are to be sent there; he could only write briefly to Geldenhauer regarding the synod and urges Gwalther to press him for a response to his letter.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Ammann has informed you by letter what the school authorities want from you. You should write to him whatever matters of yours you wish to be addressed before the school authorities. Meanwhile, I do not forbid you from also writing to me about what you wish; but you will have him as your patron with them. I will not neglect the care of a father, provided you meet my expectations.</p>
      <p>From Marburg, you will quickly report on the state and condition of studies and the church: What is the state of religion, whether our religion is publicly propagated, who the professors are and what studies are pursued, and what expenses are to be incurred. If it seems appropriate, we will send Wolf, Wick, etc., to Marburg. Furthermore, you will urge Noviomagus to respond to those points for me. He was not able to write more extensively. For in these days we are holding a synod. Therefore, it happened that I only wrote a brief recommendation of you to him. Therefore, act with the utmost faithfulness in what I entrust to you, and see to it that you are pious, diligent, and honest.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my son. The family wishes you well. May 11, 1540.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Rudolf Gwalther in Basel, residing at the house of Mr. Myconius, my son.</p>
