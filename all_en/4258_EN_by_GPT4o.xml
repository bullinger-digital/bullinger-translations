      <p>Most illustrious man and always to be respected by me.</p>
      <p>I have returned safely to Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>All the letters have been faithfully delivered by me to each individual.</p>
      <p>Tilemann (Hesshusen) had left shortly before, having been called to Bremen by the senate of that city. Immediately at the very beginning, a new disturbance arose there; he did not want to be received unless Albert (Hardenberg) was first expelled; however, the church did not want to dismiss him. The Bremen senate consulted Dr. Philipp (Melanchthon), whether a synod should be convened there because of Albert and Tilemann. Philipp replied that Tilemann would not comply with any synod unless all the Tilemannic heads were present, and therefore the synod was not convened.</p>
      <p>Albert remains there still; therefore, nothing is more certain than that Tilemann will also stir up new troubles there. Furthermore, my affairs are doubtful and completely uncertain; I have not been reinstated, and they become almost worse every day because of the new commotion that has arisen in the Heidelberg church over the same controversy. However, what that is like, your kindness will understand from Peter Martyr (Vermigli).</p>
      <p>I therefore ask that you continue to have me commended to you. I tremble whenever I consider the miserable state of such a great church, which flourished so much a few months ago.</p>
      <p>My occupations are so many that I cannot write about greater matters in more detail; however, I hope you will soon see the printed history and find it pleasant. Your letter was delivered to me on the fourth of April, and the reasons I have not written until now are that I was waiting until I could report something certain about my affairs and because I thought others had already responded long ago. However, I have diligently carried out what the Lord enjoins, and I hope the Lord will receive responses from each individual.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I ask that you deem it worthy to remember me.</p>
      <p>Thus Satan rages, that even if many good people wish to help me, they do not dare because of the fear of some. Given at Heidelberg, 5th of April, in the year 60.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Wilhelm Klebitz. To the most illustrious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, always to be respected by his master.</p>
