      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I received this letter from Gervasius some time ago, but due to a lack of couriers, I could not send it sooner.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you may not be unaware of what the King of France has issued to the princes and cities of the empire, from whose rescript I wanted to note a few things that follow, so that I would not write nothing: "I earnestly and repeatedly ask you to advise your preachers, that the thought and care they have undertaken to mitigate the controversies that have arisen around religion, they should not abandon. Then, to inform me about the manner of convening the council, what you wish to be accomplished by me, and what you especially desire to be arranged with this pope," etc. If you have not seen the rescript, I will send it to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, hastily, esteemed Bullinger, along with the dearest Pellican, Theodor, Leo, and the others.</p>
      <p>We hear not very favorable things about the people of Bern.</p>
      <p>Farewell. March 28.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and brother, prefect of sacred matters of the church in Zurich.</p>
