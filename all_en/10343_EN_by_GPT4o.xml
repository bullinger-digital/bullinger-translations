    <p xml:id="regest1">New Year's greeting. A traveling Frenchman reported that the French king was going to Italy to occupy the cities that the Pope had given to his son Heinrich in marriage. Hans Junker and the envoy Antoine II Lamet will come to the Confederation with money and demand new mercenaries. The king's sister, Margareta of Navarre, remains committed to the Gospel. Morelet's brother has been imprisoned for a long time for his faith. Mayor Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl of Bern has negotiated with the French king and is now on his way back.</p>

      <p>I wish you a prosperous beginning of this year, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear brother, on Saturday night in Ottenbach, a Frenchman, who was very forcefully detained, sent for me (to act as an interpreter). He said that the king was going with a military campaign to Montani√ü to occupy the cities given by the Pope to his son in marriage. Hans Junker is coming to Lucerne with a powerful army and a large sum of money to pay the Confederates and then to take 20,000 men from them to Milan (the lands cannot afford this; guess what lies beneath). He also told me that the king's sister still lives strongly by the Gospel, but she has never been captured; however, Morelet's brother has been imprisoned for a long time for the sake of the Gospel, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the mayor of Bern, Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl, has been with the king himself, negotiating for a long time. No one knows what about. However, he was treated with great honor, and the king and he are in great agreement, and he is now on his way home. He was also with the king for 8 days. He rides earnestly into the Confederation (this).</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my brother, in Zurich.</p>
