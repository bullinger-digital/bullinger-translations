      <p>Greetings. If this messenger were not conveniently going to you now, I would not have troubled you with this brief letter of mine; but through him, you can conveniently reply about the affairs of France, about which the most distressing news is reported daily, causing me great distress. I am almost consumed with grief; it pains me deeply that the truth is being blasphemed, idolatry is being restored, the holy confessors of God and the wretched common people are being so miserably slaughtered by barbaric cruelty, and the impious are rejoicing so greatly. However, you are compelled to hear many such complaints daily, so I ought not to increase your sorrow.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, that He does not forsake us forever. The lie or Mendoza, the French envoy, is still requesting 8 banners from the 8 cantons, which somewhat consoles me; for if the affairs of the papists are as successful as they proclaim, why is it necessary to increase the army? I hear nothing more about the English; I fear that what has been reported about their arrival is in vain, and I fear the Germans will come after the festival; for it is said here for certain that Orl√©ans is being besieged very severely. I hope to hear better news from you through this Pole, who will return to us shortly; I commend him to your kindness; for he is a good man and very devoted to our doctrine, who, if he ever returns to his homeland, will be able to greatly help the church. Farewell, esteemed lord and dearest brother, and let us continually beseech our Lord God to have mercy on us and deliver us from our most hostile enemies. Greet Mr. Beza, wherever he may be, Mr. Jonville, Bude, and our other friends; all of ours greet you and all of yours. September 14, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
