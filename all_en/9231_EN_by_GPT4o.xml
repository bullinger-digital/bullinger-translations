      <p>Greetings. A certain public courier from your most honorable city and magistrate is present. What letters he has brought, I have not yet been able to find out; however, they say that the peasants and our communities, who are considering reformation, have written both to the Swiss and to Ferdinand as relatives, so that they neither wonder nor take action if they hear of new disturbances arising in Rhaetia; for no danger is being prepared for the neighbors, but out of urgent necessity, the evil that often tends to dominate in Rhaetia must be removed. Some now affirm that the signs will not return, but that from each jurisdiction a certain just number will be present, who, as the most frequent judges, will punish this trade of judgments. This perhaps would be more prudent for the matter they wish to remedy and would pose fewer dangers to the republic. But let the will of the Lord be done, which is just and holy, to which all our human affairs must be submitted.</p>
      <p>In the jurisdiction of the Ten Courts, as they call it, most would prefer to remain quiet, such as those from Maienfeld, Davos, Grüsch (etc.). But recent experience has taught what it is to be: ΕΓΡ: etc. I wonder if you have received all my letters. Now, what I have further, which might be of interest to you, there is not. I pray to the Lord to keep us all in peace. - We hear that the Frenchman will call upon the Swiss soldier. Some, and at least one whom I know and who is a citizen of this city, is enlisting soldiers in the lower parts to be led by the Venetians against the Turk. From Italy, we have no certain news about Turkish affairs, which everyone fears will be more vigilant than will be pleasing to those papal paraphernalia. Some have passed through here, who claim to have been hired by the Swiss and who are heading there, as I just wrote. 1573, March 6.</p>
      <p>Today, March 6, several syndics from each Confederation and especially the main leaders have gathered here to consult on how to soothe the people and promise action and matters against those who have sinned against the freedom of the homeland, etc.</p>
