    <p xml:id="regest1">Received through [Martin] Frecht the [„Short Confession“] of Luther, which Bullinger so eagerly desired; Bullinger should return it after reading, as there are only a few copies of it (though if there were only a single one, it would already be more than enough!); in composing his response, Bullinger should keep in mind not Luther, but the churches of Christ; Blarer read the book without benefit, with pain and in haste. Hopes that Bullinger has received his last letter sent through Sara [...] [above No. 2044]. If Bullinger already has Luther's book, he should return this copy immediately. The people of Esslingen wrote that Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg had some hunters' eyes gouged out.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received this little book, so eagerly desired by you, from our Frecht, who gave me permission to send it to you, but on the condition that, after you have used it, you send it back to us; for very few copies exist, although it seems to me that more copies exist for many, even if only a single one exists. You, with your Christian prudence, see to everything, so that you act circumspectly and write nothing to Luther, who neither deigns to hear us nor to respond to us, but write everything to the churches of Christ, to clear yourselves most modestly with them. I read it tumultuously and with such pain of mind that I have now completely forgotten what I read.</p>
      <p>But farewell with your family and commend us diligently to the Lord. I cannot write more and hope that you have received my previous letters, which I sent through Sara. Farewell again. December 13, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Amb. Bl.</p>
      <p>If you already have the book, return this one as soon as possible; for no one at all among us has read it.</p>
      <p>The people of Esslingen write tragically about the Duke of Württemberg, that he had the eyes of some poor Actaeons gouged out.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger in Zurich. Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. Zurich.</p>
