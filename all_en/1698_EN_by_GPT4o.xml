      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I have received your Decades, a gift most pleasing to me for many reasons, most illustrious man, in good faith, for which I owe you immense thanks, since the opportunity to repay you has not yet presented itself. However, I will do my utmost to ensure that I do not appear ungrateful to you (whose friendship I would never have dared to seek due to the brilliance of your learning and reputation, had I not been invited by your kindness). Therefore, it will be your role to instruct, as is your right, the one whom you have once accepted into the number of your friends, wherever there may be need. As for the books, about which I wrote recently, I have long since handed them over to Peter Mechlin (Mechlingensis) to be delivered to you along with the others, which pertain to Theodor Pellican (Pellicanum), my most esteemed uncle, and Frisius; but he sent only the letters without the package due to the carrier's excessive haste. However, I will ensure that you receive everything at the next opportunity. We have absolutely no news that I think would be unknown to you; for we are continually expecting our messengers and scouts, from whom we will soon hear how the military affair of the Frankfurt (Francfordiensium) people has been settled by the princes. There is also some rumor spreading among us about the pacification of the German princes with the emperor, which we do not yet believe, as we were persuaded by Schertlin's son, who, having come to us from Augsburg (Augusta Vindelicorum) four days ago, said he had heard nothing about such peace. Recently, the soul of the Emperor (Caesaris anima) Vesalius wrote to our Oporinus, who was accustomed to proclaim the fortunes of the Emperor in letters, but now did not even mention him in a word. However, what he is planning, the day itself will soon reveal.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live long for us and for the church of Zürich (Tigurinae) in safety. August 15, 1552, in Basel (Basileae).</p>
      <p>Your Conrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich (Tigurinae).</p>
      <p>To Zürich (Tigurum).</p>
