      <p>Greetings, my brother and most beloved godfather. May the Lord bless you and make your departure fortunate and auspicious; may the same kind and most merciful Lord deliver you from all evil and preserve you and yours from the plague. Let us diligently pray to the Lord, that He may be ours, protect us, and bless us. - I have almost countless things to write; but being overwhelmed with continuous meetings, I can do nothing. The treasurer from Bern came here with Mr. Haller, the syndic of Geneva, Roset, with Mr. Beza, and Ludwig Bovillus with the envoy from Ulm. Tomorrow they will present their business to the senate, about which more later. - Sara, the wife of Johannes Peter von Fulach, died in the house of her brother in Wedeschwyl, to the great sorrow of her family. The plague is beginning to spread moderately in the lower part of the city. - It is written that the Turk is coming to Hungary with a divided army. If you have any news from Italy, share it. The Gospel is preached in Antwerp; but many resist. I fear turmoil and civil war. Everywhere is full of dangers. Farewell. May the Lord bless you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 2, 1566. All of mine greet you; greet your friends and brothers. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, my dearest brother. Chur.</p>
