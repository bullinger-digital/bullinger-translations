    <p xml:id="regest1">Read the letters of Rudolf [Gwalther] and [Johannes] Pistorius [from the Regensburg Religious Colloquy] [No. 1523f] and was pleased that their reports agree with his own; thanks together with Dominik [Zili] and [Johann Valentin] Furtmüller for sending the letters; they also pass the news on to the neighboring churches. Thanks be to God that the Protestants can represent their position at the religious colloquy; even if the colloquy does not lead to the desired religious agreement, it will still serve the cause of faith in the long run. According to reliable sources, the army of [King] Ferdinand [I.] was decisively defeated and forced to flee, with over 10,000 casualties to mourn; the fire of the Prague Castle and Cathedral and the surrounding quarter, triggered by fire from heaven around May 15 [correct: June 2], is seen as a sign of this defeat. Is it true that the recent defeat and the strength of the Turks are attributable to the stance of the Pope [Paul III.] and the French King [Francis I.], and that the former is recruiting troops in the Confederation for the Turkish war to disguise his stance, while the latter is doing the same to prevent Swiss troop contingents for [Emperor] Charles [V.]?

      <p>I have read the letters of our Rudolf [Gwalther] and [Johannes] Pistorius and was pleased that these reports agree with ours, so that I have included in my letters not much different from what they have indicated. Although I had long since convinced myself that you have certain knowledge of all matters from elsewhere, especially those currently happening in Regensburg, nevertheless, so as not to neglect my duty and because you requested it, I preferred, as the proverb goes, to speak to one who knows, rather than to allow that, with me as the author, you might overlook things that would be very useful to know; and I will ensure that I continue to do this in the future, especially since I feel how generously and abundantly you enrich and adorn me with the interest of new matters and knowledge worthy of attention. For our Dominik [Zili] and [Johann Valentin] Furtmüller give thanks for the letters of Rudolf and Pistorius, namely those which I myself give thanks for daily and owe greatly, and I pray that you do not fail to send whatever you consider to pertain to the public consolation of both our church and the rest of the vicinity, which our ministers indeed inform safely, cautiously, and without neglect. They give thanks to the Lord, first because it has finally come to pass, by Christ's arrangement, that our people, giving an account of our faith at that public and imperial, indeed august assembly, were heard calmly and attentively; then because the account of their faith, comprehended in writing, was willingly presented to the Emperor and then referred to the knowledge of the estates; finally, because they do not doubt that a wider window has now been opened for the reception of truth, which our people have shown and confirmed with undoubtedly solid arguments to stand with us and be ours, even with hypocrisy protesting. As for what remains to be expected regarding pacification, if it is not to be what we hope for, they still think that the whole matter has been brought to a point where even the moderately pious can aim much more easily in the future than could have been done before. But enough about these matters. Hungary is ablaze with war, and indeed it is authentically reported that Ferdinand's army has been scattered with great disaster and turned to flight, with more than ten thousand lost. The prodigy of this disaster was that around the Ides of May, the Prague Castle with the cathedral church and the most equipped armory, along with more or less two hundred and forty adjacent buildings, was set on fire from heaven and burned down. But hey, do you think it credible, what many confirm: that the Pannonian disaster and the fury of the Turks are to be attributed to the Pope and the French King; and that the former, to disguise more cunningly, is now recruiting and purchasing troops in Switzerland against the Turk; the latter is doing the same to prevent any help from being hoped for by Charles from our people? May God avert these monstrous schemes from our people, which I indeed utterly dread. Farewell. St. Gallen, the day before the Kalends of July, in the year 41.</p>
      <p>Your Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the renowned church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
