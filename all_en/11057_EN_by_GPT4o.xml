    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends, on behalf of Calvin, a confession [of the Genevans regarding the doctrine of the Trinity] and takes a critical stance on it. Disapproves of the attacks on Caroli, which were also previously presented by Farel. Had no opportunity to send this letter with Scherer Philipp [...] or Sebastian [...]. Although aware that he holds no sway in Zurich and Bern, he nevertheless asks Bullinger for mediation in the dispute among the Bernese pastors.</p>

      <p>To the most learned in the Lord, D. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed.</p>
      <p>Greetings. By Calvin's order, we send these collected writings. An appendix on the confession was cut off at the end: I do not know if there is any hidden reason for this. We are displeased, not with the confession itself, but with the counsel of the confession. For what need was there to call anything into question regarding the most holy and adorable Trinity? Furthermore, why is it so unfair regarding the terms of the Trinity and person, that he stubbornly refuses to use them, even though he used them in the Catechism? But what is it to me what anyone confesses, since I can neither judge nor should judge, except as it pertains to my church? Here, indeed, I will take care as much as possible to prevent contentions from arising over mere words. However, I am quite willing to judge this: it is most unjust to wish to clear oneself in such a way as to accuse another so disgracefully.</p>
      <p>Such brothers we are. This is Christian gentleness. Indeed, I do not defend Karl, although once, that is, two years ago, he defended himself before me in person, after being accused by Farel in the most disgraceful letters written here of the same crimes: yet I cannot approve of him being treated in such a manner among good and pious men. And what, do you think, have the evangelical French achieved if Karl defends himself in a public writing? This will be a great service to the gospel. I know that Karl publicly said: If you agree to the confession commonly written in Basel, or to the one presented to the Emperor at the Diet of Augsburg, and subscribe to the Athanasian Creed, I will be yours, nothing will be moved against you: but if otherwise, there will be something that cannot be tolerated. What then moves them, if not a spirit of dissension, lest I say anything else? Would that we either did not handle the gospel, or sought the spirit of peace in the Lord with a right mind. But enough of these things from a man ignorant and foolish in all matters.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 9, 1537.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
