      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I wish you, brother Ambrosius, a happy marriage, so that you may grow old in joyful love and see the children of your children before you.</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen Luther's preface to the little work on the Bohemian faith. Therefore, I cannot respond with any certainty about it.</p>
      <p>I see that the plan of the Pope and the Emperor to convene a council aims to remove the ministers of the word partly by poison, partly by treachery, to overcome them with clamor, and to completely suppress the evangelical truth with the authority of the council. For if we refuse to go to Italy, he will blame our cause, as if we distrust it. If we go, he will have achieved what he wanted. But the victor of the world, sitting at the right hand, will first scatter the plans of the impious and will assist the growing truth with his right hand.</p>
      <p>I do not know what good can be hoped for from the King of France. He has now brought a great amount of gold into Switzerland, the poison and destruction of the Swiss cities. We fear corruption and, again, moved by certain arguments, we hope for better things from our people, which our Gregory will explain more fully.</p>
      <p>The blasphemies of Melchior, that Valentinian and blasphemous man, against Christ the Lord have terrified me all the more, as I see Strasbourg more inclined to the acceptance of such men. For Strasbourg is the gathering place of all the dregs of the worst scoundrels and heretics. Whose fault it is, I do not know. But so far we have seen the Anabaptists rush into it as if it were an asylum. Beware, brothers, beware, I implore you, not to receive anyone sneaking into Constance. Let the example of the people of Strasbourg move you. It is better not to have received heretics and hypocrites suspected of heresy and to have excluded them from the city beforehand, than to have to expel them or restrain them with flame and sword after suffering great damage, where even the punishment of their evil takes on the guise of defending their error, claiming that those thus killed are saints. No one believes how much they can influence the simple. Therefore, be vigilant, brothers, be steadfast.</p>
      <p>The triumph of our priests will soon turn into mourning. For the Lord will not forsake his own, as long as we continue to be his. Nor is there any reason to fear the envy of our people, unless I am completely mistaken. They promise me this for certain, if they cannot assist you, they will certainly not inconvenience you in any way.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brothers, together with your brothers in ZÃ¼rich and the Blarers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 25, 1533.</p>
      <p>Pray for me and our church.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger, wholly in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the dearest men, Ambrosius Blarer and Johannes Zwick, most faithful ministers of the holy church of Constance, brothers to be especially respected and dear.</p>
