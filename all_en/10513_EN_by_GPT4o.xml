    <p xml:id="regest1">Mayor [Johannes] Varnbühler of Lindau set out for the Upper German City Day in Esslingen on November 7th, as Thomas [Gaßner] wrote to Vadian. The churches reached an agreement on the issue of the Lord's Supper. Vogler's wife asks Bullinger to put in a word for her and her case [in the trial concerning her properties in the Rhine Valley] with Mayor Diethelm Röist. Greetings. With Nasal's consent, he spoke with Vadian. He was very dissatisfied; he said that Kaspar [Nasal] must be cleared of all suspicion, possibly with a letter.</p>

      <p>God's grace be with us forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>My very dear lord and brother, no special news; for I assume you know before us that the cities in the league are gathered in Esslingen. Notably, Mayor Varnbühler of Lindau, the faithful messenger, rode away last Saturday eight days ago. Thus writes the preacher Thomas of Lindau to my lord Doctor Vadian. Perhaps he writes this to you as well, so you have it doubly. And notably how a union or gathering of the churches took place, especially concerning the sacrament. I hope to God that He will take this joy from the enemies. The article is one (what more).</p>
      <p>My wife asks you, as always, to intercede, especially that you ask my lord Röist for us and our children, that he may consider us as our father; for we expect his help, along with other faithful ones. I know, if he can, he will; I can desire nothing more from him.</p>
      <p>We greet your dear household. May the Lord strengthen you as a young work tool.</p>
      <p>Telling Master Kaspar, I have spoken with my lord Doctor with his consent. He is very dissatisfied. He believes that so much should be handled here that Master Kaspar, as the pious one, is cleared of all suspicion and perhaps written to. Yet he considers what is good.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, Wednesday after Othmar, in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my very dear lord and friend M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to his hands.</p>
