      <p>Greetings. Reverend man, esteemed patron, I received the letter you kindly wrote in July of the previous year shortly after from the Pomeranian court. I am truly grateful to you for keeping the memory of me with benevolence. I sent the book by Nikolaus Marschalk on fish, along with illustrations, three months ago to Mr. Rudolf Collin in Wittenberg, so that it may be delivered to Mr. Conrad Gessner in Zurich at the first opportunity, who, as I fear, has inquired with great care regarding this book.</p>
      <p>Both I and many good and learned men would very much wish for Mr. Gessner to visit this shore of the Baltic Sea; for he could most conveniently travel to Wittenberg during the time of the Frankfurt Fair with the booksellers, from where a coachman comes to us every month.</p>
      <p>If he were to present copies of his volumes to Duke August, the Margrave of Brandenburg, our Mecklenburg princes, and the senators of the most splendid neighboring cities, he could secure a generous travel allowance. Nor would I wish him to fear the cold of this region, which I do not doubt has been milder with us this winter than in the Alps near you. We will gladly provide all services due to a most learned and excellent man, who has deserved so well of the common church and the literary republic, according to our modest means. Farewell well and happily, and forgive me for writing you a shorter letter, as I have many things to write at this time.</p>
      <p>Rostock, on St. Matthias' Day, 1556.</p>
      <p>David Chytraeus.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man, outstanding in wisdom, learning, and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, doctor of the church in Zurich. Zurich.</p>
