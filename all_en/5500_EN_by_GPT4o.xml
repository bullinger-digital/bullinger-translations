      <p>Greetings. Your illness greatly distresses me and my fellow ministers, most illustrious man and brother in the Lord, worthy of respect. We pray to the Lord to restore you to us.</p>
      <p>I also give the greatest thanks that you have arranged for a letter to be written to me from your sickbed. I also give the greatest thanks to my scribe, Jean Ville.</p>
      <p>However, I greatly fear that Rouen has already been captured, and from there all of Normandy will be miserably afflicted and devastated. If only the English would come in time! Our neighbors are greatly triumphant, they breathe nothing but slaughter, and they are again hostile to the people of Clarens. Some fear that this matter can hardly be resolved without civil war.</p>
      <p>I see many things, my lord and brother, that greatly displease me; but how to remedy such desperate matters, I do not see. I pray to the Lord, who is the good shepherd of his church, to deliver his sheep from the mouths of wolves and the most venomous hypocrites. May the Lord have mercy on France and on all of us and save us from evil! Nothing has ever troubled me throughout my life as much as this. I seem to see innocent blood being shed every hour.</p>
      <p>How long, O Lord? Save those who call upon your name. Farewell in Christ, whom I pray will restore you.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you, including Mr. Martyr and all the fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 30th October 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
