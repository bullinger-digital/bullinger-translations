      <p>S. What commission this man, who brings you my letter, has, honorable lord and relative, he himself will explain. He discussed many things with me. The thoughts of the most illustrious elector are pious and holy; however, I do not know what can be obtained from those who are harder than all stones. Meanwhile, let us enjoy this joy, that despite all these raging ones, the truth everywhere reveals itself and raises its head. You will see the rages and thunderbolts of Heshusius. We have not yet responded, until we have been further pressed. Our good cause will not lack support, as much as is in them.</p>
      <p>But in the meantime, we will also hear your advice. What our envoys have reported from France, I think you have already sufficiently learned from yours. Our envoy praises much; meanwhile, he cannot hide the dangers that also await ours. The whole hinge turns on the fact that faith cannot be placed in the treacherous; for, while these things are happening, as Merlin tells me, who greets you very much, La Rochelle was almost captured through treachery and some merchant ships, which were carrying soldiers instead of goods, and ambushes were also set for the envoys of Condé returning to Basel. Therefore, they do not know what to do; they seem to hold a wolf by the ears; for they fear that by these good promises they will be drawn into a trap again and suffer what their ancestors have already suffered. The principal men of Andelot are setting out for Basel, summoned by Condé, to deliberate on these matters; may the Lord grant that all things finally have a good and happy outcome.</p>
      <p>Regarding my private affairs, I am writing to my brother, who is now in Baden; however, he will still be able to communicate everything with you. I am beginning to go out again and, God willing, will soon preach again and will not neglect my duty, as long as the Lord supplies me with strength. I am sending back to you these letters from Chur, which my brother in Baden sent to me, and I thank you for them. I am concerned about your health; for my brother writes that you fell back into your previous illness shortly after Pentecost. Meanwhile, I hear nothing more; I therefore ask that you refresh me soon with your sweetest letters; for nothing is more pleasing to me than to hear that you are well, for if the Lord calls you before me, I will seem to be entirely dead as well.</p>
      <p>May the Lord therefore grant that I may live while you live. Farewell. Our people greet you, especially Steiger, Diesbach, Hagenberg, Musculus, all friends and brothers, especially also Schöpfius, who rejoices greatly and cannot contain himself from setting out for Colmar, where, as you already know, the gospel has recently begun to be preached. We hear, however, that Sultzer is inserting himself there with the people of Strasbourg; if only a plan could be found to counteract them! Much would depend on it if they could have a sincere minister; I have thought of Christoph Aichinger, and in my judgment, our people could achieve something if they congratulated them through some sincere envoy, who could also suggest good advice to them, since they have certainly reached this freedom through some benefit of ours. If you have any advice here, please suggest it to us and farewell happily in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 8, 1575.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, my dearest lord and relative.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>It is written that Sultzer, uninvited, has inserted himself into the ministry of the church in Colmar, as well as the people of Strasbourg and... draws them from Tübingen and confuses everything. Since the right of conferment belongs to the lords of Bern, it would be better to send a legation now... Therefore, work on this in every way, so that you do not only congratulate, therefore a senatorial legation should be sent to Colmar, etc. Above all, Aichinger would be pleasing, who teaches Schoppffe and is known and dearest to me, a pious, learned, and prudent man.</p>
