      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ the Savior.</p>
      <p>That you write so accurately and diligently to all my matters amidst the waves of so many affairs, you do not do as a habit but as a favor, and thereby you render us, indeed our entire church, much more indebted to you, to whom we are otherwise already obliged. May the Lord repay you, since I cannot repay it. As for what you understand less, what troubles me in the prescriptions used by the satellites of the Antichrist towards the ministers of the churches, consider this: The son of that pastor Fridolin in RÃ¼mlang had so insinuated himself with the Episcopalians that he was appointed to Finsler's place without our magistrate's knowledge; he also had to swear to several articles that were not tolerable to our churches, the main points of which, as our Bovillus described, I send: 1. He wants to appoint him for a year, during which he should be bound, and if he does not want to stay or if he is no longer tolerated, each should announce to the other 4 months in advance. 2. Preach every Sunday and other necessary days, 3. Preach nothing other than the biblical scripture and the holy gospel, not to incite, but for peace, calm, and unity; 4. That he wants to preach according to the peace of the land. 5. Go to the sick people, comfort them in their illness; 6. If requested, administer the sacraments; 7. Lead an honorable (as these pimps are accustomed to) blameless life; 8. Ring the Ave Maria at noon, vespers, and evening; 9. Do not engage with anyone in any kind of understanding; 10. Maintain the usury ban and the nonsense; 11. Remain with the previous corpus, as the Benedictus is called, and do not demand further. In summary: must mix dirt (honor be to your ears) among oat grains.</p>
      <p>You see, dearest Bullinger, how much danger would threaten us, indeed the churches of our faith, if it proceeded in this way. But enough about this. As for the articles of the Londoners, I do not see them as anything other than Christian, and I wish that the Lord grants the Anglican Church to persist and endure steadfastly in this confession. This one thing (although minor) I desire in both the articles and the catechism, that I would like the authorities of the scripture, from which they are derived, to be added, lest perhaps the papacy and the simpler ones think that all these things have arisen from the brains of the learned and thereby try more confidently to overthrow them in the future. Servetus, that Lernaean Hydra, I wish he had been removed from the midst; for through his disciples, he once also disturbed our church.</p>
      <p>The land of the Margrave is being devastated daily by sword and flame; rumor has it that he is in Brunswick. Our papists say that the Emperor, having made a truce with the French, has convened a diet at Ulm; whether this is true, I do not know; I would prefer Utopia to Ulm; however, let the faith be with the authors. I received the English catechism, which you gave me through Bovillus, and I give great thanks.</p>
      <p>Greet the pious on my behalf. My brothers and fellow ministers greet you most dutifully. Farewell, long safe for the church of Christ and for us. In Schaffhausen in the year 1553, I could not add the date; for I was daily expecting the return of Ziegler to you.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
