      <p>For a long time, I would have responded to your frequent greetings, dear brother and most esteemed lord, due to my longstanding affection and respect for you, if not for continuous illnesses and various occupations that have hindered me until now. However, now that I am feeling somewhat better and have opportunely encountered our Julius, the bearer of this letter, who has informed me of his desire to visit you for the sake of seeing your church, I did not want to neglect such a just opportunity. Rather, I thought it appropriate to entrust this letter to him, from which you can sufficiently infer how sincerely I regret not being able to return the due courtesies in greeting you as I desire.</p>
      <p>As for the bearer, he is faithful and well-known to me, having cultivated this province for two years and having provided clear evidence of his faith and integrity among us. He has demonstrated the grave and horrendous persecutions he endured throughout Italy for preaching the gospel. He carries with him ample testimonies of this matter. Therefore, I have no doubt that he will be commended to you in Christ; for I trust that this sole argument will hold as much commendation with you as it should to embrace him beyond any suspicion of deceit.</p>
      <p>We have something new here, which I am very eager for you to know. The one who will deliver this to you can better present the series of events to you in words than I can write at this moment.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if it pleases you, give him your undoubted trust. He was the most present spectator and the most reliable witness of all that he will narrate. And so, as he is a lover of truth, he will also be the most faithful narrator of history to you. When you have kindly, as you usually do, listened to him, I earnestly ask you, if you have the leisure, to honor me with your response to what he will propose to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Jacques de Bourgogne.</p>
      <p>Not without tears am I forced to see and hear this tragedy of Calvin and his followers, my brother. May God deign to preserve His truth perpetually. You will hear from the messenger about this story, and indeed you can believe it; in other matters, I would not dare to vouch for him as much. Greet all your comrades and my lords in Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, esteemed lord and brother, to his hands. In Zürich.</p>
