      <p>Grace and mercy from the Lord. I have long since received your letters, most kind Bullinger; afterwards, I also read the letters sent to Haimius. We live in great tribulation; the best and most favorable to the gospel and piety are dying, and it has not yet subsided. We have laid aside a thousand funerals in a very short time and in a small town, from which many have fled for safety. Pray to the Lord for us, that He may deign to deal more gently with us. I would very gladly send clothes to Titus; but so far we have not been able to, for merchants do not accept goods from houses infected with the plague. But we will now try to send them as soon as possible through a brother. The wife of the late Johannes Blasius is also bedridden; but there is hope that she will not die. Titus and Paulus have a modest maternal inheritance, so there is no concern that anything is lacking for anyone; but now people have no commerce with each other, so nothing can be accomplished. I wish to know how the affairs of the little daughter are, and if anything is lacking, let me know. Farewell, happy and long-lived. From the Court of Rhaetia, August 19, 1550. Consul Haimius sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and esteemed friend.</p>
