      <p>Greetings and peace of conscience through Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior.</p>
      <p>Your letter, which you recently wrote to me, was not delivered to me, most learned Bullinger, and for that reason, there is no response to it here. The fault for not receiving it lies with the negligence of Niklaus von Wattenwyl. When the soldiers returned from the Bremgarten expedition and greeted him, he said to me in return: "Bullinger indeed gave me a letter to deliver to you, but I do not know whether it is still in the remaining bundle of letters or not." Then I said: "Please, make an effort to find it." But in the meantime, that good man did not send it to me. Therefore, if you wrote anything at that time that would be important for me or Megander to know, I ask you to repeat it in your next letter to me. From this messenger, who will deliver this to you, I heard that you, along with your colleague Gervasius, and indeed your entire family, fled to Zurich because of the tyranny of the Five Cantons, which now, alas, rages more than Turkish-like among the people of Bremgarten and Mellingen. I rejoice and indeed congratulate you and yours for having escaped from our uncircumcised foreigners, that is, the Swiss, who were the most desired prey. On the other hand, I cannot help but grieve for the rest of the brothers who remained there, as they are forced to accept the papal abomination whether they want to or not. Indeed, those who, through their treachery, have thrown them into such great danger seem to me to be much more lamentable. For although our external religion is mixed up and down, yet I know from the mouth of Christ that no one can snatch any sheep from Him [John 10:28]. Would that the authors of such a great crime would acknowledge their misdeeds and return to the right path; for if this does not happen, they will pay the most severe penalties to God, the avenger of all crimes. Caspar Megander, Franz, and Berthold have ordered me to send you many greetings. You will also greet in my name Leo, Pellicanus, Myconius, Binder, Collin, and Aman, and finally Rudolf Thum with his wife, to whom I would like you to say that I deeply mourn the death of her father and brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>While I was about to finish this letter, the meeting of the Bernese farmers came to my mind, which they are holding here, and although I have learned little about it, yet whatever I have been able to know, I have decided to add here as a sort of conclusion. They say that among their other demands, they are asking the senate and people to remove the younger members either from the Swabians or the French, whom they call Grisons, and to replace them with Bernese of ancient and noble lineage, then to be free from minor tithes, chickens, Saturnalia, and servile duties owed to their noble lords, thirdly, to abolish the judicial court where marriage cases are discussed, fourthly, there is a rumor that they will ask the senate for the reason for this war, namely why with such expense the other bear lingered for a whole month in Zofingen and Aarau and did not want to attack the enemy. These are the rumors I hear about the farmers at present; when matters are settled and I know more certain things, I will also share them with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Bern, December 3, 1531</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Rhellikan.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, now exiled in Zurich, his dearest friend and brother in Christ.</p>
