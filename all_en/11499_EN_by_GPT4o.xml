      <p>Greetings. I came home yesterday. I would have liked to send the proceedings of Worms to you, but they could not be copied immediately. I will send them as soon as they have been copied. Meanwhile, I wanted to at least convey this.</p>
      <p>I hope that all love and unity in the Lord remain intact among us. I wish to see you all well in the Lord. May the Lord Christ guide us in His truth. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, January 28.</p>
      <p>Your brother in the Lord, Simon Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To the ministers of the Holy Gospel in Zürich, dearest brothers in the Lord Christ.</p>
