      <p>He commends himself.</p>
      <p>This past summer, most esteemed Bullinger, I visited Wallis (Valais), my homeland, three times. However, I perceived certain things there that caused me great sorrow and which I took most bitterly.</p>
      <p>I will tell you, if you are willing to listen.</p>
      <p>A certain Walliser (Valaisan) purchased several Bibles, not a small number indeed, perhaps two or three years ago in Zürich, and was discovered to be transporting this merchandise, which was most adverse to them, to the Transylvanians. Consequently, he was soon accused and handed over to the Bishop of Sion by them (the Unterwaldeners) with supplicating and even threatening letters (written in the village of Sachseln).</p>
      <p>This good man was immediately seized by the bishop, punished, and the books were sacrificed to Vulcan by the bishop's order. As a result, all those who were discovered to have given their name to the Gospel in Wallis began to be involved in great danger. The fury of the Transylvanians to destroy the Gospel of Christ is the greatest of all; they are utterly mad in this matter. Their monstrous treacheries against God and His word increase daily.</p>
      <p>For I perceived and clearly observed that the consciences of many, once pious, were shaken in Wallis.</p>
      <p>However, you know, most illustrious Bullinger, how often I have not hesitated to urge you to oppose and print many versions of the Bible at a glance, and I could recount many reasons here why I have been moved to write to your clarity and to beseech you. The knowledge of languages, most useful and necessary for all who will handle the sacred writings, is attested by the ancient canons, the judgments of the fathers, and many councils together. I could relate many of these, unless I might seem to your sublimity not to ask, but to teach (from which I could not escape the charge of disgrace). I will only add two examples.</p>
      <p>Johannes Brisgoicus, a most renowned doctor of theology, yet a papist, once an ordinary in Freiburg im Breisgau, did not undertake any reading of the New Testament to interpret unless he had compared the new version with the old; for he was wonderfully delighted and helped by Erasmus's version. Therefore, diligently considering and contemplating the reasons for the versions, he prudently equated the more harshly translated ones. He often impressed upon us how much it mattered to have examined these things more deeply in reading.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Johannes Hoffmeister, a most vigorous defender of the papist religion, provincial of the Augustinians, always carried the Campensis Psalter with another translation, which he had at hand (for that Psalter has two). But he affirmed that this other translation (which I mentioned) was Zwingli's, most praised and dear to him. God, who knows best, knows that these things are so, and may He be angry with me if these things are not true. Therefore, I earnestly beseech your highness and rather now implore you, that if you do not consider the entire Bible to be published in this manner, at least now provide a sample or taste of this future complete edition in the Wisdom books or the Psalter or Ecclesiastes of Solomon. Thus, the minds of many will be sharpened to more deeply engage in the knowledge of languages.</p>
      <p>I often heard M. Gallus, a man of the highest learning, once residing in Freiburg (for I stayed there with the highest stipend in the house of wisdom, as they call it), wishing that a Bible of many translations would someday be published. Therefore, I ask your sublime learning, for the love of God and for the promotion of evangelical light, for the sake of enlightening our Switzerland, for the good of the literary republic to be increased, and for what not to be sought, that you may allow yourself to be drawn here someday, so that you may ensure that these things are done someday. Live and farewell, the highest honor of our Switzerland, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Given in Hedelfingen on the second of September in the year etc. 57. Forgive the letter written so hastily that there was no time to reread it.</p>
      <p>Peter Venetscher of Wallis, minister of the word in Hedelfingen. To the most illustrious of all learned men among the Swiss, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger of Zürich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
