    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller wrote only yesterday [with No. 2640] through [Sebastian] Lepusculus and [Hieronymus] Gunz, but he also takes this opportunity for a letter, as this young man [...] is traveling to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Haller's frequent writings are a testament to his affection for Bullinger. Unfortunately, he has not received anything from him for weeks. Therefore, he cannot refute the many false rumors circulating about the Confederates (including that they are at war again) with verified information [from Bullinger's letters]. Bullinger should report soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] On the [Schmalkaldic] side, the situation is as recently described. In the meantime, the councilors received a still very uncertain report from the field camp. Allegedly, the [Schmalkaldic League] in a battle on October 21, after capturing numerous cannons, drove imperial cavalry squadrons into flight. [Eriprando] von Madruzzo (the brother of the Cardinal of Trent [Cristoforo Madruzzo]), and [Gian Giacomo de’ Medici, Castellan of] Musso (the old enemy of the Confederates) are said to have launched a fierce attack, but in doing so, along with two other counts [... von Bremen and Vladislaus von Bernstein] and 300 horses, lost their lives. It is considered verified that the battle claimed numerous lives and the spoils of the [Schmalkaldic League] were great. Details are still unknown, even though it is being talked about both in the field camp and in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The [Imperials] intended to ransom a captured cavalry colonel of the Emperor [Charles V.] named Hannibal [Guerini] for 15,000 guilders, but the [Schmalkaldic League] wants to hold him for now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Verified are the many plague victims and desertions among the imperial [troops]. Wandering [Italians] are being killed by the peasants or taken captive to Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The young bearer [... Schweiglin] from a respectable Augsburg family is recommended to Bullinger and [Rudolf] Gwalther. His father [Hans] is the chief guild master, right after the mayors [Georg Herwart and Simprecht Hoser]. His pious mother [Barbara, née Seitz] is entirely devoted to [Ambrosius] Blarer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [Hans] Vogler the Younger is as always: As soon as he is given his freedoms, he becomes [overconfident].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], [Rudolf] Gwalther and the others, to Anna [née Adlischwyler] and the family. Greetings from Haller's friends [Michael] Keller, Bernardino [Ochino] and Sixt [Birck].</p>

      <p>Greetings from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. Although I sent you a letter just yesterday through Lepusculus and Guntius, I cannot let this opportunity pass (since this young man is about to travel to you) without writing at least something.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Even though I do not have well-confirmed news, the frequency of my letters will be an undeniable proof of my affection towards you. However, I am surprised that I have not received any letters from you for several weeks, which I anxiously await. So many lies are being spread about the Swiss (that they are again at war with each other), that although I do not believe all of them, I cannot refute them with certainty, as I have received nothing from you. Therefore, I beg you to inform me about each of these matters.</p>

      <p>Our affairs are as I recently wrote. In the meantime, this much has reached us and has been written to our lords from the army, although even in the army it is still doubted whether it is true or not. But there is a constant rumor in the army that in a conflict of several cavalry squadrons on October 21, our forces drove the imperial troops into flight and deprived them of many of their largest and best cannons. When they learned of this, Herr von Madrutsch (the brother of the Cardinal of Trent, a cunning military man) and the Müßer (the old enemy of the Swiss) pressed so hard with their forces that they were both killed along with two prominent counts and up to 300 horses. It is certain that the skirmish took place, and so many perished, and our forces gained many horses, guns, and mules, but the identity of the persons is not yet known; however, it is being talked about clearly in the camp and also here.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>They have also captured an imperial cavalry commander named Hannibal, for whom they wanted to offer 15,000 florins. However, they intend to keep him until further notice.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It is also certain that the emperor's forces are dying and deserting heavily. The Italians would like to go home. They wander like the crows in the land. The peasants kill many of them wherever they come, and bring many of them captive into the city daily. These are the things I wanted you to know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I commend to you and Gwalther this young man because of his most honorable parents. I hardly believe there is a more pious family in all of Augsburg. His father is the chief tribune after the consuls. His mother is most pious and entirely devoted to Blaurer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Vogler holds the old position. As soon as he is given freedom, he jumps like a chamois.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell. Greet Dr. Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, and the other dear lords and brothers, as well as your most honorable wife and family. Cellarius, Bernardinus, and Xystus, my dearest friends, greet you. October 25, 1546. Johannes Haller, yours entirely.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and venerable father. Zurich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
