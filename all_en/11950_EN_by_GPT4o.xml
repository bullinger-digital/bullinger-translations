    <p xml:id="regest1">Has already written once about a new schoolmaster [No. 1880], as Veit [Kappeler the Younger] drinks and makes debts; now the gentlemen [of Chur] send the monastery bailiff with a request for help to Zurich, because papal-minded and French friends ("Germanogalli") are working towards the downfall of the school - [Johannes] Travers proves to be a capable champion, but the confrontation with Papists, Anabaptists, and pension lords is just as difficult in Chur as it was at the beginning of the Reformation -; the letter delivered by the monastery bailiff [Hans Tscharner] [above No. 1902] is addressed to those responsible for school and church [meaning the school officials; see HBBW X 71, note 1], while one to the council was omitted. Travers would prefer [Johannes] Pontisella; perhaps he could be made available to them provisionally for two years, which would also be agreeable to Comander, to whom Pontisella was once recommended by his father. In addition to the salary of 100 Rhenish [guilders], they offer him a house and garden as well as covering the moving costs for his family. The bearer of the letter can tell the news orally; request for news from Speyer [from the Imperial Diet] and from Germany. Greetings, especially from Johannes Blasius.</p>

      <p>Grace, mercy, and peace from the Lord. A few days ago, I sent a letter to you, distinguished man, in which, by the commission of the lords, we dared to request a schoolmaster from you. Veit, whom you sent to us earlier, indeed satisfies us with his learning, but his life and morals do not correspond to this office; being a companion of drunkards, he does not shy away from incurring debt. Our lords are sending the monastery bailiff to you to request once again that you assist us, so that this well-begun institution does not perish and disgracefully fall apart. For many among us, namely the papists and the French friends ("Germanogalli"), are plotting against this institution and would like to see it oppressed. But Lord Travers is present and shows himself to be a vigorous defender, so that the adversaries do not enjoy the fulfillment of their wishes with these goods. Here in Chur, we must contend against the papists, against the Anabaptists, and against the pension lords just as we did at the beginning, when the gospel began to be preached. Therefore, act so that we are not deprived of your help and the smoldering wick is not completely extinguished. The bailiff, the bearer of the present letter, has letters to the lords of Zurich, those who are in charge of schools and matters pertaining to religion. He would also have one to the council; but we thought it unnecessary to obtain from them, but only from those ordinary ones appointed from the chapter and the council. Our Travers would especially desire our Pontisella; at least he could be granted to us for two years, with your grace and beneficence reserved for him, so that he would obey when recalled by you; but we ask to comply with this brief time, if it can be done with his consent. Indeed, he is very dear to me and always has been, having been commended to me by his father, then acting as a guardian of sorts, but educated by your beneficence, so that he may also, by God's grace, benefit and serve the church of Christ. Therefore, dear Bullinger, make an effort so that we may be provided with someone, even if not Pontisella, yet with someone else. They promise a stipend of one hundred Rhenish guilders, a house and garden, and even the expenses for Pontisella, so that he can move his family to us. The rest, the bailiff sent to you will explain orally. He will narrate the news better than I can write. If you have anything from Speyer and from Germany, please share it with us. Farewell. From the court of Rhaetia, April 29, 1544. Your brother Johannes Blasius greets you very much. We all greet the brothers, the ministers of the church of Zurich. Yours most devotedly, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and primary friend.</p>
