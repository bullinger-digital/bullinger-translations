      <p>Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus, etc.</p>
      <p>A friendly greeting with all due respect, love, and goodness, especially to you, dear lord and brother. My request and desire is for you to hear the best from me; if I can serve you in any way, whether small or great, I am inclined and willing, etc. I am informed, dear lord, that Lord Lorenz Meyer of Glarus has passed away; I served him faithfully while I was fulfilling my preaching duties in Romanshorn, where he owed me 10 b and 7[?] in loans.</p>
      <p>He sent books to Ludwig in Thun, and in the meantime, I bought 4 ells of cloth from Hans Brüdermann in St. Gallen and gave him the money for it; they cost 17 b. In all this, he sent me a testament, which cost 10 b; he always indicated to me and promised to send it to me, but it never happened. He still owes me 24 b.</p>
      <p>My request to you, as a gracious lord and brother, is that you help me with this, as my lord's wife, children, and goods have been taken, and I am sending this through this messenger to save costs; for I am a poor preacher with many small, unprovided-for children, otherwise, I would not pursue this matter. My request to you is that you do the best on my behalf.</p>
      <p>May the city be worthy of your honor, etc. Gratia domini Iesu Christi sit vobiscum.</p>
      <p>Given on the 12th day of September in the year 64.</p>
      <p>Your faithful and willing Georg Mönhart, preacher in Kirchberg in Toggenburg.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned lord, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of a praiseworthy Christian community, my especially gracious lord. Zurich 64.</p>
