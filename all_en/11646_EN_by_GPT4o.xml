    <p xml:id="regest1">Martin Mötteli, the pastor of Weinfelden, must answer at the next Baden Diet for allegedly inciting the destruction of images; Zwick asks Bullinger on behalf of all colleagues to recommend the innocent pastor to the Zurich envoys. Greetings from Ambrosius [Blarer], who must preach tomorrow and therefore does not write himself; this is Zwick's first letter since his recovery, although he would have preferred death. His brother Konrad is looking for a teacher.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>I do not know if you are familiar with Martin Mötteli, the pastor of the church in Weinfelden in Thurgau, a man commendable in many ways. He seems to be in danger because of idols destroyed by a certain girl, who, with misguided zeal, laid hands on them. But at the next Baden Diet, he is compelled to respond to the accusers, which he will do truthfully and steadfastly. You know, however, what sometimes must be feared from those who do not favor our religion, and there are those who burden this good and innocent man with suspicion, as if the girl committed this deed at his instigation. But he is as innocent as you are. And since he is a learned and pious man, we all, as many as are ministers of God here, ask you to recommend this excellent man most diligently to your envoys.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius would have written to you as well, but he is hindered by the sermons he must deliver tomorrow. However, he sends you his most earnest greetings along with all the brothers. And let these be the first letters to you after my resurrection from the dead. Would that the death of the body had been conquered for the life of the soul!</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Constance, February 18, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Brother Konrad is looking for a young man suitable for teaching boys, not highly, but moderately learned in Greek and Latin, yet honest and pious. If you knew such a one, you could inform me of this in a few words.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to his hands.</p>
