They are pleased that the people of Geneva have come to their senses after his expulsion and have urged him to return through an embassy; they admonish him not to resist God's call, as Jonah tried to do. While the church in Strasbourg is well provided for, Viret stands alone in Geneva, not to mention Lausanne, therefore Strasbourg must let him go, just as the church of Antioch did with Paul and Barnabas. The example of Christ, the good shepherd, obliges him not to abandon the sheep who seek him - Paul also continued to care for the communities he founded -; the advance of [Jacopo] Sadoleto has shown how much Geneva is in danger. God will help Calvin to overcome the difficulties; the city at the junction between France, Italy, and Germany is the right place for him to work for the kingdom of Christ through word and writing. The people of Zürich trust that he will not resist their pleas.</p>

      <p>Doctors and pastors of the church of Zürich to Calvin, brother in Christ, to be respected.</p>
      <p>Although it has always been most pleasant for us to write to you, most illustrious man and venerable brother in Christ: at this time, however, we have judged it not only pleasant but most necessary, unless we wish to be called and considered deserters of the glory of God, the churches of Christ, and our duty. For we write to him whom both the love of Christ and the highest virtue have united to us with the closest bond of friendship, with whom we do not doubt that we can both do and obtain everything. Nor is there a need for us to win your attention and goodwill with a long preface, since your goodwill towards us has long been most evident to us: hence we also believe that you will weigh more the simplicity and candor in our letters than ornament or splendor.</p>
      <p>There is no need to recount how much the cunning of Satan and the arts of hypocrites can do, since in you alone a clear example has been shown, who, a few years ago, driven out of the city and church of Geneva by their wicked machinations and conspiracies, came to Strasbourg, where you, an exile and expelled from your homeland, were received with the highest honor. Having regained their sight through the grace of the Lord, they began to recognize your faith and diligence, which they could not previously appreciate, and who were the true and who the false prophets, so much so that, having expelled others, they have, as we hear, recalled you alone with the highest wishes of all through a most honorable embassy, and have thus borne an excellent testimony to your innocence and faith. This matter has brought not a little joy to us and to all the pious, as is fitting. Nor do we doubt that you too have been affected by a certain singular joy at such news, however it may have happened that you have so far delayed your return to your Genevans. Therefore, we wanted to encourage you with our letters, which we believe, unless we are mistaken, have great weight with you, not to neglect and despise this calling of God. We are not unaware of the obstacles that the flesh is accustomed to object to deter you from your purpose: They expelled me without cause, they are unworthy for me to revisit, they are inconstant and frivolous, and countless others of this kind. But to these voices, whether flattering or vain, it befits the soldier of Christ to stop his ears.</p>
      <p>Rather, the calling of the Lord should be heard, and immediately obeyed. There is no need to prove that this is the calling of the Lord, since your conscience is a witness to you of this matter, so that you are also compelled to admit it with us: how dishonorable it is to resist the Lord, and how much danger it is connected with, the story and example of Jonah sufficiently indicate. Now, as for you to remain in Strasbourg, the reasons are not so serious, since the church of Strasbourg will suffer no loss with your departure, which has so many and such great learned and outstanding men that scarcely any other: but the church of Geneva has no one besides Viret, upon whose shoulders the whole burden, and that a very heavy one, rests, which he bears until he is recalled to his sheep: meanwhile, I will not mention with how much danger the church of Lausanne is without its pastor.</p>
      <p>There was also once a famous church in Antioch (as the thirteenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles testifies) in which there were many prophets and teachers, useful and necessary, of course, to the church of Antioch.</p>
      <p>But when the Lord called them elsewhere, neither the apostles nor the church resisted the divine calling, but rather they sent Paul and Barnabas into the work to which the Holy Spirit had set them apart. Come now, Strasbourg is a certain Antioch, in which there are teachers and prophets, among whom is Calvin, who, because of his exceptional learning and singular gifts granted by God, is useful and necessary to the same church. However, the Lord calls elsewhere: to which calling, in our judgment, not so much Calvin as the church of Strasbourg ought to obey, so much so that it should not only not retain Calvin but should send him forth and dismiss him, even if he hesitates and resists. To these is added the evident teaching and example of Christ. For with what solicitude, with what labor, he, the eternal shepherd, taught to seek and save the lost sheep, Luke chapter fifteen clearly explains: indeed, he left the ninety-nine in the desert and pursued that errant and lost one, and having found it, gently lifted it onto his shoulders and brought it back to the fold. What would he do if the sheep themselves sought the shepherd, who pursues the fleeing one with such zeal?</p>
      <p>Christ offers his grace freely to the unworthy, the unwilling, the rejecting. But every action of Christ should be an example to us: I have given you an example, he says, that you should do as I have done. With what mind, with what spirit, with what conscience will you desert and flee from those who meet you, who seek you alone? Paul often visited the churches he had begotten and established by the word of God, and he encouraged them much by letters to remain in their duty. By your work and ministry, the church of Geneva was reborn in Christ: will you then be able to neglect and despise the children wailing and crying after their parent? Will you allow so many little sheep to be open to prey, for whom Christ shed his blood?</p>
      <p>Do not let those be worthless to you whom Christ redeemed at such a price.</p>
      <p>What need is there to prove that they are open to prey, when that Sadoletus, the master of rhetoric, recently tried to creep into the church of the Genevans with amazing cunning and almost through tunnels: nor will he desist, who once enticed by the hope of prey has begun, but will make a sharper and more intense attack on the unarmed flock of Christ, deprived of the protection of a shepherd. Nor should what God commands seem difficult, nor should it be burdensome to follow the calling Lord: he who is powerful will give strength, wisdom, patience. He does not lie, so that you may easily overcome those inconveniences which seem to stand in the judgment of the flesh. The Lord has never failed those who call upon him in truth. Since so many churches pray to you, you should act more confidently even for this reason alone. Furthermore, there is no need to say much about the benefit. You will rescue many sheep from the jaws of wolves, you will weave an imperishable crown for yourself with God. You know that Geneva is on the borders of France, Italy, and Germany, so there is great hope of spreading the gospel more widely from there into neighboring cities, and of expanding the boundaries of the kingdom of Christ. You know that the apostle chose metropolises in which to preach the word of the gospel, from which it would easily spread into other neighboring cities.</p>
      <p>How much you can add to the kingdom of Christ from this city you know better yourself, not only by preaching but also by writing. These are the things, my Calvin, that move us to ask, beseech, and implore you not to reject this calling, which we do not doubt is from the Lord, but to follow it unhesitatingly and without delay. Nor is there any doubt with us about your faith and will, but we spur you on with certain spurs to make it happen more quickly. Now we hope that our prayers and supplications may have some effect with you. You know how much we love you, what we would do for your sake and in your favor, you know how much we respect and honor you, and revere you for those excellent gifts bestowed upon you by the Lord. Those who are most devoted to you and your name, and most friendly to the churches and the truth, we, your brother and friend, beseech and implore you by Christ: whom it would be shameful to despise or resist. For we hope that we too are not entirely devoid of the Spirit of God and do not consult only the flesh. Farewell, brother always to be respected in the Lord, and pray to God for us. From Zürich, 4th April 1541.</p>
