      <p> Greetings. I cannot delay any longer in sending my regards to you, my uniquely esteemed friend, even if the sky were to fall and the mountains were to give birth. You and yours are more precious to me than gold and topaz. I eagerly wish to know how you are faring. I am living in Kaufbeuren, a place of almost Scythian nature, where I have bought a house for my wife and children, to which I will return whenever the Lord calls me to Him. Indeed, the injustices of the times and the destruction of true piety would have taken me long ago if the Lord had not granted me extraordinary strength of mind. But tell me, why is the calamity, so often predicted and standing ready, being so long averted from you? Surely it is from the Lord, who entangles enemies with enemies, intending to deliver His own from evil for a time; to whom be praise, honor, power, and glory forever, amen. I have no news of any new events, except that a certain barbarian king has recently emerged among the barbarians and Arabs, who has conquered countless cities from both the Spanish and the King of Portugal by force and arms and brought them under his control. This has undoubtedly changed some plans; this, I say, the Lord has done and will do many wonderful things alone. </p>
      <p> The Saxons and Meisseners frequently write to our friends that they are still free and exempt from the Interim, but that Duke Maurice is so tormented by furies that he cannot find rest unless he is full of wine or debauchery. Meanwhile, the people of Magdeburg persist under the anathema inflicted upon them; I wish they would act truly piously with knowledge and not suffer only part of the danger due to superstition. The Emperor has not been seen by any of the courtiers for several days; while the Prince of Spain is wandering here and there, he is said to be hiding in Brussels. What will happen, I do not know. In Augsburg, the Gospel is still being preached, if it can be done without the correction of depraved morals, impiety, and idolatry. </p>
      <p> I have a son, almost my only one, Jonas Laetus, who learned the basics from the excellent man D. Jacob Funcklius and my brother Ambrosius Blaurer. I am now nurturing him at home due to the lack of teachers, knowing how poorly a boy of good promise is neglected. Therefore, if you can provide for him at a reasonable cost, so that he may be educated and nourished in Zurich, I implore you by Christ to write back; whom I will soon send to you following your advice. </p>
      <p> Write to my Blaurer, if it can be done conveniently, that I am the same towards him as I have always been, and nothing makes me more anxious than that I cannot console or help him in his exile. I could indeed console him if letters could be safely delivered to him; I could also help if my means were not too small to meet great necessity. Let me know where the brothers Laureri, Zwick, and Jacob Funcklius are; I believe Gabriel is in Zurich. I perceive that each of them, along with each of your colleagues, councilors, and scribes, is well. Farewell. July 15, 1549. </p>
      <p> Yours, Georg Laetus. </p>
      <p> To the honorable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my especially gracious and dear lord, to be delivered. Zurich. </p>
