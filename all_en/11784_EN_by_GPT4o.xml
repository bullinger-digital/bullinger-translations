    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks Bullinger and Jakob [Ruf] for the sent medicines and sends the promised money; does not know if it is sufficient, and will send any shortfall later. He cannot write more due to his headache. The Pope [Paul III] is expecting the arrival of the Emperor [Charles V] in Bologna; the Grisons stubbornly adhere to the [alliance with the] French [King Francis I]; may God come to the aid of the righteous! Bullinger should not forget his Comander, who is plagued by a long illness. Greetings from Johannes Blasius and Philipp [Gallicius].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord through Jesus Christ, amen. I have received the medicines you sent me, dearest Bullinger. I give thanks both to you and to Master Jakob; I willingly offer myself and my services to you, should the need arise. I am sending the promised money; I do not know if I have calculated correctly; if anything is missing, I will make up for it later. I am unable to write more due to my headache. The Pope in Bologna is waiting for the arrival of the Emperor, who is rumored to be coming soon. We, the Grisons, stubbornly adhere to the French. May God, the best and greatest, deign to help the good and upright in heart. Farewell, most beloved man, and do not forget your Comander, who is afflicted by a long illness. From the Court of Rhaetia, April 10, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>Brothers Johannes Blasius and Philippus send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
