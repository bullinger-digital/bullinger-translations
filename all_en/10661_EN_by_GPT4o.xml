    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds to two letters from Bullinger and one from Leo [Jud] together. His long silence is not due to annoyance. [Response to No. 562:] The dispute over the sacraments cannot be overcome without conversation, as once practiced under the guidance of the Holy Spirit by the bishops and Paul. Regarding the confession of the Zurichers [No. 482]: The crucial point is that during the meal, the ministers offer not only the bread but the body of Christ. Otherwise, what Paul attributes to the officeholders, that they contribute to salvation, although this is solely Christ's work, would not apply to them. The imperial cities unanimously confess, using the words of Scripture, that the minister, and through him Christ himself, grants the communion of the body of Christ, while rejecting a natural union of Christ with the bread; Oecolampadius approved the consistent statements of the early church, which, however, displeased Zwingli. He is satisfied with Bullinger's response regarding his commentaries. He rejects his harsh judgment of the Wittenbergers as unjust, as it is based on preconceived opinions. Even the scholastics should not be hastily condemned based on their origins. Councils once contributed to the establishment of the church under Christian princes; as more and more princes allow the preaching of the Gospel, this should be seen as a sign, and one should prepare for a proclamation appropriate to the circumstances, as Luther did at the beginning [of the Reformation]. Without suspicion, he complied with the request to take a position on the attempt at unification initiated by the French king; in his opinion, he recommended preliminary talks with selected [theologians], accepted externalities under the condition of recognizing the doctrine of justification, and granted the bishops a pastoral supervisory right according to the model of the early church. Despite its shortcomings, he also approves of Philipp [Melanchthon]'s opinion and defends it against Bullinger's criticism, whom he urges to brotherly love. Although a distorted excerpt is being spread, it cannot deceive anyone; indeed, it would have been better if the opinions had not been issued, but they have in no way contributed to the persecutions in France. He reproaches Bullinger's hatred of the French. Responds to his second letter: Luther's polemic against the sacramentarians in the commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians, a lecture given three years ago, does not target the Zurichers; provoked by the Catholics, by Müntzer and Karlstadt, for whose followers he considered Oecolampadius and Zwingli, Luther indeed treated his opponents awkwardly, yet he has rendered the church the highest service, for example, through his Bible translation, which is clearly superior to that of the Zurichers. They condemn the Lutheran doctrine of the sacraments, although Bucer has tried to explain to them the sincerity of Luther's intentions. He rejects the accusation of inconsistency made by Leo [Jud] against Wilhelm von Zell and denies that a second [Anabaptist kingdom of] Münster is threatening in Strasbourg. The Zurichers may defend Zwingli and themselves against excessive attacks, just as Bucer has defended Zwingli's doctrine of original sin, but they must not make the same mistake as their opponents. If they revive the destructive dispute at an inopportune time through false accusations and reservations in the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, they endanger the progress of the Gospel in many places and behave as if Christ belonged only to the Swiss. Responds belatedly to the letter from Leo [Jud]. Justifies his travels and reports on his mediation efforts in Augsburg, Constance, Kassel, and Isny; in Strasbourg, Capito and the council were more vigilant than ever against sectarians. He is saddened by the mistrust of the Swiss churches, which could be overcome through meetings following the apostolic model. The refusal of conversation, which can never be replaced by written exchange, pains him; he recalls the damage caused by the rejection of the mutual visits of the synods initiated by Oecolampadius. He thanks the admonishers and reminds them that the church of Christ is not to be confined to the Confederation.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I have received your two letters, one in Augsburg and the other here. I also received one from our Leo. One heart in the Lord for you and me with you. You will therefore forgive my occupations, for I respond to three letters with one and that briefly. You also require brevity and simplicity.</p>
      <p>Regarding the delay in replying: Attribute this to my occupations and the hope of meeting, which you had made, Bullinger. From the letters, I see how little we progress in those matters that are controversial to us. Neither your freedom in advising nor Luther's zeal has made me hostile to you or delayed my writing. I believe in Christ, and I believe you do too; therefore, I must love and respect you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the sacramental cause: Long ago, I seemed to see that we would make little progress in this without a colloquy. Although you promised this and wonderfully refreshed me, now, because you write again that you see no use in it, you deny it. Why should you do or I ask for what you judge useless? But it is indeed strange that, while the Holy Spirit among the true bishops and Paul himself valued so highly their meeting in the Lord and discussing holy matters, that now the same Spirit considers it so harmful or, to speak more mildly, so unfruitful. It is not fitting for you not to consult the most religious Spirit of Christ, who so often prays, and indeed earnestly, to deny your presence. May the Lord himself guide us.</p>
      <p>Regarding your confession: While you make a spiritual and carnal presence of Christ in the supper, you show that you do not yet see where this controversy lies. For no one defends the carnal. Thus, no one demands that we say the bread is the body of Christ, and to avoid that the simpler ones venerate the signs for the things, all approve. This is contended: Since these words "Take, eat, this is my body" etc. [Mt 26, 26 par] are the words of the Lord offering, and not only the bread but also his body, which is given for us, and through us ministers he speaks these, he uses us as dispensers of his mysteries, that we believe and confess that in the holy supper is offered with the bread (the sign, namely, of offering) the very body of the Lord, just as with the water of baptism regeneration is offered and once through circumcision the communion of the divine covenant was offered, with the breath of the Lord the Holy Spirit, with the laying on of hands the blessing of the Lord and various gifts. Pesah was a sign of remembrance, not of offering.</p>
      <p>If the minister offers nothing but the sign, he will not dispense the mysteries of God, he will not be a minister of the Spirit and the new testament, he will not save, he will not regenerate. All these things the apostle attributes to the sacred ministry, but yet affirms that we can think nothing of this from ourselves as from ourselves, much less do. We are not ministers of the Lord unless we cooperate with him for the planting and watering and building, that is, the regeneration of the saints, which certainly does not consist in words and signs without the Spirit, without true communion with Christ. Paul boasts that he laid the foundation of Christ in the Corinthians, not only sacred words and signs, that he begot them to the Lord through the gospel, not only administered words. From this, however, it does not follow that we receive all salvation by faith alone or that salvation is not entirely the work of one Christ. Christ speaks and acts in the minister, and by faith is received what Christ speaks and acts through the minister, nor is he a minister of Christ in whom Christ does not speak and act all things. Therefore, it is a fallacy due to ignorance of the refutation: "Christ is eaten by faith alone, therefore not by the benefit of the minister" similar to this: We receive food conveniently by the attractive power alone, therefore we are not fed by the benefit of the cook. But what need is there to dispute in writing, which I have so often found to be in vain?</p>
      <p>This, by the grace of the Lord, is now the unanimous opinion and doctrine of the churchmen through the cities of the empire: concerning sacred matters, because the natural man understands nothing, it is to be felt and spoken as the Holy Spirit has taught us to feel and speak. Therefore, we not only religiously desire to hold the meanings of Scripture in these matters, but also to express them in the words of Scripture. We say, therefore, that the bread which we break is the communion of the body of Christ and that the minister gives this, but ministerially. The Lord is both the food and the provider of the food himself. Lest the simpler ones conceive anything too gross, we add that Christ is neither united to the bread naturally nor included in the bread locally nor becomes food for the stomach, that this communion of Christ is a matter of the new testament and heavenly, but the same effective and most real, because there is nothing fictitious here, nothing empty. In this way, we sufficiently meet either the grosser or even impious opinions, which have been introduced from the old error of the papists. We involve nothing, but use the language of the Holy Spirit, than which nothing can be imagined more clear or more pleasing to Christians. This was used by all that better old church, which Oecolampadius also approved, although Zwingli did not approve it in all respects, as they did not have the same opinion in many other things, which you see, if not otherwise, from the monuments of both. Certainly, Oecolampadius' Dialogue did not suit Zwingli's taste, as he testified in his letters to Sturm. But this matter too, what is to be decided about the disputations of both, cannot be settled by letters. It is broader than you perhaps think, reading the writings of others cursorily, as you write.</p>
      <p>Regarding your commentaries, the matter is well. Let us pray to the Lord to guide us everywhere by his Spirit and to teach us to use the writings of anyone piously.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Wittenbergers: Here I ask nothing else from you than that you do not do to them what you condemn them for doing to you, namely, that you do not condemn them without knowing the cause. For neither from the writings nor from the conversation of your truly loving brothers do you sustain this cause to know. If I now had to give the ultimate reason for this judgment of mine, I could not judge otherwise than that you are no less unjustly affected towards them than they are towards you and injurious. Consider it good that I write what I feel and feel before the Lord. Indeed, you harm them with milder words and not so often or so openly. But what could be said more atrociously about them than to betray the truth of Christ, to oppress the church of Christ with impious tyranny, and to pursue the ministers of Christ with lies? They admit, alas, what perhaps gives you occasion for these accusations, but the stronger you seem to yourselves, the more diligently you should take care that nothing beyond the truth or against your most inimical ones should escape you. I may err while I think there is in both of you a reason why you should embrace each other in the Lord. Meanwhile, however, while I see you ascribing to them opinions which they first attacked and still attack today, and erring too much about their whole character, I cannot but grieve for your sake, who thus avoid seriously discussing these matters, and not only this, but also read their writings cursorily, only considering what they say in general, etc. But it has seemed good to the Lord that we, who ought to spend our blood in gathering into the fold of Christ his sheep that have strayed from him, should hinder their collection and meanwhile interpret this as simplicity and constancy. May our Lord Christ strip us of ourselves and clothe us with himself.</p>
      <p>Regarding the scholastics: It is not to be considered what Melanchthon condemns, but what ought to be condemned. There is an infinite multitude of truly Christians who are held by the doctrines of the scholastics, but corrupted. We would indeed have consulted these much better if we had attacked the corruption, not the doctrines, which are in themselves right, and had so tempered all our things that no suspicion of calumny would stick to us. Now we have treated all the scholastics in such a way that we have presented a not to be despised stumbling block to many wise and good people, while they see that we either have not read them or have wanted to calumniate them knowingly. But about these things too, it cannot be satisfied to you by letter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the council: Long ago the Lord established his church under pious princes, Constantine and his successors, by the consultations of sacred synods and repressed the furies of heretics, which had previously prevailed. What if the Lord grants us this grace too? It is near that all the princes of Germany, who are to the north, have publicly admitted the preaching of the Gospel, and it is not far off that the whole kingdom of Denmark will yield to the most pious prince Christiern the Younger; for recently he almost completely destroyed the hostile army. If the Lord grants him peace, he will consecrate his whole kingdom to Christ. The Swede did this long ago, now the English and the Scot follow, kings of no ordinary power. If the Lord has accomplished these things for the most part within two years, to which indeed two very large kingdoms of England and Scotland and two principal duchies of Pomerania and Württemberg have been added, we ought indeed to hope for greater things than to be concerned only about the kingdom of Christ in our corners. France is now watered with the blood of Christians, in Italy the truth is admitted everywhere, the Spaniards are beginning to feel this too. How easy it is now for God to break the tyrannies opposed to him, we preach daily. Hence it seems to me rightly not unbecoming to prepare for all those things by which in any way an accession to the kingdom of Christ can be made. And yet the Lord has given us this mind, that we are led from known things to unknown and are freed from errors by clear truth, as it has been done to us. Luther indeed at the beginning of the cause profited the truth not a little, while he refuted the public corruption of the doctrine of Christ with those reasons which could then be recognized. And I consider this to be the prudence of simplicity and the constancy of faith.</p>
      <p>Regarding our response to the French: To me in Christ there is neither French nor German, and it is not allowed to condemn those whom you have not found to be evil now; having been is not enough for condemnation. I was asked to respond how the king could contribute his effort to reconcile the churches and what could be borne from the received opinions with piety unharmed. Those who asked were not so bad that they could have been considered by me as dogs or swine. For I am ignorant of precautions that rely on suspicions. A Christian cannot be circumvented; for he follows the word of the Lord, and if he errs and deviates from it, he considers the punishment of this as gain, for he gives it to his own good. I therefore responded with two things: One, that the way of reconciling the churches should be sought by some good and wise men, who first, meeting in small numbers on both sides, should examine the controversies of religion. I expressly added that this preliminary discussion could not be allowed to any who are of the common ecclesiastics of this time; those who have proven themselves truly religious by their life should be employed. The other, with the doctrine of justification safe, that is, the whole gospel, we can bear any discipline, any orders in the church, all ceremonies, provided they serve faith, not hinder it. We have all professed this in so many published books, and we would have taken nothing away from the Roman or other bishops always, if they had truly and according to the word of the Lord wanted to provide that pastoral care which they promise in words. It was once the custom that the chief archbishops - Roman, Constantinopolitan, Antiochene - as soon as they were consecrated as bishops, would send each other a confession of their faith and profess mutual society of holy administration and mutual subjection. Others and bishops commended themselves to these. They were in a way holy observers and presidents to each other. If this order and mutual care were to obtain today in the Lord and according to his word, what, I ask, would you fear of danger from this? Charity, because it is the nature of God, does not derive any way of doing good from itself and alone establishes a certain way and just order in human affairs. But the pontiffs will promise anything and do whatever. Nor have we deferred anything to them or will defer, and if they obtain anything by some false appearance, the word of the Lord is still no less effective for me to take away their person than it was before. I have a throat to offer, and my Lord is able as before.</p>
      <p>I subscribed to Philip, although I would have preferred some things in his response to be more expressed, because he referred doubts to the disputation and wanted to give nothing except what would promote the doctrine of justification. But with this safe, no place can remain for any superstition. The king writes differently and deceives. He has his judge, we have our guardian, lest his deceptions harm us. Some shout: "Botz wunden." From their own speech, I see these must be sent away. You would redeem at a great price not to have given these responses. I indeed at no small price, that either you would incline a little more to the concord of the churches or listen to your most observant and loving brothers. You write that they are the seeds of the greatest discords. Of which, I ask? Would that we sowed so little discord, because we do not listen to each other and yet judge so securely about the opinions of others. Surely it is a useless and pernicious institution if anyone confesses his sins to a priest, so that learning the law and gospel of God better, he may progress in repentance and faith? But Philip approves no other confession. Even if you want to judge truly, what this most learned and candid man, truly loving you (for he is indeed of another judgment about you than he was), now writes and once wrote, you will not bring forth so many contradictions for us. You are in an unjust and sick mind towards these men. May the Lord correct and heal you! This charity does not produce nor the fear of the Lord, nor what Luther and others falsely attribute to you. You desire solidity and simplicity, brevity and purity in us. Pray to the Lord to grant us these and to you a more equitable judgment about the gifts of God in others. I do not speak of myself; you know for whom. I attribute more than enough to the papal monarchy. But what do I attribute? It is not right to say what kind of pope we could bear, and in that way to show how they do not respond to their order, who are called popes? Or is it impious to say what are the duties of a Christian man, even if no one has been or can be here who fulfills them? We do not build a Platonic city, but we expose the impudence of those who in words take upon themselves to be able to provide for so many churches, when they are certainly ruinous to all.</p>
      <p>Nothing has moved the envy of many against us as much as this plan. I avoid this envy as much as I have been able to find out so far. But indeed, my Bullinger, to how many does this plan reach? Some priests circulate a certain excerpt from Philip's response distorted, but since it is not unusual for them to circulate trifles, I do not hear who are so moved. And to whom is there a crumb of equity, who reads our public writings published about these very things before and after those responses were given and judges us from the notes which the enemies circulate privately? There were some friends and brothers, very much to be respected by me, who were angry with us because of these responses. Since I see that the reason for our plan about these responses stands so badly with them and you, and that they contribute little in France, as far as I hear, to what they were given for, I would prefer them not given. But since they are either so badly consulted in themselves or have given so much damage to the churches, because I have neither found out, it does not appear to me that there is a reason from these why we should be so distressed. For it is falsely more false that anything of danger has been created for anyone in France by occasion of these responses. For these responses do not concede these things to the pontiffs, since it was capital to profess what is contained in them. It was enough to be Lutheran, but also Erasmian, indeed not a pure papist and to profess this in all ways was enough for punishment. Now, when the king recalls those who fled, granting pardon, the sacramentarians are excepted. But what is the cause of this in our responses? Since Philip approves my moderation in the opinion of the Eucharist and I profess that there is concord in the matter between us? But enough about these.</p>
      <p>That you make the French without exception slippery and deceitful, you know you do not do this from the Spirit of Christ. For he teaches us that we are all equally lost from ourselves, but he does not reject any nation for regeneration. However, because I seem to have sinned so much here to you, which I can judge only from the fact that you judge so, I beg pardon for this thoughtlessness. I will be more cautious in the future. So far to your previous letters, Bullinger, given to me on Easter day.</p>
      <p>To your other letters: In these, you are somewhat angry and threaten severely. That commentary on Galatians, about which you complain, was taken by Caspar Cruciger from Luther's lecture three years ago, but recently published. It curses "charity and concord, for the preservation of which it is necessary to endanger the word of God." What is impious in this sentiment? But it makes the sacramentarians those seeking such concord. Who are the sacramentarians? He understands sacramentarians to be those who place nothing but bread and wine in the sacrament. You are not such. Therefore, these things do not concern you. But he understands you by this name. It pains, but what can I do? You too, while you refuse to use the forms of Scripture and the fathers, I cannot persuade him otherwise about you. Therefore, he must be attacked by you. But if it is my duty to attack all those who seem to me to judge badly about others, if it is, you too must be attacked by me, because you judge Luther and others, which I know to be otherwise. And before Christ the judge, you too will acknowledge how far from all piety it is what you write that Luther was born to excite and foster dissensions. He was born to excite and foster the gospel of Christ Jesus, my Bullinger, he has accomplished this in work. He treats his adversaries more impotently, believed to be false by him, than true. This, however, is true, that he never waged war first on anyone. He was provoked by the papists, he was provoked by Müntzer and Karlstadt, with whom he thought Zwingli and Oecolampadius were acting. He considered these among the Karlstadians. Who also, although more modestly, yet first attacked the Lutheran opinion. Yet I do not excuse the man's impotence, but because I know he purely preached and preaches the Lord Jesus, and except for that importunity against adversaries, also lives. Because finally his labors have benefited the whole church so much, I cannot but take it very seriously that you, Bullinger, born with a mild disposition otherwise, dare to write so about Luther, who has benefited the church of God so much. For to speak of the Bible translation alone, how great a treasure is that? I believe you do not deny how many things have always been desired in your translation, even by Oecolampadius himself and, as I now see, by Pellican and Theodor too.</p>
      <p>Regarding the sacraments, he seems to you to err grossly, but before Christ the judge, you will know that this man in asserting these things aims at nothing else than that the word and promise of Christ be held in their place. He attributes all the fruit of the sacraments to the benevolence of God alone and the faith by which we receive that benevolence offered in Christ. To show you this, I ascended to you from here two years ago, I offered a writing, I sought a meeting afterwards, but all in vain. You want to judge, you do not want to know the cause. This has given great damage to your church and ours in Zwingli. May our Lord Jesus Christ avert that it also gives in you.</p>
      <p>We are gradually defamed, we who preach Christ in the churches of the republics of the empire, as if we do not deal simply in this cause, as if we defect from the preached truth, as if we are what the word quackler sounds, by which name our Leo has marked us writing to Wilhelm von Zell, a truly pious old man, but who has come to the point that he no longer uses our ministry. Thus this republic, which always wanted to deserve better from yours than they wanted to admit, is everywhere accused by you of being in danger of becoming another Münster, although since the rise of the sects, the sectarians have never been less powerful here than now, never has it been acted more severely against the sectarians. In these things, because many are vain and done beyond the rule of charity, the good are offended in vain, peace and concord are rejected at an untimely time. Great is the security not supported by its own strength. I greatly fear lest you give yourselves some inconvenience.</p>
      <p>You write that you will have greater regard and authority for the truth, less for men, and will bear the injuries of Luther so that the simple may sometime see how Luther is ashamed of no lie. I earnestly beseech you to have regard for the truth alone, and for this to be willing to hate men too. But meanwhile recognize Christ in his men and do not, while you want to appear such strenuous patrons of the truth, write so against all truth that Luther is ashamed of no lie. He labors under this evil, that the false opinions he once admitted about Zwingli, he attributes too pertinaciously to all who seem to follow him. So that you may defend both Zwingli's and your own innocence, but from the truth and without the communion of the vice you attack, no good man will disapprove. I myself in my commentaries on Romans defended Zwingli about original sin, but I tempered the defense so that meanwhile I did not cast down any of the servants of the Lord, much less attack with a false charge.</p>
      <p>This certainly alone, excellent brothers, has dragged us here into this pernicious sacramental fight, that we could not bear to see Oecolampadius and Zwingli treated so inhumanely by Luther and some others. We always saw in Luther's opinion about the Eucharist nothing established that is impious in itself, therefore at the beginning we called our people away from contention and did not openly support either party. Now if you want to revive the fight in vain, indeed with the ruin of the churches, and that with false accusations, then with an imperfect confession of the truth about the sacraments, do not doubt, God will be present to his church, so that he may protect the concord begun in whatever way and make your efforts most pernicious to you. You have come very close to the full confession of the truth, while yet you openly contradict the forms of Scripture affirming that the minister offers nothing but the sign, in which way he would not be a minister of Christ; for he would not administer the mystery of Christ and the Spirit, but only the letter. Certainly, by the votes of the saints, you will fall in the cause and will incur the grave wrath of Christ. The times are different, a greater knowledge of the cross of Christ; it has raged enough. Now Philip and with him very many are wholly in this, that they avert the intemperance of a few, defend and magnify Christ in you. And you, surely with favorable omens, will recall to the world that deadly war? In this way, therefore, will you stop the blood of the saints in France, promote the course of the gospel in England and Scotland, and serve the peace of Germany? Augsburg and Frankfurt are now deserted for this reason. Regensburg had joined; at the beginning, the attempt was extinguished. None of this would have happened to us if we were in concord. To give occasion to these things by untimely fights and diminished profession of the truth, who would not execrate? If Christ is only the Christ of the Swiss, go on; but if not, bear to imitate Paul, so that where the foundation of Christ lies, there you may not be burdened to do and bear all things, so that what has been begun may stand and be promoted. These to your other letters, Bullinger, and take well the freedom in a matter of such importance and to your letters so free.</p>
      <p>To yours, my dearest Leo, since I have already responded for the most part, as far as I can respond by letters, take this: Luther has not alienated me, but since I hope for a meeting and see little progress by letters and am occupied with many things, finally there were no couriers at hand, I did what you also did: I wrote rarely. For I only delayed responding to one letter.</p>
      <p>You disapprove that I went around and visited the churches, since I gave damage to both mine and the French churches. Let those who know the cause judge this, which, as I see, you do not know, my Leo. The people of Augsburg, placed in great danger because of the dissensions of the preachers and citizens, called me with the most holy entreaties, my magistrates sent me to them; how could I not have come? Meanwhile, the Landgrave called me to Philip at Kassel; so that I might respond more certainly in the name of the brother symmists in the allied cities, we met at Constance, all by the order of my magistrates. I think here too I did nothing rashly. But in Augsburg, where all things were only begun, not yet established, and the dissensions of the preachers were more manifesting themselves, lest the latter things be worse than the former, I was recalled by the people of Augsburg and sent by mine. And the Lord granted that there was no greater concord in the cause of religion in Augsburg than while the gospel was preached there, and the Lord granted, while I was there, and unless the preachers themselves voluntarily dissipate it, I hope very well for this church. When I was about to leave here, the most pious man Buffler of Isny called me because of Paul, who left there against the will of the saints. Therefore, I came here, then to Constance, to satisfy the brothers there about the writings to France. I left them, as they testified, most friendly to me. Behold, you have the causes of my circuit for six months. Meanwhile, the best Capito and others watched so well at home that it has begun to be acted by the magistrate for the true constitution of the church and against sectarians of all kinds more severely and gravely than ever before. And God has given greater increase than before. And while we are farthest from the fate of the Münsterites, we are slandered by you as if we are closest to it. It was not to be believed by anyone, my Leo. And if we were in such great danger, we should have been warned long ago.</p>
      <p>We greatly marvel at the credulity of the Swiss churches in this matter; for things are written by you, the Bernese, and the Basilians, which carry a horrendous persuasion about us. It is pleasing that you warn, but it pains that you do not think more friendly of us than that you doubt we would have consulted you long ago or implored your help in prayers if our church had been in such great danger even by a tenth part. So this also pains: Whatever we strive for the holy and Christian concord of the churches, you attribute this to fear of the power of princes. If you are wise, you will let Christ judge, and what your brothers do not seek for themselves as evil, you do not ascribe to an evil end. You want ministers who are concordant and constant in simple and true truth and who insist on prayers for a long time and ours, we want these too. But these will indeed judge of each other from charity, they will hear each other, they will seek mutual meeting with Paul through lands and seas. For they will not seek what is theirs, but what is Christ's, and they know that the Lord grants these things most abundantly to those who come together in his name. Therefore, they will have nothing more desirable in this life than meeting in the name of Christ. You will acknowledge this truth by reading Paul or you will deny that Paul was a Christian.</p>
      <p>As long as I live, it will be a torment to me not to have been able to discuss all the cause of Christ with you amicably. Woe to us if we cannot talk about Christ without contentions! I never wanted to lead you away from the truth, and the Lord would have easily guarded you from my subtleties, even if I had wanted to. What shall I do now? I love and honor you, and not in an ordinary way. Therefore, it pains more that, since the obstacles are so small by which the greatest offenses can be averted, it is not allowed to comment on these with you. Meanwhile, by writing we lose nothing but time and alienate minds more. How easily writings are taken in a different sense than they are written. How easily anyone objects anything to the writing for himself and thinks it firm, while no one is present to dissolve the objection. I have now written to you at length in words, but if you look at the matter, how little will it be enough? How everywhere will you have something to refute? How will my things seem diluted, evanescent? Your reasons, if you reply, will perhaps have the same for me? You will seem to have understood most things not, to have distorted many, to have objected things of no moment. So when will it agree?</p>
      <p>But yet, lest I seem to neglect you and acknowledge what you falsely think, that I am indignant with you, I have replied. May it fall well! You wrote freely, I replied freely. I took your freedom well, but to respond, so take mine well too. Let us make equal. I, unless you are entirely lacking in the ability to converse Christianly about Christ, would not doubt that if we seriously confer in the Lord and at a just time and with few and only those admitted who seriously fear God, we would make much progress. We fear the cries of the unskilled, but how skillfully? Then, if we wanted to keep the secret of the Lord, who would shout so? And how many are the most honest causes of meeting and discussing again, which no one can disapprove? Oecolampadius, as you know, Leo, when we were last with the legates of the republic at Basel, thought it very necessary that we should meet at our synods every year, and he was very offended with you and Megander then, that you even then so avoided the colloquy. I do not write this because I want to drag you unwilling to a colloquy, but because it seems to be confessed among you how I think there will be a great cause of great inconvenience for you and not for you alone. May the Lord avert this and keep us in his good pleasure. Amen.</p>
      <p>I have written these things with a truly loving mind for you; you will see how you receive them. The Lord is the judge, and the matter itself declares with what mind we are towards you. I am a man, I can err and never do not err. I ought not to trust myself. I am grateful to the monitors. But admonish yourselves with the same! The church of Christ is not to be confined within the borders of the Swiss. But if you see Christians elsewhere too, your members, see how you behave towards them.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and do not doubt that I honor and love you as always.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Bucer in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned men Heinrich Bullinger and Leo Jud, esteemed symmists.</p>
