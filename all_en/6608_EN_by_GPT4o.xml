      <p>Greetings. Once again, my brother Kessler, I write to you with sorrowful letters, as our Lord God so arranges our affairs according to His holy and good will. The most illustrious and holy man, Dr. Conrad Gessner, a unique ornament of all Switzerland, not just of Zurich, died last night at the 11th hour. A most pestilent anthrax had seized his chest, and a bubo had settled under his left armpit. Last Sunday, he was still in the holy assembly, as he was a most diligent listener of my sermons. He greeted me as usual.</p>
      <p>Soon he began to fall ill, yet he never lay down; for when he had composed himself a little in bed, he would soon rise again, walk around, or sit down. He always discussed holy and useful matters, indeed, he labored until his last breath, a man otherwise exhausted by labors. Yesterday, he himself still wrote many things, and having grasped my right hand, he bid me farewell, professing his faith and his most certain hope of eternal life through Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>You see, our Lord God calls the most learned and best men from this world.</p>
      <p>What will happen, you judge according to your piety. I earnestly ask you, my lord and brother, to ensure that this bundle of letters is sent to Augsburg through our Liner or through our friends safely and as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>I write to my friend Georg von Stetten; he will take care of my letters addressed to the secretary and the emperor's physician, my special friends.</p>
      <p>I write this in my great sorrow.</p>
      <p>Pray for us.</p>
      <p>Greet your son, all the ministers, dearest brothers, Liner, and others. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 14, 1565. He will be buried at 4 o'clock in the evening. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Johannes Kessler of St. Gallen, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To the schoolmaster Kessler in St. Gallen.</p>
