      <p>I had decided to set out for Zürich, most learned man, and to live there for a time, so that I might enjoy the company of learned men and attain those things which pertain to the instruction of the soul, which for some time I have not been able to exercise as I wished and as was fitting. To this goal, not at all impiously, my friend Engelbert Milander also encouraged me, indeed he provided me with letters by which I know I am sufficiently recommended to you. However, the importunity of friends, who called me back to my homeland three months ago, or rather the necessity of my affairs, which admits no delay, obstructed my efforts. Therefore, I have taken care to have the booklet and letters, as I received them from Master Milander, transferred to you in good faith (as I hope).</p>
      <p>If in this matter I have done anything otherwise than I ought, I would like it to be attributed not to me, but to the haste which I could not escape. Farewell, and kindly consider these little letters from an unknown person, yet one most devoted to you. Lucerne, 16th of July.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your excellence and distinction, Heinrich Menscheverus of Groningen.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in gravity and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most vigilant minister of the Church of Zürich, lord and patron to be especially revered, etc.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
