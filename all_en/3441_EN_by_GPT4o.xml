      <p>Greetings. Reverend and most learned my lord Bullinger, after I have certainly learned from not only your most courteous letters often written to me, but also from the consultation and report of the excellent and most learned Mr. Lelio, that I am sincerely loved by you and that my tasteless and incongruous writings, sent to you several times, are pleasing and welcome. Therefore, I could not refrain from sending these to you through our aforementioned Lelio, who today we both depart from T端bingen, he to you, I towards Kempten, and here I make you aware that I have completed the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles and have printed them, to which I have added a very long preface, in which I discuss the principal and necessary theological topics, among which is also your most learned and pious preface to John, translated in full word for word, and the aforementioned preface has 25 pages. I have also translated that compendium and scope of the entire Holy Scripture from your Bible and placed it on the first page of my Slavic book in place of those three German pages, which I published not for my Slavs, but for the overseeing printers, so that from that German preface they may understand that I write nothing against the Roman king; for neither the Nurembergers nor the Hallers wanted to allow, seven years ago, that my rhythmic Slavic catechism be printed by their printers, who knew that I was under the king's indignation, from which they also feared for themselves. I have also begun to print brief annotations on the Sunday and festival, as they say, Gospels; but I could not yet complete them.</p>
      <p>I leave those to a certain studious compatriot of mine and have entrusted him to correct them. I wanted to inform you of these things because I know that this my labor pleases you.</p>
      <p>So that you may be more certain that I speak the truth, I send the first three pages of my editions. From the third, which lacks a German title, from the concordances or cited places added in the margin, you will easily understand, and also from the division, that it is your compendium. I have noticed somewhat from certain conjectures that there is some discord between you and Vergerius, although Vergerius himself has never spoken any evil of you in my presence. Therefore, I ask and advise you to also tame human depraved affections, which Vergerius has promised me he will do. I know Vergerius still struggles with one or two vices as before regeneration; but that he is a hypocrite or a secret papist, this worst mark is falsely imputed to him. You will learn all the rest more clearly from Mr. Lelio.</p>
      <p>You will commend me to the honorable lord Ochino and the rest of my lords and brothers, your fellow soldiers, diligently. From T端bingen hastily, December 20, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your reverend lordship's most obedient Primus Truber. I had written to you 9 weeks ago through Matthias Rotto of Lindau, about what has been done in my homeland with the Turks this year and how my learned compatriot in Vienna has begun to defend our religion in public disputations. If you have those writings, please let me know when you can.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Z端rich, my most esteemed lord and teacher. In Z端rich.</p>
