    <p xml:id="regest1">Received two letters from Bullinger. In the first, he expressed his displeasure with Haller's interpretation of Old Testament statements about wars, land, and promises of victory. Can they be reinterpreted as the fight against sin and the promise of eternal life? Is it permissible to wage war for the sake of the Gospel? Many dispute this. On these questions, Haller again asks for Bullinger's opinion. He cannot come to Königsfelden for the time being. He has delivered Bullinger's message to Peter Im Haag. He asks for news about the Basel mediation. The Bernese envoys sent because of Glarus have returned home from Baden. Farel's reforming work in Geneva. Little can be learned about the trip to France by Schultheß Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl; the most important has already been indicated by Haller earlier: Bern wants to maintain the old peace. The Five Places are trying to slander the Reformers as rebels because of the Solothurn affair. Haller expects the fourth volume of Pellikan's commentary work from Froschauer. A delegation from Bern in Solothurn, where re-Catholicization continues. Jud is to comfort Heinrich Winkeli, who is in Bern, by letter. Many Reformers are leaving Solothurn, where they are being harassed by the authorities. Treasurer Tillmann is being replaced in his office by Hans Franz Nägeli. Greetings. When will Bullinger's commentary on the Corinthians appear? Requests the loan of Theodor Bibliander's notes.</p>

      <p>Grace, peace, and a happy beginning of the new year from the Lord.</p>
      <p>In recent days, I have received two letters from you, which I continue to kiss as symbols of mutual love and a sacrament. The first indicates that many things in my letter displeased you, in which I had included some remarks about the use of arms, and also how I should extricate myself, since under the law of the land of Canaan, the victory of the nations and many similar carnal promises are given to the Jews, which, as far as we are concerned, seem to need to be turned into a spiritual sense, so that we fight against sins and, through their victory, attain the heavenly homeland. Since I cannot easily believe that you are offended by these things, because you love me very much, I see that what displeased you was, of course, that my judgment of these matters, of which I have publicly professed for so many years, is so slight. I have seen Augustine, whom, since I do not understand him everywhere, does not satisfy me either. But I am convinced of this about you: When leisure permits, you can, with your skill in handling sacred matters, resolve everything in very few words, as you are adorned with this special gift above others, so that what you understand yourself, you can instruct others very plainly. Many mockingly ask: Where is it written that one should wage war or defend with war for the sake of the Gospel? Where do we have a word or example from Christ and the apostles? Our rich city here under the cross, etc. Although I have sometimes responded to these things to the best of my ability, I still desire the judgment of others, especially yours. Therefore, I beseech you, dearest Heinrich, not to take my ignorance, which is more than importunate and morose, too hard, since you promise to be mine in such a way that you wish to be another self.</p>
      <p>It is not possible for me to come to Königsfelden in winter, as it is not easy to find a suitable horse in the whole city, even one that I could hire with money. For it is dangerous for me to ride any horse. But if the times are more peaceful by May, as we all now hope, I would undertake the journey more easily and without danger. You, however, are in perpetual danger wherever you leave the territory of Zurich. May the Lord grant that I hear you at least once before my death.</p>
      <p>I told Sepiano what you had ordered. He, as he is always timid, always asks for his letters to be burned. Furthermore, what the people of Basel could achieve with you or whether they were with you and how things stand with you, who are asking for news of the rumors of war, he asks you to write, as far as you can.</p>
      <p>Our envoys sent to the Glarus people came as far as Baden and, instructed by the prefect, soon returned.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, Farel is now kindling a fire with others, but not openly. For there are over 400 pious people in that city. Rasi and his followers resist with the help of Freiburg.</p>
      <p>It was not possible to find out everything about our consul's trip as he wishes to keep what is entrusted to him and others in utmost silence. However, in the last letter, in which I mentioned his return, I hinted at the whole matter in one word, which you perhaps did not notice: We ask for help from no one of this kind, but we desire that the peace long since established, even with you, be maintained. The Antronians undoubtedly urge as much as they can, and they inculcate the whole evangelical matter as heretical and seditious, following the example of the Solothurners, to everyone, even kings and princes. Therefore, so that our innocence might become apparent to some and we might become more secure in turn, lest we find those we consider friends to be enemies at their instigation, it pleased us to remind of the peace long since established. I will keep silent about the occasion of the legation. You have the cause, and what was requested, I hear, has been obtained. I am not allowed to say more, and I have written these things to you alone.</p>
      <p>We have long known what has been done between the Pope and the French, although we have understood that it does not please the Emperor in all respects.</p>
      <p>Christopher has sent the end of the third volume. I am now expecting the beginning of the fourth.</p>
      <p>Our senate has now again sent a delegation to the Solothurners because of the exiles and the freedom of the word. You would not believe, nor can it be described or said, the madness and impious fury of these people. They have sent away 25 pastors and preachers. From Alsace and Breisgau, the priests flock in groups. Among these people, there is no regard for equity or truth. I will write in later letters what has been done. I wish our Leo would console his relative Heinrich Winkeli with a letter. He will stay with us for a few days with his wife. For that good man and old man bears exile gravely, who is nevertheless entirely innocent in this seditious matter. If letters are sent to me, he can receive them every day. 57 citizens have already changed their place from the city of Solothurn. If they are forbidden to stay in the city, and if one wants to leave, they bite into his goods and estimate them. If he estimates them too cheaply, the next one can take them and lay down the payment accordingly, but if he wants to leave, he must give one out of 10 guilders as a deduction. I write it as it has been shown to me. They are fortifying heavily in their city.</p>
      <p>Our Tilemann has been removed from the office of treasurer. He was succeeded by Franz Nägeli, well known to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, safe with your genial companion and children. May the brothers, Pellican, Theodor, Leo, and Carolstadt be safe. Sulzer greets you.</p>
      <p>I wanted to know one thing, whether we would receive your commentaries on the Corinthians at the next fair. Therefore, as soon as you can do without Theodor's notes for a while, do not neglect me, as you have never done before. On the penultimate day of this year.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. H.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in many respects, Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zurich, always dearest and especially to be respected.</p>
