    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller sent a rather short letter [No. 2837] six days ago through Hans Wilpert Zoller, as well as through Lorenz Meyer and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder, and announced in it that he would write more extensively with the current bearer [...]. Unfortunately, there are still no verified news. Georg Frölich will also write.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The situation is catastrophic. The garrison soldiers are allowed to get away with everything. They plague the population and go unpunished. The Augsburg council justifies its leniency by saying that they are at the mercy of Emperor Charles V and must endure the evil with patience. Meanwhile, however, the truth and Christ are being betrayed. The imperial forces publicly announce that they will not be gotten rid of before a year has passed, indeed, not until the priests in the city regain their rights and the will of the Emperor is enforced.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The poorer population is outraged by the peace. The better citizens are completely devoted to the most important merchants. Anton Fugger is back. First, he was cursed as a traitor, now he is celebrated as the father of the fatherland and the support of the city! The original imperial garrison has now grown from six to ten companies!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Emperor has departed from Ulm. The people of Strasbourg are said to have sought him out in Nördlingen and submitted to him there. Landgrave Philip of Hesse is allegedly leading auxiliary troops to Duke Maurice of Saxony against Elector John Frederick of Saxony.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Augsburg Bishop Otto Truchsess von Waldburg is reforming or rather deforming the churches. The married pastors have been dismissed and the misconduct of concubinage has been reintroduced. The churches are being deprived of their heavenly nourishment. They rightly accuse the pastors of having delivered them to this wolf.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The imperial captain [Bernhard von Schaumburg] is in possession of the city keys and is holding night watches. Many Augsburgers are selling everything and want to leave.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] No consideration is given to the pastors. Even those well-disposed towards them are turning away. Wolfgang Musculus and Michael Keller remain steadfast, all others are undecided. However, the proclamation [of the Gospel] continues without fear: Salvation is proclaimed to the repentant and punishment to the evildoers. Haller cannot imagine that the pastors can remain in the city for much longer; but for now, everything must be tried! Instead of the Augsburg church, he would rather be cursed himself, especially since that in Swabia was closest to the Zurich church. God will surely not abandon this pious, great community because of a few good-for-nothings, especially since he would have spared Sodom for the sake of just ten righteous people. Bullinger should pray that the pastors may be saved from the hands of the enemies and serve God as long as they live.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings, also to the colleagues and to Rudolf Gwalther. Haller will soon return his sermon notes on the Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] [Enclosure:] Haller had already sealed this letter when Frölich let him know that he cannot write (as something has come up), but Bullinger should know that the Elector has defeated Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (who came to Duke Maurice's aid). Praise be to God! Greetings. Should Haller learn more about this, he will report next time.</p>

      <p>S. P. I wrote six days ago through Zoller and also through the two brothers, but only one or two lines. I promised to write more extensively through this citizen. But since I have very little certain material, I will be brief again. Mr. Laetus promised to write something.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Everything is in a terrible state. These soldiers are allowed to do whatever they want. The injustice they inflict on the citizens goes unpunished. The magistrates have hearts softer than wax. They say: "What can we do? We are in the hands of the Emperor. We must obey, hope for clemency, and overcome evil with patience." Meanwhile, with this patience, truth and Christ himself are not preserved but betrayed! They boast that they will not be driven out of the city for a year, until the priests are reinstated in the city and everything is done according to the Emperor's will. Various rumors are spreading.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The poorer part of the populace is indignant about these agreements. The more civil citizens depend on the nod of the leading merchants. Fugger has returned, and the one whom they previously abhorred and cursed as a traitor to the fatherland, they now adore as the father of the fatherland and the pillar of the city. The six banners, initially small in number, have become very strong through continuous reinforcements: Four more have arrived, so we now have ten.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Emperor has left Ulm. It is rumored that the people of Strasbourg met him in Nördlingen and submitted to him. They speak marvels of the Landgrave's treachery; whether out of envy or truth, I still doubt. They say he is bringing aid to Duke Maurice against the Elector.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Bishop of Augsburg is deforming or reforming the churches again. He expels all pastors who have taken wives. He reinstates concubinage and fornication. The churches are deprived of heavenly nourishment. They condemn us for having delivered them to this wolf, and not without reason.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Emperor's chief captain has the keys to the city and holds night watches. Many are selling everything they have and are contemplating moving away.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>No consideration is given to us; we are the refuse of the world. Even the hearts of those well-disposed towards us are alienated. Musculus and Cellarius remain steadfast. All others are wavering. We cry out fearlessly to the repentant for salvation, to those wicked scoundrels for judgment. Therefore, I do not see how we can remain here for long. We will try everything first, for it pains me beyond measure! I wish I could be anathema for this church, because none of all the Swabian churches was ever closer to the Zurich confession! I hope God, who did not want to destroy Sodom for the sake of ten righteous people, will not extinguish such a numerous and, in my judgment, sufficiently pious (as we are human) and Christian church because of a few scoundrels. Pray diligently for us, that the Lord may grant us to serve Him without fear, delivered from the hands of our enemies, in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life. Amen.</p>

      <p>Farewell with all yours. I wish safety to all the lords, fathers, and brothers, also to Mr. Gwalther, to whom I will soon return his notes on the Epistle to the Hebrews. Farewell again. March 12, 1547. You know the place and the hand.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and esteemed father. M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>S. After I sealed my letters, the chief scribe sent to me and asked me to excuse him to you (for he could not write due to intervening business) and to add that certain news has come that the Elector has clashed with the Margrave of Brandenburg (who came to Duke Maurice's aid) and has won a significant victory. Praise be to God! Farewell. I will inform you of all business as soon as I learn of it.</p>
