      <p>Greetings. I read your letter written on July 28th with the greatest pleasure, and it never seems to me that enough has come from you. There is nothing about our affairs that deserves to be written, and I assume you have understood what has been happening in Flanders since the 20th of this month: In almost all cities, the gospel is being proclaimed, images have been cast out of the churches, especially in Antwerp, and fornications have been removed from sight, along with the public abolition of the inquisition. However, there is a rumor that Philip has decided to go there with Spanish, German, and Italian soldiers. May the Lord turn everything to the glory of His name. My wife and children are well and send you many greetings. If only we could testify to our gratitude and goodwill towards you on occasion. May God keep you safe. I send my greetings in my name to the esteemed council, Mr. Gwalther, and all friends.</p>
      <p>Paris, August 27, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church. Zürich.</p>
