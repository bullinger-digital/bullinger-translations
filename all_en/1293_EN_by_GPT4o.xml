      <p>S. in domino. Hey you, into which corner has the treasurer fled: He is heading to Saxony, perhaps to serve Maurice just as Lord von Heideck does. What kind of people have we had in Switzerland so far, to whom we have given comfortable hospitality and protection at the risk of our own? The Gospel clothes many scoundrels in a beautiful guise.</p>
      <p>Whom do you think can be trusted? Who does not understand the schemes by which such a kind of people inconvenience us?</p>
      <p>It is certain that Magdeburg is heavily besieged by a large crowd of soldiers from all sides, and they expect a more severe siege. Who will liberate those good men, God with His mighty hand or the Turk, the servant of God? And certain prodigies have been seen in Saxony, I think, five suns were seen for three days, and at night three moons. The Turk will undoubtedly extend his horn and eventually close the moon with the coming of the last day. And Philipp Melanchthon wrote something about this prodigy. Many things that I feel also terrify me. The French war is escalating, and we will not be able to keep our people in line; their spirits are tumultuous and they thirst for gold; they are poor due to the constant feasting that has been carried out and is still continued every single day, caring nothing for who will pay the accumulated money.</p>
      <p>The people are almost without God, even though perpetual sermons sound; many hear the word of God, but nonetheless, they are not better, which is strange to me. The people are stiff-necked and worthy of a great plague. The Christian world is shaken by various plagues and is overwhelmed by the densest darkness and every day we are infected with new and unheard-of diseases, we are oppressed by scarcity, tormented by hunger, and attacked from all sides, but we do not repent at all, indeed we become worse and more depraved, oh immortal God! Farewell. Basel, May 25, 1551.</p>
      <p>The envoy of the King of France returned to us yesterday; some say he came laden to recruit soldiers crowned for slaughter. Greet D. Theodor in my name along with your dearest wife.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, to his hands.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
