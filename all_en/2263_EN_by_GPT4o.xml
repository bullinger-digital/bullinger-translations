      <p> Greetings. I received your most recent letter, which included my letter addressed to Mr. Baionensem; it was faithfully delivered to his scribe at the same hour, as he himself was in Davos at the assembly. Our soldiers have granted the treaties, if indeed they wish to follow the agreement and pact between us and the king. He hesitates to withdraw them; for our wise men have agreed, even if the Swiss have not yet agreed; we are so compliant to him. However, the old saying goes: when gold speaks, any speech is powerless. In our church, we both discouraged people from military service, regardless of what those who are unwilling to listen might say; we both did this with clear and many words, and one of us even taught this in an entire sermon, and nothing more. We hold this for certain: the King of the French will not have so many Rhaetians (he requested four thousand), unless he makes a larger payment than he has so far. From Italy, we hear for certain from everyone who comes from there that Strozzi has put many Spaniards to the sword, some say a few thousand, and that many of the Emperor's leaders have been captured by him, and this happened in Siena. Some say that the Imperial forces have also suffered in the Piedmont region. </p>
      <p> Everything else with us remains in its previous state. Farewell, most honorable man, and continue to love us. Tscherner, Haimius, as he instructed me to write, Pontisella, greet you; furthermore, the brothers of the church, whose names we currently refrain from listing, wish you all happiness. </p>
      <p> From Chur, on the 16th of April, in the year 1554. </p>
      <p> Of your kindness, Johannes Comander and Philippus Gallicius. </p>
      <p> To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, his most esteemed lord. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
