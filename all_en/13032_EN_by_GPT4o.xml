    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The following information comes from a letter that Vadian received from an important man [...] from Augsburg. This man asked him to forward it to the appropriate authorities: Apart from the Swiss envoy [...], a messenger [...] from Zug and another [...] from Solothurn appeared in Augsburg! Both messengers delivered letters and stayed for almost three days at the house of Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle. It is obviously an attempt to incite the Swiss against each other, to more easily drive them into the clutches [of the Habsburg eagle]. The [pernicious influence] of money and the large number of people in the Grisons who support Emperor Charles V are particularly worrying. Vadian could not find out whether the Bishop of Chur, Lucius Iter, is also imperial-minded. The many supporters of the Emperor in the Grisons should best be removed! Why Zug and Solothurn sent messengers to Augsburg could not be determined. Perhaps there is nothing evil behind it, but it would be worth a thorough investigation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Reports from Augsburg speak of vile desecrations of women and children. The Emperor is allegedly undergoing a wood cure. Presumably, however, he has only laid himself in the Spanish lying wood. Because by feigning an illness, he most easily has peace from visitors and other affairs, to be able to prepare the future Reichstag undisturbed with his advisors!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] As soon as Itelhans Thumysen and the mayors Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater are back in Zurich, Bullinger should inform them about the news shared here, but without mentioning Vadian's name. According to rumors, an attack on the Confederation must still be reckoned with.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Respected citizens of Augsburg are said to have been stabbed for completely trivial reasons. It is enough to just look askance at one of these foreign mercenaries to be punished!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The betrayed and completely bled-out imperial cities place their last hope on the preservation of the freedoms and prosperity of the Confederation, to expect their liberation from any tyranny from there within two generations. It is believed that the imperial cities became victims of the discord prevailing among them as well as the betrayal by greedy and selfish individuals. Even the imperialists share this view.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Enclosed is a booklet full of boasts about the subjugation of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Landgrave Philipp of Hesse, who is suspected of having betrayed the Christian [Schmalkaldic] League by revealing secrets. Vadian also encloses with the present letter a pasquinade consisting of Bible passages that are actually not, but have been adapted through paraphrasing to the papal teachings. The irony of this satire against papist errors suggests a pious author, perhaps Philipp Melanchthon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings. Bullinger should return the booklet with the documents about the Landgrave.</p>

      <p>S. A very trustworthy man from Augsburg confidentially wrote to me and asked me to pass on the information to the appropriate authorities, namely that apart from the Swiss envoy sent to the imperial majesty, two messengers with letters arrived in Augsburg, one from Zug and the other from Solothurn. They stayed for three days at the house of Lord Granvelle. There is concern that there is a continuous effort to divide the Swiss Confederation and subsequently subdue and bring them into the clutches, and there is fear that money is the main concern. There are several, and not a few, who are well-disposed towards the Emperor and wish him all the best. I cannot know if the Bishop of Chur is also one of them. Certainly, there are not a few who should be removed with all seriousness. However, it is not known what Zug and Solothurn had to negotiate there. Hopefully (if God wills) nothing bad. However, this man suggests that good speech and inquiry are still needed, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Otherwise, reports from there say that it is a vile situation with women and children. The Emperor is said to have laid himself in the wood ─ perhaps in the Spanish wood of cunning ─ having gathered his advisors everywhere, with whom he composes all those things that will be discussed at the next diet; for no pretense more easily gains leisure and quiet from those greeting and bringing other business than that which feigns ill health. In summary: he is said to be lying in the wood, God grant, what kind of wood it is, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Such information may be confidentially shown to Lord Thumysen or the mayors, who have become familiar, without revealing my person; for the common saying is still that the Swiss will not remain unchallenged.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Some respected citizens are said to have been stabbed in Augsburg for trivial reasons. Whoever merely looks sourly at a foreign mercenary must lift the cats.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The highest and last desire of the poor, betrayed, and sold-out cities is that a pious Confederation may be preserved in their prosperity and brought freedom; for then there would still be hope among them that with time, by God's help, they might be freed from heavy servitude and worrisome tyranny for their children's children. Two things have given them the death blow: discord among themselves, namely among the estates of the empire, and shameless betrayal by greedy and selfish people of high and low status, as is finally believed and as the imperialists themselves let it be known.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Enclosed I send to your humanity a booklet full of boasting about the surrender of the Saxon and Hessian and about the suspicion of the Hessian, that he was a traitor to the Christian league by revealing all secrets of all orders. I also send a pasquinade sewn from Scriptures, which ascribe everything to the papists, while in reality, they attribute nothing less to themselves. It seems to me the irony of a pious man, perhaps Philipp, who wanted to mock the public cesspool of errors in this way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell and return the Emperor's diploma about the Hessian being received into grace.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, August 10, 1547.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
