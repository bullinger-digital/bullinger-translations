      <p>Health and peace through Christ.</p>
      <p>It is my greatest joy that you are all well, dearest brother. May I hear this news for a long time, especially that you may be safe in the Lord and in the power of His spirit for as long as possible. May the Lord Himself increase this health both publicly and privately. We are also well, especially since our church is well, with the weeds removed. Ambrosius, our brother, remains in Isny. We are not certain about his return, but we hope he has decided to winter with us.</p>
      <p>We hear not unhappy news about the Turkish war, namely that the enemy has vanished. I do not know what fear the Lord has struck into them, while others attribute this to battles, and that with the disgrace of God's power or His will. It can be a favorable message if worse things are considered. But certainly, Germany fights quite unfortunately, being burdened with such expense almost every other year, even if there is no other danger. The enemy is quite cunning. For after inflicting damage, killing and taking many into captivity, destroying many by fire, and miserably devastating the land, he finally departs safely, having certainly achieved what he wanted. For he wanted to harm and he harmed more than enough, to return unexpectedly whenever he wishes. How unfortunately prudent the Germans are in the business of war, when they do not believe they have fought unless countless troops are routed on both sides, indeed unless they themselves are miserably overthrown!</p>
      <p>Our soldiers have not returned, but we expect their return daily. I encouraged those who were about to leave, with what manners and with what spirit they should return. Would that we see such men. Otherwise, you know what wars teach. But if we have indeed abused this victory, we will see and experience how easy it is to repay our ingratitude to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we hear that you are burdened by many injustices, I do not know by whom. But it is a more useful exercise to be burdened than to burden others. Remember that you too have reigned. Do not immediately flare up at any injury, lest you invoke the arm of the flesh or meditate on revenge for justice. Let zeal be suspect, let certain instigators be suspect, who would want to stir up crowds for private injuries to be overcome with patience. Thus the Lord will finally protect not your cause, but His own. With humility and patience, we draw both God and men to our opinion. But may the Lord be with us. Amen.</p>
      <p>You demand frequent letters from me, which I also demand from you, although I know with what business and studies you are overwhelmed. Even if I had leisure, I do not have the talent for writing. Otherwise, I would never not write "overwhelmed".</p>
      <p>As much as possible, help has been given to this wretched one, but not according to necessity. You would not believe how we cannot do what we nevertheless wish for with all our prayers.</p>
      <p>For the kindness and benevolence shown to me when I was with you, I do not cease to give thanks. And through you, I greet all the hosts and guests. You add the names.</p>
      <p>I especially bid Pellicanus the father to be safe. Would that your wife, children, family, and all your belongings be safe.</p>
      <p>I will prepare the inkwell.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, 26th October 1532.</p>
