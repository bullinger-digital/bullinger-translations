    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks to Zwick's mediation, Bullinger did not take offense at his silence; thanks for [„De scripturae sanctae authoritate“]. He is glad about the copies of the correspondence between the Swiss and Luther and would like to be informed about Luther's certainly friendly response; something should be able to be countered to the opponents in his own and the Lutheran camp who belittle the agreement. Sebastian Franck, one of the Concord enemies in Ulm, will have to leave the city on September 29, but Kaspar Schwenckfeld - with whom Frecht, Bucer, and Blarer once reached an agreement - is still being protected; he recently saw an anonymous, undoubtedly Schwenckfeldian writing, in which the creatureliness of the glorified Christ is disputed. Delegates of the Ulm council have traveled to the Schmalkaldic League meeting in Eisenach. He received a print from Nuremberg in which Luther criticizes Simon Lemnius because he mocked some Wittenbergers in epigrams and praised Albrecht, [Arch-]Bishop of Mainz, who was hated by Luther. A rumor says that Bartolomeo Fonzio was drowned in Rome, whereupon 13 preachers appeared in his place, proclaiming the Gospel; he tries to learn more from [Johannes] Sinapius from Ferrara. The letter bearer [John Butler?] can tell more about church life in Ulm. He assures Bullinger and his colleagues of his goodwill.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I would apologize to you, my esteemed Bullinger, most humane man, for the fault of my prolonged silence with many words, if, due to your remarkable kindness, you had not already accepted our excellent Lord Zwick as a mediator and sincere intercessor, by whose intervention I was acquitted of the charge of ungrateful incivility, and you, as a judge, were not overly strict. I give you the greatest thanks both for your exceptional fairness and for your truly royal gift, with which you have both honored and, with your permission, burdened me. For when can I repay this?</p>
      <p>I add that you have sent me copies of Luther's letters to your people and theirs to him, which are quite friendly, for which benefits I give you immortal thanks. Would that I could someday return them! It remains that, as I hope Luther will do, when he has now responded to you amicably, you would also deem me worthy to be a participant in this. For you do not believe, as many do, not so much from the Lutherans as from our own, that this agreement is plainly suspect and made odious. Therefore, it is necessary to have something certain and firm to oppose those detractors.</p>
      <p>Here among us are enemies of concord, that impure Sebastian Franck, who has lived here as a citizen until now, and Mr. Kaspar Schwenckfeld, who has stayed here as a guest. The latter is now absent, and the former, as is certain hope, will leave by the next Michaelmas, namely, to be expelled from our city by the senate.</p>
      <p>Schwenckfeld, however, who, when we once made an agreement in Tübingen with Bucer, Blarer, and myself, still maintains this, indeed confessing with his mouth that he does not hinder our ministry, but rather promotes it greatly. But I hope that day by day something different will be revealed; for these days a certain writing has come into my hands, although anonymous, yet of Schwenckfeldian vein. For he contends to prove that Christ, glorified as a man, has now shed the nature of a creature and condemns all who think otherwise. But about these things, if the Lord wills, I will speak more broadly someday.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing new worthy of you now. It is the eighth day since our senate's delegates departed from here, setting out for the meeting of the evangelical allies, which will be held in Eisenach at this time; I do not know the subject of the action.</p>
      <p>From Nuremberg, a printed sheet came to me these days from Doctor Luther, posted after the Pentecost festival, in which he very severely criticizes a certain Simon Lemnius, who published some infamous epigrams in Wittenberg without the knowledge of the school and church authorities, in which he injured the reputation of good citizens and women and exalted the Archbishop of Mainz to the heavens, that is, to use Luther's words, made a god out of a devil. Hence Luther took the opportunity to argue against the Archbishop of Mainz, whom he sharply accuses; for he initially calls him the scribe of Halle and, pardon the expression, a filthy bishop, a false and lying man, whose wicked deeds Saints Stephen and Maurice, the tutelary gods of the bishoprics of Magdeburg and Halberstadt, will soon reveal to the whole world through Luther's work; for Luther promises to soon manifest the wickedness of this filthy priest (I use Luther's words) to the world. This severity is not of any spirit; how it should be received by both our adversaries and even our friends, you can easily judge with your prudence.</p>
      <p>Now rumor here spreads that Bartholomeo Fonzio of Venice, having reached Rome with public faith given to him by the Roman pontiff, gave an account of his faith, but was immediately placed in a sack by the antichrist and drowned in the Tiber, dead in the Lord. In his place, 13 evangelical preachers have emerged, who proclaim Christ in Rome even against the will of the antichrist. This, I say, is what the swift evil, rumor, spreads here and in Augsburg. I have written about this matter these days to Sinapius the physician, who lives at the court of Ferrara; if I receive anything more certain from him, I will see that you also learn of it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you wish to know anything about the church and our affairs, the present letter bearer, who will serve as a living letter, will fill in what this my twice mute letter has neglected.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, my esteemed Bullinger, with your dearest fellow ministers, esteemed lords and brothers, fare well and persuade yourselves of me, as you are accustomed to do of a most friendly and observant of your name.</p>
      <p>Even if I do not always write back to you as much as I would like, as our piously deceased Somius did, do not think that my good will and benevolent observance towards you is so weak that it always needs paper supports, although I do not willingly neglect even these duties. Again, farewell and write back when you can; for nothing is more pleasant and gratifying than your letters.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Ulm of the Swabians, July 24, 1538.</p>
      <p>Martin Frecht.</p>
      <p>To the exceptionally learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
