    <p xml:id="regest1">[Johannes] Zwick and the other deceased brothers are to be praised for their fate, which Blarer also longs for; only the hope of experiencing a Christian community keeps him going. Greetings. News will follow; he commends himself to Bullinger. [Hans] Wegmann delivered the letter; the messenger did not wait for the reply. [Enclosure:] The [imperial] troops lost several good men during the retreat from Pest; [the commander] Peter Perényi was captured and brought to Vienna. Due to the planned wedding of Ferdinand I's daughter [Elisabeth] with the son of the Polish king [Sigismund], the Reichstag in Nuremberg is postponed to December 14. Kleve and Jülich are almost completely taken, and now Geldern is also being attacked; Cologne and Hesse want to mediate. After rejecting peace with Scotland, the English lost almost 20,000 men. The Voivode [Petru Rareș] is causing great damage in Transylvania in the service of [Suleiman I]. Reports from Constantinople mention an earthquake and strange voices in the air. The [imperial] army lived so undisciplined that many fell ill and even died. The Turks are celebrating their triumph in Buda and Pest and are planning new ventures. Queen Maria [of Hungary, Regent of the Netherlands] has referred Hesse and Cologne to Emperor [Charles V] regarding negotiations over Jülich and Kleve. To support Geldern, the Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony and [Philipp of] Hesse are recruiting soldiers [returning from Hungary]; intervention from [King Christian III of] Denmark, [Duke Ludwig of Bavaria] and Duke Heinrich of Brunswick is expected. [King Francis I] is letting many mercenaries overwinter, which is why a restless summer is feared; the discord benefits [Sultan Suleiman I].</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is exactly as you write, my venerable and dearest Bullinger: I cannot help but greatly rejoice for our Zwick and the other brothers, whom the Lord transfers from here early, their fate, which I too desire with inexpressible sighs at every moment of life, as I see all human things incline towards a lamentable ruin. There is nothing anywhere from which you can conceive even the slightest hope that the affairs of Christians and indeed the whole world will be better. Therefore, let us bravely fly to follow where those best and dearest brothers of ours have gone before, although here we also have very pious people, whose company alleviates the most burdensome tedium of this life. For no one can complain with Elijah that he alone, who seeks the Lord, is left, since there are so many everywhere in whom the spirit of the Lord manifests itself not obscurely, although the number of these also daily decreases in a deplorable manner, so that every pious person not without cause fears that he himself will be the last to place the final footsteps in this more than worst world. In reading Jeremiah, you do what I also am accustomed to do, my brother, who would not at all dare to promise better things to our people than he did to his, with everything daily falling into worse. Meanwhile, however, as you rightly advise, I do not despair so much that, if not for several years, yet I hope to see for a few hours some example of a rightly and most Christianly constituted republic, however soon it may perish again, and here many good brothers and sisters add not a little courage to me, who will stand as a wall against divine wrath, by whose benefit I trust we will have peace for a while, until we too are gathered to our fathers, although I wish the posterity, if there is to be any, to fare as well as possible. But hands must be lifted.</p>
      <p>See to it that you commend us perpetually and Christianly to our Savior Jesus Christ, greeting all who are there, the venerable and dearest brothers Pellican, Theodor, Megander, Fabricius, and especially your entire household with the incomparable man, your consul Rösti, his son and daughter-in-law. Conrad Zwick and my brother with his wife send you their most dutiful and loving greetings.</p>
      <p>Now I will write to you briefly what I have received in letters from others in these recent days, and I do this more willingly because I see that in this way, if in no other, I can gratify you not in a common manner; indeed, I would prefer nothing else than to testify to you my highest love for you with some argument not ungrateful to you. You wish the Lord to be my rewarder for my faith, diligence, charity, and beneficence, which are plainly nothing, I in turn wish you the Lord himself, since outside of him there is absolutely nothing from which I can hope to do equally with you. Farewell. November 21, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>Wegmann the tribune arranged for your letters to be delivered to me through a certain boy; whom I absolutely wanted to address, but he had already left.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, venerable and by far dearest brother. In Zurich.</p>
