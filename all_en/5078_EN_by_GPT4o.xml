      <p>S. D. You will forgive me, venerable old man and most esteemed lord, if I am perhaps briefer in writing than you would like. Attribute this to my inexplicable affairs, and that, broken by immense and endless labors, I cannot do as much as I would otherwise willingly wish. Regarding the bishop's cause, I do not have the leisure to write at length; however, I am quite sure that you, with your prudence, are not unaware of this: the more the power and influence of the bishops grow, the more is detracted from the Church of Christ and the truth, especially since the bishops are sworn to the Pope, the Antichrist, and if they do not promote his kingdom, at least they do not hinder it, but rather preserve it with all their might, lest it fall. Yet the time is approaching when they will not be able to preserve it, but will perish along with their head. I urge your piety to always not only progress in true religion but also seriously assist the course of the gospel and ensure that obstacles are removed. I have taken care to have my homilies on the Apocalypse of John bound for you, as you requested; but since the book seemed too thin and yet the same price had to be paid to the binder, I have taken care to add here the homilies of my son in Christ, Gwalther, and my most closely related relative on Mark; the bearer paid two gold coins; the bookseller and bookbinder wanted the same amount counted for themselves; if I have erred in increasing the costs, forgive me. I cannot briefly explain everything about French affairs, but in summary: D. Peter Martyr, our school's professor, called by the most serene queen and the most illustrious princes of France, departed on August 26th, escorted by the envoys of the kings of France and Navarre; he returned safe and sound on the 22nd of this month, escorted by two captains, certainly excellent men, leaders of the horsemen. They brought letters from the queen, the queen of Navarre, Prince Cond√©, the admiral, etc., to the most honorable magistrate, in which they express thanks for the use of such a great man and testify that his presence was very beneficial; for the churches of Christ are growing in France beyond belief; they have their pastors and very large congregations. The bishops of the papists want to disturb these; but the power of the nobility is great, which proceeds strongly.</p>
      <p>A colloquium was held at Poissy and an attempt was made to find some agreement; however, due to the fault of the cardinals and bishops, the colloquium was abruptly ended. By God's grace, our side was superior in the colloquium.</p>
      <p>Now it is being discussed how peace can be preserved by some agreement. The states of the entire kingdom will meet again in December; in the meantime, the assemblies of the faithful are tolerated, they are not confirmed by any edict; it is hoped they will be confirmed in the next assemblies.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Pope with his dregs attempts the utmost; they will incite the king of Spain, who threatens to expel the gospel from France. There are various schemes, and God must be prayed to, that He Himself preserves His truth.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more now.</p>
      <p>I wrote this very hastily and did not reread it.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours, great man and incomparable friend. Greet my most sincere friend D. Friedrich, your son-in-law, and our son Johann, etc., along with the ministers of your churches.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 28, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Regarding the people of Chur, I cannot now; it is too lengthy to explain now; it still lingers and the insolence of the Cantons is great. I fear some evil; may the Lord avert it.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man D. Johannes Travers of Zuoz, Rhaetian, most esteemed lord and incomparable friend.</p>
