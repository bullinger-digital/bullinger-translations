      <p> I have had this letter with me since the 6th of September, but I could not find a suitable messenger to send it to you; for all the merchants had gone to Frankfurt, and so now I am sending both the old and the new together. The banishment of the preachers of Augsburg disturbs everyone's minds and deters and discourages them from attending the council; for what do we believe the fathers will do, influenced by such prejudice? Regarding the 17 Spanish ships intercepted by the Frenchman Pollino and the Scots and brought to Normandy, I know you have already been informed; the knowledge of all French actions is more certain with you than it is here. The King of Denmark, the King of Poland, the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg, and the Palatine, then the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, the Duke of Pomerania, and the Duke of Prussia have decided to intercede for the Landgrave in the future at the Imperial Majesty's court; but it seems unlikely that they will achieve anything with their pleas. I hear that negotiations have been made with the people of Nuremberg to also dismiss their preachers; but they have responded that the Emperor has decreed that the matter of religion should be determined by a free and Christian council and that all the orders of the Empire have decreed the same, therefore they trust that the Emperor will stand by his promises and the decrees of the Empire and will not introduce any changes before the completion of the council, and they still retain the preachers. Farewell again. 23rd of September. </p>
      <p> To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Bullinger, most esteemed friend. Zurich. </p>
