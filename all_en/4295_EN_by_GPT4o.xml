      <p>The rumor that was spread about several thousand being in arms was utterly baseless; for not more than seventy set out, and indeed half of them were of the lowest class of craftsmen. However, their expedition pleased me in such a way that they attempted more, in my judgment, than God would allow; thus, lacking counsel, they foolishly and childishly undertook an illegitimate matter; those who were innocent among them paid the penalty for excessive credulity. Around the same time, in some cities of Provence and Dauphin√©, our men occupied the temples, as if they were already in possession of their desires; but, as rashness is never firm or consistent, at the first sound of arms, that zeal, which we had vainly tried to restrain, immediately vanished. Since they did not dare to engage openly and in battle, the Guise, with flattering and deceitful edicts under the king's name, gradually broke the spirits of those whose strength they could not match. Many were ensnared by these plots, and while each one looked out for himself privately, their society was scattered. Now, with things somewhat pacified, those executioners begin to rage cruelly, and if the Scottish war did not stand in the way of their fury, the condition of the pious in France would be far worse. They especially threaten us and this city, where they think all the disturbances are being stirred up, or rather they pretend to feel this way as a pretext for capturing. Almost this entire month, the neighbors thought it was all over for us; yet I could never be persuaded to fear, nor did I truly see any cause for fear. If greater dangers press upon us, relying on God's protection, we will calmly await the outcome; whatever happens, the heavenly Father will turn it to our salvation, and the regard for the whole church will also avail somewhat for our mercy.</p>
      <p>This is not in my own hand, because I dictated it from bed, where I customarily lie for half the time, so that at least some hours may remain safe for me. May 29, 1560.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed and dearest brother.</p>
