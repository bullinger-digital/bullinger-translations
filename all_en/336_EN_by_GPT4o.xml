      <p>My willing service along with friendly greetings beforehand. Gracious, dear sir, I have learned from your latest letter how things are with Konstanz.</p>
      <p>This grieves me deeply, and I am troubled for the honorable people who loved Christ and His holy word, so badly that it distresses me. Despite all the hundredfold examples, no one wants to believe, but each one is deceived himself. May God from heaven soon put an end to it out of grace and help, so that it may eventually come to a halt at some point.</p>
      <p>There were also three envoys from Luzern, Solothurn, and Freiburg here, who undoubtedly have the same opinion as the others have presented to you in a friendly manner, and their matters appear in such a way that I hope to God it will serve the good peace of the Confederation. The agreement with the king in France also contributed well to this, who, as I hear, is very eager to make the alliance between the Confederates and him. May the Almighty grant His grace to it, so that there may still remain a small place on earth where a Christian may dwell.</p>
      <p>I have somewhat defended the emperor to the envoys; they have kindly accepted it from me with the assurance that if my matter is remembered by their superiors, they will also speak well of it.</p>
      <p>The uprising in Bordeaux in France is said to be settled; however, they do not want to let the Lord Constable into the city, fearing punishment for some instigators. Nevertheless, up to 4000 people are said to still be in the countryside and among the marshes, staying together and unwilling to surrender unless they all remain unpunished.</p>
      <p>The emperor is very quiet in Brussels, having no troops with him. Saxony and Hesse are still held in good custody, Saxony in the city and at the court in Brussels, Hesse outside in a small town in Brabant. Entrusted to the grace of God.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, November 4, 1548. Sebastian Schertlin, knight, signed.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, etc., my gracious, dear sir.</p>
