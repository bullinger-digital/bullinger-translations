      <p>Greetings from Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear brother, when I sent you Heini Jos and Buchmann eight days ago, they gave me your response on Saturday, with which I agree. Regarding the co-liable guarantors, the Prior will likely express his opinion. If it is not customary for the office, I will not do it; if it is not necessary (for his direction), he will find someone else who is willing to do it. My opinion is that you should respond that he should find someone. However, you can do as the Prior advises. Also, give him the money so that I don't have to keep it, now that I should be studying, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding our mother, write to me about her condition. If it does not improve, I plan to come to Zurich before the Easter holidays once more.</p>
      <p>Michel has prepared an hourglass for me; give it to the blacksmith and have him make it so that it does not break.</p>
      <p>If there is any news with you, I ask you to let me know, because there are many lies about the war here, like how the people from Schwyz painted their shield on the gallows somewhere at the border.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet the family.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, his brother.</p>
