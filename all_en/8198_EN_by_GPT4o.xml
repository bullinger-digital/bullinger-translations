      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, this time I have nothing to write to you, but I found in your room a torn calendar of this year, where I still found some notes.</p>
      <p>I am sending them to you herewith, in case they might be useful to you and prevent you from harm. Young Master Hans Mey is fresh and healthy, he wrote here yesterday; that is, his letter, which he wrote in the Italian land, arrived here the day before yesterday, and I did not understand it at night. There is also a letter to you; Heinrich also wrote one to him.</p>
      <p>Take care, he will arrange your affairs. He will come home on the 11th or 12th of March. Yesterday, the boys set off in God's name together, Rudolf Zwingli, Rudolf Walthart, and Bernhard Meyer from Knonau, etc. May God grant them His grace; may He also protect you, Susanna, Elisabeth, and the whole household. I have not yet received anything from Glarus.</p>
      <p>Dated Friday, 3rd of March, when March has a rusty, horned beak. May God will that he does not peck off the ravens with it, 1570.</p>
      <p>All the people greet you.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
