      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Your brother came to us, most esteemed man, and so that he would not return to you empty-handed, I wanted to give him these, along with some sheets from our book and commentaries on the Apocalypse. I will send more from our book with the next messenger. Added to this will be the book "On the Origin of Error" concerning the Lord's Supper and the papal Mass. Finally, the Holy Bible, the translation by Münster, has been printed, to which I will preface a foreword about all the books of the Holy Scripture and their dignity and excellence, etc. May the Lord be with you; I could not write more now. February 15, 1539. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Joachim Vadian (von Watt), most esteemed lord.</p>
