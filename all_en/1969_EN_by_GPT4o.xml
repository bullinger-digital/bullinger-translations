      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed patron, Georg Keller sends his greetings.</p>
      <p>Day by day, I perceive and understand more and more the great love you have for me, my most esteemed patron, as you have not rested until you have promoted me, unworthy as I am (due to my weakness and insignificance), to the pinnacle of highest esteem and expectation, unless you had urged me, almost resisting and somewhat fearful, to write, and not to just any of my closest peers, but to you yourself, whom I have hitherto feared to trouble with my most barbarous letters, and to whom I have preferred to allocate time to more important matters than reading my letters with greater pleasure. However, since I must rightly obey and comply with your most honorable advice, breaking off all delay and removing all fear, relying on your utmost kindness, I venture to write these few words to you, trusting that you will read them with no less favorable a mind than that of others. But what, then, will be the beginning of the letter, with what narrative, with what kind of reasons shall I use, what shall I write that I understand will be pleasing and acceptable to you?</p>
      <p>Shall I sing of the warlike tumults and dissensions, which we now see arising and increasing more and more everywhere among the nations? But all these things are more known to you than you would wish, there is no doubt. But what shall I write, when it is not fitting for me to attend to these things and to be curious about them? Therefore, I shall write about our health (which I hope will be pleasing to you), which, by the benefit of the most good and great God, we have enjoyed in the best condition until now, so that you may understand that we are not using it in a worse condition even now with the same help, which indeed I do not need to say how much I desire to hear about you and yours. Indeed, aided by the work of this most good and great God, we strive with all our might and exert all our efforts (as they say) to fully satisfy and respond to the expectation and hope you have conceived of us, and not to succumb to the very heavy burden that we feel is pressing upon our shoulders due to excessive laziness, and finally, to be a great honor to those to whom we are indeed a great disgrace (may God avert this omen). Indeed, he must be earnestly entreated with the greatest prayers to deign to avert and calm the most savage wars and the most serious diseases, which we see raging all around, with his mercy, so that finally peace, the nourisher of all good things, now hiding for a long time, may finally come forth and all things may be rendered tranquil, so that we may better perform our duty and you may finally expect greater hope from us day by day and promise yourselves, and that you may not regret having chosen us for this task.</p>
      <p>This was hastily sent to you due to the constraint of time. Therefore, if there has been any error in writing or composing these things (as indeed there is much), your kindness of spirit will not disdain to make up for it. Having understood this, I will later undertake the same task with greater diligence and a more eager spirit. If I were to ask you to preserve your former love for me, I would indeed do an injustice to both you and our friendship, as I would seem to distrust your constancy. Therefore, I will not allow you to rightly accuse me of this matter. Meanwhile, I complain that Heinrich and Rudolf, your sons, have so forgotten me that they have not yet sent me any letters, nor do I think that I am not loved by them, whom I love wonderfully. I would like you to remind them of this matter, and convey my greetings to them and the whole family. Farewell. Dr. Martin and Brother Wolphius wish you all well. Paris, August 26. To the most learned man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most excellent minister of the divine word among the people of Zürich, his most loving patron. Zürich.</p>
