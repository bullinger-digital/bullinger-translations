      <p>S. Both envoys came to us on the evening of August 28th, after I had informed you in the morning of the same day with three lines via the Luggarnense that their arrival was expected. I read everything they demand very diligently.</p>
      <p>First of all, it is demanded that the Italian exiles be expelled from Chiavenna and the Valtellina and (see the impudence of people) that the monks of Morbegno be received at the discretion and will of the prior, whoever he may be, as long as he is Catholic; likewise, the Jesuit monastery should be restored, etc. You will hear about the other countless absurdities at another time.</p>
      <p>The last demand is that the Pope's full rights in the Three Leagues be restored: that he may announce his bulls and post them unhindered in all places and ends, and that they be followed, and that this may bring more love and friendship, they, the Rhaetians, write to Philip themselves and show themselves entirely inclined and obedient to do so. They also summon our people to the council.</p>
      <p>You will have the full details at some point.</p>
      <p>Either these people are seeking a pretext for war with force, or they consider the people of these lands to be complete fools, or they are great fools themselves to make such requests; for they demand things and much more so crudely and with such broad words that any simple peasant can understand. I hope to God it will never succeed for them, or if it does, there must be a special madness in the land, unknown to me and many a good man, and God will visibly punish us. This evening the three leaders are coming together, but they will only begin to handle the matter tomorrow.</p>
      <p>I think that next Sunday the matters will be presented to the communities back and forth. You may share this with our lord mayor Tscharner (if he is still with you), so that he may prepare himself more advantageously at home. In the meantime, you will encourage him with your authority to prove himself a man.</p>
      <p>Now, since this is a common cause, since our adversaries are bringing together all their plans and efforts and leaving nothing untried, since the Pope no longer asks obscurely but openly and without ambiguity that we abandon the doctrine of the Gospel and return to his filth, that we submit to the council, that we expel good men, - what would prevent Zurich and Bern, along with the other evangelicals, from sending their envoys to ours, to confirm them and instruct them more clearly about all these things? You see that the Five Places are not ashamed. Why are we then so negligent and sluggish and do not come together with more seriousness and loyalty? Especially since it has now come to the last; for if this rampart should succeed for them, you would have the war more certainly on your neck. I hope to God it will not be necessary; nevertheless, it would frighten the enemies and raise our spirits, moreover, it is to be feared that the Five Places will have their embassy there. But if one wanted to send envoys, one would have to hurry; if not, then at least write with seriousness, etc. This is written hastily, as you see.</p>
      <p>When I had written this far, I received yours. You say you are anxiously waiting to know what has been decided in the assemblies (I assume you are speaking of the minor assemblies, at the diet, on behalf of Mr. Beccaria). Understand this about it: The Five Places wrote sharply and wanted a final answer shortly. From the loyalty, those from the courts have done so much that they have ridden day and night so as not to anger their confederates, that is, they have done their duty and have never appeared at the diet, have sent their land bailiff with a letter: they let it remain as it was decided at the diet; if they are concerned about something, they can wait for a decision from the diet. So it has remained.</p>
      <p>This will bite the people a little, that they have not been immediately incited, etc. At that time, the Pope's embassy had not yet arrived, and it was thought that there would be no diet before St. Martin's Day. Since then, I have been with several trusted friends and hope that the matter can be delayed in such a way that the diet does not begin before 14 days.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, if something were to be considered by your or other evangelical cities, there would be enough time. I am also sending you the entire proposal from their (the envoys') own original translated word for word. You may have it read to whomever you wish; for the same will be presented to the communities. I am very grateful to you for having forwarded my letters to Mr. Coignet; for it seems to me more and more necessary that something comes from France. Several prominent people among us, who have come together, write about the same matter. Therefore, our urgent request to you is that you ensure that these letters reach Mr. Coignet, and if it is possible for you, I would very much like you to write to Mr. Coignet as well; for he must know that, although Philip's embassy only presents these things, he is secretly practicing many other things. Otherwise, things are going well with us in Chur, and I have good hope.</p>
      <p>The envoys are alone in the inn and would like company; yet no one goes to them. I have sometimes seen that elsewhere much more fuss was made with a dirty abbot than with this great lord's embassy. - You know that the Bishop of Constance is dead. - This, which I send here, is Ricci's proposal.</p>
      <p>The Pope's embassy's proposal has not yet reached me; however, it will be essentially the same, only that the Pope's envoy will use sweeter words.</p>
      <p>This is poorly translated; yet it will not be translated otherwise; for they have had it translated in this way themselves, etc. Chur, September 2, 1561.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, renowned for his learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his ever-honored lord and patron. Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
