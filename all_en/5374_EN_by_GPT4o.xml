      <p>S. D. With the greatest sorrow, I hear and read that cities, stripped of their defenses, are being occupied one after another, and that so many saints are being slaughtered everywhere. I am terribly afraid for Lyon, for which I have written to you seriously once and again, having learned that all the plans of the enemies are directed towards its occupation and to instill terror in all our people. I also mentioned that the people of the Five Cantons would set out with their own, and indeed they have set out.</p>
      <p>Would that they either not return or return by seven ways! In the meantime, Guise is negotiating about establishing peace, while he himself gathers a strong army; but when he thinks himself sufficiently equipped, then our people will finally experience what those delays were intended for. Mr. Augustinus Maynardus writes from Italy that the Pope has prepared 8,000 men to send to France against the prince to exterminate the heretics. Others add that the Duke of Ferrara is also preparing troops to join with Guise and the most wicked constable, Achitophel. I have promptly taken care of the letters addressed to Mr. Hercules from Salice and will now write down Mr. Fabritius's response.</p>
      <p>He writes back: "I am very displeased with the hesitation of our well-equipped men, as are all the brave men and experts in military affairs whom I have heard.</p>
      <p>You desire that the Rhaetians do their duty; you urge fervently. But what should they do, to whom no one has written anything so far! And indeed, they are most indignant to be thus overlooked. How is it that the most illustrious Prince of Condé has so neglected our people? When our people see themselves thus despised, they are indignant. At least the prince should write to them; if nothing else, he would win over the spirits of our people. Before our people go to Geneva and return, a month will have passed.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, will the pious be prey to the impious? If you can do anything with Mr. Calvin and Beza, ensure that the Prince of Condé, if he indeed needs the help of the Rhaetians, writes promptly.</p>
      <p>I will submit the letters entrusted to me to Mr. Hercules.</p>
      <p>I would wish for him to proceed to Geneva himself." These are the words of Fabritius, which I did not want you to be unaware of.</p>
      <p>Hallwyler has not yet responded.</p>
      <p>I can hardly express how anxious I am that our plans may turn out differently than we wish. Let us pray to the Lord to guide the matters Himself.</p>
      <p>Not far from us is Baron Mr. Ulrich Philipp of the High Saxony, very skilled in military affairs, who would like nothing more than to be called by the Prince of Condé; he could bring some troops from Switzerland. However, I fear that these matters are being handled too late.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us and preserve His own! Farewell forever with all good things. The brothers greet you; greet Mr. Budé, Jonville, and all the brothers. Given on the very day of John the Baptist, late in the evening, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my most honorable lord and dearest brother. [Geneva].</p>
