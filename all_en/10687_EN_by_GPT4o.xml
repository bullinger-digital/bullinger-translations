The council has sentenced the blasphemer [Rosenbaum] to imprisonment, but acquitted the pastors.

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>I do not know whether the letter dated September 6th has been delivered to you. I entrusted it to the coachman from Kloten with the utmost care, even adding a gratuity.</p>
      <p>However, our accuser attempted to prove his insults against us with an Anabaptist argument, namely that our life is dissimilar to Christ's, and therefore our doctrine is false. But the council passed a judgment that he did not prove the insults against us. Therefore, so as not to appear too eager for revenge, we entrusted the matter to the council and earnestly requested that they protect the doctrine, which is not ours but Christ's, and the office, which is not ours but the church's, more diligently, so that it may not be tainted by such insults in the future. They generously promised to do so. Consequently, they consigned the accused to the most dreadful prison, and we were acquitted.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is a widespread rumor among us about Bucer's recantation. For in these days, a merchant of great renown from Augsburg, David von Dettighofen, was here, who said he attended a sermon that Bucer gave to the people, in which he publicly confessed that whatever he has written and taught about the sacrament of the Eucharist until now are errors; he now recants all of it and at the same time asks for forgiveness.</p>
      <p>Then Waldkilch is circulating a new booklet, which was recently published by Ambrosius Blarer, in which he declares his opinion somewhat more than in his apology. I have not read it, but Bovillus, who says remarkable things about Blarer, has.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we have also heard that Capito was with you. Please tell me what he did, I beg you. And regarding our apology, what is to be hoped for, make sure, if you have the leisure, that I am informed by this messenger.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Schaffhausen, September 15, 1535.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and good friend.</p>
