      <p>Greetings. Since this command was given to us by you, most illustrious lord and most revered father, to write to you frequently from the journey about the success of the boys and all of us, we have thought it necessary to begin executing your paternal command at the nearest place, Basel, where we arrived safely and unharmed by the grace of God on the third day after our departure from Zürich.</p>
      <p>Everything on the journey went smoothly; the boys were carried in the carriage without discomfort, except that they retain the greatest longing for you, from which an uncommon weariness has arisen, which they endure with difficulty, even with tears; while eating, dining, or doing something else, they heave deep sighs, remembering the love of their most dear father and mother.</p>
      <p>We do not neglect our duty, we prioritize all their comforts, especially their health and what follows it, over our own well-being, and we hope the Lord will be with us, aided by your prayers.</p>
      <p>We have now found a suitable ship, on which we will descend to Strasbourg tomorrow; for our coachmen have gone directly to Lorraine from here.</p>
      <p>But we will enjoy greater comfort by the easy descent of the Rhine by the grace of God; from there we will send you longer letters.</p>
      <p>For we write this in haste.</p>
      <p>I am sending you a certain booklet written by our Pole Orichovius, it is named "Chimaera," but truly a chimera has begotten a chimera, and thus I think that this talkative Orichovius will remain a chimera in the future, not because he deals with the rascal Stancarus, but because he attacks many holy and pious men and does not spare your name, the beast.</p>
      <p>God will finally restrain his impiety.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily, most revered father, with your most prudent and pious wife, our mother, and with your entire most honorable family; the boys send their most dutiful greetings to you all, and I to your colleagues and sons-in-law, most illustrious men.</p>
      <p>May God preserve you for His church.</p>
      <p>Given at Basel, May 9, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your most observant servant, Christoph Thretius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the distinguished leader of the Zürich church, etc., his lord and most revered.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
