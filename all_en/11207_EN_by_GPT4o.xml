      <p>Greetings. Until now, he has celebrated mass here and in the meantime preached the gospel, for which reason he was taken captive by the people of Ensisheim and detained for some time, not without fear of great danger. Finally, having been freed, he was forced to renounce Lutheranism. Therefore, console and advise him to persevere steadfastly in the Lord and to be and remain. And if you can assist in any other way, do so, as you are accustomed.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and love me in return.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 30, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the people of Zurich, his venerable lord in Christ.</p>
