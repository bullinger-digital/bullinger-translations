    <p xml:id="regest1">It is uncertain whether his letter [No. 1406] has arrived; he distrusts the messengers. For this reason, he cannot further explain why he wants to leave Marburg and go to Frankfurt for the fair; he will report from there and advises against sending more students to Marburg. He does not attend lectures and only maintains closer contact with Eobanus Hessus, who is friendly towards him and Bullinger; Bullinger should write to him. He expects instructions and reminds of his financial difficulties. He promises a poem. Geldenhauer has not yet returned from Hagenau; preparations for war are underway. Greetings. He apologizes for his poor handwriting.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>A few weeks ago, I sent you a letter, most kind father, but I doubt whether you have received it; for these are times and manners such that you can rightly consider yourself fortunate if you manage to find a faithful caretaker for your affairs.</p>
      <p>I described my situation somewhat in previous letters, about which I might write more now if I had as much security in writing as I have occasion to write. However, you will understand the essence of everything from my plan, which is entirely such that I have decided to free myself from Marburg at the first possible opportunity. However, I am waiting for the fair, where our Froschauer will find me. There are many reasons for my decision, both the lack of useful readings for me and especially this, which, as I was to inform you, you had commanded. You understand what I mean. It is incredible to say how much I desire to describe the whole matter perfectly, and I can hardly restrain my pen inclined to this. However, I will write everything in detail if I reach Frankfurt. In the meantime, I want to warn you (if I still have any trust with you) not to send young men here whom you wish to be well-educated.</p>
      <p>I always hide here at home with my Muses. I do not attend any lectures here, partly because they are not very convenient for me, partly so that I can better extricate myself from the questions of certain troublesome people. I have a roommate from Frankfurt with whom I share my studies. Among the professors is Mr. Eobanus Hessus, the prince of poets, to whom I often go to delight myself with his company and to become more learned through his conversations. He has certainly shown me every courtesy of humanity so far. He is also, as far as I can judge, an excellent supporter of your name. You would do him a great favor by addressing him in a letter, and I have no doubt that he will reply.</p>
      <p>Please, consider what I should decide. I will follow your advice. As for what I wrote earlier about the money, please see to it. For you yourself see that it is impossible for me to live for half a year on the salary of a single courier.</p>
      <p>I will send you at the fair what my Thalia has played here in the meantime, while trying to expel the distress of the mind.</p>
      <p>Noviomagus has not yet returned from Hagenau. We expect war here every day, and there is no one who does not prepare for arms at the prince's command. I greatly fear that we will feel the most serious disturbances. I will write about the cause of my fear another time.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name your wife and mother with the whole family. I wish to greet my brother Johann more than a thousand times.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Marburg, from the college of the orchard, 8 days before the calends of August 1540.</p>
      <p>Forgive the deformity of the characters, for I was forced to write hastily. Yours most observantly,</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
