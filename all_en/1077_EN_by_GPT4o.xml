      <p>Greetings and Peace. When I recently gave your book, the fourth decade of sermons, to the almoner, he asked that I send these letters of his to you through some trustworthy man. I gladly took care of this, both for many other reasons and because I wished you would write to him as often as possible. For among all the Englishmen I know, he is the most steadfast in friendship; and as for how great a patron of studies he is, you can learn from your people who are in Oxford, so I will not say more. Furthermore, this man's authority is not insignificant in this kingdom, as he has long been entrusted by the highest council, along with other bishops, with the task of correcting and better establishing the ceremonies and the entire ecclesiastical matter. How much is still lacking, we can easily see, we who know not only from the word but also from experience what the church ought to be like; but they do not deny it. Nevertheless, I think they have progressed thus far not undeserving of praise. Therefore, some seem to me more unjust, who prefer to attack the works and efforts and studies of the best men with detractions or accusations rather than encourage them to make further progress. It is indeed very true that nothing is easier than to criticize the good deeds of others or to add to their undertakings and inventions, although this is somewhat praiseworthy, the former is far more disgraceful. Therefore, what has been accomplished so far deserves to be praised by all the pious; yet I would not wish them to remain in these beginnings, but they should be encouraged to progress further. For you are not unaware of how arduous it is to restore a collapsed religion. Moreover, our people and especially here (as I know well) would like everything to be completed more quickly and fully.</p>
      <p>However, the struggle of votes stands in the way, as there is no head of full and free power.</p>
      <p>Then, because it often happens that in human affairs we fail by rushing too much in the middle, it results that in the matter of religion we are slower and more hesitant or at least seem so, than we ought to be. Here exhortations are needed, which either stir up languishing spirits or free them from some vain and preposterous fear.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since I am fully aware of how great is the zeal for religion of this most excellent man who loves your name, and how great your authority is with him, I did not hesitate to ask you to spur him on with your letters and also to add your counsel fortified with arguments, which he can follow in abolishing certain remnants of ancient superstition and restoring the true worship of God, which the church may follow publicly and privately piously. You will do this as quickly as you can, since within two months they will again meet to correct that book of royal constitution in ecclesiastical ceremonies.</p>
      <p>In which it has been granted either to the weakness of some or rather to the malice of others, that the ancient rites should be retained as closely as possible. Everything is done in English, and many impious things are rejected. However, the name of Saint Mary still holds a place in the prayers made at the time of the Eucharist, and the dead are also commended to God. Songs and vestments and the whole papal order are retained, and in the cathedral churches a sermon is held daily, in others almost every week very often without any sermon and not with the people communicating, but with some priests and indeed few of them. P[...] the wine is diluted with water and the bread is given only to the priests in hand. But since I do not doubt that the book has been sent to us, I will cease to pursue what in the burial of the dead and elsewhere has so far seemed tolerable or at least could not be obtained from the adversaries to be completely abolished. Therefore, I ask you to write diligently to him about the vestments and the songs and those fragments of the gospel... and epistles... what about the canon, in which the memory of the Virgin Mary and the deceased is made, what about the prayers for the resurrection of the dead and about the feasts and certain observances, what should be done on this or that day, what also about Lent and fasts on the saints' feasts, I ask you to write diligently to him. If you wish to add something about the consecration of bishops and the institution of priests and deacons, it will not be useless. I know your effort will not be in vain and your study will be most pleasing to this excellent man.</p>
      <p>It will be your prudence to write in such a way that you do not seem to have understood anything from me except the state in which things still are, but nothing about their future meeting. Since this is the work of God and I know you wish for whatever will be for the benefit of the church or the glory of God, I know you will do it seriously and diligently. If there is anything in which you wish to use my service, I offer all duty and obedience to you.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name Mr. Bibliander and Mr. Pellican with Mr. Gwalther and your wives of all.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you safe and increase you more and more with His spirit. From the court of the King of England on the Ides of November 1550.</p>
      <p>Your most observant disciple Valérand Poullain.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant ecclesiast of the Church of Zürich and the most faithful servant of Christ.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
