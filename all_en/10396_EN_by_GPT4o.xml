      <p>Greetings. Myconius wrote to me on April 20th as follows: The Prince of Hesse [...] is silent. This is from Myconius. If you have any information on these matters, please share it.</p>
      <p>I am entirely focused on persuading certain trustworthy men to resolve the dispute between the Abbot and your city, so that amidst these most perilous turmoils, we may abstain from legal contention for a year or two, and in the meantime, each party may enjoy their rights and privileges. I hope to achieve something in this matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and continue with the Epitome. I did not have time to reread.</p>
      <p>April 24, 1534.</p>
      <p>I wish Vogler well.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To Doctor Joachim Vadian, the most prudent consul of St. Gallen, my friend and most esteemed lord.</p>
