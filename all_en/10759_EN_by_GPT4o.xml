    <p xml:id="regest1">Contrary to Bullinger's reproach, he has already sent a letter through Quirinus [von Leiden]. Inquires about what Bullinger and Theodor [Bibliander] primarily want to negotiate [at the meeting convened in Basel]; not only the Lord's Supper is disputed. The intentions of the people of Strasbourg are unclear. A letter from Erasmus [Ritter] indicates that the people of Schaffhausen are hesitant to participate; they should be urged to do so. A Frenchman has observed an unchanged hard stance on the issue of the Lord's Supper in Swabia and with Osiander and Venatorius in Nuremberg; even if Luther were more conciliatory, there would be little hope for concord.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You seem to complain that I have not replied to your letters, which I do not understand. For I sent a letter through Quirinus (von Leiden) a few days ago, as lengthy as it was inept, which, since you write this, I doubt was delivered. You also wonder why no mention was made of any articles. Indeed, I am currently asking you, as well as Theodor (Bibliander), about which topics you think should be discussed first. For it is not only the Eucharist that is contentious, but also confession, absolution, images, original sin, the intercession of saints, and other matters I am not aware of. As for the people of Strasbourg, we wrote earlier (for it seems so) that they would seek an agreement on doctrine and church governance, and then, in other matters, what can be conceded to the papists, what cannot, and what can be overlooked, etc. They might attempt something regarding the power of the ministry if they come, which I do not know at all; what that might be, I cannot ascertain. Please do what I ask regarding the articles, as if you had promised.</p>
      <p>Erasmus (Ritter) of Schaffhausen writes uncertainly whether his people will come unless they are seriously invited, and this because of the papists and Anabaptists, who know that this meeting will not turn out well for them. Therefore, they must be urged.</p>
      <p>A certain Frenchman reports from Swabia how obstinately some there boast in their sermons that the sacramentarians have defected from their opinion regarding the Eucharist; also that he met with Osiander and Venatorius in Nuremberg about this sacrament, but heard nothing about concord or even the slightest mitigation of their former opinion, while Melanchthon is spoken of very poorly, as he seems to have become more submissive and to hold something Zwinglian in his heart. It seems to me that the Swabians will not yield, even if we agree with Luther, although nothing has yet appeared from which there is hope of an easy concord with him. For you know what that Boniface of Augsburg writes. May God have mercy on us, as He has done so far, and we will lack nothing.</p>
      <p>I sent the letter collection, as you requested. Farewell with your family and Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, in the year 1536, January 11.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of Christ, his dearest in the Lord.</p>
