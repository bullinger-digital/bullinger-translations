      <p>S. D. Your case, beloved brother, was discussed yesterday in a full senate meeting. First, the testimonies of those who were asked were heard, and then your declaration, which was handed over to the most honorable consul, was read. The senate decided that you should stay and teach faithfully.</p>
      <p>What will happen at the Baden assembly, no one can easily say. However, the delegates to be sent there will be instructed to commend this cause and to advocate for you. There is no doubt that the governor or proconsul of the province will present this case kindly.</p>
      <p>We have thus conceived a good hope that this matter, initially quite daunting, will not be resolved so unhappily; to achieve this, we must pray to the Lord, who holds and turns hearts in His hand. In this, farewell and keep our John Stephanus in your care.</p>
      <p>Keep all these things to yourself, so they do not leak out. Zurich, August 19, 1560.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Bernard and Marcus Siccius, my old friend.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Convey my willing service and friendly greetings to my gracious lord, the governor, and that I have received letters from England last Friday, dated in London on July 22, which state that in all three kingdoms, England, Ireland, and Scotland, the state of religion is quite well and that it is remarkably increasing, and that the severe war between France and the three kingdoms has been settled and judged. The conditions of peace have been sent to me, but I do not have them at hand now.</p>
      <p>The queen in France is and remains queen in Scotland; however, she should not at all assume the titles of England and Ireland, and the letters, coats of arms, and seals bearing those titles should be annulled. All Scots should remain with their privileges; 12 men shall govern, of whom 7 are to be chosen by the queen, and 5 by the parliament in Scotland from the Scottish nobility. All Frenchmen shall leave Scotland except for 120, of whom 60 shall remain in the garrison of Dunbar, 60 in the garrison of Eyemouth, and they shall be inspected and paid monthly by the regents.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, no ships or foreign people shall be allowed into the land without the knowledge of the Scots, and the fortress of Leith shall be demolished in the presence of the commissioners in England and according to their command, as well as the new fortress near Dunbar. Any damages and injustices that occurred since 1558 in this warlike uprising shall be forgotten and forgiven, and all those displaced in Scotland shall be reinstated, etc.</p>
      <p>These are as many of the notable articles as I can remember. In France, the gospel is remarkably increasing, so much so that some unfaithful people are going around with strange counsels on how they might hinder the gospel with force. But there is no force against God.</p>
      <p>May He be with you.</p>
      <p>It is said that the Pope is again demanding Parma and Piacenza from the Farnese.</p>
      <p>If that were the case, it would not be resolved without war, which would delay their council. The Pope is said to be vehemently targeting the families of the Carafa and Farnese, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Frauenfeld, his beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Frauenfeld.</p>
