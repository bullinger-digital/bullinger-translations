      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt, most excellent Mr. Bullinger, that you have understood the current state of affairs in these places from my recent letters, which I wrote to you perhaps 14 days ago. Now, although I have nothing new to report to you, I did not want this messenger to come to you without my letters, and I earnestly request that you reply to me with this messenger, and if anything new has been published, please include it with your letter. I previously requested that you briefly share your opinion on the doctrine of our new guest in Prussia, namely Osiander, because I do not doubt that you have already read most of his writings. I now make the same request and also urge you to ensure that your letter written to the Hungarians, which you sent to me a long time ago, is printed; for all who have seen and read it desire nothing more than for it to be published and to be common and very familiar to everyone, especially in this turbulent and dangerous time. If I achieve this, you will render me so indebted to you that you will have no one more devoted and more eager to gratify you with any services within my ability. Please convey my respectful greetings to Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, and Mr. Lelio Sozzini, whose response I have eagerly awaited throughout this year. But since I have received nothing, I am compelled to doubt whether my letters were even welcome to them. Nevertheless, I still love and honor them sincerely and willingly offer them my humble services.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with all your family, most excellent man, love me and write back.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erhard von Kunheim.</p>
      <p>I earnestly request that you respond with this messenger, even if you have not written, otherwise I will not believe the messenger unless he brings letters. If it is not too much trouble, I would sincerely wish that others would also write.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning, virtue, and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
