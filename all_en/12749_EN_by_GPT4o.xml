<letter xml:id="file12749"><summary><p xml:id="regest1">[1] Only [Francisco] de Enzinas learned of Bullinger's communication in his letter of November 27 [No. 2695]. The day after receiving this letter, [Rudolf Bitzinger], the Zurich messenger, brought a letter [from Zurich] addressed to several [places] with similar content. The [Basel] authorities kept the matter strictly confidential, as Myconius' informants could not hear anything of the sort among the citizens.</p><p xml:id="regest2">[2] Recently, a good man [...] from Brugg (in Aargau) reported a conversation at the Königsfelden Monastery with Hartmann von Hallwyl, who had just returned from the [Schmalkaldic] camp: [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse had told him upon departure that despite the lack of money, he would rather rot in the camp than withdraw. Regarding [Elector Johann Frederick of] Saxony, Hallwyl said that he was of an almost contagious cheerfulness, so that many believed that the situation in Saxony was by no means [as bad] as portrayed! [Johannes] Gast joined in and confirmed that the earlier [bad] reports about Saxony were not true. He had learned yesterday from a messenger from Stuttgart [...], who had been in Saxony a few weeks ago, that although he had heard of an attack by the Bohemians there, he had not seen a single enemy.</p><p xml:id="regest3">[3] The letter from Zurich further reports that [King Francis I] of France had allied himself with [King Henry VIII] of England. May Bullinger's communication about the alliance [of the Schmalkaldic League with Francis I] be true! Why he wishes this, Myconius will discuss later, if Bullinger desires. The rumor that Francis I is recruiting soldiers around Mainz is not confirmed.</p><p xml:id="regest4">[4] [Matthias Claudius], the servant of the wealthy Augsburg resident [Hieronymus Sailer], who once lived longer than Enzinas in Spain, wrote on November 29 from St. Gallen on behalf of his master to Enzinas that the Landgrave intended to winter with his army in Württemberg. In the attempt to prevent this, 2000 of a total of 6000 imperial cavalrymen had fallen. Emperor [Charles V] had, however, escaped to Lauingen with eight horses. Yesterday, a soldier [...] from the [Schmalkaldic] camp told something similar: [Sebastian] Schertlin had, through brave resistance during an imperial raid, struck down their forces. Strange that the Zurichers report nothing about it!</p><p xml:id="regest5">[5] Yesterday, a Habsburg nobleman [...] also reported that there had been fireworks and celebratory gunfire in the Emperor's camp when it was learned that [Duke] Maurice had killed 24,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry in [Electoral] Saxony. Believe it who will!</p><p xml:id="regest6">[6] Myconius has learned from a councilor [...] that Jodocus [Kilchmeyer] is attempting something dreadful in Bern. If Bullinger knew about it, it is strange that he does nothing against it. There are much better means for peace!</p><p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings, also to the colleagues.</p></summary><body><div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1"><p>S. What you wrote on November 27, I revealed to no one except Francisco de Enzinas. The day after receiving it, Rudolf Bitzinger, the Zurich messenger, came and brought a letter with similar content, but addressed to several places. The Basel authorities kept the matter strictly confidential, as I had prepared my ears to listen if anything of this sort could be heard from the citizens.</p></div><div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2"><p>Soon a good man from Brugg (in Aargau) came, who had dined with Hartmann von Hallwyl at the Königsfelden Monastery. He told me what he had heard from him, coming directly from the camp. Among these was not the least that [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse had said he would rather rot in the camp than leave, despite being greatly pressed by lack of money. Regarding [Elector Johann Frederick of] Saxony: He was so cheerful that anyone who looked at him was compelled to be cheerful as well. Hence, many said among themselves: "Perhaps the situation in Saxony is different than the rumors suggest." Meanwhile, as we were talking, Johannes Gast approached and, when he heard what was said, he remarked: "For this reason, I came to tell you that the reports about Saxony are lies. For yesterday, a messenger from Stuttgart was here, who had come from Saxony a few weeks ago. He certainly reported that he had heard some rumor about the Bohemians being in arms, but no enemy was seen in the Elector's domain, not even one." This is what Gast told us.</p></div><div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3"><p>In the letters from your lords, the Englishman was joined with the Frenchman. Would that what you wrote about the alliance were not in vain. I will later explain the reasons for this wish of mine, when there is leisure and you so desire. There is a rumor, and nothing but a rumor, that soldiers are being secretly recruited for the Frenchman around Mainz.</p></div><div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4"><p>From St. Gallen, the servant of a very wealthy citizen of Augsburg, who once lived longer in Spain than Francisco de Enzinas himself, writes to him on November 29 in this manner: "We have heard that the Landgrave intended to go with his men to Württemberg to winter there. The Emperor attempted to prevent this with six thousand cavalry, and from this arose a battle in which two thousand of the Emperor's cavalry were killed, and the Emperor fled to Lauingen with only eight horses." And he adds: "This is certain." Yesterday, a soldier came from the camp, who recounted the same thing with a few changes: Schertlin, I don't know where, was attacked by the Emperor as if by surprise, but he, being prompt through the Lord, bravely resisted and struck down a great force of the Emperor's men. It's strange that you report nothing about this.</p></div><div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5"><p>This is indeed horrendous: A certain Habsburg nobleman was here yesterday, who claimed to have come shortly before from the Emperor's camp and to have seen fires throughout the camp and heard the thunder of cannons, signs of great joy; for the most certain news had arrived that Maurice had killed 24,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry in Saxony. He asserted this as if it were true. Let him believe it who will.</p></div><div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6"><p>Jodocus is said to be attempting something dreadful in Bern beyond necessity. It's strange that if you know the man, you do not restrain him. Peace could have been achieved by a far different and indeed better way. A certain member of the council told me about this, otherwise completely unknown.</p></div><div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7"><p>May the Lord be with us all. Farewell in Christ with all the pious brothers. Basel, December 4, 1546. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p><p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, the best minister of Christ, his venerable lord in Christ. Zurich.</p></div></body> Note: Proper nouns have been translated into their modern German equivalents where applicable.</letter>
