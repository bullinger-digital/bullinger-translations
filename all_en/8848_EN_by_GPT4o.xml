      <p>Greetings. This young man is the son of an honorable senator among us, namely Jakob Albin, and the nephew of Samuel Telamon through his sister; he has learned the art of baking; for his father, although very wealthy, teaches all his sons, of whom he has quite a few, to engage in manual labor. He has decided to stay and work in Zürich for some time and later, if he can find an opportunity, to visit Venice.</p>
      <p>Therefore, his parents and especially Telamon have asked me to recommend him to you with a single word, not to provide him with anything, except this one thing, to assist him with advice, if he can find a good and honest master who will take him in. He is otherwise well provided with money. They also seek, above all, that he may have your acquaintance and be able to remember you throughout his life. I could not refuse them this, as I dare nothing with you. I have nothing new to write, except that the people of Geneva, for our sake, have negotiated with the neighboring cities, first Freiburg, then Solothurn; for the king's envoy urges that they at least be received into the alliance by these cities, and the people of Solothurn have already been brought to this opinion;</p>
      <p>the people of Freiburg have so far hesitated, especially because of religion. What has finally been concluded in Solothurn, I do not yet know; meanwhile, I understand from private sources that the people of Freiburg want, if a garrison is ever to be stationed there, that they too be granted freedom of their religion, that is, that they may celebrate mass there. This is difficult for the people of Geneva, and I think that question will also have to be discussed among theologians. I therefore ask you to share with me what you think about this.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, the penultimate day of March 1572.</p>
      <p>The lords, friends, and all the brothers greet you, especially Telamon.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours, as you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
