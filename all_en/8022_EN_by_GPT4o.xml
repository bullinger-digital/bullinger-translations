      <p>Yesterday, a letter arrived from Basel stating that the Duke of Alba was raging fiercely in the Netherlands and thereby sharpening everyone's beliefs on both sides. In Antwerp, he had several burned as Anabaptists. The Prince of Orange had a son in Leuven, where he was studying; he was taken prisoner, along with the two counts of Egmont and Horn, as well as the old mayor of Antwerp, and they were taken to Vilvoorde. He also captured with them the Count of Mansfeld, who was staying in Antwerp; however, he escaped from the servants, and it is thought that he will cause an uproar, etc. In Vilvoorde, he had 27 lords and nobles executed. If this is true, then the German princes now see well what the Augsburg Confession means to the Spaniards.</p>
      <p>The Count of Egmont years ago drew his dagger against the Cardinal of Arras. At that time, I said: "The priest will hold this against him in a little box until the opportunity arises," and now it has come to pass. Egmont, otherwise, is of great name and authority, was singularly esteemed by Charles and this Philip; he himself arranged the marriage between Philip and the deceased Queen of England, etc. But since Froschauer knows more and more certain things (if he has brought anything), I will add it. Greet Johann Caspar Felix, especially your wife and daughter, and if Agatha is with you, etc.</p>
      <p>Monday, the day of Michaelmas 1567.</p>
