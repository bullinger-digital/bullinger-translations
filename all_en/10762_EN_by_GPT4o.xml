      <p>Greetings. Megander recently delivered your letter to me, which he said Hans Hager brought, though I did not see him.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the council has decided to send an army to Geneva, as they are so pressed by the Savoyards that they must either perish or confront the enemy. However, I do not know the number of troops or the plans, and I am even less informed about this. I fear that we lack everything necessary to conduct the war effectively. Therefore, we must implore the Lord from the churches to grant everyone sincere hearts and to be the leader of the war himself.</p>
      <p>A meeting has been scheduled for us on the 30th of this month, but with the war looming, I do not know what will happen.</p>
      <p>If our messenger passes through your area again from the Grisons, you will burden him with your Thessalonians.</p>
      <p>If you send my letters to Vadian, please let me know.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>If my illness worsens by Easter as it has begun, I will either have to die or remain bedridden until death. Farewell.</p>
      <p>January 14, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold H.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
