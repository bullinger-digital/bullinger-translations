    <p xml:id="regest1">Still waiting for instructions, while the theologians are already beginning to depart; if it weren't for the Turkish threat, Emperor [Charles V] and the now-arrived [King] Ferdinand would probably proceed against [the Protestants], as Bullinger as well as [Diethelm] Röist and [Jakob] Werdmüller can gather from the [enclosed] German letter of Gwalther. Refrains from communicating the numerous rumors. Praises the opinions of the theologians, which will be presented to the [Protestant] estates tomorrow, but excludes the stance of [Bucer]; also [Johannes] Agricola, who spoke in favor of the Mass in a sermon and criticized [the Protestants], is a traitor in their own ranks. Greetings. [Enclosure:] Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] departed on June 14, which has raised hopes among the opponents. The behavior of the Emperor - such as the arrest of a pious man at court and participation in the Corpus Christi procession - shows that his compliance was only intended to deceive; he insists on the [Regensburg] book, which is rightly rejected by the theologians; Gwalther will present the documents in copy upon his return. God uses the Turk [Sultan Suleiman I] to halt the impending persecution; King [Ferdinand] arrived on June 21 and seeks help to defend his hereditary lands, as Turkish troops are already advancing over the Danube and the siege of Buda is threatening to fail. When the princes wanted to negotiate about it, a rank dispute broke out between Duke Heinrich of Brunswick and Margrave George of Brandenburg[-Ansbach]; Elector Joachim of Brandenburg threatened resistance, leading to a heated exchange of words. The Turk will probably not be vigorously opposed, as the Protestants insist on a prior religious peace; a merely superficial peace cannot endure. The Diet finds little favor among sensible people. As Gwalther was written from Prague, the castle along with the Lesser Town has mostly burned down; also in Pomerania, three towns were burned down, and in Brandenburg, arsonists were arrested who had set fire in Berlin. Prays to God for preservation and recommends himself to his lords.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>On the sixteenth of this month, I sent my last letter to you, most kind father, which I do not doubt you have already received. If only I could receive a response, so I could be more certain about what to decide regarding myself! Almost every day, some of the theologians are preparing to leave and depart from here, and I believe our own will soon follow them. For here, one can see more danger than hope; the Emperor has begun to look at our people with very unfavorable eyes, to which the court singer Ferdinand has now contributed, and undoubtedly we would feel the turmoil if the Turkish plague did not bring a remedy to this evil, which you will understand abundantly from the German letters. I earnestly request that you present these to the most prudent men, Röist and the treasurer Werdmüller, excusing me as well, because writing in haste did not allow me to arrange everything as it should have been, especially since this vernacular style of writing is most unusual for me.</p>
      <p>I have written only about the main matters being dealt with here, about which there is no doubt. For the uncertain and doubtful rumors that are spread here, not even ten writers could commit them to letters. I prefer to send you few and true things rather than many and uncertain ones.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, the judgments of our theologians will be presented to the estates of the empire, all certainly pious and learned except for one (whom you know, though he is anonymous), who will present a private opinion. Agricola, the preacher of the Elector of Brandenburg, also approved the Mass in a public sermon today and condemned our people as disobedient and stubborn. And this is certainly a matter to be greatly lamented, that such scoundrels and Judas traitors can be found among our own. But enough of this for now, more in person; for I do not think we will remain here long.</p>
      <p>Dr. Draconites and Pistorius send their greetings to you, who do not send a response because they want to use me as a messenger. I also wish well-being to your entire family, Dr. Pellican, Theodor, Collin, Ammianus, and your other colleagues, my most esteemed teachers. Farewell, dearest father.</p>
      <p>In haste, Regensburg, 8th day before the calends of July 1541. Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>Honorable, wise, kind, and gracious lord, after offering all due services and proper loyalty, know that on the fourteenth day of the month of June, my gracious lord, the Landgrave, departed here to Regensburg after obtaining gracious permission from the imperial majesty, for special, important reasons, namely, as he had seen all his great costs, toil, and labor in vain. And although he left his retinue here along with two preachers, the opponents have nevertheless gained not a little hope due to his absence, as they now believe they can advance their cause further, not having my gracious lord, who has so far opposed them, before their eyes anymore.</p>
      <p>It also now begins that the imperial majesty favors our people much less than before, from which one can well perceive with what mind he has shown himself so graciously until now, namely, that he could not win over our people with harsh words, now he tries to lead them astray with a false appearance of love and piety, which plan, seeing it entirely in vain and useless, he would gladly turn to violence and try it with evil, if he did not find himself too weak and insignificant for this matter. For it is well apparent from the appearance that he bears no good heart towards our religion, as he has secretly had a good, pious man from his court imprisoned, solely because he said there is no other mediator than Jesus Christ, who has done enough for our sins. Indeed, it is also entirely said that he will have him secretly thrown into the Danube at night. I now remain silent that on the holy feast of Corpus Christi, he personally, along with other princes, carried a candle before the sacrament, with many other papist and idolatrous practices, all of which clearly and explicitly indicate that the papist religion is so deeply rooted in him that he recognizes it entirely as just and pleasing to God, indeed that he has arranged this conversation with the intention that he thinks he wants to bring Germany back to the previous state with his power and influence, not that he wants to learn something better and more pleasing to God. And thus, all hope that one had of a reconciliation of faith is now dead and gone, for it is now entirely and completely the will of the imperial majesty that one should remain and persist with the Regensburg book, which is written from human reason and opinion and presented by the imperial majesty to the estates of the empire, which no one who understands the scriptures and loves God can accept or approve, for it is nothing but a patched beggar's cloak made of human plans and writings, which are not introduced in the right places. For those who have set up this book, who are not rightly built in true faith and not kindled in God's love, think it is the same in matters of faith as if one were quarreling over an inheritance, where one lets both sides go until one finally comes together. For this reason, the learned entirely reject this book and reconciliation and will hand over their writings and opinions to the estates of the empire tomorrow, of which I will also inform your wisdom upon my return. Therefore, it is now well to be concerned that one should only seek to find true, right peace with God through the improvement of our lives, for human plans will have no success in this matter.</p>
      <p>And it is also well to be concerned that if the Turk does not bring us more peace than our disputing and meeting, one would soon see a cruel persecution of the Christian faith. But God Almighty also knows how to use the wicked and godless for the advancement of his faith and the benefit of the church. For on the twenty-first day of this month, the royal majesty arrived in Regensburg early in the morning, alone with 20 horses, and seeks help from the Roman Empire so that he can preserve Hungary along with his other hereditary lands from the bloodthirsty enemy of the Christian faith. For it is now certain that two Turkish pashas with eighty thousand men have arrived 24 miles below Buda and are building a bridge over the Danube so that the large army, which is still behind, can come over. It is also said that the soldiers are withdrawing from Buda day by day out of fear of those who have already arrived, as they have now lost several assaults and suffered great damage.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, your wisdom should know that on the 22nd day of the aforementioned month, the princes rode to council regarding the Turkish matter, among whom a great dispute arose. For according to the order of the empire, the electors have a separate council, likewise the other princes have a separate one, and the cities also have their own, Duke Heinrich of Brunswick sat directly above Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria and wanted to drive Margrave George of Brandenburg from his rightful and orderly seat, upon which the aforementioned Margrave, along with Duke Heinrich of Meissen and my gracious lord's retinue, stood up and complained greatly, also intending to leave and not come to council anymore. However, this was finally reported to Margrave Joachim of Brandenburg, the elector, who did not want to let this disgrace to the house of Brandenburg go unchallenged, but complained about the aforementioned Hans Wurst before the estates, saying that with such evil, wanton insolence, he not only shames the house of Brandenburg but also hinders and destroys this praiseworthy and necessary council concerning the Turk; he also desires to bring this before the imperial majesty, indeed if necessary, he wants to avenge this disgrace with righteous resistance. Upon which Duke Heinrich of Brunswick said he was quite satisfied that this should be brought before the imperial majesty, and he would gladly take the resistance in hand. To which the elector replied: "See that you use the resistance openly and not in a murderous way against me." Margrave George also said: "Although I am old, just give me a sign with a glove if you have a heart in your body, for I will certainly not flee from you, as you have shamefully fled from many a good man." Thus the devil always sows his seed so that one cannot come to a proper agreement and unity. It is also to be feared that little resistance will be made against the Turk, for everyone believes that the Christian princes and protesting estates will not engage in any action in this matter unless religion is first settled in peace and quiet, which will not happen if one handles the matter no differently than before. For although the imperial majesty cries and urges much out of pressing necessity, it does not help much with those who have not only been deceived once before. And although some think and the imperial majesty has been advised by many that one should see how one can make a common external peace in Germany, your wisdom knows well what stability such a building will have, which is set on such a rotten, unstable foundation. For even if such a treaty is established, the dispute and discord of faith remain unresolved. For how can we stand well in external matters when we stand badly with God, who governs and handles such external things with his power and wisdom?</p>
      <p>Further, I have nothing to write about the Diet, except that few sensible people are pleased with it.</p>
      <p>As for what happened in Prague in Bohemia, your wisdom has probably long understood, namely that the castle was burned to the ground along with the Lesser Town entirely, so that nothing more than a quarter remains, as one from Prague wrote to me today, who has been at my gracious lord's court for a while. Also, three towns have now been burned down in the absence of the Duke of Pomerania. And in the Brandenburg principality, four arsonists have been captured, who have been imprisoned in Berlin, the capital of the Elector of Brandenburg.</p>
      <p>In summary, wherever one looks and comes, one can learn nothing good. May God Almighty preserve us with his grace, that we may be found true and right in his judgment and court. I also ask your wisdom to kindly accept my writing, done in haste, and always keep me in your favor.</p>
      <p>Given in Regensburg, on the day of John the Baptist in the year 1541. Your wisdom's always obedient</p>
      <p>Rudolf Walthart.</p>
