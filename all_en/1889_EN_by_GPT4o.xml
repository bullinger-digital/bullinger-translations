      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Since I have to stay in Tübingen longer than I expected and wanted, I wanted to write to you about the state of our affairs, so you wouldn't think anything adverse had happened to us. We arrived in Tübingen on the fifth day after we left you, and the next day, which was a Saturday, we went to Stuttgart. We had to stay there until the fifth day. The prince received us kindly, and Mr. Vergerius spoke with him twice without an interpreter; for he speaks the Latin language well and fluently.</p>
      <p>The prince asked Mr. Vergerius to translate the confession presented by his legates to the Council of Trent into Italian. So now we are staying in Tübingen until it is printed.</p>
      <p>We are staying with the most courteous and learned man, Mr. Melchior Volmar. Count Georg left Stuttgart for Richenwil before our arrival; however, I sent your letters to him through the prince's messengers. Mr. Vergerius spoke with the prince about Mr. Molinée; he invites him to Tübingen and offers him an honorable position to teach law, or if he does not want that, he leaves it open for him to live in Montbéliard.</p>
      <p>Molinée himself also wrote to the prince, and the prince showed these letters to Mr. Vergerius to read. I gave your letters to Brenz. Mr. Vergerius also spoke with him about many controversial articles; however, Brenz seemed to me to be dissembling in many things. He promised to come to Tübingen to see us; whether he will actually do so, I do not know; if he comes, we will discuss more. This is what I had to write to you briefly; I will explain everything more fully in person. May the Lord keep you all safe. Tübingen, June 4.</p>
      <p>Your always sincerely devoted son, Josias Simler.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord and father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
