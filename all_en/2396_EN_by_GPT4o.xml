      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord. When I was with our dear Calvin and this messenger presented himself very opportunely, I entrusted two copies of our booklet along with this letter, from which you will understand, I hope, how great the impudence of our adversaries is and with what diligence they must be countered. However small our effort here is, I hope it will not be ungrateful to you, and I earnestly ask you to send me separately, in a few notes, whatever you find worthy of observation in it (if you have the leisure), so that your effort, which you will take in reading it, may at least be of use to me. But enough of this. I received your letter dated July 10th the day before yesterday, in which you commend to me a certain young man from Aarau. I, my father, will gladly and eagerly assist his studies and piety with whatever resources I can, because he was commended by you, and I ask you to persuade yourself that nothing could be more pleasant to me than if I have an opportunity to declare my gratitude to you. I have nothing new from France at the moment; for you have long heard how miserably our French tyrant has raged against the people of Artois and Flanders. Now I do not doubt that the Emperor is entirely focused on avenging these injuries. However, this winter, if it is true what they say, the king intends to exercise the same or even greater cruelties against the church. If you hear anything about those Saxon and Augsburg diets that concerns us, I ask you to write to us and to sharpen and inflame our zeal for prayer with your frequent letters. Farewell, my father. May the Lord Jesus continue to protect and strengthen you, bless you, and preserve you for His church. I ask you to diligently greet D. Gwalther and the entire church in my name. Geneva, September 18.</p>
      <p>Th[eodor] Beza, your most devoted son in the Lord. I wish the people of Basel would be seriously admonished to cleanse this cesspool in time.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered father and the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
