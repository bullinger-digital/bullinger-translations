      <p>Greetings. Due to the rainy season, during which the lands of our region were horrifically torn apart with the flooding of fields and estates, there was no one (as far as I know) who could deliver letters to you. But now, since there is hope that some will travel, I will write in time about the matters that have transpired here in recent days.</p>
      <p>A meeting was called in the name and at the expense of the French. But at the very hour when I reported the last writings from you to the honorable consul, the interpreter of the envoy was at the door with Captain Dietegen, who advised the consul to cancel and renounce the meeting.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, they, with soldiers whom they had recruited from everywhere and of all kinds, prepared to depart, and since there was no place to enlist in Chur, they moved to Bad Ragaz. Nevertheless, the leading figures of the Rhaetians gathered here to deliberate on what should be done, having neglected their own authority and mandate. It was decreed that the three primary leaders of all Rhaetia should go to the envoy's castle and, dealing with him most seriously, should be the ones to recall the dismissed soldiers; indeed, today they departed for Bad Ragaz to recall the disobedient and constrain them to duty, whether they like it or not. We shall see if they will comply.</p>
      <p>These matters could have been handled earlier, had our people not been reproached for carrying out everything sluggishly. The rumor here is that the king himself, along with the queen, is now guarded by the Count of Cond√©.</p>
      <p>The envoy stubbornly continues to defend religion in no way, but only attacks some rebels, and yet he wants to appear evangelical. But I know that envoys must be ambidextrous.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus graciously rescue His church from the jaws of the most monstrous beasts and preserve it perpetually according to His promises. Amen. Friedrich von Salis sent these to you through his brother. May they be safely delivered to you. November 2, 1567.</p>
      <p>At this very hour, Consul Willi came to me, indicating that he had only reached the envoy, while the other three proceeded to Bad Ragaz, but the enlisted soldiers had already departed. Meanwhile, a notary arrived, who brought letters to the envoy from Solothurn in France. They say this notary is familiar to the envoy; for he often comes and goes. Everyone asks me if I have any news; all are anxious about what is happening, what has occurred, and what is being done. The consul says they will convene at the feast of Saint Martin and report to the communities about punishing the disobedient, against whom the laws and authority of the magistrates have been of no avail. I ask you, if there is anything, to write to us, but without causing you any trouble.</p>
