      <p>S. D. I see, my brother, that everything is full of evils and therefore we must pray more fervently to the Lord, that He may remove us and protect us from evil.</p>
      <p>The people of Milan seem to be seeking some occasion for war; therefore, I judge that we must act prudently, not hastily.</p>
      <p>War is indeed easily begun, but it is not ended and laid down with equal ease. They indeed seem to have given a just occasion for war; but you must consider again and again whether any occasion should be used for your right. Many more frequently and rightly yield their right than pursue it, and that monstrous birth presages and portends nothing good.</p>
      <p>May the Lord deliver us from evil and not repay us according to our merits! I do not understand whom you say Ascanio was shot by a gun by Sciero at Mesaucos; I do not know who Ascanio is or who Sciero is or what the cause of the murder is. Therefore, narrate these things more clearly.</p>
      <p>What I recently wrote about the battle engaged at Groningen is more and more confirmed, so that it is believed without doubt.</p>
      <p>The lieutenant and a great man, the Count of Arburg, as if the hand of Alba, fell. Ten Spanish banners were destroyed to extermination. The captured Germans were released; the Spaniards were all hanged and killed. Nine more illustrious Spaniards were hanged on one tree. And other wonders of this kind are written, moreover, this: Alba was so exasperated by that disaster that he beheaded all his captives, whom you have heard were detained for a long time, to a man, including Count Egmond, Count Horn, likewise barons, knights of the golden spur, and about 50 nobles. If this is true, this monstrous and unworthy cruelty will arm both the Germans and many princes of the Germans against that robber, whom all good and bad people otherwise hate; for many of those decapitated magnates were adherents of the papist religion; others were relatives and kin of princes. But that beast spares no one. From France, we have not yet heard better and more merciful things; yet we do not despair and we expect more joyful things, beseeching the Lord, that He may save us and make us glad. In this, farewell, dear brother. Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet for me the honorable consuls and Mr. Karl, Pontisella, Ganthner, and all our people.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 25, 1568.</p>
      <p>Please, ensure that these enclosed letters are properly taken care of. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Your senior Bullinger. (on the back:) Greet for me, I pray, Mr. Friedrich and Hercules Saliceos; I could not write to them now.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful pastor of the Church of Chur, my esteemed lord and most beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
