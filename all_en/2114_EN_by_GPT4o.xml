      <p>All is well. I gladly saw the messenger and paid what you ordered, although here I usually give half as much. But listen to a strange thing: the matters about which the Bishop of Bayonne wrote to me were certainly not worthy, to speak frankly with you, for which a special messenger should be sent; it was more worthy for something else that was contained in those letters, which you write were given to you by Ziegler.</p>
      <p>Therefore, God moved that orator to write about sending a special messenger, so that meanwhile other more weighty letters might be brought to me; for, as you should know, Laelius writes to me about the marriage of my niece, which I needed to know quickly. Praise the Lord, who favors the pious in all ways. I am sending a response both to the Bishop of Bayonne and to Laelius; you ensure that it is delivered quickly and faithfully. Laelius is well, and you will see him soon; this should also be announced to Ziegler. The news you wrote was most dear. I responded to the previous letters and sent them to Schaffhausen. I hope this messenger will bring them to you; for I ordered him to inquire at Ruggers. I was recently in Stuttgart (for gout gives me a truce); I offered your commendation to the Duke and read what you think about Martyr. I affirm that he listened gladly, and he does not abhor you (believe me), nor does Brenz, who greets you lovingly. But I noticed envy and hatred in some others, even in those whom you would never have believed; I will reveal it sometime, for it is worth knowing. Indeed, someone from Basel writing here inserts hatred. I am forced to indicate this now; Sulcerus wrote that you added certain things in agreement with Calvin's opinion. But I had that agreement printed in Geneva and produced it and refuted the lie. But all is with you. I could not know whether that Beatus, about whom you write, is alive or not; but I will inquire and you will know.</p>
      <p>After tomorrow, I am going to Augsburg and will return within 15 or 20 days. Good and holy causes draw me there in the middle of winter, still almost sick. The papists (of whom there are many here; see what I say) will hardly be able to bear me for long; thus I press on by God's grace. This booklet, which I now send to you, has greatly moved many from that flock, but it moves more that I daily spur the ministers. One notable papist, four days ago, while professing in the Decretals, struck by God, almost expired on the very seat, certainly survived little. He was Caspar Voland. Molinaeus has begun to profess with a great number of listeners; there is reason to rejoice that such a man has been inserted into this school by the work of two of us. I send his letters to you. Martyr has not yet responded whether he wishes to winter with me; for I invited him, as I already wrote to you; good God, how joyfully I will receive such a guest.</p>
      <p>I beg you not to send (if he must be sent again) such an illustrious messenger; I fear envy, I am Italian, I am among many papists, among evangelicals who disagree with me; the prince openly favors: all these things accumulate hatred. But do not address it to the councilor, let me be in reality, as I am; let us flee envy as much as we can.</p>
      <p>Of the 12 booklets I send, send 6 to Bassafontaneus; distribute the rest there at your discretion; do not hesitate to read them yourself, for you will also find yourself counted among the chief heretics; indeed, I added two, so that you have eight. The diet will not be held at least until Easter (as I wrote). But the Emperor wrote to Count Hugo of Montfort, who was his legate at the council, to prepare himself for that legation again. Margrave Albert is outlawed; but he still sustains himself. They say now that he offers his service to the French, indeed they report that Augustus has gone to France; I do not have certainty. When I return from Augsburg, I hope to be full of new things and I know I will have a way from there to write to you, which I will gladly do.</p>
      <p>The main business for which that friend wished a messenger to be sent was this: namely, that one, with whom you and I spoke, you know whom I mean, gave to him, who now writes to you, 50 crowns; but it is with you. It is amazing from where the Lord and from what dregs he sustains his own. What miracles will there be if these are not? I recognize as a miracle what the heavenly Father indicates to me, so that I certainly know him to be most truthful.</p>
      <p>I say with tears and to you alone here that piety is growing cold; believe me, it is so. They appear rarely; let us pray to God to send workers into his harvest. Nicolaus Gallus and Matthias Illyricus complained in letters with the ministers of this duchy that they favored Osiander in the cause of justification, and hence you will hear a tragedy arising. Melanchthon published a booklet against Stancarus; I would wish for peace among such. I expect your booklets on justification; would that you also touch on Osiander's novelty. I also expect Catullus and what you wrote against him. But now farewell and be well; for the eleventh hour of the night is approaching and I am completely exhausted. Pray for me, Heinrich Bullinger, with the whole family, school, and church. May God keep you safe for them. In TÃ¼bingen, December 19, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius, ever yours.</p>
      <p>I rose before day to complete the bundle of letters. I asked the messenger to make his way through Tuttlingen; for perhaps there and not in Schaffhausen he will find the letters, which he recently wrote to you. I promised two batzen for drinks, if he brings them to you, if from Tuttlingen, I say; if you give them, I will repay.</p>
      <p>To you, Bullinger.</p>
