      <p>Greetings. If there are two things, Bullinger, that distinguish and divide people, they are error and depravity - error separates friends and good people, depravity separates the wicked and bad -, I do not fear that we will be perpetually divided, as the goodness of Christ has freed us from depravity. It remains, I think, for us, who are still separated by error like a cloud while striving towards the same Christ, to recognize each other more diligently. We can do this; the depraved cannot. So come, my dear Bullinger, see if there is any truth in these arguments by which our Bucer tries to dispel and remove such a grave suspicion from himself and to approve himself to you brothers. Since charity does not allow me to suspect either of you wrongly, but compels me to think well of both, I believe neither that you are trying to impose something false on him nor that he is trying to deceive you, but if there is anything, I believe it is a cloud of error that will soon be dispelled by the rays of the sun. Certainly, the natural warmth and the bond of the same body's harmony will bring back the members of the body of Christ Jesus into mutual embrace.</p>
      <p>Farewell then, well with all the brothers in the Lord, whom you will greet for me by name.</p>
      <p>Your Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
