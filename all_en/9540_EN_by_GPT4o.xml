      <p>S. May the Lord Jesus make this year happy and prosperous for you and all yours. I have received all your letters so far, including the last ones from the courier Johannes Itel.</p>
      <p>Mr. Haller also communicated what you provided about the proceedings of the Chur court. I thank you for everything. From France, I am waiting to see how the peaceful action of the lords of Damville and Montmorency with the Occitans and Aquitanians will turn out, and also what has been done at the royal assemblies either at Orléans or Compiègne. May they seek peace and not rekindle the war to their own certain ruin!</p>
      <p>The Pole (King of Poland) left the kingdom with great sorrow for the Guises and the clergy. On December 11, he entered Heidelberg, accompanied by Christoph of the Palatinate and Ludwig of Nassau. The Elector Palatine neither invited him to his table nor visited him.</p>
      <p>The next day, he called him to a meeting in the presence of the Polish envoys. The king sought advice on how peace could be restored and the indignation of the Germans, conceived due to the Parisian tumult, could be abolished, etc. The prince replied: 'By a free confession of the crime'; it is in vain to seek empty excuses for the murder of the admiral and his faithful followers. Then, if the king's brother refrains from persecution, does not listen to the pope, but grants firm peace to the faithful throughout France; if he does not do this, the kingdom of France will be torn apart. Finally, he urged (with much approval from the Polish envoys) to cultivate peace in Poland and, as he confirmed to the Polish envoys with an oath: that he does not wish to hate or persecute any evangelical in Poland, he should faithfully fulfill. And since he must swear this to the crown of Poland, his brother in France should not be ashamed to do this willingly, etc. The next day, they parted with good grace on both sides to Worms, Mainz, Frankfurt, etc. What will happen next, time will tell. Accompanying him are Duke of Nevers, Marquis of Beauvais, Guise, Count of Rethel, Count of Maine, and the rest of the band of criminals, etc. Let him go, let him go never to return, unless he turns to the Lord and performs the duty of a good prince, etc. - I write this amidst the turmoil of business and with my strength afflicted by the troubles of business. As I warned you in my last letters, I fear that Ganthner may still cause you harm before he is seriously removed.</p>
      <p>The devil does not break the barrel without a reason. May wise men understand!</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 8, 1574.</p>
      <p>Greet the honorable consuls and all friends in order. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church of Chur, my honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
