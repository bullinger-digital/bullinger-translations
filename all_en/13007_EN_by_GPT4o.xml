    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] It is not Bullinger's fault that Haller was not recalled! He made great efforts in this regard, but without success.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] On June 27, Emperor Charles V wrote from Saalfeld to the Confederates regarding the planned Imperial Diet. At the time of writing his letter, the Diet was scheduled for September 20 in Ulm (since then it has been moved to Augsburg due to the plague raging in Ulm). In the letter, the Emperor made many fine promises. However, since Basel and Mulhouse were also summoned to the Diet in the meantime, the Confederates [in their response of July 9] asked not to summon their allies to foreign meetings, but to let them maintain their customs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger is aware of the danger in which Haller finds himself. However, he need not despair. As long as the preaching of the Gospel is still allowed in Augsburg, he should proclaim the truth! Undoubtedly, it is thanks to God's providence that he is allowed to bear witness for Christ before the Emperor and all of Germany in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] He should remember the words of the Lord, especially the Bible passages about Paul at the end of the Acts of the Apostles. The Lord does not abandon those who sincerely seek Him. Haller should be steadfast, faithful, and cautious. What he reports about the events in Augsburg is very reminiscent of the time when Paul was brought to Rome as a prisoner and his disciples proclaimed the Gospel there. Haller should not be discouraged! Whatever he does for the people of Zurich and for God's Church serves for edification. How many people did the Lord edify by preaching to the Jews! And the prophet Ezekiel was told: Whether they obey or not, proclaim to them my ways!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Not everything is going right in the Confederation either! Nevertheless, the truth must be proclaimed. Haller should ask God for assistance. If there is a danger to life or no longer any possibility to proclaim the truth, he may flee following the example of the Lord and the Apostles. But only in unavoidable danger! Otherwise, he would bring shame upon his own and prove himself ungrateful! He should therefore conduct himself wisely.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] On August 14, Zurich is organizing a shooting festival to which all Confederates are invited. The excitement over Rudolf Gwalther's "Antichrist" seems to be subsiding. But even if the Confederates stood together, there will always be people who express their dissent with the [Protestant places]. At the Diet in Baden, there was more agreement than there had been for 20 years.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is not my fault that you were not recalled. Indeed, I have been anxious to the best of my ability to have you recalled, but I could achieve nothing.</p>

      <p>Regarding the Imperial Diet, Emperor Charles V himself wrote to the Swiss Confederates from Saalfeld on June 27, but he thought he would hold it in Ulm on September 20. However, due to the plague raging there, he has now moved it to Augsburg. He promises all good things to the Swiss. Meanwhile, since he also summoned the people of Basel and Mulhouse to the Diet, the Swiss Confederates request that none of their allies be summoned to those foreign meetings, but that we may enjoy our own customs.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I know you are now in extreme danger, but I do not want you to despair or fear. If there is freedom and a place to freely preach the Gospel, confess the truth! I am fully convinced that it is by divine ordination and benevolence that you have been brought to Augsburg to bear witness to Christ there before the Emperor and all of Germany.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Remember the words of the Lord! Remember what the Acts of the Apostles recount about Paul, especially in the last chapters! If you act sincerely and seek God and the truth from the heart, the Lord will not abandon you. Just be steadfast, faithful, and prudent. The same things that you say are happening in Augsburg were happening in Rome when Paul was brought there as a prisoner and when the disciples of the Lord preached the Gospel there. Therefore, do not be discouraged! We are doing so much for ourselves and the Church, we are building so much! How much did the Lord himself edify by preaching to the Jews? Ezekiel heard: Whether they listen or not, you must announce my ways to them!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Even at home, things are happening that are not right, yet the truth must be preached. Pray to the Lord that He may never abandon you. However, if life is in danger and there is no place for the truth, you know that the Lord and the Apostles sought safety in flight. Yet, I do not want you to resort to that unless compelled by the greatest and unavoidable reasons, so that you do not disgrace yourself among foreigners and bring shame upon yourself at home, and prove ungrateful to all! Therefore, I require prudence in all things and through everything.</p>

      <p>On August 14, there will be a shooting festival in Zurich. All Confederates are invited. The excitement over the booklet about the Antichrist seems to be subsiding. It is thought that even if we are united, we will still find people who disagree with us. At the Diet in Baden, the Confederates were more united than they had been in 20 years!</p>
