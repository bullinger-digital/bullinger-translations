      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. Although I do not write to you, most learned Bullinger, a man who has greatly deserved well of both me and our little church, as often as I might, because I do not wish to occupy you with my trifles, yet when Johannes Ulstetter, the overseer of our republic's seminary and school, the son-in-law of the elder Paul Fagius, was about to go to Zürich, I wanted to write so that he might have the opportunity to visit you. He will report how much we have endured here in recent days as quiet spectators amidst the envy of many, among the clamor of arms and the warriors sounding the trumpet. For it is incredible to say with what great slanders they have attacked us, not to mention the Son of God and His most holy word; but God will see. Now, however, with the French army having crossed to Luxembourg, our neighbors, somewhat calmed and more tranquil, restrain their lips. Hedio writes that last week the fortress of Rodenbach, not far from Luxembourg, which is under the dominion of the Margraves of Baden, the younger Philibert and Christoph, was forcibly occupied by the French and from there they plundered a huge treasure, about three hundred thousand guilders, excluding silver cups and jewels; for the whole region had placed all their wealth there as if in some asylum, etc. After plundering everything, they completely destroyed the fortress, sacrificing it to Vulcan, etc. Certainly, the judgments of God are inscrutable. Pray for us, that in these storms the church of Christ may stand safe and that, with this horrible tempest finally calmed, we may amend our lives for the better and believe in the Son of God. Amen. Greet your household along with the brothers.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, June 6, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your old Erb.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, renowned for piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his brother.</p>
