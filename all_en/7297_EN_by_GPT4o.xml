      <p>S. Although I am well aware, most honorable man, that you are variously distracted in six hundred places and that not an hour passes without you dedicating yourself most diligently to others who come to you, I cannot refrain from impudently burdening you with my nonsense at this time. On November 5th, I received your letters through Mr. Karl along with a note that contained the state of miserable France. It cannot be expressed how much this has dampened our expectations and desires. The entire council did not know what to believe, indeed, since the adversaries spread everything to terrify our people, they almost despaired of our cause; but from your latest letters, they were somewhat refreshed. If only more auspicious and joyful news would be announced sometime. Mr. Willius, Mr. Karl, and all the others are particularly grateful to you for your dedication and singular love towards us.</p>
      <p>[...] However, the cardinal has summoned all his priests to Rome and held a conversation with them, admonishing them to be brave. He also opened a papal decree to them, stating that they should dismiss their concubines so that they may deceive the peasants, etc.; furthermore, it has been arranged that all cardinals should contribute half of their benefices to the war.</p>
      <p>[...] Our Mercury distorts everything we would like to hear and presents it in his own way. Yes, he has spread his news in Davos to such an extent that I believe they would have agreed to withdraw if they had not been informed of the opposition through my and others' letters."</p>
      <p>[...] If he knew that it did not concern religion, he would not be so old, he would still bet on it; but otherwise not at all. If everyone were of the same mind as he is! Truly, he proves it with words and deeds, that he is highly displeased with our leniency, as they do not better maintain the captains; but it is neglected. - Young Remigius von Schauenstein is also gone, he is a captain, recalled; he is bound, he may withdraw or not: they will truly send him the woman and seize his property. There he has given up his citizenship and departed. What the cause is, you will understand from the letter I send you, that the leaders have given many crowns from their own, thereby binding themselves to the devil. Young Balthasar has already sent this answer. I have done it before and received it from the one who always copies and makes the copies. He denies that religion is included in the new union, and yet it states right at the beginning, it should last as long as it pleases God and serves His honor. So they would not have gone there if the infancy of the nascent Gallic church had not moved them greatly, and if at that time only the preachers had remained silent, Mr. Bellievre could not have achieved anything. But I still know very well how we had to reveal the dealings and cunning plans of the Spaniard to the common man, who wanted to go idle everywhere. Now they do not see it that way, and the legate threatens, he wants to accuse the preachers before the council and communities as agitators who wrote against this move. He also keeps watch day and night because some communities threaten him. In this, we are truly as guilty as the poor sheep standing below at the brook, etc. - Dr. Consul Tscharner has taken office; they want to let him die in it, as death is not far from him. Dr. Pontisella remained a senator, which is most pleasing to me. Last Sunday, a gift was presented to Dr. Consul, where 600 men were seated. The bishop also came with all the priests. He is very friendly with us and has invited us to him. He has also promised my wife the midwife's help, etc. - Today, a runaway monk comes to me; he says he comes from you next, would like to serve; but our peasants do not understand the Dutch language.</p>
