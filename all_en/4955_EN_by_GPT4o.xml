      <p>S. I give thanks to your kindness, most excellent man, for sending me what I requested.</p>
      <p>I wanted to return them sooner; but there were no suitable messengers for this matter. Therefore, I ask you to consider this delay favorably.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, if it is possible, I would like to read or even copy the confession of the Rhaetian churches, which I understand for certain is to be sent to you. I congratulate the Rhaetian church for the concord of the brothers, which has been achieved through your instruction and intercession. We have neither received nor heard anything about the Council of Trent; you surely have received some information.</p>
      <p>From France, a very certain rumor has reached us that a decree of the prelates has been published in France at the instigation or with the assistance or rather the urging of the envoys of Philip and the pope, that those who do not wish to simply and without any contradiction retain the papacy and subject themselves to the decrees of this Council of Trent, all of them (without any harm, however, to their body or property) must leave France, wherever they wish. But I do not doubt that you will soon have certain news from France.</p>
      <p>We pray to the Lord that the business of the gospel may succeed happily and that Mr. Martyr may return safely.</p>
      <p>Mr. Simpertus has been struck again by a deadly disease from the Lord and is lying gravely ill; we fear miserably that our church will no longer enjoy his ministry. Pray to the Lord for him and our church, which you know (if this faithful and vigorous servant of Christ is taken away) will be in no small danger for many reasons. May the Lord be gracious to us and preserve us.</p>
      <p>We ask what will finally happen (for everything is in the hand of the Lord), that you may deign to have us and our church commended to you; for if our colleague is taken from us here, there are many who are pricking up their ears, intending to try something. Too many are smiling at the Egyptian pots, too many admire the saleable Pagans. The Lord alone knows what will happen; He will undoubtedly protect our church, so that it is not deprived of faithful ministers and His word. In the empire, all is calm, except that the Lutherans are raging and raging excessively. May the Lord convert or destroy those new pontiffs.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, and I ask that you bear nothing with difficulty. Greet all the good and pious people to whom our church is dear.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, September 9, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours devotedly, Jakob Rüeger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most excellent Antistes of the church of Zürich, his lord and brother in the Lord, to be greatly respected.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zürich.</p>
