    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas would have come to Zurich together with Bernardino Ochino if he had known that Calvin was also coming to Zurich. Bullinger should greet the latter. Unfortunately, Enzinas cannot currently go to Zurich because he is awaiting the birth of Hieronymus Sailer’s wife [Felicitas, née Welser] at Sailer’s request. Even though Enzinas is being treated very well by Sailer and his wife, he would prefer to be in Zurich or back in Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Sailer and his wife send their regards. Sailer thanks for the information [not received] about the dispute concerning Rudolf Gwalther’s [“Endtchrist”]. Hopefully, after the resolution of this dispute, the Zurich church will be able to enjoy lasting peace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] According to a vague rumor, there have been disturbances in Lindau and the arrest of the city leader [Laux (Lucas) von Kirchen] has taken place. If this is true, Enzinas will report back. Regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [P.S.:] Enclosed are two letters from Sailer to two people in Zurich [...] with the request for delivery. If Bullinger has anything to take care of in St. Gallen, it will be gladly arranged!</p>

      <p>Greetings. If I had known about the arrival of Master Calvin, I would have come to you with Bernardino, because I am eager to see him. Please convey my most accurate greetings to him, to whom I would come without delay if Sailer permitted. But I am compelled to stay here until Sailer’s wife gives birth. Although the communication between us is very friendly and I am treated with a certain indulgence by Sailer’s wife, a most prudent woman, which is more than befits a studious man, believe me, most learned Bullinger, I would much prefer to be with you or in our residence in Basel.</p>

      <p>Sailer and his wife send their regards and are grateful for what you wrote about the matter of Gwalther. I congratulate your church on the tranquility, which I hope will be lasting, if indeed this matter is settled according to your judgment. I do not know what is being reported about the disturbances in Lindau; it is said that the city leader has been captured, but nothing certain is known yet. I will write what it is when I receive some truth. Meanwhile, fare well with all the brothers.</p>

      <p>Your Francis Dryander.</p>
      <p>I am sending two letters from Master Sailer to two people in Zurich; please, do not find it burdensome to send them through a servant. If you wish anything to be taken care of here by us, we will all be most ready.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church.</p>
