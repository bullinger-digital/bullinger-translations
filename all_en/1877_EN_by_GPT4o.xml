      <p>Greetings. Since I hope that it will soon be possible for me to be with you there, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, there is no need for me to burden you with lengthy letters, especially since I know nothing new that my dearest godfather, Samuel Wittenbach, does not already know. He will gladly inform you of the French efforts, which he learns from his brother-in-law, Mr. Mirabilis. I would commend this man to you in many ways, but it is already clear to everyone how highly you regard him, as he has been fortunate enough to marry a wife so excellently endowed by your favor, which I mean in terms of both physical and mental qualities. As for the gifts of fortune, he may have reason to complain. However, with your help and authority, what he currently lacks can easily be remedied. I also kindly and earnestly ask you to make this happen.</p>
      <p>There are those who think he loves his wife less warmly because he has not received what was promised as a dowry by his mother-in-law and relatives. If they would fulfill their promise here, the most chaste matron would be better off and altogether more comfortable.</p>
      <p>He does not want much from her. He is very reluctant to be at home and is unfriendly in the house. She has confided in me with all sorts of complaints about the birds in person. May your household be well. Please convey my respectful greetings to your excellent colleagues and all other friends and brothers on my behalf. Mr. Treasurer Fuchs, Mr. Jacob the elder, and also the younger, my Funck, along with the others, send their greetings and commend themselves to your Christian prayers.</p>
      <p>Help us diligently with your holy prayers. Farewell. Biel, May 28, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable friend and brother in Christ, most beloved. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
