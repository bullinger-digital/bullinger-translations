      <p>Greetings. Since I hear that rumors have spread here that are no less sad than they are false, both concerning the kingdom of England itself and our people who profess letters and religion among the English, I thought it was my duty to relieve you of all anxiety, just as I have relieved the people of Basel. Many here were convinced that Bernard and Bucer had been captured along with the protector of the kingdom; and with them, the entire form of religion, which they had established a little earlier, had collapsed. But this is not the case. I was a witness to the entire transformation, and I not only saw the external and pitiable appearance of the change, but I am also aware of the plans of the leaders, which I will report to you in person by the grace of God when the storms are milder. Meanwhile, regarding Bernard and Bucer, I affirm that, in my judgment, they have never lived more happily or usefully than now. For Bernard spends all his time writing, and indeed with an impetus and speed never before seen, as I have heard from him; and recently a male child was born to him, with whom he is uniquely delighted. Bucer, on the other hand, has been appointed royal professor of theology, and one or two days after my departure, he was about to set out for Cambridge, almost restored to his former health. I also say that religion is now in a better state than it was before the protector's captivity. For I saw a public edict, promulgated by royal authority and printed, in which not only is the reformation, which I sent to you, confirmed, but certain other things, not yet addressed, are affirmed to be reformed according to the form of the gospel. These things are true, and on the fifth of November, I was at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Canterbury and Bucer, on which day public and private affairs were in the same state as when I now write. What has happened in the meantime, I do not know, nor do I think the people of Basel or Zürich can know. For I came with the speed that anyone else could have come and for no other reason than to publish here in this winter what I had worked on in England, leaving my family in Cambridge, to which I will return by the grace of God at the beginning of spring. I wanted you to know these things, which are most true: I would write more if time permitted, or if I did not think it better to defer them until my arrival.</p>
      <p>For I wish to see you and to be refreshed with you through the mutual communication of our faith, whom I have always recognized as true ministers of God and have not hesitated to proclaim in many places. Greet all the brothers and the whole church in my words. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 3, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Zürich.</p>
