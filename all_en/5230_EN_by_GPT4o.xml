      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I was pleased to see Johann Heinrich, whom you so highly recommended to me in your letters, both for your sake and his. He stayed for about seven months with the vice-chamberlain of the most serene queen, with whom I placed him temporarily, so that he might more easily learn about our court and its customs. Indeed, I wished that he might be promoted to greater things, and I endeavored to achieve this: but I regret that the state of our affairs is such that, especially in these times, it can be more wished for than hoped for.</p>
      <p>However, when he observed with the experience of many that these things were sufficiently and excessively true, he left the court and has remained here in London at his own expense. Here he conducted himself honorably, with the utmost integrity and modesty.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the fact that his affairs here have not been better attended to should be attributed more to the difficulty of the times than to the will of friends. As for religion and the state of the kingdom, by the grace of God, everything here is conducted quietly (as before) and peacefully, and we always hope for better things. I pray to God that the same may be perpetually true for you and your churches.</p>
      <p>Farewell, along with the entire church of God.</p>
      <p>London, March 16, 1562.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety, F. Bedford. To the most distinguished men, Heinrich Bullinger, and Rudolf Gwalther, most faithful ministers of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>Zürich</p>
