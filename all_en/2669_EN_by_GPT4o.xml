      <p>Mercy and salvation from our only mediator, Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Greetings. When I was in Z端rich a few days ago and learned that you were absent, I was indeed not a little saddened; I greatly value, as I usually do, and now even more so, your holy conversations and most beneficial advice, from which I have often departed more learned and holier. Now, at least for the sake of duty, I wanted to write to you, who have deserved so well of me, so that you may form an opinion about me and my true sentiment in religion, as sincerely as you have always been accustomed to do, and this because I seem to have placed a horse before a donkey in changing my place. In this matter, I believe I have explained the reasons for my decision quite extensively to Mr. Pellicanus, my honorable teacher. I would inform you about the state of the Frisian church, if you could not have learned it from Johannes a Lasco or from this compatriot of mine, who undertook this journey to see your church. His father, easily second to the counts, is a great lover of religion and most devoted to the Z端rich church, and was once recommended to you in my letters by Gerard a Campff. Therefore, I do not doubt that your usual benevolence, which you show towards all, will also be extended to him, and that your humanity, once noticed by him, will provide sharper incentives for brotherly love and faith, so that, as hitherto, we may begin to grow more and more as members of Christ. With these few words, farewell. Greet the lords and venerable fathers and brothers in Christ. In Basel, in the year of human liberation 1555, on the day before the Ides of July.</p>

      <p>To the pious, most learned man Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful bishop of Z端rich, my dearest teacher.</p>
