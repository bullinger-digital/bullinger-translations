      <p> Greetings. I have received all your letters, most reverend father, and as you were eagerly desiring, I have made efforts with the consul, so that they would not take anything on loan from your city. But the consul smiled and showed letters in which some hope on this matter was revealed. Therefore, they think they should do nothing else but take a loan from volunteers, yet a moderate sum, and not without a moderate interest or profit returning to you, and that for a few years. Therefore, my reasoning could do nothing with him, who, along with others, is fully convinced that they will not suffer rejection, provided that under fair conditions and for a few years, whatever it may be (the number, however, will not exceed 10,000, as I hear), they wish and hope to obtain. </p>
      <p> I indeed would have gladly prevented it; but in vain, since others have given hope. Therefore, I humbly ask, most esteemed lord, that you do not doubt my dedication and, if it cannot be otherwise, consider whatever happens here in a good light. </p>
      <p> Farewell, most excellent man, the ornament and protection of the churches of Christ. </p>
      <p> Most swiftly from our Chur, August 26, 1574. Your most devoted admirer, Tobias Egli. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord. Zurich. </p>
