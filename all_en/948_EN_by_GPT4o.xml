      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have received two letters from you these days, to which I have nothing to respond. I would have sent a copy of the Valentinian spectacle; but they say it must be recalled to the press again and will appear more corrected in many places than it was. Many rhymes have been added, some corrected; you wouldn't believe how good the book is; but the multitude of copies indicates the usefulness of the book; more on that another time.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is in Speyer and will remain there for several weeks. He has summoned the Elector Palatine and the Archbishop of Mainz to him and wants to reconcile them; for they have a certain dispute over a trivial matter, and the bishops are now more arrogant than they ever were, due to the Emperor's power and victory. Perhaps, once these matters are settled, he will move to Strasbourg and oppress that city in such a way that it could never rise again.</p>
      <p>The example of Ghent terrifies and shakes me; but they do not want to learn unless struck. The people of Augsburg are expecting the Emperor's arrival, and some even say that the Pope will come to those councils. What a marvelous thing it will be in our days, never heard of before. Now all of Germany will be subjected with the head present, indeed trampled under the feet of serpents and dragons, unless the Lord helps. The cities of Saxony have established a new alliance with the King of Denmark to defend the Gospel and to preserve the freedom granted by the ancient emperors.</p>
      <p>This alliance completely terrifies the Emperor, and he is already trying to establish something new.</p>
      <p>The Emperor finds the discord of the princes and cities convenient, and he would not want them to be in agreement; he has many reasons, which he will not easily reveal to anyone, and this was said by Mr. Granvella to a certain friend. But hey, what do you say to this? The Lord has sent us a female healer from Monte Veneris, who has two spirits with her, whose work she uses for healing, who seek herbs; for they usually leave her at night and return in the morning. So some say. She is a poor woman and promises much, but has so far delivered nothing. I hear our most prudent council will expel her; they have certain reasons. See what Satan is up to. She knows how to examine urine brought to her and also knows how to divine. If you people of Zurich want to embrace her, I will arrange for her to come to you. Farewell in the Lord. Tell Mr. Theodor that I will soon send him a very long letter about various matters, whom you will greet in my name. Basel, June 27, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, his perpetual lord to be honored.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
