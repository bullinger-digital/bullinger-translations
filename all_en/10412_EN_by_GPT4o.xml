    <p xml:id="regest1">Guillaume du Bellay, Seigneur de Langey, the envoy of the French king, conferred with the theologians in Zurich and requested an opinion on the restoration of church peace. This was promised, but it was stated that they would not deviate from the scripture and doctrine in any way; they intended to benefit unity with the truth. Bullinger fears that the diplomatic endeavor only serves to make the Germans favorably inclined towards the French king. He has first rumors about the victory of Princes Philipp and Ulrich and wishes for more precise news about this as well as about Sebastian Appenzeller and the pension recipients. Greetings. Should Ferdinand be defeated, the Abbot of St. Gallen might not fare so well either.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Guillaume du Bellay, the envoy and orator of the King of the French, whom you recently wrote about, came to Zurich a few days ago, summoned us for a discussion, and shared exactly the same matters with us as he did with you. He is a man of very pleasant intellect, eloquent, prudent, cunning, and learned, and I would promise myself the best of everything from him if I had not suspected that he might be intending something else in the name of the king than what his very well-prepared words suggest, or that he might be sitting on two chairs. He asked us to put in writing what we considered best for restoring the peace of the church and in what matters we would be willing to yield, even for the sake of the weak. We promised to do this at some point, but said that there would be very few, indeed none, in which we could yield even a little from the accepted doctrines or ecclesiastical customs. In the meantime, however, we would do everything, provided that the truth is preserved, that seems to benefit peace and concord in any way. I fear that this whole business has been set up by very cunning men to prepare the minds of the Germans for their king, so that they may find them more ready and willing when the Germans' help is needed, etc.</p>
      <p>The more turbulent everything is, the more I long for your letters. I have heard some things about the victory of the princes, but I have not yet learned clearly what the situation is. However, I know that you are very knowledgeable about all these matters. Therefore, I would ask, if it were not too much to trouble you, to note in a few words what has happened, who perished in that disaster—if what is rumored is true—whether the prince has regained his homeland, or what good men are predicting. You could not write anything more pleasing today. But what about Sebastian and the pension recipients?</p>
      <p>Farewell. I wish Vogler, Studer, etc., well.</p>
      <p>May 21, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your H.</p>
      <p>Is there anything to the rumor that Ferdinand has suffered badly, how then should your Antronius sit so warmly?</p>
      <p>To Doctor Joachim Vadian, the most prudent proconsul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord.</p>
