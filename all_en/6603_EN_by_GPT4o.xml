      <p>Greetings. The steward of Küngßfeld sent your letter to me, most excellent and dearest lord and godfather, from which with great sorrow I learned of the death of your dearest daughters, Zwingli and Simler.</p>
      <p>With this news, the wound that I had received from the death of my dearest daughter Elisabeth, and which had just begun to heal, has completely reopened for me, especially when I recalled the words of my Elisabeth, who so frequently and almost to the very end repeated your Elisabeth, her godmother or sponsor, constantly mentioning her, and when she heard from me that she was ill, she predicted that she was already dead and that she would join her, so much so that I admire that spiritual connection and do not doubt that they now rejoice together before the heavenly Father. I truly sympathize with you and all of you from the heart, that you are deprived of their comfort in the present, just as I know you also sympathize with my fate in this part. However, since we know where they have gone and how surely we will follow them, there is reason to give thanks to the Lord and to patiently submit to His will and also to prepare ourselves for this journey (which may it happen to us happily and fortunately in Christ Jesus!). Your example greatly comforts me; for if the Lord has imposed this on you, who am I to complain? May the Lord comfort and preserve us both.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the letters you were sending to Geneva, I forwarded to my Blaise in Lausanne; he will take care of them diligently. As for the plague, it has greatly subsided for 14 days now.</p>
      <p>Stephan, the son of the elder Wittenbach, is still bedridden; but he seems to have overcome all danger now by the grace of the Lord; may He completely raise him up. From the letters of Lord Steiger, you have understood the whole matter of Savoy, so there is no need for me to repeat it. I fear that instead of one enemy, we may eventually have many; and I hope that those who have been considered mediators until now are not the instigators of these matters! Perhaps this is more useful for the churches; the Lord knows this; may He protect us! Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Give my greetings to all yours, especially to Lord Simler and Lord Zwingli, and let them know how much I sympathize with them in their great sorrow. Lord Consul Steiger, Diesbach, Amadeus, my father-in-law, Musculus, and others greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 13, 1565.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always and sincerely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my lord and godfather, to be honored with perpetual respect.</p>
