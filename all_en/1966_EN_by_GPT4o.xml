      <p>The convenience of the messenger now allows me to write these few words to you, most illustrious and likewise most excellent Bullinger. By the grace of God, I am well and laboring in the gospel. I have sent two of my men to Italy for not insignificant reasons; but as soon as they arrive, which I hope will be within 20 days, I will come directly to you. For I cannot perform my ministry in the Valtellina due to the plague raging most fiercely. I have no news of new matters. Lecco, a town of the Duchy of Milan near Lake Como, was attempted by treachery in vain and unsuccessfully. I beg you, send me the instruction you received from England, and quickly.</p>
      <p>I ask my Josiah to ensure that the small vessel sent to him from Basel (as I hear) is delivered to me quickly, and also to inform me whether the booklet I sent to you from Tübingen with a crown was found. I wish to know and have these things before I leave here, if possible. The devil roars in Italy and diligently exercises persecution on the members of Christ. But this is more to be lamented; for there are few who remain steadfast. Pray for all the pious, Bullinger, with the whole church. I bid all fellow believers to be well. You, farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>In Chiavenna, August 24, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>The same messenger, a pious man, returning to Basel, can bring the instruction I mentioned to me, unless a more convenient opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother. In Zürich.</p>
