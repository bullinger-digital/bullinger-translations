      <p>Greetings. I am sending to you the letters of Lord Cognetius. He writes back to me about the business of Pontassella; I have recommended him to the legate among the Rhaetians as a person of better reputation. I hope we will achieve something; for he has promised me generously and kindly regarding his willingness. I write this while busy; you will excuse the negligence of the letter. It is written from Germany that Johann Friedrich of Saxony, who is besieged at Gotha, endures the siege with a strong and present spirit and is prepared for anything. The Germans neglect the Turkish war, I do not know how wisely. The Spaniard has his hands full in the Netherlands; for it is reported that the younger Nassau, brother of Orange, has arrived with great forces and German cavalry to aid the Belgians.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, March 25, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Pomponne de Belli√®vre.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and reverend men, Lords Heinrich Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther, pastors of the Church of Zurich.</p>
