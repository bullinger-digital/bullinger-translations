      <p>S. P. D. The reason I have not yet sent you any letters, most learned and illustrious man, is truly because not only did no matter come to mind, but not even the type of letter with which I could conveniently communicate with you. For you know that both the times that followed my departure were not at such a long interval, and indeed that it is not my place to cultivate learned and distinguished men with empty letters, especially those whom I know do not have enough leisure from public affairs. Knowing that you are the most occupied among them all, I have not sent you any letters yet, not out of forgetfulness or negligence, but because I had nothing at all about which I thought it appropriate to write to you, a very busy man, from so far away. However, I hope that I will someday give such signs of my respect towards you, by which you will easily judge that the memory of you is cherished here by me with the greatest benevolence, as both your highest dignity and your singular love towards me seem to demand. Meanwhile, I will deal with that which has now especially led me to write this letter to you: it is Mr. Peter Martyr, a man indeed by far the most learned, along with Mr. Richard Cox, the chancellor of our academy, to whom my brother and I have been commended by you. They promise us their effort, diligence, and finally their utmost dedication, so that I am confident nothing will be lacking for us, and that they will do everything most readily for your sake. For which I thank you, and I wish that an opportunity for us to repay you would arise; you will always find us ready and benevolent.</p>
      <p>However, being absent, we cannot do so now, but we will someday make you understand that you have placed your effort among people who are mindful and not at all ungrateful. Farewell, therefore, most learned man, and take my lightly written letters in good part.</p>
      <p>Given at Oxford on the first of November.</p>
      <p>Heinrich von Ulm, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
