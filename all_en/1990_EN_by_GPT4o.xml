      <p>You still know, most illustrious Bullinger, how often I have not hesitated to urge you to oppose and print many versions of the Bible at a glance. And I could recount many reasons here, from which I have been moved to write to your [excellency] and to beseech you. The knowledge of languages is extremely useful and necessary for all who will handle the sacred scriptures, as the ancient canons, the judgments of the fathers, and many councils together testify. I could recount many of these, if I did not seem to teach your sublimity rather than ask - from which I could not escape the charge of impropriety. I will only add two examples. Johannes Brisgoicus, a most distinguished doctor of theology, yet a papist, formerly an ordinary in Freiburg im Breisgau, did not undertake any reading of the New Testament to be interpreted unless he had compared the new version with the old. For he was wonderfully delighted and helped by Erasmus's version. Therefore, carefully considering and smoothing out the reasons for the versions, and prudently equalizing the more harshly translated ones, he often impressed upon us how much it often matters in reading to have examined these more deeply. To this, Johannes Hoffmeister, a most vigorous defender of the papist religion, a provincial of the Augustinians, always carried the Campensis Psalter with another translation, which he had at hand - for that Psalter has two - either in his bosom or in his hands. But he affirmed that this other translation - which I mentioned - was Zwingli's, most praised and dear to him. However, the best God knows these things to be true, who would be angry with me if they were not true. Therefore, I earnestly beseech your [excellency], and rather now I implore you, that if you do not consider the whole Bible to be published in this manner, at least in the Wisdom books, or the Psalter, or Ecclesiastes of Solomon, you now provide some example or taste of this future complete edition. Thus, the minds of many will be sharpened to more deeply engage in the knowledge of languages. I often heard M. Gallus, a man of the highest learning formerly residing in Freiburg - for I stayed there in the house of Wisdom, as they call it, with the highest stipend - wishing that a Bible of many translations would someday appear. Therefore, I ask your sublime learning, for the love of God, for the sake of promoting the evangelical light, for the zeal of enlightening our Switzerland, for the good of augmenting the literary republic - and what not seeking? - that you may allow yourself to be persuaded at some time to ensure that these things are done in this way someday.</p>
