    <p xml:id="regest1">[Enclosure:] The messenger appeared only in the morning; the evening before, Blarer received [two] letters from Musculus and a copy of his [„Anticochlaeus primus“]. If one wanted to negotiate with [Konrad Zwick] regarding [his military skills], it would have to happen soon, as he will soon travel to the Imperial Diet [in Worms] and before that to the City Day. Musculus writes that he responded to Bullinger in a brotherly manner and with restraint, without condemning him - like Luther, whose behavior Musculus cannot approve of.</p>

      <p>The messenger only appeared this Friday morning, and last night I received letters from Augsburg, dated December 10th, from Musculus; otherwise, Gervasius held the letters in Memmingen for so long. Musculus also sent me a copy.</p>
      <p>If one perhaps thought of negotiating something with my cousin, one would have to act in time; for he will soon have to travel to the Imperial Diet, especially since the City Day is approaching. May God arrange everything for the best according to His great grace; praying for me with faithfulness.</p>
      <p>Musculus writes among other things: "I respond to Bullinger as to a brother with such moderation that I retain the freedom to say what I feel and do not condemn those who think differently; for in this matter I very much disagree with Luther, whose desire to slander and lack of restraint I cannot approve of in any way," etc.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
