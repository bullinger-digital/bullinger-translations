      <p>Peace and health through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>You know even without me saying, most esteemed father in Christ, how many obstacles hinder those who wish to write, especially those who roll not the stone of Sisyphus, but the typographic one.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I am well aware that the common excuse for writing less frequently is valid with you.</p>
      <p>However, I think of you often and not less diligently than those who write more frequently, and I pray to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He may keep you safe for a long time in this most turbulent state of affairs, for His church, not only in preserving the fold of the gospel but also in driving away the wolves and those who falsely boast the title of brothers.</p>
      <p>Thus far, we have devoted our efforts to publishing French books; but that internal war among the French has consumed everything like a storm.</p>
      <p>Our Flemish and that lower homeland remain, for whom I am preparing those books, which you first wrote against the Anabaptists in German, then translated into Latin by Mr. Simler, to speak in French, until the Lord God provides them with faithful preachers of His word, who will also drive away the wolves with a living voice.</p>
      <p>Lord Trecelius the Pole, who also awaits these, will explain everything more conveniently in person, and what is said here.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell, most illustrious man and father in Christ of many, who embrace you from the heart.</p>
      <p>Hastily, Geneva, January 16, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Jean Crespin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious minister of the word of God, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the distinguished pastor of the people of Zurich.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
