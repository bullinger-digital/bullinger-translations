      <p>Greetings. The letters that you sent to Mr. Haller last month have been properly taken care of, as evidenced by those I am now sending to you from him. If you respond to them, I will ensure that you do not find my diligence lacking in handling them either. This is the one thing I wanted you to know now; for what else should I write amidst such great occupations (I have recently betrothed my son to a colleague of mine, and the wedding is to be celebrated tomorrow) and amidst such inconsistent and varied rumors that you do not know what or whom to believe. Let others write to you about these matters. I will ask of you what you would have done of your own accord without my prompting: that you continue to love me and make use of my services wherever needed; it will be so far from ungrateful that, if you do otherwise, I would doubt your goodwill towards me.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and give my regards to Mr. Tomann, as well as to Gwalther and Johann Wolf (to whom I recently wrote about a certain matter of his upon his request) and to your most delightful family members, along with my son, in my name (if it is not too much trouble).</p>
      <p>Augsburg, May 3, 1569, in haste. Matthias Schenck, yours.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a man outstanding in piety and learning, and a respected friend.</p>
