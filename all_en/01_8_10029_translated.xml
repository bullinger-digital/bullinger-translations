  <input>Gratia et pax a deo patre per Christum.

Quę de pane eucharistię contra Bartholomeum scripsisti, frater charissime, placent, sed vereor, ne oleum et laborem perdideris. Nam nisi crediderint, non intelligent, surdisque narras fabulam; si crederent, nihil opus pluribus argumentis. Orandus est deus, ut mentes eorum excitet, ut tenebras illuminet, ut intus trahat. Et nos aliquando tenebre eramus, nunc autem ipsius gratia lux [Eph 5,8], «qui operatur omnia in omnibus» [1 Kor 12,6]. Quare te rogo, ut quedam verba, quibus acerbius in fratrem invehere videri posses malis, in mitiora mutare velis, non quod tales iisce verbis digni non sint, sed quod nos alia decent, nisi cum deploratissimis impiissimisque tibi negocium siet. «Calamum confractum non confregit» Christus, «linum fumigans non extinxit» [Jes 42,3], quem imitari hac in re velis. Et sunt, qui duci, non cogi volunt. Ceterum dum corpus a divinitate separas, dum traditum sit, cave, ne adversarius secus, quam tu velis, intelligat et ex verbis tuis caput tuum petat. Ego enim non intelligo, quomodo divina natura corpus, quod semel adsumpserat, reliquerit, neque tamen dubito solum corpus passum esse, non divinitatem. Sed hoc quid contra eum, qui corpus divinitati unitum adorandum contendit? Haec scribo, non ut eorum partes adiuvem, sed quod periculum esse videam, ne is, qui cum iisce hominibus argutiis rem tentet, argutiis, quibus ipsi maxime nituntur, referiatur.

Ego nunquam me iisce Syrtibus crederem neque unquam donarem hic esse corpus, cum «caro nihil prosit» [Joh 6,63] et figurata sit locutio: «hoc est corpus meum» [1 Kor 11,24], id est «hoc significat, figurat corpus meum»; nam id sacris litteris alienum non est. Sed fortissimus locus ad hoc firmandum habetur Exod. 12 [11]: «Est enim phase domini, id est transitus». Vides hic «est» pro «significat» positum esse, nam dominus adhuc non transierat, sed sequenti nocte transiturus erat. Et agnus non erat phase, sed significabat phase. Sic Christus adhuc nondum erat traditus, sed sequenti nocte tradebatur [1 Kor 11,23], cuius hic panis memoriale et mn[em]osynon erat, nec erat corpus, sed significabat corpus passurum.

«Schaha»: Hebreis «adorare» significat genu flectere aut caput, procidere in terram. Ne te torqueas, obtundo te ineptus meis, sed tu boni consule, frater in Christo charissime, in quo perpetuo valeas.

  <output>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ. The things you have written about the Eucharist against Bartholomeus, my dearest brother, are pleasing, but I fear you will lose oil and labor. For if they do not believe, you tell a story to the deaf; if they did believe, there would be no need for more arguments. God must be asked to awaken their minds, to enlighten their darkness, to draw them from within. And once we were in darkness, but now by His grace we are light [Eph 5,8], "who works all things in all" [1 Cor 12,6]. Therefore I ask you to change certain words that might seem too harsh against your brother into milder ones, not because they are not worthy of such words, but because something else is more fitting for us, unless it is a matter of the most wretched and wicked. "A broken reed He did not break" Christ, "smoking flax He did not quench" [Isa 42,3], what you should imitate in this matter. And there are some who want to be led, not forced. But while you separate the body from the divinity, be careful that the adversary does not understand it differently than you want, and take your head off from your words. For I do not understand how the divine nature left the body which it had once taken up, yet I do not doubt that it was only the body that suffered, not the divinity. But what has this to do with him who contends that the body united with the divinity should be worshipped? I write this, not to help their side, but because I see the danger that the one who attempts to deal with these men with arguments might be referred back to the arguments they use the most.

I would never believe these Syrtians nor would I ever give here to be the body, since "flesh profits nothing" [John 6,63] and the expression "this is my body" [1 Cor 11,24] is figurative, that is "this signifies, figurates my body"; for this is not alien to the holy scriptures. But a most powerful passage to confirm this is Exod. 12 [11]: "For it is the passover of the Lord, that is, the passing over". You can see here that "is" is put for "signifies", for the Lord had not yet passed over, but was to pass over on the following night. And the lamb was not the passover, but it signified the passover. So Christ had not yet been delivered, but was to be delivered on the following night [1 Cor 11,23], of which this bread was a memorial and a mn[em]osynon, and it was not the body, but it signified the body to suffer.

"Schaha": To the Hebrews "to worship" signifies to bend the knee or bow the head, to prostrate oneself to the ground. I do not twist you with my nonsense, but you, my beloved brother in Christ, consult the good and may you fare well forever.
