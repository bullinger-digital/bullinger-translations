    <p xml:id="regest1">Did not want Niklaus [Appenzeller?] to depart for Bullinger without a letter, even if he has nothing new to report. Hears bitter news; the [Bernese] followers of Bucer ingratiate themselves with the powerful and claim that they only want to commit to the pure word of God, with which they seek to relativize [the theses of the Bernese] disputation and council resolutions; thus they erect their new fabrications, and what they hardly dare to preach publicly, they secretly chatter in their corners and ensure that nothing of it is reported to the Great Council. Even more detestable is that their teachers are corrupting the entire youth. Compared to the public grievances, R체mlang's private concerns seem minor; for what [the opponents] fail at is attributed to the cunning and audacity of the writers, especially him, who dared to challenge them; Erasmus [Ritter] and Johannes [W채ber] appear strong and fearless; one must pray for a good outcome, for Bucer does not sleep. Wants to change his life; many good brothers advise him to pursue the pastoral profession, but God alone knows the future; R체mlang asks for Bullinger's advice. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Most excellent Bullinger, I did not want Mr. Niklaus to depart for you without a letter, even if I have nothing but old complaints to report.</p>
      <p>I hear astonishing, serious, and bitter things that tear my heart apart. Our followers of Bucer in Bern ingratiate themselves with the powerful with amazing flattery; they claim they wish to be bound by no man's words or writings but only by the pure word of God.</p>
      <p>With this reasoning, they attempt to evade our disputation and the decrees of the council, as if the disputation were drawn from Marcolf and not supported by the divine scriptures. They say they do not teach against the disputation, for it is renowned and, according to the times, deficient in many ways; and because it can easily be added to and further refined, they wish to do this in divine matters from the holy scriptures. Thus, they pave the way and lay the groundwork for establishing their new and fictitious ideas, and what they hardly dare to preach publicly, they whisper in their corners and take every precaution to prevent the matter from being reported to the Great Council; yet in private conversations, we perceive what they have whispered into ears.</p>
      <p>And what is more detestable, the entire youth is being corrupted by their teachers. That Satan can only be expelled with sighs, groans, and prayers to Christ, who allows us to be tempted here so that we may be tested; I trust He will be present for His little ship.</p>
      <p>I bear my private troubles, which accumulate, lightly compared to the public ones. What does not succeed in their efforts, they attribute all the blame to the cunning and audacity of the writers, and they especially attack me, as if I dared to challenge them beyond the scope of my duty. Erasmus and Johannes act bravely and stand firm without fear. Pray for a favorable outcome; Bucer does not slumber.</p>
      <p>I will arrange my life differently. There are many good brothers and lords who zealously urge me to the ministry of the word, where I would have the opportunity to attack these rabble-rousers. I promise nothing. I do not know what I should do nor what God wants to do through me. He knows, to whom I completely commit myself. I ask for your advice, I pray. They seize this as an opportunity, that such a matter has sometimes been referred to the council; yet I have resisted, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent one, my distinguished honor and protection. Given in Bern, on the 19th day of October in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>Greet all the learned and also Gesner, etc. Yours entirely, Eberhard von R체mlang.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable, faithful, and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor in Zurich, his ever-to-be-respected patron.</p>
