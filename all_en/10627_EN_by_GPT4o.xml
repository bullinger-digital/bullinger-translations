    <p xml:id="regest1">Complains that the Gospel has so far borne so little fruit. According to a letter from Capito, the followers of [Melchior] Hoffman have gained great influence in Strasbourg; the intrusion of Anabaptists into the house of a member of the Mieg family seems to have gone unpunished, while [Bucer and Capito] instead concern themselves with foreign affairs. Capito has also reported on the Anabaptists in Holland and Münster; since the Anabaptists invoke God, the evangelical powers shy away from taking harsh action. The Castellan of Musso is said to have abducted the wife of the Duke of Savoy.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Why such a long silence? What could be the reason? Perhaps it is the same thing that weighs me down with some kind of lethargy and almost overwhelms me, namely the miserable state of affairs. The Gospel, which has been preached for many years, has so far borne so little fruit that it seems to be deteriorating almost daily.</p>
      <p>Capito writes that the followers of Hofmann have taken over a good part of his people. See the negligence of the leaders of the republics! I can give an example: There is a very wealthy citizen of Strasbourg, yet, as I hear, pious; his surname is Mieg. Recently, six men of that heresy entered his house while he was absent and asked his wife for food, and when she said she had nothing prepared, they added: "If you are a sister, you will not refuse food." So, seeing their intent, she called the neighbors. Through them, it was arranged that these men left again, although they returned not long after when the husband was present and asked again. Such impudence! But even then they were thrown out with empty stomachs. This crime, you see, I do not hear being punished. Meanwhile, the leaders of the word wander in foreign republics, as if there is nothing at all to be done at home.</p>
      <p>The same Capito writes these words: "Strange rumors about a new external kingdom among the Dutch. We have received for certain that the people of Münster are still defending themselves very strongly. However, whatever is reported about the Anabaptists, because they invoke God in their deeds, I see the evangelical powers are so terrified that they do not dare to raise their hands, lest they be contaminated with the blood of the saints. I see that we must resort solely to devout and faithful prayers."</p>
      <p>Besides this, hear something that will delight you. A certain Bernese, a relative of mine, told me that the Castellan of Musso has abducted the wife of the Duke of Savoy. A truly remarkable piece of news, if true.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 7, 1535.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, his own.</p>
