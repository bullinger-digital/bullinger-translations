      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the divine word and patron and benefactor of all scholars, from a student of the lower church, greetings.</p>
      <p>Recently, when I met with some of my fellow students, most excellent Heinrich, and we were discussing various matters (as often happens), we eventually mentioned geography. Then I said that I had often wondered why maps were not acquired for the benefit of students using church funds and affixed in the study halls, especially since these expenses seemed to be in the interest of studies. Then some said that the canons had no regard for studies, so they are not compelled to spend anything of their own; for although this matter has been discussed often, nothing has yet resulted from that deliberation. However, I and (if I am not mistaken) others also desire this greatly, and not without reason; for you yourself know that all reading of poets, historians, and orators is utterly blind, incomplete, and mutilated unless the demonstration and location of regions, cities, rivers, and mountains are present. I certainly did not attribute this to their avarice and stinginess, but rather to the fact that they were not engaged in true learning from their earliest years (for their times were not as fortunate regarding the true transmission of letters), and they had not properly tasted its benefits, but had often devoted their efforts to those ecclesiastical chants. But you (who have fallen into more fortunate times, which are indeed more to be desired, if we do not consider the seditious and turbulent ages, but rather the marvelous flourishing of studies and progress and the increase and restoration of evangelical truth) I earnestly beg you to lend your aid in promoting this matter. For you are well experienced in what benefits or hinders letters. Moreover, it is also your duty to care for those things that pertain to the education and progress of young students in learning. And by doing this, you will earn and receive many thanks from me and many others. And please ensure that our hope placed in you is not disappointed. For we have placed all our trust in you alone in achieving this matter, and may you consider us and the humanities recommended in this matter. For if we see that you have made little progress, we will pursue another way until we have achieved our goal.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Diethelm Keller, ready for anything.</p>
