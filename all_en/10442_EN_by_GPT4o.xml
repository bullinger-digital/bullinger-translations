    <p xml:id="regest1">Just as God expected the people of Israel, who returned from Babylonian captivity, to restore the destroyed temple, so is Ulrich, who returned to his duchy after years of exile, expected to restore the church. Citing the exemplary deeds of King Jehoshaphat, Bullinger exhorts the Duke to guide the people to divine truth based on the Bible and with the help of a pious, honest clergy. He defends the reformed faith. Secondly, Ulrich, like Jehoshaphat once did, should ensure that his land receives a God-fearing judiciary and administration, in order to win the people over and be assured of divine assistance.</p>

      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince and lord. My willing, humble service is always ready for your princely grace.</p>
      <p>My earnest request and humble desire is, most gracious lord, that your princely grace may receive this my faithful, simple writing from me, an unworthy servant of the gospel of Jesus Christ, kindly read it, and also consider it well, since it is not presumptuous to teach your princely grace, but only intended to remind you of those things which are of great benefit and excellent welfare. I hope that for this reason your princely grace will not need much preamble, as those burdened with affairs cannot endure long speeches.</p>
      <p>God, the highest and most benevolent good, a righteous judge, a lord of wonderful deeds and great mercy, led His chosen people Israel with justice and to punish sins into severe captivity through the most powerful king of the earth, Nebuchadnezzar, and, when seventy years of captivity were fulfilled, turned to them again with His mercy and, through the favor, counsel, and help of the glorious king Cyrus, freed them from great misery and allowed them to return to their inheritance and fatherland, in all this desiring nothing else from them than that they, in all danger and suffering, which they had to endure according to the prophecy of Daniel, would be patient, steadfast in Him, upright, faithful, and honest, but especially grateful and thankful, which, however, did not happen as it should have, for they all generally and also individually took care of their own affairs, built their houses, and paid little attention to the temple and God's matters; therefore, they suffered more and more danger and want. This is all seen in the prophet Haggai, who rebuked them for this and earnestly admonished them to be thankful to God the Lord, to build the temple, undoubtedly, God would be with them, protect them in the midst of all their enemies, and in time send the Messiah, our Lord Jesus, who would build the true, right, and great temple and make the whole world blessed, etc.</p>
      <p>All this, gracious lord, is written for the comfort, instruction, and as a living example for all Christians, but especially for your princely grace, who, like them, have been thrown into great misery for many years by the hand of God, have suffered various troubles and sorrows, either because of sins, which God graciously forgives, or because your princely grace, like King David, was driven out of the land of Israel, exercised through various tribulations, poverty, suffering, and distress, indeed tested like gold in the fire, and at last brought back into your land not only as a lord but as a wise, experienced, and faithful father to your people, for the advancement of God's honor and all righteousness, for the comfort and help of the poor people, and for the eternal praise, honor, and glory of your princely grace. For just as God's power, faithfulness, and favor with powerful deeds, also through the earnest support of the Christian prince of Hesse, have now shown themselves to your princely grace as they did in the past to David and the oppressed Israel through the victorious king Cyrus and have come to help with an outstretched arm. To Him be victory, honor, and praise for eternity. Just as He desired nothing else from His people at that time than faithfulness and gratitude, so He desires nothing else now from your princely grace than that you recognize His righteous judgment, His heartfelt mercy, love, and faithfulness, trust in His power, protection, and grace, acknowledge and call upon Him alone, cling to Him and be thankful to Him with all your heart at all times, as the only righteous judge, the only faithful, heartfelt father, who has troubled, saddened, humbled, and struck your princely grace, so that He may teach you, make you understand His will, faithfulness, and love, and now at His time rejoice and exalt you again. "For He alone," as Daniel says, "is the one to whom all wisdom and strength belong. He changes times and seasons, He removes kings and sets up kings" [Dan 2:20f], He kills and makes alive again, His is the kingdom, the honor, strength, and power forever.</p>
      <p>Just as in the times of Haggai the most visible act of gratitude was the rebuilding of the temple, so your princely grace can show no more grateful act to God, the faithful, than by building the true, right temple for Him. This will also be your happiness and salvation, since the delay in rebuilding brought great misfortune to Israel; although the building was not without special danger, God nevertheless preserved them with strength in the midst of their enemies. So the punishment of delay cannot prevent anyone from taking action at the wrong time and without consideration; for Paul, the apostle, earnestly admonishes to use the time, so that everything is undertaken at the right time and in an orderly manner. Similarly, the ancients have said, at the beginning one should seriously consider the action and, after finding the best, bravely and without delay complete it. Thus your princely grace should neither hurry too much nor delay too much with the erection of the temple of the Lord. The temple we are speaking of is not a stone or wooden temple, but the multitude and community of living people, your princely grace's land and honest, poor people, since Paul also says: "You are the temple of God." Such a temple is cleansed and built to the praise and honor of God with the word of truth, with just judgment and unadulterated righteousness. Therefore, the pious kings of Judah, David, Hezekiah, Jehoshaphat, and Josiah, at the beginning and most importantly, when it was appropriate, provided their kingdom, which was entrusted to them by God to govern, with God's word and good judgment and law. Of the pious and honest king Jehoshaphat, the biblical chronicler writes in the second book of Chronicles in the 17th chapter [2-10]: "Jehoshaphat placed an army in all the fortified cities of Judah and appointed officials in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim, which his father Asa had won. And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, for he walked in the former ways of his father David and did not seek Baalim, that is, foreign gods and idols, but the God of his father and walked in His commandments. Therefore, the Lord established the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah gave Jehoshaphat gifts, and he had much honor and wealth. And when his heart was encouraged in the ways of the Lord, he removed all kinds of idolatry. And in the third year of his reign, he sent his princes to teach in the cities, and with them the Levites and priests, who taught in Judah and had the book of the law of the Lord with them and went around in all the cities of Judah and taught the people. And the fear of the Lord came upon all the kingdoms in the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not fight against Jehoshaphat."</p>
      <p>Here your princely grace sees how the pious prince Jehoshaphat built up the temple of God, what honor and praise he thereby attained, what reformation he accomplished, and how he provided his people with good laws and the word of truth above all else. From this, your princely grace learns in the same way to provide God's people, who are entrusted to your princely grace by God, with the word of truth, that is, with the teaching of both testaments, through such a priesthood that is godly, pious, truthful, learned, gifted, modest, earnest, faithful, brave, honest, discreet, peaceful, and prudent, who are not inclined to arrogance, to boast with the teaching, to quarrel, to incite rebellion or sects, or to serve the world, or to strive to accumulate goods and money, but are inclined to plant God's honor, peace, tranquility, discipline, and all good, obedience, and piety. For where such people are appointed to teach, who, without temptation, look only to God's honor, the love and faithfulness of the Lord Jesus, common discipline and well-being, and eternal reward, and who earnestly, yet kindly, urge with the truth and power of the suffering and powerful resurrection of Jesus Christ, so that everyone can see that it is the fundamental eternal truth, your princely grace will see how easily the abuses, which have crept in over time through the carelessness and misunderstanding of the learned, will be removed and the ancient, better, and more divine will be restored. For our teaching, which we preach as the gospel of Jesus Christ, is not intended for the destruction, for the disruption of all good customs, orders, and rights, as is said of us, nor is it inclined to overthrow the holy sacraments, to overpower God's word, to incite the common man against the monasteries and authorities, or to abolish good arts, your princely grace should undoubtedly believe, but it is truly intended for improvement, namely that everything that is misused in the church of God is rightly used, that the false is removed and the good retained, likewise where something bad is removed, something better is put in its place. And that in all this not our own opinion, but the holy biblical scripture is the judge, I could now prove with several examples, for which this time is too short, if time and leisure allowed, yes, if your princely grace did not already have faith and understanding in the gospel of Christ from the praiseworthy memory of Huldrych Zwingli, my predecessor, in the teaching of Christ, so long and widely renowned, that I do not think it necessary to prove it.</p>
      <p>The other part, however, by which the people of God are well and to God's honor built up with the benefit and praise of the prince, is good judgment and law. Therefore, it is written again in the aforementioned Chronicles in the 18th chapter about Jehoshaphat: "And he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to the Lord, the God of their fathers. And he appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, in each city several, and said to the judges: See what you are doing, for you are not holding the judgment of men, but of God, and He is with you in the judgment. Therefore, let the fear of the Lord be upon you and be careful and do it, for with the Lord our God there is no injustice nor partiality. He also does not take bribes" etc. [2Chr 19:4-7]. Thus, your princely grace should now also do this good for the poor people, that rulers, superiors, bailiffs, judges, and officials are appointed who love God and value His word, who are devoted to all discipline, peace, and piety, who hate evil scoundrels, despisers of God, blasphemers, violent and wild unclean people, who love the pious, peaceful, godly, who are friendly to the good and cruel to the evil, who adhere firmly to good laws, judge the poor and the rich alike, according to the nature of the case, not out of regard for persons or the influence of gifts, who also do not make your princely grace hated by the people with their disorder, but who are completely honest, faithful, and pious to God, to your princely grace, and to the whole community. For with earnestness and faithfulness, with judgment and justice, a people is thus won. God Himself will also be moved in such a way to stand by such a pious prince with His grace, that He will not be moved for eternity according to the promise and saying of the 72nd Psalm.</p>
      <p>All this your princely grace should earnestly consider and take to heart, not regard the insignificance of the one who writes this, but the immortal truth, which truly preserves all who trust in it and build upon it; undoubtedly, if your princely grace earnestly undertakes to build the temple of God in the manner mentioned, God, the eternal and true, will establish your kingdom, and (even if) He troubles it with various trials, He will nevertheless bring it to a happy end, so that not only your princely grace will come to great fame from misery, but also the honor and praise will be given to you, that you, together with the Christian and Thuringian prince of Hesse, my most gracious lord, in these dangerous and evil times have set up the light of truth and common justice by God's providence in German lands. Such confidence in your princely grace is held by all God-loving people among us, also earnestly praying that God, the merciful, may guide the way of both princes, so that we may not be put to shame before Him in our hope, that your princely grace may not exalt itself too much in victory, but always remain in humility in earnest calling to God and in the fear of God, so that God's name may be praised, the true faith promoted, and your princely grace may attain rightful peace and due praise among many, now and among our descendants. May your princely grace accept me as a particularly favorable and tireless servant, wherever I may be of use.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, on the 4th day of July in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Your princely grace's humble and entirely willing</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious high-born prince and lord, Lord Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg and Teck, Count of Mömpelgard, his princely grace.</p>
