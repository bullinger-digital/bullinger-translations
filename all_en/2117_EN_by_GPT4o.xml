      <p>Greetings. Since we do not usually delay the bundles of letters or couriers who come from Rome or Venice, whether they travel by day or by night, I will be brief, and as soon as possible through this Rizzio, to whom, incidentally, your Galitius is entirely devoted; and I do not wish to add more, so I did not want anything to be said in my name on that matter. That part of your letters most aptly reminded me of what I should hope for from each one: "And yet in me," you say, "more trust will be placed by you than in those whom you think are very much obliged to you," but if it will be possible through Rizzio, I will respond to the letters in such a way that you will also learn something about my innermost feelings. As your letters show you to be a fortunate and rare kind of man, so they should not deprive others of every opportunity for some praise. Meanwhile, remember what St. Paul calls λογεῖας εἰς τοὺς ἁγίους, and not all men hope for some reward from what they do generously. - There is nothing new from Italy. When there is something, even in the greatest occupations, I will inform you, but always with this note added, that unless I am at leisure, I will dictate nothing and will briefly indicate the main points by my own hand. From rumor, you will later learn more fully. Farewell, most esteemed man. Chur, 13th day before the calends of January.</p>
      <p>Your John Du Fraisse, Bishop of Bayonne. To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, dearest friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
