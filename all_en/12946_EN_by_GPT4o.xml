    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] To the most divine man, the highly learned Heinrich Bullinger, Justus Vulteius (Will) sends his greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Learned man, nothing more terrible could happen to me than to lose goodwill, especially that of God, but also that of righteous people. When I now see that I am not only being slandered as a rogue by you, best man, but also being labeled as someone who leads others to the worst things, it makes me extremely angry. How could anyone not be upset about such lies? Such slander truly goes beyond all measure! The sciences appropriate to a noble man - to start with that - have always been close to my heart; not even my parents could tear me away from them, although they wanted to. I do not say this because I know for sure that you truly have such a bad opinion of us, but because I have only heard that you harbor a suspicion against us. For a decent young man must, on the one hand, use great zeal for the good, but at the same time also remove things that harm his reputation. And a suspicion based on untruths always stands in the way of reputation. Therefore, I considered it indispensable to write this defense. Indispensable is, in any case, what is useful. And will this defense not bring benefit to both of us, to you as well as to me? To you, because it will free you from your suspicion and ensure that you think nothing untrue about us, and to me, because it will secure your goodwill for me again after all the suspicions and will reveal that the slanders brought forward by the enemies are unfounded.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] I do not deny that I have already been guilty of many transgressions in my life. But you know very well that this is also the case with all the people around me, so that no accusation should be made against me because of these generally widespread transgressions. Thus, it would be urgently necessary that some of the bad actions I have committed are particularly serious. But what am I accused of? I believe I am accused of having indulged in drinking bouts and feasts. But no one should even think that of me, after all, I did not taste wine until my fifteenth year, but drank only water and the like for such a long time. I know the misfortunes resulting from drunkenness: people are beaten by their drinking companions, imprisoned, fall victim to murder, or are robbed of their possessions, so I understandably abhor drinking. Should there be anyone who has observed something else in me, I will immediately admit to deserving the worst punishments, but if not, then I naturally do not take responsibility for such things. He should also consider the following, which I wanted to make clear to you before: Immoderation in drinking wine is probably the cause of all other offenses. Cicero also says: "No one dances unless he is drunk." We mostly commit bad deeds with a clouded mind. Effeminate and brainless men like Attis neglect the gift of speech and reason.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] In the following, I will justify myself for other things. Perhaps I am still too hesitant in dedicating myself to honorable studies and waste what should have been concentrated on the sciences on pleasures. So today the exact opposite of my former efforts is happening? For until now, I have always been praised by my teachers for my almost excessive academic diligence. You will not interpret this statement as boasting, but attribute it to my predicament. For I see myself forced to say this now, after being confronted with such a serious accusation. If you wish, ask my table companions and the people who are most often with me. They have always known. But if some people envy me and have accused me out of envy, I ask you to introduce me to these informers so that I can hear them face to face and defend myself. I really sleep until the sixth hour in the morning - or I am completely exhausted and not receptive. Partly I do this, but partly not. I do not lie in deep sleep all the time. Sometimes I memorize Herodian's historical work while lying on the bed, sometimes other works of this kind. But sometimes I also sleep properly. I say this briefly and succinctly, for I do not deny what I have done. Before I end this letter, I would like to add one more thing: Perhaps you believe that we sing inappropriate songs in the evening. I assure you, I am not guilty of that, except that I have sung two or three psalms, but even those only with a gentle voice, not so loud that anyone outside could hear it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] These are the accusations I wanted to defend myself against. I wish from you that you take note of this letter with goodwill and do not become angry. It was necessary to act in this way as long as it was still possible to timely refute the slanders of the enemies. But I am extremely grateful to you for taking such care of all those who live with us. I would have been even more pleased if you had also informed me and my brother of what we are now being accused of. For we do not believe that we are less well-educated than the others. We want to respect and honor our teachers and superiors in a similar way as the others do. Farewell and take care.</p>
