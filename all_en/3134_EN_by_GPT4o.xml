      <p>S. D. There was otherwise nothing to write about the common cause: since I hear that the most honorable council will write everything to your people. It is not unjustly regrettable that our people have been able to achieve so little with B. so far, even though they have tried everything. However, undoubtedly more prosperous times will come, and the Lord will grant, if He wills, the opportunity for you to reunite more abundantly.</p>
      <p>But if it seems otherwise to them, what can we do but pray: Thy will be done? I hope the Lord will not fail us/you anywhere.</p>
      <p>Regarding my arrival, I do not know what will happen, as I am not in very firm health and various matters overwhelm me daily, and countless troubles vex me. Others may come if they can. But however that matter stands, I fear, not without slight reasons, that this meeting will not proceed with great benefit, as he thinks. There will be danger from the journey. There are also many other inconveniences. And if what is written from Germany is true, a colloquium will be held in Regensburg next September: in which Philipp will be among the first to be involved. Nor do I know with what utility they will converse, since they are prescribed an impious matter, to reconcile religions fighting among themselves, and to attempt to harmonize papism and the gospel. I greatly fear that some, weary of the truth, are seeking ways to return to papism, or at least to obtain a gospel and religion for which they will receive no inconvenience. But God sees everything. I see that everything in Germany is torn and scattered, and all the sermons of the preachers are directed against the sacramentarians, as if there is nothing else they have to do. Different news is brought from Italy, now the army is advancing, soon there will be talks of peace. May the Lord have mercy on us and keep us. Farewell forever. Greet the fellow ministers. All of ours greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 24, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful minister of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
