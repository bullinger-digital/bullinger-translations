    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich is pleased that Bullinger and his colleagues are doing well. He himself and his own are, in misfortune, thanks to trust in God, like the lamb among wolves.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">He affirms what Bullinger had written in his last letter [not received] in secret code. Those who continue to doubt it will fare badly. Furthermore, one must not challenge God. Missed opportunities do not present themselves again so quickly. There has been so much hesitation!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Those whom Bullinger mentioned only talk. [The city of] Brunswick is reconciled [with Emperor Charles V]. However, the conditions imposed on them are not fulfillable!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Frölich has heard nothing about a change of the episcopal residence [from Dillingen back to Augsburg] and does not believe in it. [The Germans] have already submitted and [the Swiss Confederates] will follow.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Charles V has disclosed the opinion of Pope Paul III on the continuation of the Council of Trent. It is clear to every wise person that nothing more is to be expected from this council. The Pope even demanded the return of [the Emperor's] occupied Piacenza. Therefore, the Emperor decided as a transitional arrangement [Interim] to establish a church order that would be binding until a council and a general reform take place. Whatever regulations the Emperor decides upon, they will be unavoidable and fatal for those who violate them. This will be a difficult undertaking! May the Kingdom of God come soon and the time [of tribulation] be shortened!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is of great pleasure to me that you and the other pious men of your region are well. I, in these calamities and pressures, moderately fare well with my own, thanks to trust in the Lord, yet like a lamb among wolves.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The things you wrote in more obscure letters are certainly more certain, and if anyone doubts longer, they will experience their own harm. Furthermore, as it is pious to trust in God, so it is impious to tempt God. And since opportunity is bald, it easily slips from the hands. Indeed, there has been enough delay.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Those whom you name only give words. Brunswick is reconciled, but only to the extent that they have satisfied the imposed conditions. However, the conditions are impossible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have heard nothing about the change of episcopal residences, nor do I believe the matter stands so. We have already donned servitude. Therefore, you will follow.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Imperial Majesty has declared the Pope's mind on holding the Council of Trent, namely in this manner, that there is no hope for that council among the wiser. Indeed, the Pope boldly demands the return of occupied Piacenza, etc. Therefore, the Emperor consults on drafting a formula according to which life in the churches will be conducted until a council is held and a universal reformation is made. Whatever the Emperor decides in this way in faith, the laws will be Socratic and capital for transgressors. Here will be the work, here will be the labor. We pray that the kingdom of God may come soon and the days be shortened.</p>

      <p>Farewell, my most distinguished man, and you will greet yours, to whom I diligently commend myself, from the heart. January 18, 1548.</p>
      <p>Laetus.</p>
