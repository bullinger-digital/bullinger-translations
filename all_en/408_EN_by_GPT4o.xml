      <p>Greetings in the Lord. It is surprising that you have not written to Gast or sent anything this entire year; I willingly attribute this to your occupations.</p>
      <p>Brentius, called by Duke Christoph of Württemberg and taken away by him, was recently with us. The Duke wants to keep him in a certain fortress until the Lord grants more favorable times to the church, and he can conveniently attend to his studies in those places. The pious man is affected by sadness due to the death of his wife, who left him six children, whom he has given to relatives to be raised. He has one son, six years old, whom he will call to himself and whom the Duke will endow with an ecclesiastical benefice; for he is compelled to receive all the priests in Montbéliard who have so far been hiding in Besançon and are now encouraged by imperial letters to reclaim all their possessions.</p>
      <p>The prince does not dare to refuse but promises everything that the papists want and ask for. Strasbourg still conducts itself bravely. We now see what a plague the gathering of merchants is in the cities; they are the reason why the gospel of Christ is erased everywhere, the pious are proscribed, and they are forced to bear the cross. In Augsburg, the Emperor inquires about all hidden treasures in the tribes, which they are compelled to give to the Emperor; thus, these people have brought damage upon themselves, deserving a crueler punishment and a more severe scourge. The Emperor has fined Margrave Ernest of Baden, a prince, with a huge sum of money, even though he is a very good friend of the Emperor.</p>
      <p>He has deposed the preacher of Pforzheim from office and still wants to proscribe and consider a pious man. The people of Colmar are compelled to give the Emperor 14,000 florins, Sélestat 12,000 florins, and other cities and abbots will also give a huge sum of money. He is trying to plot something either against us or against the Saxon cities, which still stand by the gospel and are very strong and unmoved by any terror. Lord Bürens died of drunkenness; thus, the enemies of Christ perish most miserably.</p>
      <p>Duke Henry of Brunswick does the same, and his son has no Germans at court, but Spaniards and Italians, followed by the young bishop of Augsburg. Thus, they want to compel the pride and arrogance of the Germans under the yoke.</p>
      <p>Some in Constance said to the Franciscan temple, for two came there seeking altars, etc.: "You are, God is witness, the most terrible plague."</p>
      <p>The monks were indignant, complaining to Captain Polweiler, who laughed, asking if it was really so. The Bishop of Würzburg was with the Palatine in Heidelberg with 60 horsemen; the Palatine lifted the son from baptism. Various rumors are spread about this boy, whose he is, which I do not want to write nor is it safe.</p>
      <p>In Burgundy, they beheaded a pious man who had been in Montbéliard for 20 years; he was once a priest, taught to shine lanterns, as he had traveled back and forth. They asked him about the mass and eating meat; he said in few words, the mass is not held as Christ instituted it; much has been added to it. He also said about eating meat, that it is not forbidden by God, but by men; one may eat it without sin if they wish. Then they attacked him, asked who he was, from where. Therefore, he was beheaded, as he did not want to recant, did not want to accept an ecclesiastical benefice, and did not want to sacrifice. He was a pious and steadfast man until his last breath. Priests and monks surrounded him with their admonitions, but they could achieve nothing; otherwise, he would have been freed. Farewell. January 20, 1549. Greet in my name D. Pellicanus, Theodor, Rudolf, etc.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned master Heinrich Bullinger, priest in Zurich, my dear, gracious lord. Zurich.</p>
