    <p xml:id="regest1">The pastor of Tegerfelden, Johannes Winzürn, had to leave his position. Rümeli fears that the same will happen to him, as the Catholics have already taken action against him. The Reformers are being pressured to attend Mass and are suffering under the high taxes imposed by the canons. Request for advice and assistance.</p>

      <p>I pray for an increase in the knowledge of God for you.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, you have well understood how it went with my fellow brother from Tegerfelden. He ultimately had to leave his position with great sorrow, although, as I hear from the well-meaning, they received great grief at his departure, as they reluctantly let him go, since they can recognize that this happened more out of imposition than out of guilt. The same or much worse could happen to me overnight, as I have already understood through some well-meaning people that three articles have been recorded against me. Among them is one stating that I said God is no longer physically with us on earth, although I have explained the words of Acts 1:11, spoken by the angels, regarding the humanity of Christ according to the capacity of faith, with reference to other scriptures in John 14:16, 17, etc. Now you know well that our answers are of no value, except for the spiritual writings, etc. It also oppresses me, dear Master Heinrich, that I must see and endure without any contradiction that many of our weak ones are being led astray by erroneous, unfounded teachings and are being most of all turned away from our adversaries and the authorities to the Mass, which is an abomination to them in their hearts, as they say. And thirdly, it is a great burden to my subjects that they must give so much of their goods, as they estimate a third of their possessions, to the canons, and yet a preacher must also feed himself, as I have had to endure for a time with eating and drinking, not using my freedom according to the indication of the scriptures. I am at home, but my situation is very poorly arranged, as you can well imagine. In all this, my request to you is that you would better understand my need and situation yourself and inquire from Herr Hansen, my fellow brother, to be helpful and advisory to me, so that I may be considered by my gracious lords, whether I must or might stay there, and that my reasonable necessities would also be provided by the canons, along with compensation. But I am greatly concerned that I may not be able to stay there, so overwhelming is the imposition of the adversaries and enemies of Christ. Dear Master Heinrich, I ask you to write back to me how I should conduct myself in such great dangers.</p>
      <p>May Christ live in you.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurzach, June 1st.</p>
      <p>Peter Rümeli.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, pious Master Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord and father.</p>
