    <p xml:id="regest1">Hospinian thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received] and for the [“Orthodoxa Tiguriane Ecclesiae... confessio”] against Luther's [“Kurtz bekentnis”]. Due to lack of time, he has only been able to read the [Zürich] writing superficially so far, but admires its moderation. [Luther's] impudent writing has greatly offended him. He must have been possessed by hordes of demons. However, it is possible that his writing is the result of too much beer drinking and the hearty Saxon dishes. It is an example of arrogance and intemperance; the response of the people of Zürich is an example of kindness and moderation. Offended by Luther's impudence, many are running over to [the people of Zürich]. This should be a cause for joy. It is regrettable that no agreement is possible over the small word [“est”]! - Hospinian wants to live and die with the [Zürich] church. He suffers from the fact that [in Basel] they did not stand up for [Johannes] Oekolampad against [Luther]. A French friend [...] shared with him a French letter, translated into German, from an unknown person to Luther, in which the latter is reproached for his booklet. Hospinian has copied the letter, which would certainly amuse the people of Zürich. - Greetings to Kaspar [Megander], [Theodor] Bibliander, [Konrad] Pellikan, Erasmus [Schmid], [Rudolf] Gwalther, to the other brothers and the family.</p>

      <p>Greetings through Christ.</p>
      <p>I received your letters along with the Response to Dr. Luther's invective, most esteemed Dr. Bullinger, for which I give you great thanks and hold you in high regard, intending to reciprocate whenever the opportunity arises. For you could not have gifted me with a more pleasing gift. As for your Response (which I have read, but only superficially, as my duties have not yet allowed me to examine it more thoroughly), I cannot sufficiently admire the moderation of your spirits. For in the meantime, I have been provided with a copy of that impudent and more than scurrilous writing (if indeed such grave slander does not demand harsher words), and I am gravely offended by it. Is the spirit of Christ or Belial a jester, a slanderer, a blasphemer? Therefore, I believe he was possessed by a legion of demons when he spewed forth these unclean, filthy, foul, disgraceful, and impious things, although I would rather interpret it as the effects of beer, which he (as I hear) is accustomed to imbibe frequently. For, speaking naturally, just as this drink is thick, so it produces thick spirits, especially if richer foods are added, such as almost all Saxon dishes. There is also the man's own corpulence, whom they say is quite obese.</p>
      <p>Therefore, what wonder is it if, as he is and as he delights in, he also produces such offspring? But I return to you; for just as Luther's petition was a singular example of arrogance and lust, so your Response will be one of goodness and moderation. And indeed, all the pious ought to give thanks to God, who has so tempered the movements of your spirits with the spirit of His Son, as we all see. For it is beyond human strength to bear such atrocious slanders so temperately, that you do not respond with slander. But many, believe me, who previously subscribed to Luther, offended by his insolence and delighted by your modesty, will defect from him to you. Therefore, we should not grieve because he has raged and continues to rage against us, but, as Christ our teacher has taught us, rather rejoice and exult. For besides the fact that our reward will be great in heaven, it will also result in a great benefit to our church, bringing it immense growth. It is to be lamented and sighed over that, although both we and he profess Christ the Lord, we cannot agree on a single word, and that such a one, on which the hinge of salvation does not turn. Therefore, the Lord must be entreated with constant prayers to break the obstinate hearts of the adversaries and to restrain and humble their proud and arrogant spirits. For no other author of this discord seems to be than a haughty and stubborn spirit.</p>
      <p>I will live with your church, which I believe to be no mean member of Christ, as long as it pleases the Lord, and I will die; only recognize me as a brother.</p>
      <p>It troubles me that our people either did not stand with you or separately for the most holy man Dr. Oekolampad against that reviler; for this, unless I am mistaken in judgment, both charity and faith demanded. A certain Frenchman, a good friend, shared with me a letter from an anonymous (unnamed) brother to Luther, written in French but translated into our language, in which he reproaches Luther openly for that infamous booklet; although I have copied it, for certain reasons I have shown it to few yet. If nothing of the sort has been brought to you so far, let me know; I will send it to you as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>For I think you will derive some pleasure from it. Farewell in Christ and love me.</p>
      <p>From our museum, on the 4th day before the Ides of April in the year of the Lord's incarnation 1545. In my words, please convey my greetings to Dr. Megander, Bibliander, Pellican, Erasmus, Gwalther, and the other brothers, along with your entire family.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Hospinian.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant Archbishop of the Church of Zürich, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
