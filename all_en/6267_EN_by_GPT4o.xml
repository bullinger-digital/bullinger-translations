      <p>Greetings. Nicolaus Strasser of Zurich, pastor of the church of Christ in Güttingen, presented a question to the brothers, the ministers of St. Gallen, about being recalled again, which was established from the beginning when he was already appointed pastor of the church in Güttingen and was not entirely approved by some, namely that he had not been examined either in Zurich or in St. Gallen; a public mandate exists that no one should be accepted unless examined. Therefore, to satisfy everyone and remove any occasion for alienation and slander, he requested to be examined at our next synod, since the church of Güttingen looks to the St. Gallen synod. He was therefore examined by the presidents of our synod and responded to the questions so piously and learnedly that we finally judged him suitable for our synodal fellowship and the sacred ministry due to his honest conduct.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, we commended him to the church of Güttingen in this name through certain messengers of the synod. Thus, the church was at peace, and no pious person had anything about which they could rightly complain. Now, the priest of that place, moved by reasons which you will learn more fully from Mr. Nicolaus in person, began to be entirely focused on having this pastor rejected and another, whom he had appointed for his own benefit, substituted. But after daring to accomplish many things, he could achieve nothing, and finally, he insinuated into the ears of some to undermine the authority of our synod and simultaneously the reputation of the pastor, that such a preacher presides over them, whom neither they could have nor hear, since he had not been examined in Zurich.</p>
      <p>This fabrication still pleases some of that church, to whom this good man began to seem unworthy, especially because he conducts himself soberly within his own walls and does not indulge in drinking bouts as some do.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he requests that our examination be considered valid, so that he may have something with which to refute his adversary, which we cannot provide him; although we desire to preserve the authority of our examination, the judgment belongs to others. Therefore, in this matter, it will be yours to decide what seems most advisable, and we ask nothing else from your kindness, most illustrious man, than that our testimony be communicated to the presidents of your examination through you. Farewell in the Lord, venerable father.</p>
      <p>We wish the pastors, fellow ministers, and all teachers the best of health. St. Gallen, September 6.</p>
      <p>The pastors and ministers of the church of St. Gallen, most observant of your paternity. Furthermore, venerable father, we have received through our Liner your writings on Repetition. Fortmüller and Joshua, his son, have therefore enjoined me to give the greatest thanks in their name for your great gift.</p>
      <p>I therefore give immortal thanks for your most holy vigils; for we see the manifold reading, vigilance, and tireless zeal for asserting the truth.</p>
      <p>Everything is delivered so clearly and perspicuously that nothing remains perplexing to the studious reader. Whoever, therefore, continues to err in heaven and earth and to mix them up, and to obscure the mystery and hope of the eternal mediator and priest and the resurrection of our flesh, let him see to it himself. May Christ the Lord, the Son of God and man, preserve you safe for us.</p>
      <p>Regarding the works and fragments of Vadianus, since I must now hurry, I do not have time to write; later, if possible. We also commend our church to you in prayers to God; for the pestilence, about which you recently wrote to me, seems to be manifesting itself among us today in some places; but we must see what will happen.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that we, repenting, may turn to Him with true faith and piety, so that we may be found ready at any moment according to His will!</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most illustrious Antistes of the city of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
