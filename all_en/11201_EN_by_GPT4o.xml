      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>My dear Myconius, my boy and indeed my son is coming to you, whom I beseech you to take under your discipline and trust, and to deal with him in all respects as if he were your own. I love him for his mental gifts and integrity of spirit. Therefore, consider whatever you do for him as done for me. Also, in my name, ask Grynaeus to remember in due time what he wrote to me about this boy. If you lend him anything for his necessary uses, I will repay it. He will explain the rest himself.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me. August 12, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Master Oswald Myconius, truly his own.</p>
