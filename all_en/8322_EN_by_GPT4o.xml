      <p>Greetings. I received your letters sent through this messenger; the others, which you mentioned were sent through Küngßfeld, I have not yet seen, as far as I know. However, our steward will be here in the coming days, and he will undoubtedly bring them with him. For several weeks now, I have had no one who could travel to you; otherwise, I would have written something sooner. What I have now, I mostly write to our Gwalther, who will share them with you.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we also had that Gniphaeus with us, who wanted to engage in a public debate with us about the Brentian ubiquity; but we gave him no opportunity. In the meantime, we dealt with him privately and even persuaded him to travel to Geneva, and he left us in such a way that, although we judge him to be a man of disturbed mind, we nevertheless consider him to be either our own or not far from us.</p>
      <p>However, we hope that he will be more fully confirmed in Geneva. He complained greatly that he did not stay longer in Zurich, and he would have left here sooner as well, if we had not kept him back by friendly persuasion. Furthermore, I thank you very much for your kindness, especially for that Heidelberg history; I am returning it to you enclosed here. Here, the golden chains that should have bound public peace have dissolved, as you will learn from what I wrote to Gwalther. Steiger, Manuel, Bernhard Erlach, and many others are intact; but all the others have long sought to break the laws and now, thinking they have found an opportunity, have vented all their bile on us, frustrated in their hopes. I could say more than I dare to write. Such are the turns of events. I truly fear that the Savoyard alliance will be a step for us to ascend even to the French one. May the Lord avert this from us! About the rest, another time, when I am less busy.</p>
      <p>All of ours diligently send their greetings to you; I also pray for the health of all of yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 16, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
