      <p>Greetings. I thank you for those new things from France.</p>
      <p>Hearing the mention of the Augsburg Confession, I will see to it that I act cautiously, so that the wretched do not seize upon it to disturb the matter. In the meantime, I acknowledge that nothing is done rashly or by chance.</p>
      <p>May the Lord, in His eternal wisdom, direct everything to a good end. I have hastily written this letter, and because the messenger is in a hurry, I send it back to you.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us now.</p>
      <p>Farewell. October 7, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Junius.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most sincere Antistes of the people of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed brother.</p>
