      <p>Greetings. I recently received the letters you sent to me, along with those from Mr. Sulcer, for which I thank you greatly and will continue to do so; from them, it is clear to see the faithfulness with which you have acted on my behalf. I have no doubt that your letters of recommendation will be useful for our boy (whom, God willing, you will see there within the next eight days), if not immediately, then at least after some time, when it can be done without inconvenience, as I gather from his letters. We belong to God; He will present the gain, to whom and when He wishes. I also received your earlier letters to me as well as those written to Johannes Travers, along with the booklet of your sermons, which I diligently sent to him, and it was delivered to him with your letters. He continues steadfastly in his undertaking. However, you will perceive more certainly and better the state of his affairs from the letter he sent to me, which I thought it best to send to you. Within a month, the mass was abolished in another community of my Engadin, though not without great contention. The priests here in Chur at their cathedral church fear for themselves because someone told them that I am striving to eradicate and abolish their mass and canons. Certainly, this would not be so difficult to accomplish if only the communities in our League of God's House, which have abolished the mass, were bolder and more vigorously encouraged by the preachers to undertake the matter. For we would be more numerous, especially now with Zutz joining us through Travers. Some hesitate to attempt this because many pensions are given to the canons from the Emperor's regions, fearing that if the mass is abolished, they will no longer be given, even though the canons of the Emperor take what comes from there for themselves. And what? Shall we retain the mass for the sake of pensions? Shall we continue to be impious to have them? - Johannes Angelus Ricius has achieved absolutely nothing here with our people; for all the communities of our Leagues unanimously rejected the articles offered to us by the Emperor through him. I hear that Mr. Baionense is displeased that I wrote to him, as you know, though I wrote nothing except what he publicly proposed to the Leagues, and that at the request of the scribe of our city. But behold, the French think that we are their subjects and should do nothing unless it pleases them as our lords. I will send to Vergerio what he requested when I send my son there to Basel within the next eight days. We hear no news from Italy. Our Bishop of Chur invited almost all the wives of our city's leading citizens to his castle three days ago, and there they danced for almost the entire day. We do indeed protest, but with a restrained hand, lest we become less favored by our young ones. Farewell and love us in return.</p>
      <p>Pontasella and Father Comander greet you. From Chur, January 16, 1554.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a lord and brother most worthy of being honored by all good people.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
