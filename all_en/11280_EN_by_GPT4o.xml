    <p xml:id="regest1">R端mlang does not need to compensate Sebastian [Meyer], as Froschauer will satisfy him; Meyer's concern that Luther might take offense [at the preface to the commentary on the Apocalypse] is unfounded, because if the Concord were to forbid criticism of a fallible human, it would be untenable anyway. Can only imagine a publication of the [First] Helvetic Confession with the consent [of the involved places]. Gifts him and Peter Cyro his new book "De origine erroris" and asks for an assessment. Points out the [newly published] Bible translation by M端nster, for which he has written an introduction. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>It is not necessary, my dear Eberhard, for you to pay anything to Doctor Sebastian; Froschauer will satisfy him. When I mentioned to him what you had written, he said he would satisfy the man. Do not be concerned about other matters. In the meantime, your modesty knows how to forgive an old man something. It is in vain that he fears offending Luther. For truth will be valued more by a theologian than Luther. It is not unknown to anyone how rashly Luther has pronounced on certain books of the Holy Scripture. I do not see what Doctor Sebastian has done wrong. If the conditions of concord are such that no one can open their mouth for the truth against Luther, since Luther is a man, not a god, then let the conditions of concord perish.</p>
      <p>I acknowledge that Luther is a man who can both be mistaken and deceive, who should be admonished and recalled from error. I do not approve of those who intend to fabricate a new treasure chest of the heart from him for us.</p>
      <p>Whether the confession of the Swiss churches can be published, I do not know. However, I would wish it to be published with the common consent of all, and perhaps it will be done in its own time and place.</p>
      <p>You see what I have written this winter: two books On the Origin of Error. I wrote them not without sweat and great labor. Perhaps some will not approve of them. But I have written the truth fearlessly, and with God's help, I will defend the truth to the end. I give you this copy with the condition that you share this gift with the most illustrious man, Peter Cyro, the scribe of your renowned city. And I pray to the Lord that he may make the minds, otherwise united, even more united by this common gift. You will greet the man for me and offer him my respects. For I love the candor and illustrious learning of the man. I await your judgment on my book.</p>
      <p>You may have seen the Latin Bible from M端nster's translation from the Hebrew truth, to which I have prefixed an exposition on all the books of the Holy Scripture and their dignity and excellence. I have strived with all diligence in it to commend the study of the Holy Scriptures to all.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dear Eberhard, and expect from me what you would from a brother. March 8, 1539.</p>
      <p>Greet for me the preacher brothers Erasmus, Sebastian, Conzen, etc.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the noble and learned man Eberhard von R端mlang, scribe of Bern, sincere friend. To the treasurer in Bern.</p>
