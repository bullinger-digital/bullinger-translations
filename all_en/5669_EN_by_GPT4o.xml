      <p>Greetings. I received your letters (reverend father in Christ) quite timely, and today I took great delight in them. I also noted what I deemed worthy of publication. I will inquire about session 6, and if it is in my notes, I will send it. The cause of the Pellizari family is worthy of good advocacy. We certainly do not abandon the cause. All the letters that were written to Milan and to the marquis and president have already been written by me for the third time. But the authority of the Zurich senate would greatly benefit the cause if it intervened seriously; for there are those who hesitate and now procrastinate, so that it is to be feared that the decree of the lords will not take effect. This loss now, although it is great, is not of such importance; but it is a bad example. What if the Venetians attempted the same at the instigation of the pope? Maximilian also wrote (which you will be surprised by) to the Rhaetians and recommended the cause; he also wrote to Mr. de Rozins, who opposes it, separately. The best form is dictated by Mr. Calvin. If you have not yet persuaded your people, you can persuade them thus: "Balingketus has given up his iron trade, will again transport goods of these lords and others through Zurich; brings a large toll. But if the priests' outrage had a precedent, his enterprise might have no precedent, etc." If letters are to be written, they should not be directed only to the people of Chur, but to the senate of the Three Leagues; however, they are sent to the consul of Chur, who opens them first, etc. I have learned about the death of that good old man. I have nothing to write; for I do not wish to be accused of ambition, having entrusted myself and all my affairs to the Lord. Now I do the same. You know the state of my affairs, how much expense I have incurred while I am here, how much hope there is in such a great confusion of all things. I have six hundred things that torment me, which I nevertheless keep to myself, lest I seem querulous. If you, if the lords of the magistracy wish to have any regard for their promise and my service, you will do of your own accord what I trust you will do. If it seems different to you, let the will of the Lord be done, whom I am ready to follow wherever he calls. But I pursue the smallest things and willingly yield to the ambition of others, if there are any. To you, however, my patron, I commend this cause in such a way that I entrust it entirely; if you assist it, you will have conferred a great benefit on me. The most honorable Mr. Consul M체ller, whom I can most appeal to among the living, knows how much hope he alone has given me, and indeed several times. The late Mr. Lavater, of blessed memory, also spoke many times in your presence, my lords, about my services, that my gracious lords would remember my services. Mr. Consul M체ller was present at all these occasions and perhaps should be reminded of it briefly. I write nothing to him for this reason, lest I seem to want to hinder or anticipate a free calling; for what I said, I repeat, I await the calling of God. In the meantime, I know the apostle says that he who desires the office of a bishop desires a good work. If God ever releases me from here, then you will first hear whether I have rightly sought to be freed from here. Now I conceal many things, which I also think should be suppressed; for I ask nothing more than that I may someday depart with good grace, in which I still know I am among all good people. There are hidden tunnels by which I am attacked. No enemy of the gospel has attacked me with impunity, whom I have not overthrown by the grace of God. So much for this. While I search and examine my notes, I realize I do not have the acts of session 6. I knew I had something about the sacraments; but it is about communion under both kinds. But now it occurs to me that I have it written; if it is what you want, keep it or have it copied. I indeed reserve no copy; but perhaps I will recover it printed elsewhere. Therefore, keep these things, etc. About all other matters, I spoke extensively with the people of Glarus, who were here the day before yesterday, and I hope B채ldius sent everything to you. In the meantime, nothing is certain, except that today Remigius von Schouwenstein told me (which I had also heard elsewhere in passing) that a certain German known to him passed through here, coming from Italy; he was said to have been a standard-bearer, has obtained a captaincy. He told him (Remigius) that he was going to Germany to recruit 500 soldiers under his banner; he was to lead them to Corsica. There they would also need the banners that Lazarus Schw채nd takes up, of which (if I am not mistaken) there are about 15. This evening an honorable man told me that he heard from those coming from Trento that the servants there, Italians and Spaniards, had clashed with each other for a long time, for about 2 hours, pushing each other while the Germans and citizens watched, until they had to make peace; 13 were left dead, many wounded. He affirmed this as certain. You confer with others. Farewell, reverend lord father, with all your people, most happily.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 29, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
