      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, dear brother, dated October 19th. By God's grace, I am indeed walking around and carrying out my duties, but I feel a severe weakness throughout my body, which the Lord can also remove if He wills and equip me with proper strength. Meanwhile, matters are multiplying, and age is advancing. However, with the Lord's help and favor, all is well, and I rejoice that I can serve Him to my last breath.</p>
      <p>What is being spread about the Spaniards, if true, is from God to curb the insolence of that most impudent people; if false, it is fabricated by them to embellish their schemes. It is said that 23 companies have marched through the Simmental near Biel and towards Basel, others say they have come to Montbéliard; it is supposed to be a fine, well-equipped French force. Some say Condé has directed them to the Prince of Orange; others say they are waiting at Montbéliard for Duke Wolfgang of Zweibrücken, the Count Palatine, who is supposed to bring 6000 horsemen and 3 regiments of landsknechts to join them and march into France together. I do not know which is true. Duke Wolfgang is certainly in great preparation for Condé. However, some say the French are moving from Basel to the Margraviate, then to the Palatinate and to the army of the Prince of Orange. There, on the other side of the Meuse between Liège and Maastricht, both armies are supposed to be not far from each other. The English are supposed to be at sea with all their might, as one suspects, against the king at Calais, etc. As some Swiss Confederates marched to fulfill the companies in France, the advancing French are said to have come to them from Neuchâtel and have dealt with some, and it is said that Captain Tugginer is also wounded. I do not know if it is so. God be with you. My lords and Bern are insisting with great seriousness that their people stay at home.</p>
      <p>Dated October 22, 1568.</p>
      <p>Greet our friends.</p>
      <p>Yours, always.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
