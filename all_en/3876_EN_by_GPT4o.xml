      <p>S. I am sending you three cheeses from Bressia and Tarct sia.</p>
      <p>I recently replied to your letters.</p>
      <p>You know that the Elector Palatine has passed away, and Frederick of Simmern is to succeed him.</p>
      <p>Things are not yet calm in Denmark nor in Cologne. The Turk made an incursion into Tyrol and captured a certain castle of the emperor.</p>
      <p>I have not yet heard anything about peace.</p>
      <p>I commend my son to you and wish for him to abstain from wine or to drink it very diluted.</p>
      <p>I do not know what progress he has made in his studies. Greet Mr. Martyr and Walter and the friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, the last day of February.</p>
      <p>Yours as you know.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Zurich.</p>
