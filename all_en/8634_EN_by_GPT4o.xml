      <p>Be well, most delightful Bullinger. In March, the notable papist Boxall, secretary to Queen Mary, died at Lambeth. In that same place, before him, one of her counselors, Thirlby, Bishop of Ely, also passed away. Around the end of June, David Whitehead, an octogenarian, a man cultivated in every kind of literature, departed this life in London. Thomas Spencer, Doctor of Sacred Theology and Archdeacon of Chichester, passed away on July 8th. He diligently fulfilled his duty of preaching in my Suffolk. He was with us in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cole, not the one who was in Zürich, but the one whom Mr. Wolfgang Weidner loved so much, Archdeacon of Essex, at the same time departed to the heavens. Both were remarkable craftsmen in preaching.</p>
      <p>For nearly two years, there has been an implacable contention here in Norwich among the strangers, which is not yet settled; but now there is some hope that everything will be in a better and more peaceful state.</p>
      <p>You would hardly believe how many labors I have expended during this whole time (I say nothing of expenses): and yet the obstinate men do not want to yield anything of their right. I have always dealt with them most gently and humanely, but recently more harshly, against my nature. But what can you do? When one thing does not succeed, another way must be attempted. Three of their preachers, indeed ambitious and desirous of a little glory, have caused and continued these disturbances. It was almost to the point that the whole congregation would be dissolved. Their number is about 4,000.</p>
      <p>The English were turbulent in Germany, I admit; but if you compare them to these, they were very quiet. I am certainly not making this up. There were great dissensions among their countrymen, at Sandwich in Kent, and also in London, which are not yet buried, as I hear. In the French church among us, everything is very peaceful.</p>
      <p>They are in number about four hundred.</p>
      <p>In Scotland, true religion flourishes. But the nobles sometimes fight among themselves, not for religion (which almost all favor), but for the custody of the king, to which the chief among them especially aspire. The Queen of Scots is still detained in England.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of St. Andrews, the author of many disturbances in Scotland, was removed from life to the gallows in May.</p>
      <p>The Marquess of Northampton, brother of Queen Catherine, the last wife of Henry VIII and my most gracious lady (to whom I served in the office of preaching twenty-three years ago), passed away around the beginning of August. When I was in London, he married a very beautiful German girl, who remained in the queen's court after the departure of the Marquess of Baden and Cecilia his wife from England. Our marquess was sixty years old and, I believe, much older. Your son Heinrich Butler is well. I wish all the happiest things for your consuls, senators, preachers, citizens, and the entire dominion of Zürich.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name your sons, Heinrich, Rudolf, and the third, whose name I have forgotten, your daughters Veritas and Dorothea, Simler, Lavater, Zwingli, your sons-in-law, Wolf, Haller, Wick, Froschauer, Julius, Johann Heinrich Fabricius, and all the others. My ailing wife greets you, yours, and all.</p>
      <p>Hastily from Ludham, August 10, 1571.</p>
      <p>You will learn all other things from Gwalther's letters.</p>
      <p>Yours, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. In Zürich, to Zürich. At Mr. Froschauer's in Frankfurt.</p>
