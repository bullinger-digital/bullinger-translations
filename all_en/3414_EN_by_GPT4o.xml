      <p>Greetings. I intended to write more to you; but I do not have the time now to write about everything.</p>
      <p>I wanted to inform you of this one thing, which I do not doubt you will read and hear with great eagerness, namely that on the past Sunday, by the grace of the Lord, a treaty with the people of Geneva was finally struck and confirmed, not just for certain years, but eternally. May the Lord grant that this leads to the glory of His name and the preservation of the churches and the truth. They themselves rejoice greatly, as do our people, and I hope that henceforth hatred and discord will cease, and that all will embrace each other with mutual love.</p>
      <p>I would have gladly informed you of this sooner, if I could have, so that I might have had you not only as a witness to my joy but also as a participant; but I could not do so sooner. Pray with us to the Lord, that these things may be auspicious and fortunate for us; for nothing has happened to me in a long time that has brought me more joy. These bitter dissensions of those whom the Lord has united not only in place but also in the recognition and confession of His truth have almost worn me out. If there are other things to be written, this will be done at another time; for they are not so necessary.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and rejoice with us together with all the brothers, to whom I send greetings, especially to your wife and family. All of ours send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, 25th of November, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot. In Zürich.</p>
