      <p>Greetings. I am surprised that you are moved by such trifles, which should rather be scorned and considered as nothing, given that your neighbors boast and act insolently.</p>
      <p>For where they have displayed their stratagems is unknown throughout all of France.</p>
      <p>Two banners of Orléans have been placed in the garrison. Some of them, while asleep, were awakened by our men, but without bloodshed.</p>
      <p>Until now, they have sat quietly there, now they are eagerly indulging in grapes, just like hungry thrushes.</p>
      <p>Those who were in the siege of Le Havre were warned by disaster to be cautious and did not advance to the throw of weapons.</p>
      <p>The French, who were bolder, were sharply repulsed, and when they had dug trenches, a great force of water was released by the English to surround them.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a great slaughter was made.</p>
      <p>From that time, the fight was only with cannons until the powder ran out.</p>
      <p>When the English were unaware of this, they were forced to surrender.</p>
      <p>Now it is certain that the war will rekindle.</p>
      <p>For prisoners are held on both sides against the law of nations.</p>
      <p>Behold why your neighbors trumpet their achievements. Our men do not fear the troops that you now warn are being recruited in Lucerne.</p>
      <p>For what if they are armed against the enemies? For the king's council disapproved of soldiers being gathered in Germany at their own expense, and they were strictly forbidden to proceed.</p>
      <p>A wicked conspiracy was also uncovered which will undermine their authority.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the queen is striving with utmost effort for the majority of her son.</p>
      <p>He has barely passed his thirteenth year, yet he declared himself of age in the court of Rouen, and that by the decision of his mother and the nobles, among whom his brother, the Duke of Orléans, a boy of eleven years, is counted first.</p>
      <p>You see to what mockery the ancient splendor of that kingdom has fallen.</p>
      <p>The Parisians reject that decree, and rightly so. For while there are seven supreme courts in France, six were created only for the administration of justice.</p>
      <p>But only the Parisian court was accustomed to deal with matters concerning the entire state of the kingdom.</p>
      <p>Although if anything were done by reason, the three estates should have been called.</p>
      <p>Whatever it may be, the king will be made of age against nature's will, and he will obtain the pardon of age from himself, which the laws teach is in the prince's discretion to grant to others.</p>
      <p>When he has entered the city, it is intended to restrain the madness of the tumultuous people.</p>
      <p>The constable stubbornly defends the edict by which freedom was given to our churches and security was promised, and he thinks it should prevail.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Augsburg Confession, I see no reason why we should be so anxious: for it will be imposed in vain, because none of the papists will accept it, and our people will vigorously reject it.</p>
      <p>However, lest any harm occur from our negligence, we have given and will continue to give our efforts.</p>
      <p>But what about you in the meantime? Your senate, as usual, looks out for itself privately, and thinks that its domain will be safe while all others are lost.</p>
      <p>Forgive me if I speak harshly, because until now it has not given the slightest sign of the concern that the necessity of the times demanded.</p>
      <p>The Bernese certainly complain that in consultations there has never appeared any zeal for public safety.</p>
      <p>Today, if the three prefectures are returned to Savoy, besieged on all sides and far from help, we will be easily overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>For Savoy will not be content with this part, but does not doubt to recover it to improve the condition for waging war.</p>
      <p>Although we are brought to the utmost danger, I do not ask that we be considered, but only that the common danger be taken into account.</p>
      <p>Again, forgive me: until your people act differently, I will believe they are no more affected by our troubles than stumps.</p>
      <p>But God allows us to be forsaken by men, so that we may learn to direct our minds to Him and keep them fixed on Him.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man and my honorable brother. May the Lord keep you safe for a long time, continue to guide you with His spirit, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>I pray for much health to all colleagues. Geneva, September 9, 1563. Your Ionville reverently and sincerely greets you.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
