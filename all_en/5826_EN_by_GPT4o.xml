      <p>The Lord be with you along with our friendly greetings, etc.</p>
      <p>Reverend sir and brother, we write to you briefly and in haste, as our certain message is at hand for you, to inform you that in the parish in Thurgau, named Sumbri, their preacher has been relieved, and the parishioners are in search and selection of another pastor. They have chosen and accepted one who has preached for some time in a parish in the Appenzell region, called Grub, who is part of our chapter and has been recommended by us to Sumbri. He is a native of Zurich, named Mr. Christoffel, etc.</p>
      <p>Now, just yesterday, Sunday, he preached there and assumed he was accepted and confirmed. However, the bailiff of the canons of Constance has arrived and intends shortly to impose someone on the church in Sumbri by force, named Mr. Georg, whom we have excluded from our chapter for many reasons, especially due to his arrogant lifestyle and also partly because we are concerned about his understanding and teaching of our religion, as he is the son of a mass priest, whom we had previously tolerated in hopes of improvement.</p>
      <p>And since this case concerns us and we cannot act against it other than to call upon faithful lords and friends, we have resorted to you, trusting in what you can do, as we willingly and gladly do in such matters, that you may provide your advice and help, and especially, if he might be referred to Zurich for examination, that you may be informed beforehand and handle the matter with more information regarding him.</p>
      <p>You will understand this better in such haste than we can write; for we have just been informed of this matter at this hour.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given on Monday, the 2nd of August.</p>
      <p>We, the servants of the two churches of Christ in St. Gallen, your always willing [servants].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Mr. H. Bullinger, doctor of the church of Zurich, his most respected lord.</p>
