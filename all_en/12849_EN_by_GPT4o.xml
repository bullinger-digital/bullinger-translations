    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] In response to Bullinger's letter [No. 2787] to Ambrosius Blarer, Zwick wrote to Ulm to inquire [about the Swiss delegation].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The people of Konstanz are trying in every possible way to delay a reconciliation [with Emperor Charles V.] for as long as possible. Hans Jakob von Landau wants to advocate for them, as do the Landkomtur Johann Werner von Reischach, Count Friedrich von Fürstenberg, and Wilhelm Truchsess [von Waldburg-Trauchburg]. Even Bishop Johann von Weeze has assured his willingness to help through a messenger. What this means is clear, even if many are still blind to it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Zwick suspects that Sebastian Schertlin will go to Zurich. The Secret Council of Konstanz was warned by a good friend [...] that the Emperor will write regarding Schertlin [and demand his extradition], which would certainly have unpleasant consequences for the city. The council then informed Schertlin about this because they are well-disposed towards him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, is moving with 2000 soldiers towards Augsburg. Also, about 1200 soldiers are supposed to go to Memmingen to take control of the city and plunder it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] There is a rumor that the Emperor has made peace with King Francis I, which is why all the latter's actions [allegedly undertaken in favor of the Schmalkaldic League] are just a deception.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] If the Zurichers were to make a copy of the letter from Ulm addressed to Zwick, they should definitely ensure that the parts from which the identity of the letter writer [Georg Besserer] could be derived are omitted or changed: Such as where the Venetian ambassador [Alvise Mocenigo] is mentioned staying at the letter writer's house, the breaking into his barn by imperial soldiers and the subsequent accommodation of 15 of their horses, or also where Landgrave Philip of Hesse is mentioned; the same applies to the part where the letter writer regrets having been a war councilor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Zwick thinks it would be beneficial if the Zurich Secret Council sent an envoy to the Secret Council of Konstanz with the following message: After the Zurichers learned from the recently appeared envoy from Konstanz [Zwick] and from the letter [from Konstanz to the four Protestant places dated February 1] that the council and citizens of Konstanz fear having to submit to the Emperor (which will result in disadvantages for the Zurichers and the Confederates, for which they already apologize), and accordingly [the four Protestant places] ask for advice and means to avoid a peace treaty with the Emperor, the Zurich Secret Council has decided to send an envoy to Konstanz with the following message: Firstly, that the Zurichers forgive the people of Konstanz if they are forced to take measures that would be unfavorable for the Confederates. Secondly, that regarding the help requested by Konstanz, the Zurichers will consult with their [three] other Confederate allies and communicate the result of the consultation. Thirdly, that the Zurichers want to warn the people of Konstanz that it is heard from all sides how the Emperor is stationing foreign soldiers in the cities [that have submitted to him]; and that this is also imminent for Konstanz. Then the imperial troops will probably do everything to insult the Zurichers and the other Confederates from Konstanz and perhaps even harm them; from which not only a bad neighborhood but also serious consequences will result. The people of Konstanz should consider this so that the good neighborhood continues to exist; for which the Zurichers and the other Confederates also want to advocate.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Such a request to the people of Konstanz could not harm the Zurichers and would hardly anger the other Confederates. Furthermore, this would prompt the Konstanz council to act more cautiously and prudently to avoid a foreign occupation in the city. Additionally, the citizens would be inclined to expect more from this envoy [than is actually the case], and the episcopal authorities around Konstanz would hesitate even more to take action against the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Bullinger should receive this request favorably, as Zwick only wishes good for Zurich and Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] If Zurich and the three other Protestant places should report that they neither know means nor advice on how they could help Konstanz, they should definitely ensure that this remains secret so that no serious consequences arise from it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] If Bullinger gives money to the current messenger [Jörg] Regelin (the same applies to other messengers dispatched by Zwick) in matters that concern the Zurichers more than the people of Konstanz, it should not be given to them as a gift [but as a messenger's fee], because otherwise the self-serving messengers would still demand a fee from Zwick, which would be unjust!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Bullinger should pray for the people of Konstanz, and especially for Zwick, so that he acts according to God's will.</p>

      <p>My willing service to you, dear lord and good friend. In response to your letter to Ambrosius, I have made my acquaintance in Ulm.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Secondly, we intend to delay the reconciliation as long as we can. We are seeking all possible means for this. Herr Hans Jakob von Landau also wants to act on our behalf. Similarly, the Landkomtur, Count Friedrich von Fürstenberg, and Herr Wilhelm Truchsess have offered their support to my lord. The bishop has sent a messenger to us and has shown much goodwill. What all this means is good to consider, but many people are now blind with seeing eyes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I suspect Herr Sebastian Schertlin will come to you. My lord, the secret council, has received a warning from a good friend that he should be aware the Emperor will write to us regarding him. This has been confidentially reported to him, as my lord would not want to shorten anyone's life. He is very dear to my lord. Believe me, they suffer a loss because they would be safe from the Emperor's writing if he stayed here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Duke of Alba is moving with 2000 men towards Augsburg. About 1200 are also supposed to come to Memmingen, so that everything is destroyed and soon taken over.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There are some who think the Emperor has a lasting peace with the French, and whatever the French are doing now is merely for show.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Furthermore, it is my friendly request that if you have the letter from Ulm copied, you ensure that the points from which one could understand and deduce who wrote such a letter are omitted or at least changed, such as where it is written: "I have the Venetian ambassador in my house"; also: "They broke into my barn and placed 15 horses there"; also, what is written about the Landgrave; also where it is written, he wishes he had not been a commissioner, etc. Be cautious in these matters so that no one is harmed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>It seems to me, dear lord, that for many reasons it would be very good if your lords, the secret ones, had sent a messenger here soon, who would not appear before the council but with the secret ones and would have shown such an approximate opinion: After his lords have understood from our messenger, who was recently with them, and then from our letter, that we bear concern that the council and community would have to engage with the Emperor, etc., with a request, if such would be burdensome to his lords and the common Confederates, that they have kindly excused us, likewise, if they know means, advice, or comfort through which we might overcome the treaty, that they would not withhold the same from us, etc., they have instructed him to inform us: Firstly, as far as the excuse is concerned, they would kindly excuse us in all that we would do out of urgent necessity or otherwise justifiable reasons. As for whether they know means or advice, etc., they would speak with their other Confederate allies, to whom we have also written, and then not withhold their mind and opinion from us. Lastly, they hear from all sources that the Emperor is placing foreign troops in all cities. Therefore, they have to consider that if we accept a treaty, troops would undoubtedly also be placed in our city. Now we could assess that such troops would not refrain from burdening their and other Confederates' subjects with insults and perhaps even with deeds inside and outside our city; from which very soon much unfriendly neighborhood and further consequences might follow. Therefore, it would be his lords' request that we consider this well, not forget this friendly reminder, and strive in all actions to ensure that the good neighborhood is not disrupted but maintained, as they, as far as possible, would also like to do, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>This proposal could not harm your lords. The other Confederates might not take it amiss. It would also be a faithful warning. Likewise, my lords might be moved to act more slowly or at least more cautiously so that they are not burdened with foreign troops. Likewise, our citizens, when they see the messenger, would assume it was something much better. The authorities would be less likely to undertake anything burdensome against us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>May you hold this request in good regard. I do it for the best, for your and our good. God knows that.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>If afterwards your lords together with others decide that they neither know means nor advice for our sake, then for God's sake, they should keep it secret so that it does not become public; for much depends on it for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>If you afterwards pay the messenger Regelin or other messengers I send to you for matters that concern your lords more than my lords, do not say that you are honoring them with it, because otherwise they are so self-serving, they will still want to have the fee from me and keep the other for their advantage; which is not fair!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Pray to God for us without ceasing, especially for me, that I act according to His will. Amen. Dated in Konstanz, February 7, 1547. Konrad Zwick, your willing servant.</p>
