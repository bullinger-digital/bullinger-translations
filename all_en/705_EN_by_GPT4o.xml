      <p>S. I received your letter, which you wrote to me through this young man, and it was most pleasing to me, both because you took the time to write back despite being otherwise very busy, and because I again understand the expression of your Christian and sincere spirit towards me. In return, I will strive to do what I consider to be my duty, as much as I can, and it was not, most excellent man, that you should value a small gift so highly, as I see from your letters you do. However, I am certain that you have such wisdom in these matters that you consider the spirit rather than the quality of the given things. I was unaware that Mr. Musculus was the author of the booklet due to the change of name, although I know that Eutychius is derived from [Greek], I would never have connected it to Wolfgang; but however these things are, I judge the man to be both learned and pious and steadfast in Christian truth, and I would wish to come into his friendship for the reasons I have just mentioned. I have most diligently recommended you to my prince, as you requested, although you are already most highly recommended and do not need my help in this matter; however, he asked that if there was anything new, you would inform him.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on my homeland, and nothing more, although I doubt whether the Lord can or will have mercy because of the denial of the truth once known. I fear that in the end, the outcome will be similar to that of the miserable Italian Spiera, etc.</p>
      <p>I received this news these days: The Interim is being quietly tolerated among the Saxons with Charles's connivance; disputes about the matter of religion are arising between the Wittenberg and Leipzig churchmen. Philip is suspected by all because of his gentle nature; who, as he is most eager for the concord of the churches, might perhaps concede certain [Greek] things, to which the others are opposed. These are the schemes of a malignant spirit. They say that the envoys of certain princes will meet at Gitterbach in these places to consult about religion. Furthermore, Charles has allowed the evangelicals and papists in Erfurt to deliberate on the matter of faith. They say he will also move within a month to the borders of the Nemetes, accompanied by 6000 barbarians, perhaps to winter there until he undertakes something new. I leave all these things in the middle. I believe it to be more true because of the state of all things in our time and because I believe that the enemy of Christ will not rest, as someone wrote to me, that three Roman cardinals are following Charles's court, to whom full authority has been granted to reform churches not yet reformed and to inquire about persons suspected of Lutheranism (that is, as they call it, of heretical depravity). Furthermore, I learned from [Greek] of someone, who himself was involved in this occupation, whom I know and do not doubt to be true, that the French have taken several fortified places from the English.</p>
      <p>These are the things that seemed to be worth writing to you, not to weave a history of certain uncertain things, but so that you might understand that many things are also being circulated among us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man, and keep me in your thoughts. In Basel, hastily, October 11, in the year etc. 49.</p>
      <p>Your Michael Maler, doctor.</p>
      <p>Almost forgot, Johannes Cochlaeus, a good Catholic, published two monstrosities: the History of the Hussites and Commentaries on the Acts and Writings of Luther. Oh Lord, how vain, how unlearned, how tasteless, fabricated, and false. I almost fear that the Lord will be angry with me for spending these expenses not on the poor but on patching up such filth. But since it is known to everyone what his nature was like, I also wanted to know.</p>
      <p>May you ensure that this letter is delivered to Ludwig, Count of Oettingen.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, professor of theology among the Zurichers, a lord to be respected and a chief friend. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
