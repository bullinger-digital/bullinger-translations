      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Our students Samuel and Abel have arrived; they brought your letters to me. Two hours before they came, that traveler from Zürich was here, who also delivered other letters from you to me, to which I see nothing to respond now, except that we give you immense thanks for your diligence and kindness towards us, for sending us your Vocabulary as we had requested, and even more so for also sending that very beautiful booklet by Naogeorgus, which, as soon as I looked at it, I did not stop reading until I had read it entirely. We will make an effort to diligently carry out what you prescribe. Mr. Paulus Rasdorfferus himself wrote to us, to whom I am responding on behalf of all of us; I advise that if he wishes to obtain anything, he should come himself. For I see that no one from our side should be summoned; however, few who appear to be sincere should be rejected. Four parishes are now vacant in the countryside, and we have only those two young men, in whom there is still a risk as to whether they can be appointed to such significant positions as neophytes. There are some among us who hate all Swabians worse than a dog or a snake. While I strive to promote and establish good men, which I consider to be useful for the church, I am forced to endure so much and so many things that, unless I could overlook many things, I would have already given up long ago. The diaconate in the city is vacant, as you know; we all admit that there is no one in the entire region who can be suitably appointed to it except for Hochholtzer alone, whom the council refused to call because he had to be requested from Zürich; for they do not want to be a burden to you and seem to be struggling with such a shortage of learned men.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, however, they confess this with abhorrence whenever there is mention of calling a learned and good man, but a foreigner. I would gladly try to tame their minds, made wild by such a long and bitter contention; but while I contemplate this, I seem to irritate them more. For they have become so inflamed against all those in whom even a suspicion of sacramentarian business has lingered, that even about those who have remained untainted by this contagion, yet because they are foreigners or have lived with others, they have lost all right judgment. I hardly see anyone who strives to bring back the erring to a better mind, but immediately condemns all who do not agree with our minds in every way. You advised that I should behave amicably towards Viret and Calvin, which I do, and I think that even piety and Christian charity require this. However, it is certain: if some were to find out that I either wrote to them or they to me, they would have me suspected with them. And this makes it so that I can promote neither my dearest brother Musculus nor anyone else here as I wish.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jodocus is easygoing, and I can easily bring him to my side, although I also wish that he were less unfair to foreigners; otherwise, we get along well. Eberhard similarly; but another of our colleagues (for I can no longer keep silent, although I will tell you alone) hinders all our efforts.</p>
      <p>He resists me in calling learned men, resists in the institution of public prayers, resists in the institution and celebration of the synod. While I was working for Musculus, he was secretly going around to all the senators who were of our party, pouring in how sacramentarian he was, what things he had published against our disputation; now indeed, with changed fortune, he also changes his mind, so that when I later approached them, I seemed to them as if I were eager for new disturbances. Thus, most esteemed father, I stand between the sacred and the stone: on one side, the calamity of the brothers burns me, which I would like to relieve with all my strength; on the other side, the concord of the church urges me, which I try to promote, not disturb again. Meanwhile, as much as the Lord will give, I will act prudently and bravely, so as not to neglect the wretched nor act tumultuously with the brothers; for I give thanks to the Lord, who, as he has always granted me his grace, so he does not withdraw it from me here, so that both sides agree and consent very well in my teaching, and I would not doubt that soon the dissension among the brothers of the entire dominion would be removed, if only suspicions and the memory of old injuries would cease.</p>
      <p>What you write about Blaurer pleases me; I will await your advice. I expect Musculus here, although he can hardly be promoted here; I will try, however, as much as I can. I wish he could meet me in Bruges; for I will set out next week to visit the school; for it has been decreed by the council that I should visit the schools in Bruges, Zofingen, and Thun, hold examinations and reviews as in the city, and transfer those who have made progress in letters to Bern to hear public lectures, and substitute others in their place (for in these places they also have certain stipendiaries) etc. I will leave here on September 17th, so that the examination will take place there on the 19th. Therefore, if Musculus comes to you in the meantime, encourage him to meet me there; if he cannot be provided for here and wishes to go to Zürich, my house will be open to him, and whatever I have. I do not think this will be troublesome to you or Mr. Provost, since it is not only not troublesome to me, but very pleasing, to assist his necessity with all my strength; which I entrust entirely to you, as I have also written several times before. And if only he could stay in Zürich until the end of my vocation; then indeed he could be conveniently and with greater authority substituted for me by the lords of Zürich and Bern.</p>
      <p>Regarding Mr. Naogeorgus, I respond the same as about the others: let him come to me; however, I fear about him that he uses a language too barbarous and Saxon for Swiss ears, especially intolerable and annoying to the Bernese, as you will hear when he comes to you; nevertheless, an effort must be made to provide for such a pious and learned man. Oh, how often I think about what threatens us, since we are such towards such good men!</p>
      <p>May God have mercy on us!</p>
      <p>I have read your letters sent to me three or four times, to see if there was anything to which I had not responded; I found nothing to which, if I remember correctly, I have not responded; therefore, it will be your task, if you wish to have anything more, to inform me; henceforth I will do as you advise, to propose your letters to me. You sent the laws of the Zürich school in time; I give you great thanks. I cannot return them through this messenger; for I am having them copied, which could not yet be done. I will send them to you from Bruges soon.</p>
      <p>The four students we will send to you will come after the next courier; have them recommended. I am sending back to you the letters of Musculus and Naogeorgus; it is incredible how much their calamity afflicts me. I am also sending some excerpts from the letters of certain people, as you will see, from which you will understand what they think. Such things also make ours more bitter. However, I send them on the condition that you send them back to me after they are copied; for I do not have so much leisure to copy them again; nor do I willingly believe they should be copied by others. I have from Zebedee, who, although he thinks well, yet seems to be too much led by emotions and acts out of envy and contention. I have also hastily compiled these things, it will be your task to forgive; for I was not allowed to reread.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jodocus and the other colleagues greet you; Eberhard is no longer in the city. Give greetings from me and my wife to yours and all your family, also to all the most esteemed brothers and colleagues.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 11, 1548.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
