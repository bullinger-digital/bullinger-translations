    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The Zurich authorities wrote today to the Nine Places and the day before yesterday to the Three Places, stating that Emperor Charles V is acting against the freedom of Germany; that the southern German cities must swear not to ally with anyone in the future; that if Constance also submits to such an oath, the Confederates are in danger; that this situation explains why the people of Zurich are armed; that therefore a quick consultation about the future relationship with Constance is necessary. The Diet was convened in Baden for the coming Sunday, January 9. If one supports Constance, then war will come to the Confederation. If Constance is abandoned, the favorable passage possibility is lost, and yet war will later come to the country, for Charles V will not relent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Francisco de Enzinas is thanked for his letter [No. 2736]. Bullinger forwarded his letter to [Hieronymus] Sailer to St. Gallen today. As soon as he receives the book [... by Christoph Froschauer], he will also send it to Sailer. Enzinas should neither worry about the costs nor should he use dishonest carriers!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The content of the present letter is also intended for Enzinas and Johannes Gast. Hopefully, the latter has received the money for the wool through the messenger [Meinrat Oggenfu√ü] sent by the Zurichers yesterday.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Is there any news from France, Saxony, and Denmark? The Swabians have surrendered! But what if the places further north do the same? Then it will come to war [against the Confederates]! Allegedly, Augsburg is excluded from the peace negotiations [with Ulm]. No news has come from there for 14 days. Bullinger fears that Augsburg will also fall. What is heard about Strasbourg?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also to the family, to Enzinas, and to Gast.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Johannes Herwagen will report more, to whom Bullinger has entrusted some things to tell.</p>

      <p>S. D. My lords have written everywhere and especially on the 9th today (since the day before yesterday was the 3rd), how one now perceives more from the Emperor, especially in the peace with the cities, that he is pushing against the freedom of the German lands, to annul them, while he binds them by oath not to ally with anyone in the future, so that the Confederates consider this; and, if Constance is bound by this, what great disadvantage the Confederates will suffer from it; so also, my lords are concerned; that one should consider and deliberate how to deal with Constance; and finally bring a decision now on Sunday to Baden - for on the mentioned Sunday a Diet will take place. There it lies, dear lord and brother: If we take on those from Constance, we are at war; if not, we lose the glorious passage and have the war nonetheless on our neck, for the Spaniard does not relent.</p>

      <p>D. Francisco de Enzinas is thanked for the most friendly letters. I have arranged for the letter addressed to Sailer to be taken to St. Gallen today. As soon as the book is returned, I will ensure in good faith that it is also delivered to Sailer. Do not worry about the costs. Just deal with honest carriers; for it is the most unjust kind of people.</p>

      <p>What I write to you about the unfortunate war and these other matters, communicate to him and to D. Gast. I hope Gast has received the money for the wool through the messenger, who was sent by our lords to yours the day before yesterday.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>What news do you have from France and Saxony? Also Denmark? Up here it is done with the Swabians. If those down there act the same, then it will come to blows! They say the people of Augsburg are excluded from grace and peace. I have received no letters from Augsburg for 14 days. I fear that they too will be overthrown. Let us pray to the Lord, that He may stand by His cause. What about the people of Strasbourg?</p>

      <p>Farewell again with the family, D. Enzinas, Gast, and other good men. January 5, 1547.</p>

      <p>More from D. Herwagen, to whom I have entrusted many things to report. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man D. Oswald Myconius, faithful minister of the renowned church of Basel, lord and brother always to be honored. Basel.</p>
