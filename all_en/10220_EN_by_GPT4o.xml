    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds hurt to Bullinger's accusation; he allegedly accused some people from Zurich of treason. Misunderstanding. He does not want to accuse his friends at all, but he often had to notice that his communications and advice leaked to Lucerne through carelessness, which even brought him threats. He has already written about alliance plans. It is the duty of fellow believers to promote unity among the reformed cities. Some councilors strive for this, but due to internal enemies, who even strengthen their influence in the councils, they can do little. The people of Zurich do nothing against such individuals, which is why their friends withdraw. Myconius wants to advise them, especially Bullinger. Through Otto Werdm√ºller, he did not convey any further accusations, as Bullinger criticized. Why does Bullinger not respond to his concerned questions? Contradictory news from Zurich worries him; Bullinger should not be deceived by the enemies. Myconius does not want to instruct him, but only to support him. Call for unity.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace.</p>
      <p>Would that I had either never written anything about our common affairs, or that everything had turned out better. For not only has such a great number of words vanished into the wind, but I am also not rightly understood by you. Did I write that any of yours had betrayed my words? If I did, it was done unintentionally, as I hold you and Utinger in high regard. Indeed, if I remember correctly, I was careful to avoid anything that might lead you to suspect me. I do not know how it happened otherwise. I said that it often happens that such matters, while being entrusted, are intercepted by the careless and sometimes leak out without considering the damage that can arise from it. Nor did I conceive anything against your people. For suspicion never went so far, it remained with us, not because we communicated anything with those about whom I cannot think well, nor do I believe anything was communicated by mine, but because I know for certain by suspicion that they have betrayed what reached Lucerne. For through them, plans were reproached, not specifically, to incite the people of Zurich, making it more difficult for them to accept what they want, but in general, that I give advice which will eventually rebound on my own head. Therefore, dispel the thought that I have conceived anything sinister against you or those you name. Nothing of the sort will ever enter my mind, even in a dream, due to the honorable opinion I hold of them.</p>
      <p>We wrote about the alliance long ago, I do not know whether to Utinger or to you, that it should be handled by us in such a way that the matter would not be harmed. I thought, however, that there were still some who would be grateful for good advice, whoever gave it. Even if they are not found, it does not seem to us that we should remain silent out of conscience, unless we saw certain danger arising for us. Is it not our duty to counsel for concord, especially in such great dangers, where it is clear to everyone that the harm that befalls one affects all? They are indeed cruel who prefer harm to the friendship of an enemy upon themselves, how much more so those who undergo the loss of safety rather than reconciliation with one who is neither an enemy nor wishes to be, but a friend. This insolence will undoubtedly pay for itself, which will cause regret someday, whoever it may be. Certainly, the senators act through me, not all, but the principal ones. Others also act, and from other places indeed, such as from Bern, from Schaffhausen, from Strasbourg, so that it is now futile to say, "if the senators acted." Then you know from the latest letters why they do not act on their own. Did you not understand what restrains them? Those who are elevated to honors are not quite suitable. Such people are feared; they have proven themselves, so that a good man does not dare to trust them safely. They interpret the harm that befell them from the gospel (as they interpret it), which is why, full of vengeance, they expect nothing but an opportunity to satisfy their spirit. And such people are not only among you, but also here, and elsewhere, but they all collude. There, however, I do not know what greater favor such people have among those who seem to be something, from which there will be even greater opportunity someday to bring harm to the good. Hence certainly these wrongs, which happen daily among you. The guilty are acquitted, the innocent are condemned. Piety is valued at nothing, impiety is promoted. Men not so bad are expelled from the senate, openly impious men and of almost no worth are elected to the senate, to prefectures, to the judicial forum. What do you think is the cause of this diligence, namely promoting the most impious, if you exclude the so-called favor? Can you be unaware of what harm will someday flow from this into the republic of Christ? That will certainly not be among the least, which all of you dread, not because of you, but because of those we just mentioned. However, even if no senator ever speaks a word about restoring concord, are your actions so imprudent that they do not know it is primarily in their interest to restore the former friendship, then indeed to provide for the republic all those who are tasked with restoring it, whether they are priests or those monks? Does the regard for persons still make a good, honest, useful thing vile and worthless among them? Do we learn Christ in such a way that we become more and more foolish every day? I cannot briefly express how much this displeases me in yours and in others, then what I see God has determined for us, who, while pretending to have a concordant doctrine, are in reality so discordant. Indeed, in despair, I leave whatever it is to God henceforth. I will not, however, neglect my duty, unless God takes me elsewhere. Meanwhile, I will complain thus, that the impious is exalted among the pious, indeed even by the pious, who will be sold, until it is enough. For he is the one who has taken away and reduced to nothing whatever good has been offered to you by pious men, and he will not cease to do the same in the future, until he has brought you all to ruin, fulfilling his wish. What I know in my mind, I freely confess to you. You see what you owe to God and to your people, that is, to those entrusted to your faith.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you add at the end about my letter accusing you of treason through Otto, I do not know at all what it is. Indeed, I sent nothing through him nor ordered him to write in my name, nor did I say anything that he could have written down, which is why I would not want you to take anything else badly because of me, unless you have a clear reason. Believe me, that word hurt. I would have taken it badly, unless etc., not moderately. However, I am surprised, not to say more, that you did not write a word about the latest assemblies, then that you responded so little to the last letters sent, which I have not sent to Zurich more diligently, more correctly, and with I do not know what fear, indeed and anxiety. I had entrusted the last ones to Utinger as well, so that you would examine them carefully, convinced that there was something there that should not be neglected. But perhaps I wrote so obscurely that you did not understand me, wherefore you did not weigh it equally with me.</p>
      <p>However the matter stands, I heard that you recently said in a sermon: If you wish so, and return the gospel. But in your last letters, you write that your affairs are not so deplorable. These different things, even if nothing else, make me more restless than is just. If you think it would be beneficial, I would like you to discuss the discord of opinions, indeed what is ambiguous. I almost forgot what you write about the Clodians and the pious increasingly abhorring the friendship of some. If these are good men, the pious do not justly abhor them, but if they are bad, I will never believe that they are not considered the most friendly by the Clodians, unless they pretend more than cunningly, to deceive the simple more easily. Beware, dearest Bullinger, that you are not to be numbered among these simple ones. The simplicity of doves indeed befits, but the prudence of serpents no less. If the poorly allied are forced to deviate from their purpose, then, believe me, unless not only you but all of you together have become piously cunning, a much more miserable harm will threaten the gospel. You will feel someday what I say. Therefore, I wish you to be entirely in this, that you suspect everything that is outside, until you know from whom and for what reason anything is done, it is clear. From here, if you direct the course of the counsels by which the republic of Christ is aided, and yours, you will never stray from the goal. I speak candidly, not indeed teaching you, but showing my mind, which if it had anything that could be of use, would share it with you as a friend.</p>
      <p>At the end, I add, let us cultivate concord, and the hare has fallen into the lap of the allies, to speak in German.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 9, 1533.</p>
