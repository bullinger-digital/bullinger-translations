    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Thamer's letter [No. 2647] was very welcome to Bullinger because it reported on the well-being of the prince [Landgrave Philipp of Hesse] and his army, and was written by someone whom Bullinger thought was hostile to him! Bullinger gladly accepts Thamer's friendship and wants to earn it as best as he can. May it be happy and last forever!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Engelbert [Milander] has correctly reported on the twice-weekly services held in Zurich, which are conducted not only for the benefit of the [Schmalkaldic League] but also for the [Protestant Confederates] who are exposed to the same danger. In every Sunday sermon, the people are called to prayer both in church and at home. This seems to be taken seriously, as the people humble themselves, show repentance, and, at the magistrate's urging (as in the case of Nineveh), abstain from earthly frivolities, giving good reason to hope for God's goodness, even though it is expected (as Thamer rightly suspects in his letter) that the [Protestants] must first be tested as if by fire.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger also does not doubt that the war would have long been over if the Landgrave had been granted the authority to lead the war. That the others did not grant him this is more due to fate (fatum) than to their ill will. God intends to test the endurance of His own. Perhaps the measure of the Amorites' guilt is not yet full [see Gen 15:16]. But it is certain that Christ will defeat the Antichrist. Until then, may Christ grant His own the understanding to act in the interest of the Church!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger has always valued Luther and still does after his death, for he knows that God has accomplished much good through this man. However, Bullinger could never share Luther's excessive and crude (immodica et crassa) understanding of the Lord's Supper; a view that Luther expressed shortly before his death in his [32-article] writing against the screeching Louvain [theologians] and previously in his "Short Confession" (which the Zurichers have refuted). He claimed that the actual body of the Lord, the one He assumed at His birth, was fully present during the mystical celebration of the Lord's Supper (coena mystica) and was consumed in its substance not only in faith but also with the mouth, even though the bread remained bread. Yes, even Judas is said to have eaten the body of Christ, although he did not believe! Such a view does not differ from that of the abominable Papists, except that Luther did not use the word Transubstantiation! And just as Bullinger can make nothing of the papist opinion of a true and bodily yet not local, qualitative, and quantitative presence and consumption (manducatio) of the Lord, he also cannot comprehend Luther's doctrine. How can one truly eat the body of the Lord and yet not in a local, qualitative, and quantitative way? It is as if one were to claim that a fire burns somewhere that gives neither light nor warmth, or that something exists without what is said of it being so! To avoid speaking nonsense, to not deny the truth of the body of Christ, and to not invent unnecessary miracles (which are not only not substantiated in Scripture but also contradict it), one should simply use the assertions of Scripture and say that the "true body and true blood of the Lord are eaten and drunk" (John 6: [53-56]). But this happens in faith and in spirit, both before and after the celebration of the Lord's Supper, as soon as a person believes the saving word and joins Christ. The Lord's Supper is a memorial, a covenant (Luke 22: [19f]; Rom 4: [10-12]), a testimony, and the guarantee that Christ sacrificed His body and shed His blood for our salvation. This is offered to man only through faith (exhibere) and can only be received (recipere) by him in faith. Consequently, the participants in the Lord's Supper receive the assurance through faith that they are redeemed by the present and not absent Christ (1 Cor 10: [1-4, 16f]), who is the true nourishment of our life. For faith is not an empty concept. It has effective impacts on the believers, even during their earthly existence, before they attain eternal life in fullness. It is therefore not necessary to invent a body of the Lord that radiates from heaven, contrary to all physical properties, everywhere, adds itself to the bread, or mixes with it, even transforms it! Our Lord retains His physical properties and remains in heaven, just as the bread remains bread and we remain on earth, even if our heart becomes part of Christ in heaven through the Spirit and faith, even outside a celebration of the Lord's Supper.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] By the way, Bullinger does not want to prescribe to Thamer what he should believe. Thamer should only accept what he believes is in accordance with Holy Scripture. Bullinger has shared his explanations so that Thamer may better understand why the Zurichers cannot agree with Luther's opinion and what they actually believe. Thamer will find that the Zurichers do not regard the sign (signum) or the symbol (symbolum) as profane or empty, but as purely divine, as a mystical celebration (mysterium) of their redemption, as a sign of the unifying Christian covenant.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] How wonderful it would be if Thamer could visit Zurich despite the current turmoil! Then everything could be discussed amicably. Thamer is warmly invited! Bullinger will gladly provide him with accommodation and treat him not only as a guest but as a brother. Thamer should know that Bullinger's only concern is to present the church entrusted to him to Christ unblemished and uncorrupted. Therefore, Bullinger is always ready to discuss doctrine with Scripture.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Thamer should take everything in the best way. Bullinger wishes him all the best. He sends his regards to the Landgrave, this strong hero, and also to the dear [personal] physician [of the Landgrave], Doctor [Johann] Meckbach, the [landgrave's] secretary Simon Bing, and the other gentlemen and brothers. Greetings from [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Rudolf] Gwalther (Bullinger's [foster] son, whose [“Endtchrist”] (Antichristus) Bullinger encloses as a gift), from [Heinrich] Buchter, [Johannes] Wolf, especially from Bullinger's "godfather" Otto Werdmüller, from the professors Doctor [Konrad] Gessner, [Johann Jakob] Ammann (school supervisor) and [Rudolf] Collin as well as from all good people.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Your letters were most welcome to me, most excellent man, both because they announced the well-being of the most illustrious prince, the staunch defender of the Christian faith, and the entire Christian army, and because they came from Thamer, whom I had been persuaded by the reports of some to consider an enemy, but now, having been truly informed by you, I perceive to be a friend. Therefore, I thank your humanity, most learned and humane brother, for having anticipated me with your letters and declared your benevolent mind towards me, and also for offering a bond of friendship. You may, moreover, promise yourself from me what a brother would from a brother; for there will be nothing lacking in me. I wish now that the bond of friendship between us may be firmly bound and connected in Christian charity; and may Christ the Lord, the author of all sincere friendship, make it perpetual, indissoluble, happy, and prosperous!</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Now I respond briefly to your matters, most esteemed brother. Our Engelbert has truly reported about the sacred supplication instituted and received on your behalf, indeed for the common danger in our church. And it is conducted with a great gathering of people twice a week; meanwhile, in every Sunday sermon, the people are especially urged to pour out prayers to the Lord both in the temple and at home, and indeed the people seem to be seriously moved by the word of truth and the danger; for they have humbly humbled themselves and have laid aside many of the vanities of this age, partly of their own accord, partly by the magistrate's command (after the example of the king of Nineveh), so that each may return from his evil way in serious repentance to the Lord, if perhaps He, having mercy on us, may avert the deserved and imminent evils from the church with His mercy, and therefore we hope the Lord will not fail us with His grace, yet, as you rightly divine, He does not wish us to be secure in the meantime, but to be tested by the cross as gold by fire, lest we fall asleep in the death of this world and be condemned with the impious world. Moreover, we do not at all doubt that the war would have been ended long ago if the authority of your prince had prevailed as it should have, or if he had been able to use his power, that is, if this had been allowed to him by others. However, others undoubtedly err more by fate than by malice; for it has seemed good to the Lord to exercise our patience. But I firmly believe that the iniquities of the Amorites are not yet complete, for I am certainly taught by the prophetic and apostolic scriptures that full victory and truly just and complete triumph over the Antichrist, utterly defeated and destroyed, is reserved for Christ the King and Prince, and therefore our Judge. Meanwhile, we pray that He may grant us understanding and strength to accomplish those things which pertain to His glory and the safety of His church.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have always loved Doctor Luther of blessed memory, a celebrated man, and I still love him even dead in the Lord; for I acknowledge that the Lord has bestowed upon us remarkable benefits through him, for which that man deserves the greatest praise from all. However, I could never approve of his excessive and too crude definition of the Lord's Supper, which he reduced into a brief proposition not long before his death against the screeching Louvain theologians, and pressed too harshly in a recent booklet, in his small confession, I say, published against us, to which we responded, and explained it extensively in his great confession. He contended that the natural body of the Lord, as it was born of the Virgin, is fully present and eaten in the mystical supper, yet the bread remains bread and is not converted into the body of the Lord, nevertheless truly and substantially present and corporally eaten, not only by the mouth of faith but also by the mouth of the body. For he contended that Judas also ate the very body of the Lord, although it is known that he lacked faith. These things do not differ from the papistic abominations, my dear Thamer, except for the one word of transubstantiation. However, although Luther was a great man in other respects, I cannot agree with him in this matter, just as I cannot bear the papistic opinion of the real and bodily presence and eating, free from place, quality, and quantity. For they speak thus: The true body of the Lord is eaten and present, but by some miracle, not qualitatively, not quantitatively, and not as in a place. Which is as if one were to say that a fire burns somewhere, but does not give light, does not give warmth. Thus they add and take away properties from the same thing at one moment, so that the same thing, I say, is at once what it is said to be and yet is not what it is said to be. But so that the scripture does not contradict itself, so that many absurdities are excluded, so that we do not take away the truth of the body of Christ the Lord, finally so that we do not invent miracles beyond necessity, outside and against the scripture, and so that we attribute to the sacraments what is theirs, to the Holy Spirit and to faith what is their own, it seems better, indeed in our opinion, more correct, simpler, and sufficient, if we feel and say, as the scripture also speaks, that the true body of the Lord and His true blood are eaten and drunk (John 6), but by faith and spirit, even outside and before the supper, whenever a man, having heard the word of salvation, believes and joins himself to Christ: The supper is a memorial, a testament (Luke 22, Romans 4), a testimony and a seal of the body given for us and the blood shed, of the accomplished salvation and life offered and received by us in the death of Christ through faith, so that those participating in the supper receive the seal of that thing by faith, that they are redeemed by the death of the Lord, already saved and made one with Christ (1 Corinthians 10), who is the food of life, and indeed of sensitive life, not imaginative, of the present, not absent. For faith is not an empty, vain, and void thing. The faithful feel within themselves the power and the living Lord in them: Indeed, they enjoy the Lord and all His goods so fully and abundantly that they can desire and wish for nothing more, already satisfied and perfect in Christ in all things, except that with great joy of heart, celebrating the saving mysteries several times a year, they renew and refresh the salvation offered, as the Lord Himself has arranged, and always pray that what they already possess by faith and hope, in due time, when it seems good to God to transfer them from here to Himself, He may fully confer eternal life in Christ. Thus it will not be necessary to imagine the body of the Lord miraculously descending from heaven and spreading itself contrary to the property of a true body in all things, to join itself to the bread or to mix with it, or to be converted into the bread, or, the substance of the bread being removed, to contain itself under the species of bread. The Lord remains in His substance and truth, and therefore the Lord remains in heaven, who is also the Son of Man in heaven. The bread remains in its substance. Moreover, we remain on earth; but with the heart, admonished by the minister and saying "Lift up your hearts!" we ascend, being carried by the spirit, and by faith into heaven, where we participate in Christ wholly, that is, in God and man, and continue and renew the participation begun long ago by faith and indeed perceived, so that He may now continue to live in us and we in Him.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>However, I prescribe nothing here to your piety that you should believe or receive. Receive what you think is consistent with the truth of the scriptures. I recite these things and briefly touch upon them in reciting, so that you may see why we have not been able to agree with Luther thus far and what we think about the Lord's Supper, not indeed inventing some empty and profane sign or symbol, but purely divine, which is the mystery of our redemption, the testimony of grace offered to us by the Lord, the visible word, and the seal of received salvation in hope, and the symbol of concord and the Christian covenant.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Would that it were possible for you to come to us sometime through those crowds; for then we would discuss all these things fully, freely, amicably, and pleasantly. Indeed, we invite you in every way, most humane Theobald, to come. I offer you my house; I open all my things to you, and the same one whom I have now received into friendship as my intimate, I will gladly welcome as a brother, not as a guest, and gladly discuss matters of religion, so that I may be instructed, hear. For believe me, brother, we are very anxious and solicitous about how we may bring the church entrusted to our faith to Christ, our Lord, whole and uncorrupted, and therefore we eagerly listen to discussions about the sincerity of doctrine from the scriptures. For we know, we know that a certain day is appointed and designated, on which we must all give an account for our ministry. Would that we may then be found blameless and feel the judge to be merciful and kind! Pray to the Lord for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Consider these things kindly, I beseech you, coming indeed from a friendly heart. Live and farewell eternally. Commend me to the most illustrious prince and most valiant hero, and also to the dearest men, Doctor Meggenbach, the physician, and Doctor Simon Bing, the secretary, and the other lords and brothers, whom you will greet most kindly in my name. May the Lord Jesus keep us all from all evil. All the fellow ministers greet you, Doctor Pellicanus, Bibliander, Gwalther, my son, whose "Antichrist" I offer here as a gift, Buchter, and Johannes Wolphius, especially my godfather Otto Werdmüller, and also the professors Doctor Gessner, Doctor Ammianus, the schoolmaster, Doctor Collinus, and the other good men.</p>
