    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks, also on behalf of his fellow brothers, for the letter delivered by Johannes von Bekensteyn [No. 1464]. Complains about the many Anabaptist sects, whose followers hate the clergy and partly advocate polygamy and the killing of non-believers. If those self-satisfied teachers were right, who claim that one can follow Christ without taking up the cross, the martyrs would indeed have been foolish; through such heresies, we are pointed to God as the only teacher of the faithful. Even before the mentioned letter, which he intends to spread among the Dutch and Frisians, he received a letter from Bullinger, but fears that his response to it was lost; in it, he asked for advice on dealing with the Anabaptists, who keep the faithful from attending sermons and despise the sacraments. The [Lutheran] Capernaumites are also stirring again; disputations with them are not worthwhile, as they are uncomprehending and only listen to their own teachers. Reads Bullinger's "De scripturae sanctae authoritate" and the expanded edition of "De origine erroris" with admiration; would like to be informed if he has published any further works. Greetings, especially from Bekensteyn, who is grateful for the encounter with the Zurichers; Aquilomontanus intends to write more extensively another time.</p>

      <p>Hermann Aquilomontanus to Heinrich Bullinger sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Your pious and learned letter containing pastoral admonition was faithfully delivered by Johannes von Bekensteyn, in which you show that you not only care for the church of Zurich but also for all churches.</p>
      <p>The pious brothers rejoiced upon reading your letter and collectively express their gratitude, praying for the increase and growth of the spirit in you.</p>
      <p>It is impossible to adequately express with pen or human voice how many sects Satan stirs up here among the simple Anabaptists, so it is no wonder that few are saved. They admit no teachers unless they are re-baptized, they pursue all ministers with Vatinian hatred; some would rather offer their neck to the sword than enter a temple, others establish sanctity in the plurality of wives, others consider killing a person of another sect a sacrifice. Into what age have we fallen, dearest brother?</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, great-named teachers come, laying cushions under every elbow, so that the cross of Christ is nullified, teaching that one can serve two masters, erasing the word of the Lord: "Whoever wants to follow me, let him take up his cross daily" [Mt 16, 24 par.] etc., "Do not be surprised if the world hates you" [1Joh 3, 13] etc. Foolish were the holy martyrs (as you truly say), foolish was the old Eleazar among the Maccabees, who refused to save his life by pretending to eat a piece of beef. I cannot sufficiently marvel, beloved brother, that such great men are held by such blindness, as if Christ could now be found without the cross contrary to the custom of our ancestors. He is not found on earth without the cross, after this life we will glory with him. But the Lord warns us through these perverse doctrines not to give ourselves to men, but to God, who is the only faithful teacher. But I desist, knowing to whom I write, namely from whom I desire to learn with all my heart.</p>
      <p>I have now received two letters from you, most learned man, in the first of which you fully instruct and teach the pastor what I ought to do; in the other, delivered by Johannes von Bekensteyn, you fatherly admonish me not to be moved by the pomp of the great and not to allow the simple to follow a perverse error. Among my Dutch and here among the Frisians, I will do what I can, I will spread your letter, meanwhile, I will pray to the Lord to assist his cause. To the first letter, I responded briefly through a merchant from MÃ¼nster at the last fair, but since he does not return, I fear the writing has been lost; I desired the best way to deal with the Anabaptists, among whom I live, who not only despise sermons but also withdraw the simple from hearing them, mock our patience, abhor our sacraments instituted according to the norm of Christ, and if they ever hear us, they alienate themselves very far in sacred matters. In meetings, they promise much, but deliver nothing.</p>
      <p>Now the Capernaumites, new papists with their carnal presence, conspired in the words of the master, are stirring again. I have decided to prick them not with lengthy disputations, but with succinct and firm aphorisms, because if they are defeated, they usurp the victory for themselves, finally proclaiming that they do not wish to feel otherwise than those learned ones proclaim.</p>
      <p>I ask all of you, excellent men, to pray for us, that the Lord may illuminate us more and more daily and strengthen us in the truth.</p>
      <p>I read your book "De scripturae sanctae authoritate" and the expanded edition of "De origine erroris" and cannot get enough; I admire the all-encompassing erudition and varied reading, the indefatigable study, and I embrace the candor in all things. If you have published anything after those for the benefit of the church, I wish to know.</p>
      <p>With these few words, farewell with your fellow soldiers, whom you will diligently greet in the name of all brothers. Johannes von Bekensteyn greets you, who counts your brotherhood and order among the greatest gifts of God. May the best and greatest preserve you in goodness and make you patient; in humble prayer and long-suffering patience, I judge the life of Christians. Farewell, excellent men, and never forget that you are the guardians of the bride of Christ. I trust I will write more extensively and clearly another time; the constraint of time forced me to write, not dictate, this.</p>
      <p>Emden, August 20, 1541.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed teacher.</p>
