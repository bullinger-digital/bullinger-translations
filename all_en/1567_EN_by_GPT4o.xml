      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. Your letter, along with the sent Latin and German copies of the preface, which you intend to include in the booklet, has reached us. You should know that our opinion, as the less knowledgeable compared to you, is not to change. Therefore, we want to leave it to you (as we have also written before) to let the booklet go out under whatever name your good spirit advises you, and this shall not be against us. We would not want to withhold our gracious response to your further writings. Dated Schaffhausen, the 15th of February, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>As you mention at the conclusion of your letter, may dear God will that the Saxons handle something stable, for you always fear that France will tremble; for the constable is negotiating very seriously for peace, and since he has the government in his hands, you hope to expect little good, much will be shot, etc. Such matters are not more for the constable; for he is constantly in negotiations with his lord, the king, and others, so that there is no need for war, and if one had only followed him and wanted to watch, then Barma would not have been conquered. He also had to let this go to his ears quite properly, that he went to court with a whole lot of adornment. We hope to God, whether it is Saxons, or whoever it is, that they have something to do or negotiate with the king, they have not acted like children. If it seriously concerns dhutt and with good consideration et bone vide, which also erli chabete lütt to say and to hold drüwen zechen fairly. For andrü can also find his own lords well. That such evil can be well repaid with harm and suffering.</p>
      <p>Our uncle Duke Christoph of Württemberg has been written to about 5 days ago, that the Saxons and Strasbourgers, who were sent to Trent, are said to have had an audience before the council and were granted the escort as they requested. If one proceeds in this way, as the two councils of our uncle have written to their dear ones, it will soon be to send back the theologians; for they have ridden upon request and returned home. The session, which was supposed to be held on the 25th of the past month, has been postponed until the 12th of March. It is also said that the Saxons and Strasbourgers, after submitting their confessions, have been granted everything they requested, and especially that no decrees should be made until our aforementioned uncle's theologians have also arrived there. And all matters are to be started anew and the theologians are to be granted the freedom to speak and dispute, and the escort is to be provided, etc. In this, which is not the least, it still hinges on who should be the judge; this is to be clarified only when the theologians come together in Trent. Their dear ones have written back that we can have no better judge than the truth, the holy apostolic scripture itself. May God, our heavenly Father, grant his holy spirit for the sake of Jesus, his beloved son, so that everything may be handled to his glory and honor and the salvation of our souls. Amen.</p>
      <p>Written in ill, which we did not want to hide from you with a kind and gracious opinion.</p>
      <p>To our dear, special Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
