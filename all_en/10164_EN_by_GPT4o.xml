      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letters along with those you mentioned in them, which, as before, I have greatly enjoyed. But I fear that those you sent to Frankfurt will reach me with difficulty, because there is no one to deliver mine and to collect and return yours, as I had arranged. For the one I had engaged unexpectedly left sooner than anticipated, as I was attending my sister's wedding in my homeland. He usually attends each fair with books for sale and stays in the same lodging as the people from Zurich, if what I have been told is true. Hereafter, if God grants life, it will be better managed.</p>
      <p>In the past month of August, I sent you letters with a certain citizen of Cologne, who solemnly promised me that he would deliver them into your hands, in which I had requested that your annotations on the Epistle of John be sent again. For I entrusted the previous ones to a certain brother, who did not return them, nor are they yet available in Cologne as they were recently. Otherwise, I would not trouble you for this reason. I am still anxiously awaiting the commentaries on the Epistle to the Hebrews along with your dearest writings, and if, as I hope, I do not receive them, I will blame no one but myself.</p>
      <p>I truly congratulate you on the success and peace of your church and pray that we may someday write the same. For with us, those who favor the gospel and the glory of Christ must act in secret. Thus, as you know, we are surrounded on all sides by Pharisaic constitutions. It is certainly forgivable in my judgment for the simple people, who wish with all their might to serve God and believe that what they do - for they are taught nothing else - uniquely pleases God. Therefore, at the outset, I would prefer nothing more than for the gospel to be purely accepted. For then, undoubtedly, all other abuses will gradually wither and perish. You and yours should pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us. The rumors about the Emperor and the Turks are still uncertain. It is said that a public conflict will soon take place, in which the Emperor has written that he will be present in person. Glory be to the Lord forever.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and greet your brother in my name.</p>
      <p>Cologne, September 13, 1532.</p>
      <p>Your Theodericus Bitter.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my beloved friend, to be delivered by hand. To Zurich.</p>
