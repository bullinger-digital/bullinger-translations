      <p>Mr. Tscharner informs me that the legate has received news by post that Polweiler, with his forces, is hurrying to Burgopräß (if I have correctly noted the name), which is not far from Legion, with the intention of enticing our soldiers away so that they may not join the remaining forces. Also, Maximilian is leading a strong force of Hungarians and Bohemians, intending to take his forces to Legion to follow Polweiler. Additionally, the Spaniards have invaded the land of the Gascons and have caused them harm.</p>
      <p>These things from the consul, after I had sealed the previous letters.</p>
