      <p>Your most welcome letters were delivered to me, most distinguished Antistes and most deservedly esteemed by me, by our friend, Doctor Sandes, and beloved brother in Christ; in which you not only congratulate us English and rejoice in our name, because the most gracious Lord has visited our affliction and has redeemed His people, which is a sentiment truly worthy of a good and pious shepherd; but also, like a nurse who nurtures her pupils, you are so concerned that no evil beast may harm, nor any calamity interrupt this joy that has begun.</p>
      <p>You indeed prudently and lovingly advise, and you mention those things from which the greatest fear should be. Would that those who are now advisors to the Queen foresee and diligently guard against these evils! However, there is good hope, especially if what is written from Antwerpen is true, that the spirits of the papists have collapsed, and they will not prepare any force unless the discord of our own people provides an opportunity. It is now to be prayed that no dissent and factions arise over the marriage; if it succeeds under good auspices, the rest will proceed far better and more safely.</p>
      <p>As for Philipp, I am not surprised at what he seeks, especially since there are new examples: but if he considers his affairs well, he would desire the friendship of the Queen more than marriage; and I do not think she would marry a foreigner now if she could, nor do I see how she could without the greatest danger if she wished. But here I attribute little to human plans: for what you write is most true, that the establishment of kingdoms is in the hand of God. If the Queen, mindful of such a great benefit received, will trust in God; if she says daily to the Lord, you are my fortress, my rock, and my refuge; neither will the spirit of Judith or Deborah be lacking to her, nor wisdom to her counselors, nor strength to her army. Against the plans of the enemies, they will be frustrated, swords will be blunted, and the horse with its rider will fall. May it be so through Christ Jesus our Lord! Amen.</p>
      <p>In two or three days we expect other letters from England, and we will take care to inform you, if there is any good or otherwise, whom we will forever venerate and acknowledge as lords and brothers who have deserved well of us. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Strassburg, 8th December 1558.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your excellence, Antony Cooke.</p>
