      <p>I have written to an honorable man in Glarus my judgment about your angel, Jacob Jöri, namely that, after reading the visions, I can only judge that it is a deception of the Devil, who disguises himself as an angel of light, or a monkish trick, as was done with Jacob or Hans Jäzer in Bern. God does not reveal His judgments in dark corners at night; He now has them preached, needing no visions; they are suspicious.</p>
      <p>That he reports some known truths against pensions and open vices, the monk's spirit in Bern did that too. Sinon Vergilianus tells some truths, so that he may support the lies with them, etc. The devil tells the truth in 1 Samuel 28, so that he may bring Saul to despair, tells the truth in Acts 16, so that he may remain. Nothing should be based on these truths; for the lies placed upon them are too gross, such as that the mass was instituted by Christ. The impudent lie of the devil: Christ instituted the supper, not the mass, for the faithful... sacred... Even the papists say which parts of the mass each of the popes and fathers instituted. The mass is the perversion of Christ's institution.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the angel's revelation is the devil's lie. Then the angel commands to offer to creatures, to build chapels or churches. Is that not a manifest idolatry? Which good angel teaches manifest idolatry? Let Augustine's "The City of God" Book 10, Chapters 15 and 16 be read, before and after, etc. We do not revile the saints; those who make them into idols revile them much.</p>
      <p>We also do not rely on them much.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is a work of lies, with which the spirit deceives.</p>
      <p>It is nonetheless true that one should teach and govern well, take no pensions, abolish usury and open vices; for God says that. That is preached, and needs no Jacob sacristan, who learns it by night; God commands it to us in His eternal word. But the mass and the veneration of creatures have no testimony in the word of God, it is against God; that requires no nightly revelations from children through Jacob Jöri and other instruments of deception. If believers believed in the word of God, they would flee from what is against God, especially the false revelations about the mass, etc. Therefore, watch, brother, and teach against such impostures; admonish serious men to remember their seriousness and avoid the frivolous, disorderly laughter. May the Lord destroy all impiety!</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
