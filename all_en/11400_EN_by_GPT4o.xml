    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to time constraints, he did not write after the last [Frankfurt] fair, but now breaks his silence, as the friendship established during his stay in Zurich means a lot to him. In England, the monastic order has been abolished, some monasteries were converted into schools, and before Christmas, three abbots [Richard Whiting, Hugh Cooke, known as Farringdon, and Thomas Beech, known as Marshall] were executed because they conspired to reinstate papal rule. The main points of a "papist" sermon by the Bishop of Winchester [Stephen Gardiner] at the beginning of Lent, to which [Robert] Barnes responded the following Sunday to general applause, will be conveyed to Bullinger by John Butler. [Lord Chancellor Thomas] Audley sends his regards; he will gladly host Bullinger's son during any potential stay in England. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Indeed, I would be truly inhumane, most learned Bullinger, if I did not greet you with my letters, as you treated me with such kindness when I was with you. As for why I did not write after the last fair, you can guess the reason. Now, even if the same reason perhaps remains, I have decided to break the silence, lest my cessation be seen as due to negligence and forgetfulness rather than a lack of time: something which, believe me, does not fit my character. For neither does my spirit shy away from mutual love, nor am I, like anyone else, forgetful of the kindness shown to me. At present, there is nothing to write except that all our monks have lost their titles, some of the largest monasteries have been turned into schools for students, and shortly before Christmas, punishment was inflicted on three of the wealthiest abbots because they conspired among themselves to restore the pope. It should not be overlooked that the Bishop of Winchester preached very papistically to the great displeasure of the people on the first Sunday of Lent, and the following Sunday, Doctor Barnes responded excellently to almost universal murmurs of approval. The main points addressed by the bishop, I have written to John Butler, from whom you can learn. You will receive other news from others. Lord Audley, an excellent man and servant of the king, has become very fond of you from our preaching, and he has instructed me not only to greet you accurately with his words but also to inform you that if you send your son here, he will treat him with the kindness that the offspring of a most dear and singular man deserves. I send many greetings to your mother, wife, brother, children, and the rest of your family. You will convey equal greetings in my words to Mr. Pellican, Mr. Jude, Mr. Rhelican, Mr. Megander, most excellent and distinguished men. Farewell. London, the 20th day of February.</p>
