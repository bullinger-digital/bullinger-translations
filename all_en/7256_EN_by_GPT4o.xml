      <p>We have now received two letters, one from someone who was near Lyon and wanted to go there, but had to turn back, and the other from Bern, which came to our gracious lords, sounding of lamentable matters, namely how in France everything is in turmoil and great bloodshed is to be feared. May God graciously prevent it, be merciful to us, and not repay us according to our deserts! Previously, I informed you how the Cardinal de Santa Croce from Rome (just as before the first French war the Cardinal of Ferrara also) was sent to the court in France to the king, and there is great concern that he, along with the Cardinal of Lorraine and other priests, will incite a gruesome bloodbath, which unfortunately has already happened and broken out. And when the Protestants in France learned what was planned against them, the noblemen turned to the king, etc. Now follows what was written from Lyon and Bern: On the 28th of September, Prince Condé and other royal princes, well-armed with 4000 horses, came to the king, who is not far from Paris with his court, and they complained about the Spanish conspiracy and great preparations, also that the empire is being delayed and corrupted more and more, etc. In this, the Lord of Mons/Mous? came with 500 horses to Lyon, but the governor did not want to let him in, and the papists took over the gates and streets and destroyed the Protestant churches; the believers were kept in their houses as prisoners. And on Friday and Saturday, the 3rd and 4th of October, the papists sent those who were not at home and not residents in Lyon out of the city with white staffs, some of whom were also badly mistreated. These expelled strangers are said to be 2000 in number. - In Mâcon and Provence, the Protestants mostly have the upper hand, but not in Vienna, and it is a lamentable matter.</p>
      <p>May God bring it to peace and good. So much in the mentioned letters.</p>
      <p>The plan of the priests in France and the Spaniards in the Netherlands is supposed to be: when the German riders go into France to help the believers, the Spaniards from the Netherlands should fall into the land of the German princes and take the nearest seat. Therefore, the German princes, who are determined, need to take care and faithfully unite; for it is ultimately and truly about faith and that we are deprived of our freedom and subjected to the most despised servitude by the French, Spaniards, and the House of Austria. May God have mercy on us and deliver us from His and our enemies' bloody hands. 9th of October 1567.</p>
