      <p>Greetings. I received your letter written on the 23rd of this month.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Mülinensis has returned, and today the matter of Glarus is being discussed before the dioceses.</p>
      <p>May it finally be resolved with God's help.</p>
      <p>You will learn what the people of Geneva are asking from us and the state of their affairs both from my letters to my brother and from the present letters of Mr. Beza.</p>
      <p>Relying on your kindness, with which you are accustomed to share all your matters with me, and also because Mr. Beza allowed this, as you will learn from the letters he wrote to me, I opened them and was greatly struck by what I read.</p>
      <p>For I fear that great dangers are threatening us. You see what is happening in Lyon, and it is now certain to our people that the king will subscribe to the Council of Trent, and this at the instigation of his mother Jezebel. May the Lord scatter and overthrow her plans; for this, we must diligently pray with our churches and firmly hope in the Lord's help.</p>
      <p>Everyone suspects that those German soldiers who are heading to Italy are to be led against Geneva and us.</p>
      <p>This will be known shortly; for our people have their own in Milan, from whom they will soon learn where they are heading. We hear that the Rhaetians are in turmoil among themselves, and I am surprised that neither your letters nor those of your brother contain anything about this.</p>
      <p>I do not wish to be more lengthy, since in these other matters you have everything that I could write.</p>
      <p>I pray the Lord to keep you with us for a very long time. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet all the lords, friends, and brothers, especially those who are of your household. Steiger, Diesbach, Grafenried, Haller, my father-in-law, mother, and wife send their greetings to you and yours. Bern, the last day of June 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller to the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
