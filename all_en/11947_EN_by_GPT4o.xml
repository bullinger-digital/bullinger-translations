    <p xml:id="regest1">He will list the books delivered from the [Frankfurt] Fair, but has not yet discovered any scholarly works among them. The latest news from the Diet of Speyer can be told to him by [Bartholom√§us] Westheimer, including pleasing news regarding Duke [Heinrich] of Brunswick, but also sad news about the hostility against the Gospel; he asks to support Westheimer in his marriage matter. Reports about the Anabaptist [Hans Regesser], mentioned in his book ["De anabaptismi exordio"], who has returned to Basel from Moravia, where he ascended the pulpit, boasts of special revelations, and may be put in chains due to his delusions; the man who appeared to him was probably the devil. A farmer imprisoned in Basel believes he is being persecuted by God; through such incidents, the Lord warns us. Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have not yet compiled the catalog of books brought to us from the fair, although I have not yet seen any that seem to be of any scholarly value; but you will have it shortly.</p>
      <p>The latest news from the Diet of Speyer will be narrated by Westheimer, whom you can question about everything; for he is accustomed to observe many things and has also observed things that you will hear with pleasure about Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, although in the meantime you will perceive many sad things due to the perverse attitude of some towards the Gospel of Christ. If you can do anything in his matter, which concerns concord and marriage, I beg and implore you to be of assistance to him.</p>
      <p>The Anabaptist turner, whom I mentioned in my booklet, has returned from Moravia and brought with him a beautiful young wife. Once again granted citizenship, he said he squandered more than 200 florins on this journey - not to say madness. He told me horrendous things about the various sects with which this kind of people is inundated. In these days, he ascended the public pulpit wanting to preach about I know not what matters, to move the people to repentance.</p>
      <p>Myconius was called; he soon descended, embraced him, and was led by him to his mother and wife. The poor man is completely insane and delirious, saying he saw a man on Easter day who filled him with all joy, so that he no longer knows how to be sad; that he knows all scripture to the letter, that a sealed book has been opened to him, and that he will soon say marvelous things that have been revealed to him. Moreover, he is sleepless and for three days did not want to take a crumb of bread; he said it is not yet time to eat, that he has another food that no one knows. Today, perhaps, the magistrate will throw him into iron chains until this madness has been somewhat mitigated. Once, when he saw this man - I think it was Satan, who deceived the man wonderfully - he took off his shoes and fell on his knees saying: "Hail, man of desires; what do you command me to do?" Many rushed to him, but no one saw anyone conversing with him. Thus the Lord is accustomed to deal with us because of our sins. Horrendous examples are set before our eyes, but no repentance wants to follow.</p>
      <p>Another example: A certain farmer was brought from the field and imprisoned, who constantly pretends to want to flee from God. He shouts: "He is here now, he strikes me," and cries out in a loud voice: "Alas, why do you strike me?" And he constantly wants to hide himself, covering his head. Meanwhile, he devours eagerly what is set before him.</p>
      <p>The judgments of the Lord are varied, by which he is accustomed to admonish us. Farewell in the Lord. April 24, 1544.</p>
      <p>Give my greetings to our Theodor in my name. Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich and dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
