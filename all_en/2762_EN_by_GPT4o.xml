      <p>Grace and innocence of life to the Lord.</p>
      <p>In the previous month of June, when I was in Sondrio, which is the main town of the Valtellina Valley, I received your most delightful letters, my esteemed brother and most revered lord, which wonderfully lifted my spirit, struck and dismayed by countless troubles because of some seditious and obstinate individuals. For, as you know, such is the condition of pastors, not to say a certain fateful lot, that they are compelled daily and hourly to endure many labors to preserve the communion of the church. However, when I was placed in such troubles and read your sweetest letters with all my heart, I was not moderately delighted, and that for two reasons. First, because I see that I am loved by you and embraced as a brother and fellow minister, whatever I may be, and secondly, because the Locarnese exiles for Christ were so kindly received by your counsel and work in hospitality by the most honorable council of Zürich. Therefore, I congratulate both you, most pious Bullinger, and your holy church, that even though in this our most corrupt rather than pious age mercy is almost obliterated, yet the Father of mercies has deemed you worthy of such favor, that you have gathered Christ as an exile. For we too were strangers; but God received us in Christ, His Son, so that we are no longer foreigners, but citizens of the saints and members of God's household. Therefore, it is fitting that we be affected by the same mercy towards each other, since we must walk in that love with which Christ loved us. I would write more on this subject, if I did not know how ready your will is to serve all the faithful of Christ and especially those who are exiled for the sake of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Moreover, when I later returned from Sondrio to Tirano, in this month of October, your second letters were brought to me, indeed filled with brotherly love and ecclesiastical discipline, in which you mentioned that Lelio from Siena, long suspected by us and considered by many good brothers as a manifest Anabaptist, not only professed a good confession before you but also subscribed with his own hand to the sound doctrine, which has always been in the catholic church. For this reason, you fraternally urged me not only to consider Lelio cleared of all evil suspicion with me but also to excuse the man to others who suspect his faith. I acknowledge, my most distinguished Bullinger, and I kiss in you the zeal of the Lord God combined with uncommon charity. For I perceive in your letters how much it is in your heart that Lelio should not be defamed, how much you desire Lelio's salvation, and how highly you value the indivisible concord of the church. Indeed, your ecclesiastical authority is of such weight and merit with us that we are abundantly satisfied in this matter if you are satisfied. Therefore, relying on your counsel and judgment, I will ensure that our church henceforth recognizes Lelio as a brother, and if I cannot so quickly remove the stain of such a violent suspicion, I nevertheless pray to the Lord Jesus that Lelio may believe with all his heart what he confessed before you, so that he may be confirmed in the true confession of faith.</p>
      <p>I was unwilling, but to make you more cautious, I am compelled to report that Lelio gave his hand to Camillo Renato in such a way that, having deserted the catholic truth, he did not blush to stand publicly on the side of the Anabaptists in Geneva, Chiavenna, and elsewhere, which matter is of such importance with us that no pretext is left for excuse. For I think you are not unaware of the cunning and twisted nature and manners of Camillo. Therefore, if I have been somewhat suspicious of Lelio's confession for this reason, I ask you not to be surprised, since we experience more than enough that the Servetians and Anabaptists do not easily lay down what they have once imbibed; which we daily discover more and more in one Camillo. For it can hardly be believed how flexible the craftiness of a heretic is and how this snake escapes with oblique and slippery twists unless it is firmly pressed. But why do I speak of Camillo? For all Anabaptists are of such perfidy that they do not hesitate to blow now hot and now cold. Therefore, most pious Bullinger, do not attribute arrogance to me, I ask, if I freely tell you only what I feel. Those who are languid concerning the struggles of sound doctrine, which provide many scandals and dissensions rather than the edification of God, which is through faith, must be severely rebuked. Questions falsely named science must be avoided, and we must adhere to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, which being rejected, Camillo and his followers have made shipwreck concerning the faith. Therefore, the mask must be removed from the changeable heretics; otherwise, the salvation of the church is at stake. For a hypocritical friend is more harmful than a public enemy. Therefore, let those who continually seek dissensions in the church be gone.</p>
      <p>However, I could not restrain myself, most excellent Bullinger (since it seemed worthy of admonition for the glory of the Lord and the edification of the church), from frankly informing you what our brothers think of Lelio. It will now be your prudence, because of the burden divinely entrusted to you, to watch and keep vigil over the flock entrusted to your faith and especially over the Locarnese, lest wolves covered in sheep's clothing devour the sheep of Christ. For this is required by the reason of a Christian pastor; for the Lord also warned that those who come to us in sheep's clothing must be guarded against, since inwardly they are ravenous wolves not sparing the flock. And because lies do not deceive for long, therefore we will know them by their fruits.</p>
      <p>Moreover, our churches of the Valtellina Valley, which are in Poschiavo, Tirano, Teglio, and Sondrio, continue in concord in the old and most simple doctrine, which from the age of the apostles has been received by all churches and today by the grace of God is taught without controversy in your Helvetia and our Rhaetia churches. Let us therefore pray to the Lord Jesus, the author of true concord, that He may preserve us all in the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. Our brother and fellow minister Paulus Gadius from Cremona sends you greetings. You will greet for us the most learned Rudolf Gwalther, the most pious Bibliander, and the most holy old man Pellican. The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
      <p>From Poschiavo, November 4, in the year 1555 from the birth of Christ the Savior. Yours sincerely, Julius from Milan.</p>
      <p>To the man of distinguished piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most honorable church of Zürich, my lord in all ways always most revered.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
