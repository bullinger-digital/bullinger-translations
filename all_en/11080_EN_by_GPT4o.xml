    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports in writing, contrary to his original intention, about the confused situation in Bern: Capito and Bucer have announced their visit and will try to enforce the doctrine of the bodily presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, where they will have an easy time with many, such as [Hans Jakob and Niklaus von] Wattenwyl, [Bernhard] Tillmann, [Anton] Noll, [Lienhard] Tremp, and [Jakob] Wagner; Megander is at a loss in view of the factions. He wants to follow Bullinger's recommendation and come to Zurich, as even previously loyal supporters can no longer be relied upon. He declares himself ready for a conversation with Bucer according to Bullinger's advice and asks to let Theodor [Bibliander] participate. He will fight with all his might against the impending separation of the Bernese from the Zurich church, where not only his own position but also Rhellikan's is at stake. He hopes to receive at least advice from Zurich for the conversation with Bucer as well as Bucer's letter to Luther, in order to confront him with it. Thanks for the booklet delivered by Konrad [Geßner?].</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I had resolved to narrate everything about our affairs in person rather than in writing. But because I see such confusion in matters and cannot speak in person on the day long intended, I can no longer refrain from briefly depicting how things stand. I say it is true, as you write, dearest Bullinger, that Capito and Bucer are coming to us. This is confirmed by letters sent to us and our senate. They wish to discuss with us in person, as if they were our bishops and provincials, with the principal ministers of our region; about what, they do not at all explain. But who doubts that they will try to impose on us the substantial presence and exhibition of the body and blood of Christ with bread and wine in the holy supper? This they will achieve without effort among many, even the principal ones, namely [Hans Jakob and Niklaus von] Wattenwyl, [Bernhard] Tillmann, [Anton] Noll, [Lienhard] Tremp, [Jakob] Wagner, and many others. We are not only divided, but everything is deplorable and disturbed, everything is also full of envy, hatred, malice, contention, I might almost say factions, tumult, and sedition, so much so that I do not know at all what counsel to take.</p>
      <p>You advise that I come down to Zurich. I will certainly come down, but not for the sake of spirit, but for the sake of sorrow. For I see that the matter can hardly be settled without great harm - I would gladly say: without tumult and sedition. There is a fine agreement among the papists, pensioners, and semi-Christians; hence, what is done is undone, what is said is unsaid. For those who have hitherto seemed to stand like many walls of brass for Christ, I wish they would now become deaf, so they do not harm us and do not oppose us. Behold the straits of affairs, behold the miserable, calamitous, and doubtful life that Megander leads! I beseech you, consult on how he may extricate and recover himself from the horrendous storm.</p>
      <p>Your advice, Bullinger, to deal with Bucer pleases me; but it would please more, and also be more conducive, if one from the Zurich church were joined and assigned to us, especially Theodor [Bibliander], since he has business with Bucer more than others. If it can be done, send him to us, I beg you through Christ. It is to be feared, and that greatly, that our church will be separated from you; if that happens, it will not be without great danger. As much as it is in me, I will take care with all my strength, indeed at the risk of my life, that we are not encircled. If it must be done, not only I, but also Rhellikan, a man of integrity, probity, piety, learning, and scholarship, will soon be with you in Zurich. Therefore, I implore you through Christ to assist not only in my affairs but also in establishing those of Rhellikan.</p>
      <p>These are the things I wish to make known to you. But if none of you is going to come to us, at least indicate the difficult and principal matters on which Bucer is to be criticized and accused. Especially make us certain about the letters sent to Luther, whether he can have the archetype. For we will confront the man with these.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord together with all the brothers. You will pray to our Lord God for us.</p>
      <p>Bern, September seventh, year 37.</p>
      <p>The booklet you gave through Konrad [Geßner?], a most welcome gift and present, I received, dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant lords in Zurich from the sermons, Bullinger and Leo, his dearest friends and brothers in the Lord.</p>
