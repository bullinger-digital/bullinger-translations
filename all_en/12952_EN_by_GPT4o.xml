He cannot believe what friends have reported to him from Swabia, as the transmitted rumors do not match. Some speak of the capture of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, while others speak of a defeat that Emperor Charles V supposedly suffered at the hands of the Saxons and Bohemians. Bullinger wants to wait for more reliable news. However, it is certain that the people of Augsburg fired shots in joy over the [alleged] victory of the Emperor, causing the fortress wall at the Red Gate to collapse. This is the reliability of these merchants: celebratory shots, feasts, and jubilation while allies and good people fall in war!</p>

      <p>S. D. Although I have nothing new to write, most esteemed man, I wanted to apologize for my long silence. Konrad Pellikan and I, along with some good citizens, visited the baths in Urdorf, where we went after Easter; we returned a few days ago.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have received several letters from friends, including yours dated April 23. However, I cannot believe what friends from Swabia have written. The reports do not match and are inconsistent. Therefore, we are waiting for more certain and clearer news. I am speaking about the capture of the Elector and again about the defeat of the Emperor by the Saxons and Bohemians. There are those who say the Elector was once captured and soon ransomed! However, it is certain that the Emperor's forces triumphed in Augsburg and Ulm on the first and the day before the first of May: The people of Augsburg fired joyfully, causing the wall by the Red Gate to collapse! This is the reliability of these merchants! They fire cannons, feast, and rejoice while allies and good men are captured and killed.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Our council has unanimously decided to recall Johannes Haller and Thoman Ruman from Augsburg to their homeland. No one favors those deceitful cities.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I hear that Martin Bucer is strongly advocating for Strasbourg's capitulation and supporting the Emperor. If this is true, what I have long feared will happen to him. May the Lord deliver us from evil!</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Ensure that this package is delivered to Johannes Gast as soon as possible. Farewell.</p>

      <p>From Marburg, Theobald Thamer and Wigand Happel wrote in a letter dated April 27 that Landgrave Philipp of Hesse is armed and will soon march against the Papists. May the Lord protect him! Zurich, April 18, 1547. I eagerly await your letters! Your Bullinger.</p>
