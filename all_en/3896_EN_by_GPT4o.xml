      <p>To the most distinguished and esteemed man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, my lord and most revered father, Hotman sends greetings. Revered father, I recognized the singular providence of God in the matter of our Wilhelm.</p>
      <p>I was about to set out for Heidelberg with the lord... St. on certain matters to the prince.</p>
      <p>On the journey, while we were returning together and I saw that I had to undertake a rather long journey, I asked him if he would be willing to have the best and most modest boy with him. When he refused because of the multitude of others, I was anxious about where to place him. As soon as I came home, I received your letters.</p>
      <p>Thus, as I said before, I recognized the providence of God, and I am fully convinced that God will take the greatest care of that excellent boy. I had undertaken another journey; but when I had completed three miles, I met a certain friend on the way, who brought me back for some time. I ask you to most honorably greet the most distinguished man, Mr. Stucki, in my words. I have calculated the accounts; we found in the name of both food and clothing and books up to 15 florins, which I beg you to send to my wife through your merchants, whom I think I will be forced to leave for a few days.</p>
      <p>I am not writing to my wife yet, because I want to wait for what is said to be a certain royal birth; may God bring aid to her childbirth. Farewell, most revered father, and greet the excellent father Doctor Martyr, whose most learned letters I have received, reverently in my name. Strasbourg, March 16, 1559.</p>
