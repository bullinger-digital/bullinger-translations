    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends Bullinger's delayed response to [Simon] Grynaeus's lecture [on the Lord's Supper] back after having copied it, congratulates him on it, and earnestly requests him to publish the writing; Grynaeus would have earned more merit if he had stayed with his original field of work. More details, including the disputes about Erasmus [Ritter], are reported personally by Matthäus [Hiltprand]. Greetings, also from [Pfister's wife] Josabeth.</p>

      <p>Nikolaus Pfister to his Heinrich Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>Later than you might have expected, most learned man, I have delayed sending back to you the response you gave to the lectures of Simon Grynaeus of blessed memory. The reason was my own affairs, which, as you know, keep me constantly occupied. Therefore, I ask you again and again, not to interpret this in a negative way, considering your fairness and kindness. But listen, I not only read and reread it, but I also copied it. See what audacity does. Indeed, the booklet is equipped with diverse learning, great and solid arguments. Without flattery, nothing more successful could be written against these things, unless I am completely mistaken. If only, if only, if only you would publish it, so that the world might finally realize how worthless and utterly frivolous the arguments are of those who, with I don't know what trifles and nonsense, try to obscure something so clear, as they say, with hands and feet. If only Grynaeus had competed in his own field! If he had done so, without a doubt he would have achieved greater praise both among us and among future generations, and we would have a more peaceful church. But I will fold the paper.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most learned Bullinger, and forgive my unskilled and rough pen. Brugg, April 9.</p>
      <p>How I am doing, Lord Matthäus will tell you in person, and about the matter of Erasmus Ritter. My Josabeth sends many greetings to you and your wife with the whole family.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a man of proven integrity and learning.</p>
