      <p>Greetings. I know indeed, most illustrious and in many ways esteemed man, that Johann, when he arrives to you, will clearly and fully report what is happening here with us. However, because there are some things he is less familiar with, I will write only about those, leaving aside the common and ordinary matters. When the younger Froschauer departed from here this winter, I wrote to you about what was happening in London at that time. As for what happened afterward, know this: the matter, which was desired by all good people and was of no small concern to the royal majesty, could not be brought to completion; therefore, things remain largely as they were before, except that the book or order of ecclesiastical rites and the administration of the sacraments has been amended; for everything that could foster superstition has been removed from it. The reason why the other things that were being instituted did not prevail was especially due to the sacramental matter, not indeed because of transubstantiation or the real presence (so to speak) either in the bread or in the wine, since, thanks to God, there seems to be no controversy about these among those who profess the gospel, but there was hesitation among many about whether grace is conferred through the sacraments, and there were some who absolutely affirmed this and wanted it to be decreed in this way. When others saw not obscurely how much superstition that opinion would bring with it, they initially tried in every way to show that no more should be granted to the sacraments than to the external word of God; for by both kinds of words, it is signified and shown that salvation has been obtained for us through Christ, which is received by all who believe in these words and signs, not indeed by the power of the words or sacraments, but by the efficacy of faith. Moreover, it was added that it is not possible for the sacraments to be received worthily unless those receiving them first have what is signified by them; for without faith, they are always used unworthily; but if those who approach the sacraments are endowed with faith, they have already apprehended by faith the grace that is proclaimed to us in the sacraments. The taking and use of them is then a seal and confirmation of the promise already received, and just as the external words of God can often awaken and revive faith in us when it is dormant and somewhat asleep, so too can the sacraments do the same by the power of the Holy Spirit, and their use is not a little useful for confirming our sometimes weak minds about the promises and grace of God. In the case of children, when they are baptized, because they cannot have assent to the divine promises due to their age, the sacrament effects in them that the remission of original sin, reconciliation with God, and the grace of the Holy Spirit, which they are given through Christ, are sealed in them, and that they are visibly inserted into the church. Although it cannot be denied that much good and benefit accrues to those who are baptized, whether infants or adults, from the invocation of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, which is made over them. For God never fails to hear the prayers of His faithful church. We would have wished these things to be established and decreed about the sacraments so that their pure and simple use might finally be restored; but there was opposition, and many, who are otherwise not unlearned or evil, want grace, as they say, to be conferred through the sacraments, nor do they want to concede that infants are justified or regenerated before baptism. But when it comes to their arguments, there are none that have not been easily refuted. Nevertheless, we are stirred by no small envy because we completely disagree with Augustine, and if our opinion had been approved by public authority, then, they say, Augustine would have been most manifestly condemned. What more can I say? People cannot be torn away from the merit of works, and what is more to be lamented, they do not want to admit it, and there are always infinite obstacles, and they succeed each other in such a way as to delay the restoration of divine worship day by day. It is such a great task to recall pure truth into the church. But for this reason, we must not despair; indeed, we are not a little confident that what has now succeeded less happily can be done otherwise. You have the affairs of our church, which I did not want to be unknown to you. The rest, as I said, Johann will report, whom I commend to you greatly; for he is modest and pious. He conducted himself well with us and made no small progress in good letters.</p>
      <p>Byrchmann has returned to London, and I have not yet dealt with him about the books; I hope to send my book to you after autumn, if I am not hindered, on celibacy and monastic vows to be printed, in which I respond to the calumnies of Smyth. I am sorry that I have not received letters from you for a long time; but since things are turbulent throughout Germany, I am not surprised that they have not reached me; but when it is possible, do not fail (I pray) to write something.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray earnestly to the immortal God for the expansion and propagation of the kingdom of Christ here, and greet all your colleagues in my name, especially Gwalter, Bibliander, and above all Mr. Pellican. June 14, 1552. Oxford.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the pious and most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
