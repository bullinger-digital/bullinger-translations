      <p>Worthy and highly trusted, dear sir, I have duly received your letter along with the enclosed note and also express my friendly thanks for it.</p>
      <p>That the Emperor, or rather others who are ill-disposed towards me, are once again so vehemently insisting on expelling me from the Confederation because I comforted the people of Constance in their tribulation and showed them due compassion, I am unfortunately well aware of, and also that the five places are faithfully helping with this, and I express my great thanks for your good thoughts, advice, etc. I have once gone to Baden on the next day and then twice written to all places and each individually for a safe conduct for a fair hearing and requested it, to which I received the answer that they would send their envoys on the next day to deal with what is of common benefit and honor (or rather?) to the Confederation, etc. I have also written to my king, complained and requested him to take up my cause on the next day; also, the king's envoys, orators, assure me to do the best for my sake.</p>
      <p>The people of Basel told me 4 weeks ago, since the Emperor is writing so incessantly against me and they might perhaps face trouble because of me, their advice is that I should leave the city for a few months until the rumor passes; they will not, however, expel my household, wife, or children, etc. To which I have submitted my complaints in writing. They have then decided to let the matter rest until the next day, from which I gather that my case is becoming the case of the Confederation and they have very little intention of maintaining and upholding their own freedoms.</p>
      <p>But I still trust in dear God and His truth, the common Confederates will not expel me unheard, and, if I am now heard, they shall learn from my simplicity the true and honest report, that they will not only rightly and justly protect and shield me, but also show a kind compassion towards me. For it will never be found otherwise than that I have done nothing in the unfortunate war other than what my superiors commanded and my promised, pledged service was; also, this matter was not mine. I would gladly spend a hundred crowns or two if I now knew when or where and that it was applied.</p>
      <p>So I ask you to show this my letter to Mr. Bernhard von Cham, my particularly trusted lord and friend, whom I know would bear special compassion towards me, and that I ask for his, as well as Mayor Haber's and the banner bearer's special advice and good opinion in this matter.</p>
      <p>And whatever you learn from him, send it to me without delay by your own or otherwise certain messenger.</p>
      <p>I earn this with great diligence and will. Where will our God drive me? How long will the persecution persist with me? If I did not solely trust in the help of the Almighty (for I am abandoned by all friends and the world), it would not be surprising if I despaired of myself.</p>
      <p>Now my dear wife and children pity me, although I have a most gracious king in France who keeps me very well, yet because I may not let my religion be noticed, I have no desire for it. May the gracious, dear God be steadfast with me, amen.</p>
      <p>I have come to about 60,000 florins of goods; if it were now over. Mr. Bernhard von Cham will well know on what grounds and how I comforted Constance; I have no doubt about him and other lords in Zurich; they will not abandon me. Oh God, why did I not stay in Zurich when I came there sick? I would pay 1,000 crowns for it. Now I must worry that if a sea is made over me once, or if I must move out of Basel, no place will take me anymore; thus I am completely banished from Germany and can never return to my loss.</p>
      <p>So I am not very delighted with the new tidings you write to me, and I have no doubt that the Emperor, the devil, and their adherents will not achieve anything with all their swift practices against the Saxon cities, France, and the Confederates and all those who wish to live Christianly and honestly. They will set up England and whoever may be of use to them. But I am of hopeful confidence that my king has now been made aware of all these dealings; so the common Confederates should also rightly understand and let us poor miserable Swabians be a good example to them, not to let themselves be misled or hindered by anyone else's faith, who yet believe Christianly on all sides, (since no one goes to hell for another and no one gladly lets another take his place in heaven), to unite among themselves and with a king (who can help them humanely) in a new alliance and to unite harmoniously among themselves. If that happens, I have little concern, God will, in view of the perfidy and the cruel tyranny, raging and raging, which our godless adversary exercises incessantly, share His grace with us, overthrow the dragon from us. I would be completely unafraid if such a bond with God could follow. France would also not let itself be drawn in so easily, as you have been written to (without mentioning Rome).</p>
      <p>If I have helped this Emperor to cross the king for the fifth time with great army, yet with God's help, the Confederates and others have remained upright, and the Emperor has achieved little against him. I also ask you most earnestly not to take it amiss that you should persuade to a good alliance and not (as I have heard) be so harsh against it in your preaching as you are said to have done at one time, then we are strong enough with God. He cannot be so well prepared if the Confederates want to grant a better passage, how will he bring people out of the empire? Not all corners can be guarded. If he then sets up against the Confederates, as you report, they may break out in other places and attack him in other places in the empire. I cannot understand otherwise than that my king is desirous of the alliance with the Confederates, also believe he will soon set and announce a day himself. So you should, as the highly intelligent one, help with the union and alliance among your people; then we will certainly sit quietly and remain well. That you think the king has great disobedience because of the harsh punishment, the Emperor has a thousand times more in the empire; he has incurred the displeasure of all electors, princes, great lords, cities, nobles, and communities, attacking and aggravating them so tyrannically; if it once began to break, no one would be able to hold it anymore.</p>
      <p>I ask you to not take my writing amiss, especially to be of good opinion against you. I believe the one who sent you the note through you has written to you about all sorts of such strange new tidings. I warn you not to give him a frightening answer about the Confederates and their and all our dealings, but to make the matter brave and good against the man, also write to him that my case is not bad; for I come to know, although he is free of his condition against the city of Augsburg, he is still a servant of the Fuggers; they are backbiters; he might perhaps want to learn from you how things stand everywhere with and around us. You do not know these people properly. Yet let me remain in trust unmentioned; I mean well, I testify with God.</p>
      <p>I ask the same man to let the enclosed note come to him as soon as you have certain news, and when something comes back to you from him, please let it come to me without delay, if you do not have a messenger, by your own.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to you in friendly manner and await your and other lords' good opinion without delay. The grace of God be with us all.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel on the 30th of January in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>S[ebastian] Schertlin, knight, [sub]scripsit.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my gracious lord, to hand.</p>
