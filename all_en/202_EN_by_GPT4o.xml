      <p>The widow of the late Matthias Zell has come to you, a pious and holy woman, to perhaps find some relief from her grief; for in this matter, she is greatly overcome by the flesh. For God sometimes humbles great minds endowed with great gifts. Her zeal for the least and afflicted brothers of Christ is incredible. However, in that she bears the longing for her loved ones impatiently and attributes to herself remarkable faults, she is all too human. But thus the Lord tests. Bear with her patiently here and console her.</p>
      <p>Out of love for her deceased husband, certainly a sincere and faithful servant of Christ, she does not bear everything rightly, just as none of us always perform our duty in a similar case. Keep her commended to you.</p>
      <p>She can tell about the people of Strasbourg, which indeed I cannot write. However, I will say this one thing: their envoys have returned from Augsburg and have brought back such edicts that the assemblies have ended, leaving nothing but to lose one's soul for Christ, to find it with Christ, or to lose it eternally if one wishes to live for the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>Philipp (Melanchthon) will steadfastly defend the kind of doctrine he has hitherto expounded, with God's help. I have his words; but they are not at hand now; otherwise, I would have transcribed them.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your family and all the brothers, and be strong. For Christ lives and will soon take vengeance on His own.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 16th in the morning, almost before I had risen, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger and Konrad Pellikan, his in the Lord.</p>
