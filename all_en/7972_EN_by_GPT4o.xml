      <p>C[oelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] S. D. Your letters, esteemed lord and brother, have greatly refreshed me, as I learned from them that you have been restored to your former health by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>It was also pleasing that you wrote to me about your age, which is almost the same as mine. I pray to God that He may preserve it for the glory of His holy name and the salvation of the church (for such men are needed in this time of great turmoil in all things) for a very long time. The matter you dealt with was most pleasing to all of us. Therefore, I thank you as much as I can on behalf of everyone and I rejoice that pious men have felt my recommendation to you, so that our Ramus also had no small weight with the most illustrious man, Mr. Rudolf Gwalther. However, I do not doubt that you have been informed by Mr. Haller about what happened in Bern afterwards. Indeed, I am tormented when I see certain men, who hold the highest positions in the church, striving for nothing else but to bury the holy memory of Zwingli and Oecolampadius in eternal oblivion. But truly, as you rightly write, the Lord will soon destroy the deceitful shepherds. However, those who have authority in the church must strive to counteract their schemes. But enough of this for the wise. You see Peter Ramus, a man outstanding in both piety and learning, whom you so dutifully ordered to be greeted; I do not doubt that his meeting will be most pleasant for you, from whom, as he is now very knowledgeable about our people, you will hear many things that will be worth knowing; therefore, I will not add more.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother, with all your family, whom I truly love and for whom I pray to the Lord for all happiness.</p>
      <p>Here on the 6th of August at the fourth and a half hour in the morning, we felt an earthquake, which although it has natural causes, I fear it may portend something, which indeed we must pray that God may turn to His glory.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most esteemed patron and most beloved brother. If you write back to me, which indeed may be done at your convenience, see to it that the letters are faithfully delivered to us and at the same time let me know whether you have received my hastily written letter, in which I informed you about the death of Eblinger, the pastor of Milusian, which I sent through a certain local minister of yours. Farewell again, Basel, August 22, 1569.</p>
      <p>C[oelius] S[ecundus] Curio, yours sincerely [subscribed]. To the most illustrious Antistes of the Church of Zurich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, [lord] and most esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
