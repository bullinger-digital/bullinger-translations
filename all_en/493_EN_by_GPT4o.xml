      <p>Dearest, truly beloved lord and brother, your friendly brotherly letter has reached me well, but the one from Winterthur only appeared on Friday through Hieronymus Kofman, the other, which you addressed to my dear brother and me, only yesterday; for it was delivered to the city. He sent me your letter to him, in which you wrote about the day in Baden and what was discussed there. It is not possible for me to answer you; for today I have so much to write to the city, to my brother, and to a dear cousin who has just come from Basel, and this young Melchior wants to leave soon, worried that he will not be able to arrange his belongings from Zurich to Constance, lest they be lost. Also, Funcklius has come here and is still here, having all sorts of matters to handle with me on his behalf; therefore, please excuse my poor, negligent writing; I will make up for it all later.</p>
      <p>I thank you with all possible gratitude for all the heartfelt brotherly loyalty and love you show us. May the rich God repay everything a thousandfold here and there, amen, amen.</p>
      <p>The writings of Calvin, which you mentioned, please, for God's sake, share with me as soon as you can, as you have written to me. May God give strength and grace to us all, so that we do not fall behind. I experience daily much weakness in many, on whose foundation I had built much and great.</p>
      <p>Strange things are being dealt with. But the royal commissioners have left Constance the day before yesterday. The colonel is also not there now. I wrote to you earlier about an error; it was written to me by the good Funcklio, who was told by a councilor in the presence of several others, namely that those who had left, with whom negotiations were held, should pay a certain amount and then be free to go wherever they pleased, if they did not wish to stay in Constance. But the latter is different; no one is allowed to leave; instead, they should all move into the city, swear, and act like others.</p>
      <p>There is concern about the guild master Bär, who is said to be already persuaded by his wife and friends to go in; for they demanded 400 florins from him, but now want to take 150; if he does, it is a terrible example, as he has always been a good, pious, honest, and capable man. With the other guild master Labhart, who was also a delegate in Augsburg, they have also negotiated, and some fear he will also waver and come in, and my brother writes himself, he fears greatly, it is more than half done with him. Oh God, that would be a great sorrow; I could trust no one more, as he has always been a good, Christian, heartfelt man. How miserable we are, that we so easily forget God and our salvation and weigh everything so lightly. But one moves the other, and if the foundation is not right, it happens quickly. Oh Lord God, keep us in your eternal grace and love.</p>
      <p>Ludwig Heuruß, from whom they demanded 2000 florins, offered them a hundred florins, if he could be reconciled and stay outside the city. They took this as a great contempt of royal majesty. It is said that they do not intend to listen to my dear brother, cousin, and the city clerk, that they should be reconciled, and that is the best; praise God, God will preserve them well.</p>
      <p>My dear brother has petitioned and earnestly insisted that he be allowed to sell his wine in the city; for he has wine worth several thousand florins, to sell, so that the creditors can be paid. This has been granted to him, and some have been appointed for this; however, the money should all remain in the city.</p>
      <p>The imperial ban has not yet been lifted. The bishop has also not yet allowed anyone to follow him into his territories, nor does he want to go into the city, saying among other things: Constance is not only under the ban, but also under the pope's excommunication, as they have not been absolved; it would not be convenient for him to move in; also, if they do not want to restore everything to him, what should he do there. But it has been briefly told to him: he will be allowed and given what he still finds there; what is gone, is gone; the king will not make him and the other priests rich and will completely ruin the city; if he does not want to go in, the royal majesty will appoint another bishop there, etc.</p>
      <p>They are also beginning to take the spiritual goods and revenues into their hands and are taking over all matters, including the palatinate in Constance, which they have not wanted to touch with the slightest until now.</p>
      <p>Your sermons have now come to me bound; they were lost with the quaternione. I will now read them diligently, seeking and having my pleasure and comfort in them.</p>
      <p>My dear brother and I will see, as soon as he comes out again, how we want to direct our affairs and where we want to go; for we can well imagine that our stay in Thurgau or other common offices will not be much longer, and even if they want to let us stay, if we could endure it rightly, it would still be difficult for us to deal with the bailiff. We hope and are confident that Zurich or Bern will not cast us out, but will graciously grant us shelter according to the state of our affairs.</p>
      <p>That the Confederates have given the pope such a unanimous good answer pleases me greatly and many good people; may God grant high grace, that perhaps a people may rise against him in such a way that he is worthy of his help and sure protection and defense. I can say no more; for God's sake, keep well and pray heartily for us.</p>
      <p>Nephew from brother Albert writes from Strasbourg that Fagius has gone to England, and Bucer is following; but their wives and children remain in Strasbourg. The bishop has summoned the other preachers to Zabern; but they have given reasons for their absence; he is planning to establish a fine reformation.</p>
      <p>Buffler writes yesterday from Isny that it is certain and true that there was such a great earthquake in Eisleben, and such a storm, that all people thought it was the last day; for at midnight everything around the city for a whole mile was on fire for half an hour, and a great drum like a giant trough fell in the middle of the square in the city, pure fire, starting the fire and throwing out flames, as one makes fireballs, until nothing was left; but no one was harmed. 24th April.</p>
      <p>His brother-in-law from Nuremberg was with him, said they had certain knowledge that it was true.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his friend as a venerable and dearest brother.</p>
