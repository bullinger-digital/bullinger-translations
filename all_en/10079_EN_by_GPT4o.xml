      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>You sent to Basel, dearest brother, and thus handled the letters, so that I seem to live not as a stranger, but in the delights of the soul, even though it has not yet succeeded for me according to my wish, and as you also hope with great desire will happen to me. Yet I enjoy hope in such a way that I am not at all afraid to leave without a dowry. But as for what certain thing I might now inform you, I do not have. In the meantime, a messenger presented himself to me whom I did not want to leave empty-handed; if a freer opportunity permits, I will write. Meanwhile, you continue as you have begun, and console my wife, who is quite afflicted; announce in my name that I will return shortly, not without the interest of greater fortune. May the Lord grant that we bear all things with an even mind in the meantime, being diligent in duty and the undertaken province, carrying on a good fight until the day of our expedition.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write about. The people of Basel went to Strasbourg the day before, bringing joyful news and having fully achieved their wish, as Rudolf Fry, a pious man, reported to the brothers. We hope that the creator of all things will soon repair such a lamentable event with the great interest of his power. For the sake of this matter, do not cease to apply all efforts of your mind, nor be afraid. I will never fail in my prayers for such holy endeavors.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my delight, dearest brother, do not forget my afflictions in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Given on the 18th day of December in the year 1531.</p>
      <p>Gervasius Scholasticus, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers in Christ, especially my Erasmus, who with wonderful efforts of the mind has relieved me of my afflictions. Marcus Berzius, a devotee of the brothers, greets you.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, truly mine in the Lord.</p>
