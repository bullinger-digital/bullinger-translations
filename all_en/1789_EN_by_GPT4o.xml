      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, listen and be amazed. I said, when I was with you, that I suspected someone among the leaders in Basel had embraced Anabaptism, and when you compelled me to name the person, I could not disobey Bullinger and I spoke. Now I affirm to you that two Italians who were Anabaptists have returned to the purity of our doctrine and they openly declare that they gave the new baptism to the one I mentioned to you, so that I consider the matter certain. But listen to the rest: both of them affirm that they were led astray by Camillo, and one, who is present, gravely and prudently accuses him to his face and adds that the entire Anabaptism of Italy depends on that poisoned skin, as you are accustomed to say. I have warned the pastors of Chur about this matter. Meanwhile, in the new church which the Lord has given me, I will excommunicate him. For I am setting out with God as my guide tomorrow at first light. The lords of Bregaglia have assigned me two envoys to warn the inhabitants of that valley to refrain from injury; for we hear many threats. But may I become a martyr! I will not be far off. They know that I have so far driven out the mass from eight towns and they fear that the Lord may work the same through me among them, and they trust in their arm and power, but I in God himself. The brothers in Strasbourg ask me whether Bortolameus Fontius, who once professed among them, is still alive, and whether I know where he is. I therefore beg you to write to Sturm that he is alive, is very familiar to me, and perseveres in the way of the Lord, and that I can arrange for him to return to them. I did not have the leisure to write to Sturm himself now. Farewell and be well. Pray for me more diligently, since certainly greater dangers are imminent than ever before. May the Lord bless your labors. Amen. Chiavenna, January 10, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother and lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
