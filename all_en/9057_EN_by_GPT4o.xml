      <p>S. I received the response to my two letters, most esteemed father, through Mr. Stuppan and I thank your reverence greatly for it, especially since I understood that you did not interpret the delay in transcribing those letters negatively. Indeed, I was so distracted by business immediately after the sermon that I was not even able to extract the main points. Moreover, that lazy scribe wrote his script in such a way that no one could read it, even if they wanted to. No one has seen that incomplete work except for Campell, who will not be a detriment to anyone. As for the history of this most monstrous robbery, he shared it with me on the same day that the most illustrious Count arrived, who, as soon as he met me with his usual great affability, discussed each detail with me at length. To avoid any delay, I quickly sent it by horseback messenger through the efforts of Mr. Tscharner, the son of the late consul, to Mr. Müller at night, so that he could translate it for us from French into Latin, which I hope to receive tomorrow so that I can translate it into German. But I have sent almost fewer letters, certainly in frequent correspondence, to the Three Leagues to almost every brother, so that I am completely exhausted from writing and my right thumb is not in good condition. The brothers had to be warned, as those French tricks have been almost secretly until now.</p>
      <p>The Pargellers and Engadiners are acting very disloyally and treacherously not only to those who remember me in any way, but also to the union, etc. In Italy and other places where people are similarly Catholic, honorable people find this murder very displeasing and are ashamed of the fruits of their faith. In the Upper League, Captain Baschle Castelberger (as I have seen there) was here in Chur with other braggarts and used much jubilation and pomp; he truly believed that it should be in the same way as in previous years, when he secretly withdrew against the prohibition of the authorities and led people away by night and gained great wealth with his pursuit. And as I hear today, he has intended to do the same again; but his and other communities and honorable people have spoken to him in such a way that he has been stopped. In the Upper League, they are completely against it. So I have no doubt, although those in Langnetz (as fervent Papists) would like to be involved, other communities will not let them do anything; for the matter has become too early public. I know of no community in Prättigau that wants to join. Davos wants to seek the evangelical places of the Confederation, although the captaincy there has fallen into a large family, namely to Mr. Ammann Peter Guler's father-in-law, and some might be quite eager, who have not been thoroughly informed so far. But I have written a whole sheet to all three Ammanns and to other honorable people, who will certainly have done their best and are concerned that people look to you. There are also some in Prättigau who would like to send messengers to the evangelical places for thorough information.</p>
      <p>However, the simple people in Grüsch have been inclined to look to the Seven Places; but they thought the Seven Places were the evangelical places as of old, and so they have left some cats on the roof, so that they might carry out their practice. But now that they have become aware of the deception, they are very upset, etc. Here in Chur, it was announced before the sermon yesterday, and there is a unanimous opinion among all guilds not to let anyone join, and many also think of renouncing the union with the murderous king. After the sermon, there was an open call and prohibition in the church that no one should join foreign lords and not the king of France under penalty of losing life, honor, property, and wife and children, etc.; also, if agitators are caught, they should be punished according to their deserts, etc. The child cries out in the street against the gruesome bloodhound. May God make him recognize his sin. I fear greatly that there will be something new with the union, which might be confused with the same treasure; for some are very disturbing, who would have gladly helped the Spaniard to the board before. May God grant right understanding. The ambassador acts as if he is not in great need, but he has long occupied the offices; if one is good, they are all good.</p>
      <p>So I do not think at all that it will be allowed to join, and it should be a thorn in the heart of the Papists, Bast von Tschiertschen and Johannes Berus from Schanfigg, opposite Tschiertschen. - "Here goes the story, Strotza was slain by his own servants; others say only captured by those servants who were evangelical under him, and they have slain his other servants, and they have equipped his entire armada to support the evangelicals."</p>
      <p>Chur, 1572, October 8.</p>
      <p>"I almost forgot this, which Mr. Müller told me yesterday from the mouth of the envoy: he is certain that about 15,000 Spaniards, etc., have arrived in Milan. So I ate at Pantaleon's house last night; there was a fine nobleman along with Mr. Laurentius Limacius and Mr. Heinrich Fabricius, the poet laureate, who indicated that he had come from the sea and had seen the procession as he went the same way, that about 25,000 Spaniards and Italians are moving here, and he believes, to strengthen and assist Albano."</p>
