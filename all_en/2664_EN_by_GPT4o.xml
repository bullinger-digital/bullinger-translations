      <p>Through our Zurzach merchants, you will have received a letter; since then, a friend in Augsburg writes about the Imperial Diet:</p>
      <p>On the 10th of June, the lord of the Tan, legate of the younger princes from Saxony, tells me: "We have put the priest's hat to the spear at the throat; we want to make a fire." Today, 11th of June, the bishops of Eichst채tt and W체rzburg are preparing to leave; many cities have departed.</p>
      <p>Perhaps even the greater heads would leave if they had something to satisfy them. There are those who say that things are going well regarding religion, others deny it and say that the priests have retracted everything that has been done so far. At the wedding of the middle son of Frederick XVI, there were princes who soon after the wedding sent Elector Augustus and Landgrave of Hesse to Henry of Brunswick; what they are negotiating, time will reveal. John the Margrave has 4000 horsemen and 20 companies of soldiers and, together with the entire house of Brandenburg, demands that the bishops and Nuremberg restore the margraviate to Albert, which they could easily obtain if they hoped to achieve firm and certain peace from here."</p>
      <p>Another writes also from Augsburg on the 25th of June: "There is a strange weather in the sky. The two bishops of Eichst채tt and W체rzburg left hastily on the morning of the last day of May. Two princes are supposed to come, Margrave Hans and Margrave George of Brandenburg (or Baden, I don't know which it is), it is murmured quietly, no one knows how or where; daily they are awaited, and if one does not want to deal with it properly, it will begin; especially those from Nuremberg are greatly worried. God knows whom it will affect; it might not spare us either and quite rightly before others." The papists are so lamented in every way that they cannot yield even a little; our people, although they do not seek the tumult of wars, do not greatly avoid it either. May Christ Jesus preserve his churches in perpetual and solid peace.</p>
      <p>I also send what our Welser wrote, since it was not possible to describe these things due to the contraction of time. I commend us diligently to our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom with your household and all friends and brothers, farewell eternally. Greet your family reverently with all the colleagues, especially Mr. Gwalther, Pellican, Theodor, Wolf, etc. On the first of July 1555. Our consul Fuchsius and Jacob the elder with the younger Funck and my wife send you respectful and friendly greetings. I send these to Baden through the most honorable wife of Samuel Witenbach to your woman, who, invited by her mother, will bathe with her in the baths. I wish you could meet her and console her in such great inconvenience of her husband. He is a very unpleasant, quarrelsome man in the house; the good, pious woman is very much pitied by me and other people; if the coal had come closer, she would not have had to move so far from her own.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
