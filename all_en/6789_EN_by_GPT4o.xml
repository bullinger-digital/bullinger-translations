      <p>Now these are the things I write: I have seen the game right before my eyes and noticed that Mr. Tscharnner, as soon as the messenger from the city of Zurich came, understood something about the cards; he would like to carry on both shoulders. Because he dispatched the messenger in the Upper League with letters, which they absolutely do not need; it was done solely to delay the messenger, as today also comes writing from the Upper League, and yet the messenger is still not here. Everything happens through deceit. The writing from the Upper League demands that a meeting be called today from the God's House; knowing well that no one can be here today except Consul Tscharnner and it would suit them for the game, as they also come from the Upper League no more than those 5. Now I am convinced from all that I see before my eyes, the companions (it will be Rozins, Consul Tscharnner, and a few others) will write to Zurich today, saying their arrival is not necessary; it is not needed; they have good hope, and some other very vain things; because I know these people very well. So now knowing firstly, that this is done by a few people in such great haste, without the knowledge of their lords and communities; therefore, there is nothing to build on; because from the God's House, young Mr. Hans von Castelmur, who now secures the castle, will not let anyone be called; because he sees the deceit, etc. Furthermore, knowing that upon our gracious lords of Zurich's writing, the appointed and commanders from the God's House have called the God's House people and have set the appointed day and also sent a copy of my lords of Zurich's writing to each community. Now if these companions write the counterplay to Zurich and the appointed make the envoys turn away and yet the honorable people from the God's House should come in vain on such a distant day upon our lords of Zurich's writing, you can well imagine what good that would bring. Therefore, for God's sake, ensure that the messengers are here at the appointed time. The beginning of the 2 Leagues is not needed there. When they see the seriousness, they will come. Believe me, the companions would like to prolong the matter until they can deal with the advice of their Palatines. I know the companions very well. Therefore, for God's sake, help that the matter proceeds. Consul Tscharnner handles things secretly through intermediaries. When my gracious lords from the 6 places come, he will be very smooth and will not want to be seen there. One must know and use the people as far as one can. I encounter many such things. I sometimes have to deal with people (I am ashamed to say, who are in the governments), who ask and command me to write or act (to divert suspicion from themselves), and they go to the cities and write and act in the counterplay. Whoever does not understand the cooper's work does not understand the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>I write these things with a sigh and had intended to write to no one but you. I often sigh; for where justice has perished and all shame is banished, there certainly is no longer a place to live. Forgive me, who writes everything so hastily and tumultuously. Urge the matter, so that what has been well begun is not interrupted.</p>
      <p>Chur, the 17th of May, in the year 1566.</p>
      <p>In such serious matters, it would be better to send a sober messenger than a drunken one, etc. My lord of Cham and the previous Confederates have lodged in Hans PÃ¼ndter's house; it is a nice inn and a dear man.</p>
