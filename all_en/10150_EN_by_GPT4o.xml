      <p>To the most learned, illustrious, and upright men Heinrich Bullinger and Theodor Bibliander, who bear the office of Huldrych Zwingli, the most invincible hero, in Zurich, esteemed teachers and patrons, Konrad Geßner sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Whenever I, reverend teachers, begin to ponder the immense ingratitude of our age, it is astonishing to say how much my entire mind is consumed with pain. "So rare is faith in friendships, so ready is the forgetfulness of the dead," to use the words of Pliny. For there is no one among us who even with a single word reveals a grateful mind towards that most valiant hero, the father of the fatherland and the light of the world, Huldrych Zwingli, in whose footsteps (which may happily fall to the entire republic of Zurich) you now also tread. I rightly call him a hero, as no force, no threats, no treachery, and finally no envy ever swayed him from truth and honor. Therefore, he is most worthy not only to be praised with words but also to be depicted in gold, ivory, silver, and Parian marble. That hero, I say, a man of sole praise, of perfect and complete virtue, while he is celebrated with the highest honor among foreign nations, lies neglected among us alone, from whom he deserved the most. No honor is given to him, no reverence, no gratitude at all for his benefits.</p>
      <p>This is what I grieve, what bites me the most, φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ (a heart grieved for a friend). For whenever I hear his name, my voice is weakened by tears, and my entire mind is hindered by sorrow. Indeed, he would be of an iron heart, or rather impious, whom such a great disaster of the entire Christian republic would not move. For we have lost a man, to whom no one in our age was similar, to say otherwise would be sacrilege. He was easily the foremost in every virtue, learned, mixing the useful with the honorable, taught in laws, judgments, and arms, presiding over the Church of Christ with no less justice than courage, a man endowed with great intelligence, greater truth, and the greatest faith. Nature circumscribed a small course of life for him, but immense glory. Which indeed, the less he sought it, the more he will have it living and perpetual among all the faithful.</p>
      <p>In the house of Wolfgang Fabricius Capito in Straßburg, August 10, 1532.</p>
