      <p>The Emperor had his steward in Nuremberg at the end of February and arranged accommodations there for mid-March, as he intends to travel to the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. His plan and intention is to dissolve the League, which is supposed to be concluded in Worms on April 1st, etc. If he cannot achieve this, he will turn to arms and lead Spaniards, Sicilians, Italians, and other people from his lands in large numbers over the Germans through the mountains. He is also said to have summoned all the princes and estates to personally come to Regensburg, but it is suspected that they will not come as he wishes. There is also supposed to be a plan against the cities of the Upper Country in the Gospel, to prevent them from helping those in the Lower Country. For if the Emperor is determined, he will attack both from below and above. March 7th.</p>
