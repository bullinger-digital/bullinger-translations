      <p>S. After I had sealed the previous letters, a messenger arrived with yours, which I read with great delight. How much more I would prefer Philipp over Brentius, even though Brentius is not ungrateful in the name of public misery, but no one has caused more turmoil in the matter of the Eucharist after Luther. If only, warned by true events, we could all focus on this one thing, that according to the apostle, the churches that claim purer doctrine would be united in one mind! It cannot be believed that those who diverge so much in the interpretations of the scriptures profess the same faith.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, 14 ships with armed sailors arrived yesterday, having traveled from Bregenz and down the Rhine with about 9 ships, having kept it very quiet until the approach. Be careful, they might occupy the city. The gates leading to Thurgau have been firmly closed, and all the emperor's anger will be to the benefit of the House of Austria, to which Konstanz has now been incorporated. It will serve in the expansion, and it is intended to become the principal seat of the Duchy of Swabia, which the emperor and Ferdinand certainly plan to establish. The gospel has been suppressed; it will cause great dispersion and a significant setback, as the common people have fallen away from their authority so distrustfully and have come to such desperate counsels for the sake of their own benefit. But what can one say? The clerical servants do not like to let the richest soups cool outside the door.</p>
      <p>The fishermen in Konstanz would have liked to have them long ago; it will happen now. May God protect us from such falls. Amen.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller does not doubt in his letters to me that Lord Musculus will obtain some significant place for sowing the word. If anything can be done with my help for this matter, I will not refuse any effort that can benefit such a great man.</p>
      <p>I am sending everything back perhaps later than I wanted; but some things were also returned to me slowly by friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>The day as above.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the city of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
