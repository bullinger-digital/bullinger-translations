      <p>Greetings. I send questions, as I understand them. I can decide nothing; I do not know what the nature of initiation or the first orders is.</p>
      <p>However, I see that those who propose these things would abhor them if it were free. But the question is whether a lesser evil should be endured for the sake of a greater good.</p>
      <p>I hear that some people from Strasbourg once received orders in the March from a certain bishop who loved the gospel, on the advice of Bucer, so that they could be promoted in Alsace.</p>
      <p>As I understand it, he proposes two questions: First, whether it is permissible to receive the first orders and thus become a canon, to devote oneself to letters, serve the school, or preach the gospel.</p>
      <p>For example, the Bishop of Worms has the collation of benefices in that city; therefore, he will confer them on no one unless initiated; but still, in a free imperial city, he cannot force them to perform superstitions or masses, but is compelled to leave them free in religion. Such people can use the resources of the church well; but it is questioned whether it is permissible to acquire them in this way. Those who affirm use this reasoning: The first initiation does not bind with a vow nor does it contain manifest impiety in itself, it is a certain obedience by which they are bound to the bishop, but only to honest and lawful things.</p>
      <p>Then, if this servitude is not undertaken, schools and churches are neglected; for they have no other resources than those conferred in this way, and no one will want to serve for free.</p>
      <p>Secondly, the question is also about the first initiation, but it differs in that the great canons, like the counts and barons of Strasbourg, receive the resources of the church in the main temple when initiated, but they do not perform masses, but from these resources maintain their status. Therefore, besides the first question about the first orders, whether it is permissible to receive them, it is asked whether nobles can use the resources of the church in this way to maintain their order, especially when, if they do not receive them, others might receive them who will perform masses; here the utility of the republic is pretended:</p>
      <p>It is in the interest of the republic and the church to protect their status with nobility, so that there are those who protect the republic. Also, either these resources must be entirely converted to superstitious use or to legitimate or civil use; but the first is impious, the second is not allowed by the bishops; therefore, the third must be tolerated.</p>
