      <p>Greetings. I have now received your letters written on the 8th of this month along with the last part on Jeremiah and four sheets on councils, which I will keep with me until I have the rest, and I will not share them with anyone, so as not to cause any harm or loss to the printer. There is no doubt that they will be very well received by everyone; if they contain everything that was in the judgment you sent to the Bishop of Rennes, I do not need them very much. I had sent what was taken from you and the earlier parts on Jeremiah to the Archbishop of Vienna, a very pious and learned man, who, however, recently exchanged the death of this life for true life, which was distressing to me due to the loss to the churches. The Prince of Condé has been released from prison and has gone to Ham, a city of the King of Navarre's brother, while his innocence is being recognized. The assembly of all of France is still ongoing, and there is great hope for the progress of the word of God and more peaceful councils. For 28 days, a great comet was seen over the city of Orléans, where the King and the nobility of France are. In Navarre, many would desire greater spirits; but I think that in time God will not fail in His duty and will govern all things and give strength to the weak. I was very delighted by what you wrote on the 3rd of this month about Rambouillet; his father and parents were intimate and very familiar to me almost from childhood; his mother was a most holy matron. He will be able to take unique care of his son next summer or at the beginning of spring.</p>
      <p>As for the people of Glarus, today I have prayed to the lords of this city that they should earnestly ensure that the whole matter is settled amicably and lawfully; they have promised me that they will make an effort to do so, and I will not omit anything at the Baden assembly. Nothing is written to me from France about the death of the Duke of Florence; therefore, I think the rumor is false. I will send gifts from Baden.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends and love us.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, January 10.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
