    <p xml:id="regest1">The council of Konstanz inquires in Zurich about Michael [Back], who proved himself as a pastor in Dußlingen near Tübingen until he was undeservedly banished; now he is up for election as a pastor in Konstanz, but he must first refute the slander that he was expelled from Zurich; Bullinger is to advocate for him. Blarer recently wrote to Leo [Jud]; in the meantime, Bucer reported on the unclear balance of power [at the Worms Religious Discussion]; the papal nuncio [Tommaso Campeggio] is said to have promised concessions, provided that the rule of the Pope is not fundamentally disputed. According to Joachim [Maler], a war stirred up by Pope [Paul III] between Emperor [Charles V] and the French King [Francis I] is threatening; the peace between [Sultan Suleiman I] and Venice will harm Christendom. Inquires about the intentions of the Confederates due to rumors and calls for prayer; greetings. Apologizes for the hasty writing.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my dearest and venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Our council writes to yours regarding the case of Michael Back, who in previous years was recommended to me by you and was appointed as the bishop of the church in Dußlingen in the Duchy of Württemberg, where he tended the flock of Christ with great success through sound doctrine and the innocence of an unblemished life, until a slanderer, who was a murderer from the beginning, managed through remarkable means to have him banished for a reason that would never have caused his downfall if he had been allowed to seek justice either with you, with us, or with any other supporters of the Gospel. Now he might be received here in the place of the deceased pastor at the Church of St. Paul, if not for some who, driven by execrable envy, spread such things about him among you as well, that he is banned from your city and land. Since I know for certain that this is false, the council has decided that your people should be informed of this matter as soon as possible. I therefore ask you to support this good cause fairly and equitably and to be an advocate to your councilors, whom you know more personally, so that they may bear full testimony to his innocence, which will greatly please God Almighty and will be a most welcome favor to both our people and us.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote to Leo, and there is nothing now that I need to inform you of, except that Bucer wrote to me yesterday, among other things, as follows: „I cannot predict what our adversaries intend to do with us.</p>
      <p>For there are those present from whom you can expect nothing of Christ, such as the Pope, the King, the Bavarians, the Archbishop of Mainz, and the Bishop of Strasbourg. On the other hand, the Elector Palatine has designated, the Margrave of Brandenburg, the Archbishop of Cologne, and the Duke of Jülich have sent, from whom you may obtain what is just. I cannot predict anything. Our people unanimously agree that nothing should be conceded that belongs to Christ himself. The papal nuncio boasts that he has orders to grant us everything we have, provided that we acknowledge him in return and proclaim him the supreme prince of the church, that is, place him alongside Christ among us, and in other churches allow him to be worshipped in the very seat of Christ, with Christ displaced. Something was to be expected from the Germans, therefore the enemies made this most unjust selection, so that not all the states are present; but the good thing is that nothing is concluded here“ etc. This is from Bucer.</p>
      <p>New seeds of war have arisen between the Emperor and the French King, which the Pope is most steadfastly striving to remove with great effort. So says our envoy Joachim. The peace between the Turk and the Venetians will be confirmed in such a way that it will result in great harm to the Christian world.</p>
      <p>Make sure to write to me diligently about what your Swiss are planning; for perpetual rumor spreads various and doubtful things. We will earnestly pray to the Lord amidst these storms and upheavals, that He may graciously grant tranquility and peace to His church in Himself and impart the spirit that stimulates us to solid repentance, we who are sluggish and most stubbornly clinging to the old mire. Above all, commend me and mine to the Lord in a Christian manner, along with your wife and brothers. My brother Thomas and the Zwickis send you many greetings and implore and beseech you, as I do, in the case of Michael. You will bid your sister, my wife, much health in my words. Again and again, farewell, my dearest and best, as well as venerable soul.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, November 17, 1540.</p>
      <p>Forgive the hasty and more than unpolished writing.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his venerable and dearest Lord Bullinger.</p>
