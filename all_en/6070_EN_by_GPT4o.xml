      <p>Dear Sir, I truly wonder about the cause of your most persistent silence; this is not what you promised, brother, when you were with us. Indeed, you affirmed that you would take the place of the blessedly remembered Maynard, who used to write frequent letters to me, and this is indeed required by brotherly love and the common governance and communication of the churches.</p>
      <p>I have been waiting until now to hear what you would write about the beginnings of your ministry, the progress of the church, and the affairs of neighboring Italy. You should not lack material for writing; you have a scribe, and couriers offer themselves.</p>
      <p>What then hinders you? By the grace of God, we are quite well and have what we need; however, our common adversaries threaten us with extreme measures unless we subscribe to the Council of Trent, that is.</p>
      <p>In Germany, serious expeditions are said to be underway. It is written that great disturbances are expected at the gates of Strasbourg, and assemblies are already being held in Worms, both because of the council and because of Amorbach. In France, that Cardinal of Lorraine is trying to stir everything up; but Beza writes that the churches are doing well.</p>
      <p>He also adds that we should pray for Master Calvin, who is lying gravely ill; may God preserve him for us. For on the first of February, Hyperius died in Marburg; this month, Ruger died in Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>It is indeed a good thing that Castellio died in Basel. Our Bernardino is hiding in Nuremberg, about to enter Poland; he is preparing a bitter writing against us; so it is written to me from Nuremberg. Brentius lost 50 or 60 folios, in which he smeared his case about the ubiquity of Christ's flesh and even placed it in heaven among the infernos, where he is said to have inveighed against us most bitterly; I have not yet seen the book.</p>
      <p>These things, of course, seem to be necessary in our afflicted times. May God look upon us, and may He preserve you and yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 17, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
