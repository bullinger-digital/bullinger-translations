    <p xml:id="regest1">Is just as willing as the guardian [of Dorothea Wirz] to keep the promises [regarding her marriage to Jakob Walder]; both regret the delay and do not blame Bullinger for it. Recommends asking the bailiff [Sulpitius Haller] for mediation and visiting the relatives [of the girl] in his company; Wirz and the guardian offer their services. The letter from the mayor [Heinrich Walder] to [Haller] has positively influenced the matter. That [Wirz and the guardian] have the girl come to them is not to take her away from the mayor, but to satisfy the bailiff; they have also written this to Heinrich [Lochmann]. Hopes for a good outcome. Requests not to be addressed with honorary titles.</p>

      <p>Honorable, highly and well-educated, especially kind, dear lords and Christian brothers, all my life, since I came to reason, I have valued nothing higher and more worthy than keeping promised loyalty and faith. I have always strived to do this with everyone - whether rich or not skilled -, to fulfill my loyalty, which has not benefited me much until now. Therefore, I am determined to fulfill what I promise to the world, as far as my life and goods allow. Therefore, kind, dear lords and Christian brothers, you should have no doubt: What I have promised you, I will truly fulfill. I also hope that I have done so in our matter until now and, God willing, will continue to do so, so that no fault will be found in me. The girl's guardian is also determined to keep what he has promised you. If there is a slight error, we bear no blame for it, and it is no less regrettable for us than for you. We also do not distrust Master Heinrich, therefore no excuse would have been necessary.</p>
      <p>However, it seems to me that the matter could be well resolved, namely in this way: If I understood correctly, the bailiff will be able to come to you. My advice would be to urge him with requests to approach the relatives on behalf of the girl, and if he promises you this, that you then ride with him and be present at the proceedings. I have no doubt it would work. Whatever we, I and the guardian, can handle well, we will not spare ourselves. We have promised you this before and now, and we will truly fulfill it; you can certainly rely on us.</p>
      <p>Also know that my lord mayor's letter to the bailiff has had a good effect; for the matter has been somewhat mitigated. Therefore, my advice would be as explained above.</p>
      <p>Therefore, kind, dear lords, it is our earnest request that you do not take it amiss that we send for the girl; for this is not done at all to take her away from the honorable man, the mayor, and marry her elsewhere, for no one, by God's grace, but the mayor's son is courting her, but solely to satisfy the bailiff. We have also written to Heinrich in Alsace about why we are sending for her; he will inform you well.</p>
      <p>Finally, I pray to God Almighty, the Father of us all, if it is His will and serves His honor, that He may bring the matter to a good beginning and a happy end with His grace. Amen.</p>
      <p>May God protect you at all times. By the way, I almost forgot, and it is the most important: Namely, on my behalf, I ask you, if you will honor me with your letters, to moderate your courtesy regarding the grand titles - "learned" and "lord" - for they do not suit me, but you. I am a poor, common, unskilled, and unworthy servant and therefore not worthy to be called a provisor, a learned lord.</p>
      <p>Given on the 16th of May in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Ulrich Wirz, your poor humble servant.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly and well-educated Master Heinrich Bullinger and Mr. Josias Meyer, my kind, dear lords in Zurich.</p>
