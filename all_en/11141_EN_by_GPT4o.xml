      <p>I wrote to you many weeks ago and entrusted the letter to Mr. Calvin, who is most loving to both you and me, as he was departing for Bern, so that it might be delivered to you from there. However, as far as I could infer from the letter you sent through Mr. Butler's messenger, mine was not delivered to you. I do not doubt that you would have mentioned it somewhere, and this matter greatly troubles and distresses me. For when my other fellow countrymen sent letters to you, and when I myself had greeted other Zurichers with letters, you could rightly accuse me of ingratitude for having overlooked you, to whom I owe so much. If I had indeed done this, I would not doubt that I would someday pay a fitting penalty to Zeus Xenios. But believe me, nothing was further from my mind, and I sent my letter to you before Mr. Butler, my singular friend and much beloved brother, had found this messenger. But unfortunately, as I see, it fell through. It certainly brought me great sorrow, not because there was anything in the letter that I consider worthy of your reading, but lest I might seem to you either a despiser of your friendship or scarcely mindful of your kindness towards me: I hardly know which of these I would less wish. It is a mark of your singular humanity that you included me in your letter to Mr. Butler. Hence, I have good hope that you will not unwillingly accept this my explanation, although, by God as my witness, I have committed no offense against our friendship, unless perhaps it is an offense that I did not send another letter to you when a certain messenger was present; in which I acknowledge some fault of mine. But who would have thought that the letter I entrusted to Mr. Calvin, and he again to Mr. Megander, would not reach you? Hereafter, if I allow any messenger from us to come to you without my letter, there is nothing to prevent you from counting me among the ungrateful or even the haters of friends; a crime which I least of all wish to cling to me. For I am, as much as anyone else, inclined to mutual love, so that I almost adore even those who wish me little good. Certainly, I hold all the learned, and those who have deserved well of me, in such delight and always before my eyes, that nothing is sweeter to them, nor more deeply rooted in my mind. How then could I forget you, whose learning has always been most pleasant and useful to me, and whose many benefits towards me are evident? Therefore, do not think that it was due to forgetfulness of you that my letters have not yet reached you; but it is something to be demanded of Mr. Megander, who did not take care to deliver my letters to you. I hope you see that I am beyond all blame, except that I did not write to you twice. I sincerely congratulate you on the birth of your son Christoph, and I am equally glad that your most praiseworthy wife has safely passed through this danger. We are eager to know what Luther and his followers are planning regarding the Eucharist. There is a rumor here, I don't know from whom, about the Bernese leaning somewhat towards Bucer's side. Here, as far as we have been able to perceive so far, everything is preached purely. I wish happiness, prosperity, and true joy in Christ to you, all your children, your excellent wife, your grandmother, and Rudolf Gwalther. Farewell, dearest to my heart, Mr. Bullinger, with all your family. To the most learned bishop of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, your singular friend.</p>
