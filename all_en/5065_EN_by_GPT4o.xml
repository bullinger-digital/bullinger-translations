      <p>Greetings. I am sure, reverend father in Christ, that you were surprised by how brief my last letter was; but the business of the market distracted me so much that I could hardly be myself. We have to preach, baptize, write, and respond to every rustic passerby to the point of exhaustion. Vergerius, too, a most troublesome man, added to all this with his obstinacy. He spread many German pamphlets, including one in which he seems to approve of that gross and carnal eating of the body of Christ. He had decided to go to you, and so it was agreed on both sides.</p>
      <p>But that night he changed his mind and took another path. If I were with you, I would have whole hours to recount to you his business and mission. For when he explained the essence of his mission to the consuls, he used me as an interpreter; Mr. Philippus was also present.</p>
      <p>The promises made in the name of the prince are magnificent, who is ready to shed even his blood and life for the Rhaetians; but he did not have the credentials to prove the credibility of his mission, and therefore, because his vanity is known to all, his words do not earn any trust among us.</p>
      <p>Hercules von Salis and his son Rodolphus were with me for several hours, who described the bad arts of this man in detail. I believe you are aware of what he did with Lady Isabella.</p>
      <p>Rodolphus (he is the one who receives such a large pension from the Venetians) solemnly affirms that Vergerius persuaded Maximilian that he was thinking of setting up a hospital in these parts for Italian exiles and under this pretext extracted a large sum of thalers from Maximilian, and Rodolphus affirms that he was asked by Maximilian himself.</p>
      <p>King Maximilian himself asked Rodolphus whether Vergerius used the money for the poor Italians, and when Rodolphus denied it, King Maximilian shook his head. See where I am led.</p>
      <p>When he proposed his opinion on the sacrament rather evasively and said many things against the people of Zurich during his speech, whose letters were circulating throughout Germany, in which they called Christian princes antichrists, and that Bullinger had said that if he came to France, he should be treated with dignity, etc., I nevertheless took it upon myself to respond, and he shouted so furiously that he would not hear a word from me. He acted like a deaf man; I did not want to be mocked by such rudeness. Philippus Gallicius was also present, who himself took up the conversation; but he did not want to hear him either; finally, he was forced to listen, and I swear by my soul that I felt nothing but a devilish arrogance in that man. And above all, he wanted to instill his opinion on the sacrament in everyone who approached him; he, in turn, did not deign to listen to anyone, only to thunder his missions to kings with great pride. When a certain minister approached him, Aurelius, his nephew, already known to all for his virtues, dared to insult me in my absence with these words: "When Fabricius tried to speak about the sacrament yesterday, he was splendidly refuted by Vergerius." Thus these most vain men triumph over my modesty. Among other things, he repeatedly emphasized to everyone who encountered him: it is a matter of indifference to believe in the carnal or spiritual eating of the body; if the learned were called to a colloquy, he would always be ready to subscribe to that party for the sake of concord, which would win by votes. If those called Zwinglians won, he would subscribe to them, if Lutherans, he would join them. I have heard this from him and no one else speaks of it; but there are others who have also heard it, and as soon as one begins to speak, he acts like a deaf man. He exhausted himself and others with these exclamations: "I do not want to dispute, I do not want to listen; I did not come for the sake of disputing, but I was sent by my prince for other business." This, reverend father, is a bit more lengthy than I intended. If he had come himself, I would not have written a word about his manners; you would have heard the man yourself. - Now I receive letters from Mr. Beccaria, which I send for you to read yourself. - The bishop's matter is, as it may be, not so bad on our side that one cannot endure it. After a long time, the matter has come to the point that it has been decided that the bishop should give an account, the beginning of which he has done today. Twelve have been appointed for this purpose.</p>
      <p>You may think that the dativus will accomplish and settle much; yet he is now to give an account as often and as frequently as the God's house requires. It should also remain that his servants are excluded from the common land councils; likewise, he should now take and give justice before the God's house and not appeal to the Two Bunds in matters of God's house.</p>
      <p>The decision has not yet come to my hand; when it does, I will share it with you. One must endure for the time being.</p>
      <p>Many envoys have not succeeded, some communities have also fallen away from us; the bishop has promised the toll to those of Ober-Port and thus turned them away from us. - I have been in the fief this year.</p>
      <p>May God grant that it may turn out better in the future, especially for the sake of my studies. I have prepared a little book for printing for certain important reasons.</p>
      <p>When it comes to your hands, you will have patience with me, considering this current confused, miserable time; one pulls me out here, the other out there." [...] Master Balthasar brought to me at your request [...]</p>
      <p>I send an Italian copy of Vergerius, in case you do not have it.</p>
      <p>19th of November, in the year 1561.</p>
