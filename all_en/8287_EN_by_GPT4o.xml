      <p>Greetings. Today is the eighth day since I received your last letter dated May 30th. I did not respond to it because neither did your letter require a response nor did I have anything worthy of writing. We have been expecting a response from you regarding the Froschauer case, but we have received nothing. Perhaps the great flood is preventing merchants from traveling. Whatever the case may be, we know you are not neglecting this matter. I have enclosed what I received from Augsburg yesterday, asking you in return that if you have any news from Italy, Venice, Turkey, or Spain, which are all converging today, you also share it with me. We have nothing from France, except that the princes, having left the Dauphiné, have entered Auvergne with the admiral. Everyone is talking about peace being made; however, no one dares to confirm it. I received letters from Mr. Gregorius; you will thank him for them and greet him most kindly. Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>Zürich, June 9, 1570.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Consul, Pontisella, Bonet, and our other friends, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
