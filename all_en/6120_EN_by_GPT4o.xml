      <p>Greetings. I believe, esteemed father and lord, that my letters have been delivered to you by our Ulysses Martinengo. Now, regarding my infrequent writing, there is no need for me to make excuses; you yourself know the state of our affairs.</p>
      <p>The plague is so great, and the fear so immense, that not everyone dares to receive or even touch letters from anyone. Therefore, not only should you consider me excused, since it is not due to me that I do not write to you frequently; but it is especially necessary that you should commend this most afflicted church of ours to the prayers of your church.</p>
      <p>From Easter until this day, one hundred and eight have died in this small town, and every day some are taken. We are compelled to hold services outside the church in the very square; we also celebrated the Lord's Supper, but each brought his own cup; however, all drank from the same wine. We were all greatly consoled and we certainly know that all things will work for the salvation of the church. In the meantime, we cannot deny that we grieve, mourn, and pray over such a calamity; truly we are all here like sheep in the hand of the butcher.</p>
      <p>Yet we acknowledge both the mercy of God the Father towards us and also His most just judgments.</p>
      <p>May His name be blessed forever!</p>
      <p>We hear nothing from Italy; the cause is this plague of ours, which makes no one dare to come to us; therefore we now/even? fear that famine may eventually take those whom the plague does not carry off.</p>
      <p>I beseech you to pray for us and that prayers be made by the church. By God's grace, my family and I are still well; may the Father preserve us mercifully.</p>
      <p>May He also have mercy on yours; for I have heard that a similar disease is spreading there as well.</p>
      <p>I also wish to send my greetings in my name to your most honorable wife and the whole family, then to the brothers and Mr. Gesner.</p>
      <p>May God the best preserve you above all!</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, April 28, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Zanchi.</p>
      <p>Yesterday evening I wrote letters.</p>
      <p>This night eight have died, and the plague has invaded five new houses; may the Lord have mercy! To the most illustrious man and best father, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
