      <p>Most illustrious man, I am sending two booklets, which I have arranged to be printed here; please share them with the brothers. You, who are great in learning and wisdom, often publish great books; I, a humble man, amuse myself with these little booklets and celebrate my pope. Tomorrow I am going to Bern; for I have waited long enough for Lord Doctor Gribaldo and can wait no longer, as expenses and the nature of my affairs forbid it. Therefore, if he arrives, tell him that I will be in Bern and will wait there for some time, and that he should bring my nephew with him. If only you would send those letters of recommendation to Bern, which I mentioned I desired, namely to the lords of Bern. From there I will set out to see the brothers in Geneva and soon return to you, as I hope. Farewell and greetings to the whole church and school. Pray for me.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 25, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
