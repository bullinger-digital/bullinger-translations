<letter xml:id="file4020"><body><div><p>Greetings. I am now writing to the most honorable magistrate about the sorrowful news I have learned regarding the death of King Heinrich*, who was succeeded by his son Franz. Everyone should wish him sound counsel and a pious mind, so that he may burn with zeal for the house of God and that his subjects may be instructed in true doctrine. This depends on the will of God.</p><p>I pray that you write to me, when you have leisure, the main points on which you think the pious king should be advised and in which you believe errors have been made, since you know that in no matter can we deserve more from the body than in healing the eye**. From Venice, I have learned of a battle fought between two brothers, sons of the Turk, with more than forty thousand slain on both sides, after the battle was drawn out for an entire day and the following until the third hour after noon. I suppose you have heard of the controversy between the Palatines and the Bavarian over possessions, and how poorly everyone agrees in Augsburg regarding religion and the contribution against the Turk. God is able to turn all things to the glory of His name and the salvation of His own.</p><p>Greet all friends.</p><p>Farewell well.</p><p>Solothurn, July 20.</p><p>Yours sincerely.</p><p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p><p>The death of King Heinrich II of France, July 10, 1559. He was wounded in the forehead above the right eye by a broken lance; from this wound, he died.</p></div></body> *Note: Proper nouns have been translated into their modern German equivalents: Heinrich (Henry), Franz (Francis), Solothurn, and Augsburg.
