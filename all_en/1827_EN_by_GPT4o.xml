      <p>Greetings. I have long considered and also discussed with others who among our people could be given to the Duke of Württemberg to be appointed to the church of Montbéliard, and I find no one more suitable than Francis of Saint Paul, minister of the church of Vevey.</p>
      <p>He is French and noble, as I believe, by birth; in Lausanne, he taught the Greek language with praise before Mr. Beza came there; he is of vigorous age, about the same, it seems to me, as Mr. Gwalther; he possesses piety combined with excellent learning, very serious manners, and refined eloquence; he is of singular modesty and great humanity.</p>
      <p>In the matter of predestination, due to the singular modesty and moderation he believes should be applied in this debate, he seemed to differ from the others, which is why he was somewhat attacked by the people of Lausanne; but the whole matter has been settled and buried by us, as I hope. However, I think that because of this occasion, he would more willingly go there if he were called. I do not find anyone else whose character seems more suitable for such an office. I wanted to inform you of this because you have written to me about this matter several times.</p>
      <p>I have taken care of the other matters you entrusted to me. I am writing to Fridolin Götschi on behalf of all of us, that he should stay with your son-in-law or go to someone else among the learned, if he seems to be incurring excessive expenses here; however, we do not want him to stay in a public inn. I have received your Fabricius. Some of ours may soon be recalled due to some vacant positions.</p>
      <p>I have no news of new events. They say Ferdinand is seeking the friendship of the German princes and is openly criticizing his brother's plans. The prisoners in Lyon would have already been burned if they had not been saved by the sudden intervention of our senate; they still remain in chains, and our magistrate is working hard for them with the king. They implore the intercession of all churches.</p>
      <p>There is some discord in the Neuchâtel classis regarding the preservation and establishment of church discipline.</p>
      <p>There are some churches in the county of Valangin, in Valais, which have so far pursued public crimes with excommunication and have not admitted anyone excluded to communion unless they first made a public confession and penance. This discipline was instituted by Blaurer in Biel, as I hear; but since it is intolerable to many, they are beginning to argue among themselves, with some wanting to retain the customary practice, while others are accusing them of not following our example. The cause of contention is also supplied by those who, in churches where this customary discipline has not been, nevertheless try to establish it with all their might and criticize and slander others who do not attempt or intend this as not being apostolic enough. Therefore, the brothers of the aforementioned classis have proposed the question of this discipline to be judged by certain churches, and first the Genevans and Bielers have agreed, as is evident from the subscription of their council, of which I send you a transcript here.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, they also came here urgently requesting our subscription; but since they seemed to be laying traps, we did not want to subscribe. However, we responded in this manner: that discipline is indeed necessary in the church, but not all churches can use the same form; therefore, each should use that which is either customary or more conducive to edification, etc.</p>
      <p>We do not know, therefore, whether they will also come to you; I wanted to inform you of these things and at the same time ask you to instruct me further with your advice here. For I see that the people of Lausanne have been cleverly bypassed by them, but the Genevans were first asked for advice. From Tossanus's name, you will also understand that this question has already reached there. Farel, in the meantime, is gravely ill and may perhaps resolve the question by death unless the Lord helps him.</p>
      <p>This is what I have for now. I expect something new from you. Jüngius of Aarau has been called to Basel in place of Sultzer; however, he will be retained, I hope, by the authority of our senate, which is writing to him today. Musculus and all of ours are well and send you and all of yours loving greetings. Bern, March 18, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the church of Zurich, his lord and venerable compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
