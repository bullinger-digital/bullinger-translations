    <p xml:id="regest1">He has refrained from writing, partly due to doubts about their goodwill, and partly out of fear of certain people who deviate from the traditional sacramental doctrine, hate Zwingli and his followers, and only speak of Luther; yet for the sake of Zwingli and the truth, he overcomes his hesitation. In his book "On the Councils and the Church," Luther not only justified military service but also accused Zwingli of Nestorianism and furthermore alleged that he regarded the water of baptism as something external, equating it with the holy water of the Papists; it is owed to the truth and to Zwingli not to accept such slanders. He suggests responding publicly and clarifying that Zwingli did not teach Nestorianism, but - in contrast to Luther - clearly distinguished the properties of both natures of Christ, and that according to their confession, the sacramental water is different from the mere element when the word is added in the act of baptism. He asks not to disregard his advice and to support him, along with all those who are oppressed by the Lutheran party [in Bern], through letters. The messenger is in a hurry.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I have refrained for some time now (most learned men) from writing to you, partly because I feared my letters would be unwelcome to you, as I suspected your minds were somewhat alienated from me due to some bad suspicion, [which] you seemed to have conceived about me, and partly because I saw that this could not be done without danger due to the inconsistency of some, who, having abandoned the certain and probable way of discussing the sacraments hitherto used in the Swiss churches, have embraced a new and obscure one, which they try to persuade everyone with such diligence that anyone who immediately opposes them is hated worse than a dog or a snake, and they not only abhor the doctrine of Zwingli, the best of men, but also his name, and they chatter nothing but Luther, just like the blind men of Jerusalem, who abhorred the waters of Siloam flowing gently and congratulated themselves under the pride of Rezin [and] the son of Remaliah. Thus, the pious and learned simplicity of Zwingli is cast out by the disdainful pride of Luther. If not the greatest offense to the churches, yet love for the fatherland should have restrained them, not to mention the ineffable care and solicitude of our most faithful pastor, our most pious teacher Zwingli, which he never refused to undertake for the Swiss churches. But thus the most ungrateful men repay the immense labors of the best man. But what; love and zeal not only for Zwingli but especially for the truth, which I see endangered under Zwingli's name, finally overcome both shame and danger.</p>
      <p>A booklet has come out this year, published by Luther, first in Strasbourg, then printed in Wittenberg, titled "On the Councils and the Church," in which from the beginning he so commends mercenary military service that our soldiers and pensioners can justly complain of being greatly wronged by us, if Luther's writings are to be accepted as truth. Secondly, when he treats the Council of Ephesus and Chalcedon and the cause of Nestorius and Eutyches, he so openly attacks Zwingli under the name of Nestorius that only the blind cannot see, for he describes Nestorius with the same words as Zwingli in his confession. Finally, as he is an impotent man and cannot long conceal his venom, he bursts out and boasts that he had a war with the Nestorians, who denied that the deity suffered, and although they confessed Christ to be God and man, they nevertheless refused to admit the communication of idioms, so as to say that God suffered, conceding the antecedent in a good consequence, but denying the consequent, and he says that Zwingli came to this, that he wanted to read the words of the evangelist: "The Word was made flesh" [John 1:14] as "The Word was made flesh," because God was immutable and could not become anything else. Lastly, when he comes to mention the sacraments, he says that some learned men, when they heard from him that he criticized certain external things instituted by men, immediately placed the water of baptism in that number and considered it of no more value than the blessed water of the Papists. With these and similar lies, he slanders our teachers and us before the whole world, which to endure any longer with such danger to the truth is not only not Christian meekness but in my judgment also a very great crime, provided that neglect of the truth and slander of the teacher, especially in the cause of religion, is to be considered a crime, as it rightly should be.</p>
      <p>Therefore, most learned men, although I know nothing more certain with my limited understanding and how lacking I am in counsel, especially in such a grave matter, while on the other hand, it is known to no one how much you excel in prudence, doctrine, and learning, nevertheless I thought it my duty to exhort you to somehow address this danger, nor do I wish to conceal my advice. Regarding the first article, in which Luther sufficiently reveals himself, of what spirit he is, I do not think it necessary to respond to such a gross error. But regarding the second, since it is clear and can be openly proven from Zwingli's writings that this accusation of Nestorian perfidy is false and mendacious, since the pious man denied nothing less than the communication of idioms, as he wanted to assert nothing else by alleosis than to preserve the property of the natures inviolate, which Luther, according to the Eutychian heresy, sought to confuse, nevertheless not abhorring the manner of Scripture attributing to the person what is in the property of the nature, I would wish that one of you would assert the innocence of the best man from his writings and make it clear that nothing less than the perfidy of Nestorius can be drawn from Zwingli's books, which can be openly proven. Then, as long as we see ourselves falsely slandered, that we would have made no more of the water of baptism even in use and because of its use than of the external water of the fountain, from which it certainly differs in nothing in nature, unless Luther wishes to admit transubstantiation, but with the word added, none of us has judged otherwise than that it is sacramental water and because of its use water sanctified by the word and inexpressibly different from elemental water, I would consider it worthwhile to make our confession, as we have always taught and felt about the sacraments, known to the world; for I see that Luther and all his imitators labor only in this, that they may triumph in victory, but care little that the truth may become known to the world. This could easily be forgiven him if the truth did not suffer danger from it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dearest brothers, consider this my advice kindly; for otherwise, I fear it may justly be said of me: "The pig wishes to teach Minerva." Yet sometimes the Lord uses the least in the church for the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Farewell and console me with your frequent learned and pious letters, for I am almost overwhelmed beyond my strength by the Lutheran faction, and the minds of many waver due to your silence; so far, however, they have been able to achieve nothing.</p>
      <p>From Bern, December 12, 1539.</p>
      <p>The messenger was in such a hurry that there was no opportunity to reread and correct. Erasmus Ritter, entirely yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious men, the pastors and readers of the church of Zurich, dearest brothers in the Lord, to be greatly respected.</p>
      <p>Gen ZÃ¼rich.</p>
