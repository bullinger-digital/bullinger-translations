      <p>Greetings. In order to honor your wife with this bundle of refined and crafted linen, our council has ordered it, so that you may have at least a small token of its gratitude for your kindness, and I am certain how much it would wish for you to be adorned generously; however, it knows well how foreign such a gesture, no matter how honorable, is to your character and your role. Therefore, since you have what you need for sustenance from your own resources, surely you will have from here what is needed for clothing; which not even the apostles themselves, I believe, would have refused if offered to them. Therefore, allow yourself, most distinguished man, to be persuaded and convinced in this matter, so that you do not disdain the offering of such a small gift to your wife.</p>
      <p>For our people think nothing less than to misuse your goodness or piety, and for this reason above all, we love you, Bullinger, all of us who have given the name of Christ to St. Gallen, because through the gift of your learning we make progress daily and improve from day to day. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, February 21, 1549.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the renowned church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
