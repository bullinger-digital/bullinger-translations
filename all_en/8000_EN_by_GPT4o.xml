      <p>Greetings. I have received your letters, my most kind Mr. Bullinger, one dated August 25th and the other on the first of September. In the former, you excuse your silence, which was hardly necessary, and recommend Count of Culemborg, who, since he did not come to us, I have nothing else to write except that I would have shown him, had he come, the greatest goodwill possible for your sake. Mr. Haller wrote to me a few days ago about a boy to be sent to him to use as a scribe (as they call it). But in those letters, he makes no mention of Bullinger. So that he does not think you have forgotten him, I have included the exact words of both your letters in my own, which I trust will be as pleasing to him as they are welcome; if he replies, I will let you know. Now I turn to your later letters written in German, in which you instruct me to inquire about Anna. I have done this with all the diligence I could, but so far in vain; I am doing it in such a way that not only no one else, but not even he himself, if he were present, could easily suspect, and I have no doubt that if he were here, I would accomplish the task, so that you will approve of my diligence. Mr. Haller repeatedly inquires of me by letter about French affairs, about which if you have any certain information, you would do us a favor by writing to us whatever it may be. Farewell and continue to love me, and give my very best regards to Mr. Gwalther and your family in my words.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, September 13, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Matthias Schenck.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a man endowed with the highest piety and learning, his singular friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
