    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius has written all the news via the blacksmith [...] from Dübendorf with [No. 2725], except that the Danish [King Christian III] is said to have killed several thousand men from Duke Maurice's [of Saxony] army. Bullinger probably already knows about this, especially since the people of Constance have informed the people of Zurich, who in turn have passed this on to the people of Basel as verified news. Perhaps the Dane will not abandon the [Protestants] after all! However, through the success of the corpse-like Emperor [Charles V], God seems to want to convey something.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Myconius thought that after the events of the summer, hardly a tenth of the Emperor's forces would have remained. Nevertheless, he now has such great success! Where are [Sebastian] Schertlin, [Johann Freiherr von] Heideck, and all the others? It has been claimed that they lead many thousands of soldiers, with whom they would easily be able to resist the Emperor. And that is certainly true! So when will these [commanders] become traitors? Something must happen! If only we do not abandon the Lord!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Myconius is relatively unconcerned about the occupied cities and towns, as they are fickle. What worries him greatly, however, is the fact that those who have surrendered apparently were never Christians; unless they actually believed that the Emperor would leave them to their religion. But as soon as he has triumphed (unless the earth has swallowed this monster beforehand), they will feel the serpent's venom that he hides in his deceitful mouth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] If it is true that Duke [Ulrich of Württemberg] has abandoned his own and has not withdrawn for health reasons, then there is reason for disappointment. Shouldn't all of Helvetia rise against the enemy [Charles V], especially since he intends to cut off the grain supply to Thurgau and the other [places]? Truly, the [Confederates] are no longer in their right mind and are bringing misfortune upon themselves! It really seems as if God has something against "Germania"! The main thing is that the Lord destroys the Antichrist along with his followers!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Myconius already shared in [No. 2725] the verified news that Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] has inflicted severe damage on the Mainz [Archbishop Sebastian von Heusenstamm]. What is [Maximilian von Egmont, Count of] Buren doing now? And why are the envoys of the [German] Protestants staying in France for so long? A letter from [Antoine] Morelet [du Museau] arrived these days. However, Myconius does not know its content.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The people of Zurich have already forwarded the communications received from Constance to Basel twice. But why has Bullinger never referred to them?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Hopefully, God will soon call someone who will resist the Emperor! One must pray earnestly for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings. [Francisco de] Enzinas is depressed not only by the work but even more by the unexpected success of the Emperor. He and [Johannes] Gast send their regards back.</p>

      <p>S. I have written all the news I know, via the blacksmith from Dübendorf, except that the Danish King Christian III is said to have killed several thousand men from Duke Maurice of Saxony's army. But you probably know this better from Constance, as your people have informed ours and indeed as verified news. This might raise new hope that the Dane has not yet completely abandoned us. For as far as the success of the corpse-like Emperor Charles V, a man neither pious nor good, is concerned, God seems to want to teach us something through this corpse that we have not known until now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>From what happened in his camps over the summer, we thought hardly a tenth of his soldiers remained; and now he achieves so much! Where is Sebastian Schertlin? Where is Johann Freiherr von Heideck? Where are the others? It is said that they still have many thousands of soldiers; so many, I say, that they could easily resist the Emperor through the Lord. And I believe this based on certain arguments! So when will they reveal themselves? Something will happen eventually, as long as we do not turn away from the Lord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I do not care much about the occupied cities and towns, as they are such that they change with any movement of fortune. But what truly moves me is that in the people who surrender, there seems to be nothing of Christ! Unless they perhaps believe the Emperor, who promises to change no one's religion. Let them stay until he has won! They will feel the deceitful mouth of the serpent holding venom and hiding it, unless the earth swallows such a monster first.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I am distressed that the Duke has left his own - if he has left them and not rather taken care of his health. Shouldn't all of Helvetia rise and repel the enemy with all their might, who tries to make sure that Thurgau and others lack grain in the future? I tell you: We are insane, even though I fear it is to our own detriment! From this, it is clear that the Lord has determined something against Germania that we did not expect. But whatever it is, I do not care much with the Lord present. May He only preserve His word for us and destroy the Antichrist with his followers!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It is certain that the Elector has severely punished the Mainz Archbishop, as I have indicated in other letters. But what is Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Buren doing? We do not know. Everyone is amazed that the envoys of the Protestants are staying in France for so long. Maurus wrote these days; but what, I do not know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The people of Constance have written to yours and yours to us; about which you have said nothing to me! I am surprised, for I do not believe you are unaware of what they have indicated.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I hope the Lord will soon raise someone who will delay the Emperor's course; for which He must be earnestly and continuously prayed to.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell in Christ. Francisco de Enzinas is pressed by labors, but more so by the unexpected success of the Emperor. He and Johannes Gast send their regards. Basel, December 28, 1546. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, the best minister of Christ, brother and venerable lord in Christ. Zurich.</p>
