      <p>S. D. I have read the letters you sent to me, dearest brother in Christ. I can give you no other advice than that which Christ our Lord gave to his disciples, that in such a corrupt age and in such an unjust neighborhood, they should be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves, so that they do not fear those who can afflict the body but cannot harm the soul, and that they may proclaim the gospel to the people fearlessly and fear nothing from any man, no matter what powers he may possess. "For I," he says, "am with you all the days until the end of the age." Beware, brother, lest you allow obscure reasoning to be inserted into the clear matter of the supper and begin to speak with this kind of people about contradictions, that Christ is present bodily and yet not bodily, bodily but not locally. Many contradictions or inconsistencies are found in their words, and the mind of Johannes cannot recognize them in these obscurities. There is no other food of life, no other drink of salvation than the very body of Christ given and the blood shed. We do not speak of any spiritual body and blood, but of that which is true and real, assumed from the Virgin Mary of our substance. Just as food, unless it is eaten or received by us, does nothing in us, does not strengthen or nourish, so unless the flesh and blood of Christ are eaten and drunk by us and are indeed within us, they will never give life.</p>
      <p>The question now is, how can the true and natural flesh of Christ and his real blood be eaten and drunk. He himself explains this in many ways in John chapter 6, and all the ancient doctors agree with him that this does not happen bodily or carnally, but spiritually through faith. Not that the flesh of Christ is converted into spirit, but that he, who is true man and now sits at the right hand of the Father in heaven, offers himself to us to be enjoyed in a spiritual manner and is perceived by us spiritually, that is, by faith. These things are most clearly taught in John chapter 6 and are thus explained by all the ancients. Since therefore the reason and manner are spiritual, what need, I ask, is there to dispute about the bodily presence of Christ on earth, in which the supper is celebrated? Does it seem sensible to concede that all things are done here spiritually, while at the same time denying the bodily presence of Christ in the supper? Yet they do not want to seem to think so grossly. Why then do they speak in such a way that the words sound true? If they mean nothing else than that the true body of Christ, which is in heaven and remains until the end of the age, is eaten by the pious spiritually, why do they oppose us, who plainly confess this? But their disputations about heaven, about the right hand of God, about the ubiquity of the body of Christ, indicate that they mean something else. All these things are in direct opposition to orthodox faith and scriptures; for, not to mention the writings of others, you know what we have published on this matter in our response to Luther's insults, what I have discussed in the 12th book of my Commentaries on Matthew, where I speak about the resurrection, and what in my fifth Decade. You know what Peter Martyr has written and disputed on this matter. Therefore, continue to assert firmly those things which are supported by scriptures, agree with faith, are consistent in all respects, and are understood by the pious. May the Lord give you his spirit. Farewell. All of mine greet you, especially my Ludwig Lavater. Pray to the Lord diligently, and he will not forsake you.</p>
