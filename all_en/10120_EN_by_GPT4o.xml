      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ Jesus, our Savior.</p>
      <p>First of all, my brother, I give you immense thanks for treating me so kindly, fraternally, and finally, as far as bodily matters are concerned, so splendidly. I had clearly revealed all these things to Gabriel and my other good and close friends, and indeed, they all with one voice congratulated your charity, so much so that if ever an opportunity arises to repay you or yours, they would like to do so. May God grant that you come to us sometime, so that we can have and restore our common friendship, etc. But in the meantime, so as not to delay you longer, you know, my brother, what we agreed upon in the last few days when I was with you in Zürich, namely that I should write letters to that person whom, I confess, I love sincerely, in which I would explain everything that might perhaps trouble and distress both me and her in our marriage matter, so that it might be easier to reach an agreement on both sides. I have indeed done this, and behold the letters are enclosed not for you but for the messenger, because of what they suspect from my walk to you. However, there is no doubt that she herself will not know how to read them. I therefore ask your charity that you be the reader of them, and if anything rustic, unrefined, and less elegant is found, as there will be many, that you, with your singular insight, amend, add, or diminish them, so that we might more easily obtain something from her beloved. For what need is there for many words? My whole mind depends on it. Listen to what I say. At first glance, as they say, that is, upon inspecting the matter, the conditions proposed by her did not entirely please Gabriel nor the other friends. Nevertheless, once they had sufficiently understood my mind and I had well persuaded the other friends, they came over to my opinion and approved everything. I write this so that you may see that everything has been done rightly. Therefore, I ask you to continue with our undertaking. For I hope that all her objections, that is, the change of place, income, children, furnishings, will not be able to delay anything. Moreover, there is still one thing that I want you to be concerned about, namely that if you see that she has decided to completely deny the matter, which I do not hope, I say, if you see; for many things often fall between the cup and the lip - that you then wish to admonish her in a Christian manner, not to want to divulge or disclose it, lest I suffer any vexation (I will omit other conveniences) from it. I want to testify this to you through Christ, so that you may be more concerned, that I do not seek her money, not her income, but rather honesty, modesty, and sufficient elegance, as befits my person, and all the more vehemently because you have so Christianly recommended her to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Strive to receive good news from you through that messenger. I sent Leo's letters to Caspar and will take care of your conversation with Berchtold in the next chapter. Greet your wife, relative, Leo, and all who have asked about me.</p>
      <p>Given on April 28, in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Zehnder.</p>
      <p>To the no less upright than learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastic in Zürich, most esteemed friend and brother.</p>
