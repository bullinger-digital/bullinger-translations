      <p>To the most revered Mr. Bullinger and dearest brother in the Lord, we have received and read your letters, and they were partly delightful to us, as we heard that you have undertaken the labor against the Anabaptist sect; for just as other good men, we too have often wished the same, yet we never dared to trouble your kindness with this matter (as we knew you were overwhelmed with the storms of affairs); but now that everything is in action, we will assist you with our prayers to God in completing this and other works; for we do not doubt that the best will be provided for posterity.</p>
      <p>Partly less delightful due to the mention of various dissensions, to which a certain rumor has been added about a dispute over providence between the most illustrious men in learning and virtue, Mr. Theodor and Mr. Martyr, which we fear will become greater among foreigners. Hence, since not only the Pope, Anabaptists, but also the Lutherans have been able to reproach us with their many dissensions and almost as many opinions as there are men of some name or learning among them, we fear they will now turn the same against us and our churches, especially since before, even falsely, they have often accused the teachers of our churches of dissension. And if this dispute is spread among the public here and also among you and elsewhere, we leave it to you to conjecture what will come of it. However, we have this remaining hope, that we do not doubt this dissension, just as that in the same cause in the year 1544, since it is not much infected with ambition, will be quelled by learned men and lovers of peace, so that it is not made public, especially since many other churches observe yours primarily and slight and very small beginnings often produce the greatest evils. Furthermore, these days a merchant, our fellow citizen, who had just returned from Paris, met me, telling that he heard from a certain brother and preacher there that you and the Genevans, especially Calvin and Beza, are gravely at odds over the sacramental matter; for you urge that the sacrament be carried around, while they deny it. But he excused the Zurich church (although he dared to assert nothing rashly) thus: that the doctrine of our church is one and the same with that of Zurich; but we publicly condemn that carrying around, therefore neither do you approve it; he promised, however, if he returns to Paris (which he will do after a few weeks), he will bring more certain information. So when he asked me, I had nothing to report on this controversy, meanwhile I added from your letters, if I informed you about this matter, I would soon receive something. I fear that Beza may bring some harm to our religion and cause.</p>
      <p>We have learned about the discord of the people of Claron and Schwyz from our consul Peyer, that it arose because in some places the mass was not instituted or celebrated and because of a sharper sermon by a certain minister of the word.</p>
      <p>The same pensioners, otherwise lazy, but here entirely busy, enemies of peace, are now attempting what they did in the year 1531, when everywhere arms were at rest, they themselves waged wars with strange practices; for they are accustomed to shed innocent blood, being cruel men; when it does not succeed elsewhere, they approach by this way. However, thanks be to God, that your most honorable senate has settled the matter until the next assembly. The wound inflicted before is still raw and therefore virtue would flourish.</p>
      <p>May God, the best and greatest, grant that we may live peacefully with our people; for unless the dissension is removed, the situation of Switzerland would be worse than ever before, indeed total destruction is to be feared. We have nothing new.</p>
      <p>Soon some leaders of the imperial cities will meet in Ulm, for what reason, it is unknown to me. From there I also read letters, which describe a meeting of some citizens of Ulm, who discussed among themselves about the fact that the ministers allow free access to the supper only to those who agree with them that Christ is substantially present, etc., or who only profess that Christ is here and that they believe it.</p>
      <p>Now some have thought it better to refrain from access to the supper than to approach; for thus a stumbling block is given to many who are weaker and still doubting, and the Lutherans would become more obstinate and say: "Behold, he also approaches here; he favors our side," etc. Meanwhile, perhaps God will give better things.</p>
      <p>Others asserted that one should approach for the sake of peace and concord, yet everyone can believe in their heart what is true. I am asked to declare to which party I would adhere; I respond that I am the least of the brothers, but within a few days I promised they would hear my opinion. However, I added this: since the Lord's supper is a manifest testimony of faith and charity and Christ says: "Whoever denies me," etc.</p>
      <p>Paul: "Confession is made with the mouth," etc. stumbling blocks, finally, should be carefully avoided according to Christ's admonition, likewise anyone in a papist place... can thus excuse himself: "I will hear the mass, etc., I will believe rightly in my heart," therefore it does not agree to believe in the heart that Christ is bodily at the right hand of God in a certain place, etc., but by access to testify that he believes in his presence here, etc. However, I have affirmed nothing until your opinion is also revealed to me; therefore, as much as you please, and as you have time, communicate, I beseech you.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the learned, whom you will greet in our name. Simpertus sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>May God preserve you safe for us for many ages. Amen. Schaffhausen, December 10, 1559.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Jakob RÃ¼eger. To the most humane, learned, and virtuous Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zurich church, and his most esteemed brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
