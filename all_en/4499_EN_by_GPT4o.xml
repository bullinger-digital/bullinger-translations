      <p>S. D. The rumor and consultation about a thousand men being taken to France for the protection of the royal body has subsided. Nothing else is heard except about the people of Claron.</p>
      <p>After the assembly in Eremo was concluded, it was decided by our most esteemed magistrate to make a selection. Therefore, on the 12th of October, two banners were organized: the city flag, to which two thousand men were added, and also the standard or banner, to which four thousand men will be joined. Thus, everyone is preparing themselves.</p>
      <p>These actions are not intended to bring force against the people of the Five Cantons or any others, but to repel force both from our allies and from ourselves.</p>
      <p>We must pray to the Lord to give courage to the people of Claron who profess the gospel of Christ, to remove their fear, so that, not being terrified by threats and too much in love with their own safety, they do not do what is least fitting, that is, accept some composition that is not sincere and pious. We are working here as much as we can to console and strengthen them.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord that they do not falter; we are very concerned about this. Meanwhile, the consensus and readiness of our entire people is admirable.</p>
      <p>May the Lord God of hosts strengthen us in what pleases Him, and may He gently turn the people of the Five Cantons to Christ the Lord, or finally avert the filled measure, but not pour out His wrath on us, and preserve us according to His great mercy! I do not think there are any more hostile to the gospel of Christ in the world now than the people of the Five Cantons, and they have with them a papal legate who makes their already embittered minds even more so; this bishop is Antonio Foxus of Como, a fox in name and deed. May the Lord scatter the counsel of Ahithophel!</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep us in your prayers. All our brothers and fellow ministers greet you and your fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 16th of October, in the year of our Lord 1560.</p>
      <p>If you have anything from our dearest brother Beza, please share it, or if you receive anything else worth mentioning from France. I give great thanks for the books sent.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, most vigilant pastor of the church of Geneva, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
