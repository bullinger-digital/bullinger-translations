    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller sends the [Gottesdienstordnung] (Order of Worship), which [Wolfgang] Musculus has transmitted to him as a guide for the celebration of the Lord's Supper, for review. However, some formulas are ambiguous and reflect more of Bucer's and Luther's views than the truth. Bullinger should review this order and return it with his advice as soon as possible. - Haller has already discussed this with [Georg] Frölich, who wants to consult with him later. However, Haller would first like to hear Bullinger's opinion. He should write via Konstanz, from where the letters can be forwarded to Augsburg weekly.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am sending to you, most esteemed man, the form of sacramental expressions, which Musculus wants me to learn and which are used in the church of Augsburg. To me, they all seem so ambiguous and unclear that they can be interpreted in either direction, but they lean more towards Bucer's and Luther's opinion than the truth. I prefer simple and clear words, such as those that do not obscure the understanding of the unlearned, unlike these. Therefore, examine them and return them as soon as you can, and advise me on what to do. They are trying to compel me to read these words during the administration of the Lord's Supper, which I will not do until I have your advice.</p>
      <p>I have indicated to Mr. Frölich that these ambiguities greatly displease me and that I will celebrate the supper in the Zurich manner. He said he would consult and deliberate with me. However, I would like to have your advice first, which I implore you not to withhold from me. And just send the letters to Konstanz; from there, they can be forwarded to us weekly.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. November 22, 1545, Augsburg. Entirely yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
