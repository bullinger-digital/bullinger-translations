      <p>Greetings. I had indeed expected the lectures of the most distinguished man, Mr. Hieronymus Zanchi, on auspices; however, I accept the excuse with which you clear yourself. In the meantime, see to it that I receive them through the next available courier. I am sorry to hear that Zanchi, a most pious and learned man, is in poor health and has a wife who is completely ill. We must pray to the Lord to restore them to full health. You rightly advise about the counsels of Mr. Martyr and Mr. Zanchi; but see, my son, that it does not become a disadvantage to you that you are born of me as a parent; for I hear that the Saxons hate my name most vehemently.</p>
      <p>See that you are not driven to a religion contrary to the true one. Therefore, it will be better to investigate these matters, yet in such a way that while doing something else in the meantime, you understand what their disposition towards us is and whether they compel the students to their sacred rites. I would not want you to be completely alienated from their sermons, but in the participation of the Lord's table, I would wish you to be left free. Although I am still in doubt in my mind as to where I should send you; I certainly do not want you to be endangered in pestilential places. Therefore, see to it that you thoroughly explore everything and inform me of all matters before mid-August. I have written to your master about mending clothes or about acquiring some new ones (if necessary); a traveler does not need many clothes, but one good one; transportation, as it is uncertain, is also so costly that sometimes it exceeds the price of what is being transported, and it might be better to acquire a breastplate and leggings where you are going, if necessary; I think the cloak is not yet worn out. However, you will record all expenses and what you have received since the last account on paper as usual and send it. I also wish to know what lectures you are currently attending. When you are about to leave in a few months, see to it that you collect testimonials from your teachers, which you will send home to me upon leaving. The books you took from here, you will not carry, but you will give or leave a good part with Rodolph; you will carry selected ones with you on your back. As for the collections you have from the lectures and the rest that you wish to be preserved, see that they are carefully bound and sent to me at home to be kept until your return, etc. Unless I understand that our name will be a disadvantage, I might send you to Saxony; for I would like you to be able to hear Philipp for a year or two, and it is not unpleasant, considering the great expenses incurred for many children, as you know, that you can live there frugally, and I always encourage you to cultivate frugality with piety and true learning. There is no need, my son, for you to recommend needy young men to me; a great crowd of the needy comes to me daily; they exhaust me, and I cannot assist everyone. The Locarnese exiles, about 120 souls, have been received into the city. May the Lord bless us and keep us from evil. Farewell. Zurich, June 23, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your mother and the whole household greet you.</p>
      <p>Bullinger, your father.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Heinrich Bullinger the Younger, residing in the house of Mr. Burcher, the Englishman, in Strasbourg.</p>
