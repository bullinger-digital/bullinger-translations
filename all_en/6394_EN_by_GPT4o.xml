      <p>Many greetings in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>What then shall I say, most learned man and dearest father? I am both ashamed and grieved: ashamed first for not having written to you more often; then grieved that those very letters I did write could not reach you.</p>
      <p>However, I beseech you, do not think that the school of Zurich, or the republic, or your great humanity could so quickly slip from my mind.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I carry you all in my eyes and in my heart, and you especially, my father, the now sole light of our age. As for letters, except for that previous year when everything was closed everywhere due to plague and pestilence, I have never ceased writing to you, to Lavater, to Simler, and to Julius.</p>
      <p>If I did not do this, I could scarcely seem to retain any sense, not to say of duty, but even of humanity. And as for my other previous letters, I do not know what became of them; but I hear the most recent ones were intercepted by the French in a naval conflict and taken to Calais. But I let that go.</p>
      <p>Now receive news of our affairs, which I know are dearer to your heart due to your piety. First, concerning religion, everything at home is peaceful by the grace of the best and greatest God.</p>
      <p>The exiled Papists disturb and hinder as much as they can; and by publishing books, I do not know whether by my fate or by my merit, they attack me alone, and that with the greatest clamor of three at one time.</p>
      <p>While I alone respond to all of them, do not think that I can be idle. Among other things, the cause of ubiquitarianism is offered to me, which I have adorned with more words for the sake of that old man of ours from TÃ¼bingen, as I could, and as the matter allowed: but in our language, as it is for our people. If indeed there is leisure, I will translate some part and send it to you.</p>
      <p>As for that old man, I truly do not see what I should decide: he seems to me to be more and more delirious every day.</p>
      <p>For I have read the new phantom of Menander, which he recently published: and I thank you for that book, and for all your letters, and for all your humanity.</p>
      <p>The republic is peaceful at home and abroad, on land and sea. We have established peace with the French: even that Flemish turmoil has now finally subsided. Merchants travel back and forth, the Flemish to us, and ours in turn to them.</p>
      <p>Granvelle, by whose wickedness alone all these things were begun, aimed to, by disturbing and hindering the markets, with nothing being able to be imported or exported, and with the merchants and the common townsfolk, who truly seek their livelihood from wool, being reduced to idleness and poverty, cause some popular movement and domestic sedition to follow.</p>
      <p>For he hoped that religion could be shaken in this way. But God rather turned those plans against the author: for ours remained in duty, as was fitting; but the Flemish common people, with our merchants having departed, and the market established at Emden, bore that matter indignantly, and even almost rioted.</p>
      <p>The Irish, as I know you have heard, obey us and use our laws. Into that island, the Pope sent a wicked and cunning man a few days ago with orders to run here and there.</p>
      <p>For he was Irish, and he was to stir up the wild and savage people against us for the sake of religion. What do you ask? The rascal was immediately captured at the first landing, and examined and bound, he was sent to us.</p>
      <p>Thus the most sacred father has utterly decided, since he cannot bend the heavens, to move Acheron! In Scotland, it is as we wish.</p>
      <p>The Queen alone retains her mass, against the will of all. Parkhurst, Horn, Sampson, Sandys, Lever, and Chambers are well and perform their duty. It has now been two years since I have seen any of them.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you safe and sound for as long as possible! Greet Mr. Gwalther, Mr. Lavater, Mr. Simler, Mr. Loup, Mr. Haller, Mr. Gessner, Mr. Frisius, Mr. Zwingli, Mr. Wick, to each of whom I would write if there were time or rather if I were not completely overwhelmed with business. Salisbury in England, the first of March 1565.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your name and most dedicated to you, John Jewel, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the church of Zurich and his most esteemed master. In Zurich.</p>
