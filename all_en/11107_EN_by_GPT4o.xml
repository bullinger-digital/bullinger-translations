    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports (in response to a letter from Bullinger) about the removal of images ordered by Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg, hopes for a calming of the situation after learning about the testimony issued by Bern [for Bucer and Capito], and advises the people of Zurich, referring to Vadian's correspondence with Osiander, to occasionally write to the Lutherans to advance reconciliation. Thomas Blarer has recovered and sends his regards; [Konrad] Zwick, who does not want to keep his promise, also sends his regards. To find a teacher for his boy, [Konrad] Klauser was asked about potential candidates from Basel; now Klauser himself shows interest in this task, which they would like to assign to him without wanting to lure him away from the people of Zurich. Recommends the ailing Margaretha Blarer to his intercession.</p>

      <p> Greetings. The Prince of Württemberg has declared against idols, dearest Bullinger, which has caused some disturbance; but truth has prevailed. I have read the testimony of the people of Bern; I do not judge its quality. It is enough for us that they agree well with the people of Strasbourg; I hope that eventually an end will be put to these vexations. Amen. To remove suspicions from the minds of some Lutherans, it would not be unwise if you, along with other good men like Theodor and Leo, occasionally wrote to the Lutherans, without, however, engaging in that sacramental contention, but only in the interest of reconciliation, just as I find Vadian's conversation with Osiander useful for dispelling suspicions. These are my few words in response to your letter. </p>
      <p> Give thanks to the Lord for Thomas Blarer; for he has recovered. He sends you his diligent greetings. My brother is obstinate; it matters to him as much as if they were speaking to him, but he does not want to admit (confess) that he has promised much. He sends you earnest greetings. Also know that he would gladly have a capable fellow for his boys. And it has recently happened that a young man was here, named Klauser, who brought me greetings from Myconius. I asked him if there might be someone in Basel who would accept such a position with my brother; I also asked him to inquire and then let me know. However, it never occurred to us that he desired us or we him, as we know for sure that he has a position from Zurich. Now we are informed that he would not be unwilling to serve us in this manner, and we fear (suspect) that you might accuse (suspect, blame) us of wanting to lure away your or other people's men. That is not our intention; we also want to have excused ourselves to you and through you, where it is necessary. Yet, it is no less (nevertheless) that we, perceiving the young man's favor (goodwill, inclination) and it being very important to us that my brother's child is taught in time and well, it would be no small service to us if the young man could become ours, yet without your suspicion and displeasure, for as I wrote to you, so it has happened. </p>
      <p> I have nothing new to report, except that I commend to your prayers our Margaretha Blaurer, who is gravely ill. Pray to the Lord that he may grant her the prayers of the pious, especially of our church. </p>
      <p> Farewell, most beloved of all. </p>
      <p> November 6, 1537. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes Zwick. </p>
      <p> To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his dearest brother. Zurich. </p>
