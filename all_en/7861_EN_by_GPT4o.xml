      <p>God with us! Johannes Müller has delivered your letter to me. As I have now received the letters and as they appear to me, as they are written to my gracious lords, I share with you all the latest that has come from Geneva and Bern. Since then, nothing has come that confirms or refutes it. But this week, a respectable council from Basel will write to my gracious lords about how you have decided in this matter, and I cannot further assure what is certain or uncertain. I give it to you as I received it; therefore, I always say, you should use it wisely. Besides, I hear from honest, truthful people who have seen it, that Duke Wolfgang is exceedingly well-equipped with cavalry, large and small artillery, and 30 companies of foot soldiers. I also understand that 2000 horses, Pomeranians, and Prussians are still to follow; they are now well with him, etc. From England, I have a letter from London dated March 7, stating that on December 29, 1568, Spanish ships were chased by Condé's Frenchmen to the English port, and when the queen was called upon, she detained those who were on the ships. However, the Duke of Alba, Erynnis, has in response arrested all Englishmen in Antwerp and throughout the Netherlands, and some have also been mistreated. When this complaint reached the queen, she was enraged that such disgrace was shown to her goods, protection, and defense, and immediately she also overthrew all Spaniards and Netherlanders with life and goods, now having about 80 ships and unspeakable goods, and is also in great armament, has written to the king in Spain, complained of the great insolence, and indicated that she will not let it go unavenged against Alba. How it will proceed, time will tell. The Scots are siding with England, and it is well thought that the German princes will too; for they have sent an envoy to Heidelberg, etc. What he is recruiting there, for cavalry or not, I do not yet know. But it grieves me greatly that the Albanian devil causes so much bloodshed. May God calm him with His power. Many other news items are present, which are too many and long for me to write; for I am almost completely exhausted with writing and other many tasks. It is also now the time and would be my joy if God had satisfaction; for this miserable life in this desolate world brings me little joy. May God grant grace and make it according to His holy will. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet for me Mr. Mayor, Mr. Carolus, Pontisella, Ganthner, and all our friends.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, April 22, 1569.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
