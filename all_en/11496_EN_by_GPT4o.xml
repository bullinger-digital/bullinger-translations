      <p>Greetings. You write, dearest father, that our letters ask for nothing but money; therefore, I now send you a letter asking for nothing but forgiveness. For I know, and it pains me to know, how I have offended you, and how justly I have offended you, to whom alone I should strive to please and to accommodate myself to your will perpetually.</p>
      <p>You can hardly believe, my father, how much this is a cause of misfortune for me. For although everything else is going well, I have nothing that stings me more sharply than your anger. Is there no hope for me to obtain forgiveness? Is there no place for mercy?</p>
      <p>My father (although I am unworthy to call you father or to be called your son), indeed, I believe there is ample room for forgiveness. For if every sinner finds grace with God, the best and greatest, if he attains mercy, if he obtains the remission of sins, how much more should I find grace with you, who are a man endowed with all humanity? If I have sinned, I confess, I ask for forgiveness; if not, then at least put aside your anger, my father. How long will you continue to be angry? I give myself entirely to you and humbly ask to be inscribed only in the register of your servants; for I am unworthy and confess to be so, to be called your son (as others are). I have erred and confess it; support my better undertakings and help with better hope those things I have begun well. There is a great fury in the first youthful years. O too happy is he who can overcome it. Therefore, my father, I say father, if any prayers or any future innocence of life have any value with you, I ask you to forgive me, if any holy power of the eternal best and greatest heaven has any value with you, if Christ, in whom all our sins are forgiven. I beg you to consign to oblivion what I have sometimes imprudently written to you. For I cannot express how ashamed I am of myself; forgive, I ask, by whatever dear pledges of life you have, by my parents and your duty.</p>
      <p>You also write that perhaps we will soon be recalled to our homeland, which causes us great pain, especially to me, the most unfortunate of all men, who alone among all the students have offended you, a man sincere in studies and our homeland's leader. For how, even if necessity soon demanded that I be called to some office of the church, could I meet you?</p>
      <p>With what face should I look at you? With what spirit should I address you? Ah, I tremble miserably whenever the thought of returning comes to mind, as long as I have you unreconciled. Therefore, my dearest father (for I have no one whom I would more call by that name than you alone), forgive, I ask; for your mercy alone offers me hope and solace for obtaining forgiveness from you. I diligently attend to divine studies and exercise myself in the ways of Christ. If, however, exercising mercy towards supplicants is to walk in the ways of Christ, I do not doubt that you will obliterate all that I have erred in so far.</p>
      <p>Regarding our studies, I have nothing else to write than what you may have heard or will hear from the letters of Kaspar Rudolphi. We have made happy progress in these since we arrived in Marburg. We have a private teacher (as you may know) Johannes Lonicer, a man as learned as he is pious and very friendly to our religion. We have all the other professors as friends and acquaintances: Kaspar Rudolphi, who teaches the art of dialectics learnedly; [Gerhard Geldenhauer], [Matthäus Pfeil von] Kappel, professor of moral philosophy, whose study flourishing in Zurich we rejoice in greatly, especially since not so much the study itself as the professor himself is to be praised.</p>
      <p>We have also heard about the harmony of the Swiss; if only we were truly harmonious! O happy Swiss republic, if we could be stable in concordant faith. The supreme and benevolent God must be invoked with all prayers, that he may implant his word in their minds and arrange everything according to his great mercy and goodness.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, and forgive, I was imprudent. However, the benevolent God has now given me a better mind, in whose ways I wholly apply myself and diligently attend. He must be invoked, that he may strengthen and confirm our studies with a pure and orthodox judgment of understanding his mysteries perpetually. Farewell happily.</p>
      <p>From the Academy of Marburg, on the ninth day of January in the year 1541. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in learning and piety, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the church of Zurich, his lord and father to be greatly respected. From Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
