      <p>Celio Secondo Curione through Christ Jesus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I give you the greatest thanks I can, my always dearest and most respected brother, for preserving the memory of us so sacred and inviolate, and for not ceasing your most humane habit of writing, which is a sign of love, piety, and constancy. Although I am slower in writing, I yield to no one in loving; for I love you, Heinrich, my divine brother and most esteemed patron, I cherish and revere you as few others, indeed more than anyone, and I proclaim everywhere that I am conquered by your great merits towards me, which I carry with me. I rejoice as I should, and as I would rejoice in our own well-being, that you and your entire family and kin are well. We indeed, by the providence of God the Father, are all safe so far in the midst of the flames of pestilence, undoubtedly not unlike those of whom you write, who were in the midst of the Babylonian furnace, yet ready to obey the best Father and Lord when it seems fit to Him to call us from this custody, in which we have been placed and located by Him, not that the love and care for a pious wife and children do not trouble us, but because we know they will have a present Father and eternal husband and patron from heaven. Relying on this hope and firm conviction, whenever it seems fit to the Lord, we will migrate to that assembly of the blessed.</p>
      <p>For having received Locadello, a truly good and learned man commended by me to you, liberally, that is, in your manner, I owe and will owe you much on this account; but I fear that I may not be able to sustain so many and such great merits of yours, especially since, not content with past ones, I prepare myself to receive new ones.</p>
      <p>What this is, I will briefly explain to you: I believe you have understood that I dedicated our commentaries on Cicero's Philippics to the King of England. I sent those Philippics along with the booklet On the Magnitude of God's Mercy, with some others partly translated, partly composed by my Horace, royally and at great expense bound, to that king and also to his tutor John Cheke, to whom I also privately wrote letters and commended the matter; I did the same with our Bernardino. The books were offered to the king by Bernardino and the tutor; the king received them kindly, praised them, and immediately assigned a certain sum as a gift with his own hand. It has been a year, and I have received nothing nor could I find out how much it was. Today I wrote to Bernardino and Cheke about this matter, asking only that they ensure whatever it is is expedited to us. What I ask of you is this: I know your name is famous among the English, and I know your authority is very weighty; therefore, I would like you to commend me to the royal tutors or others who could promote the matter. You could briefly mention to them the labors and loss of goods for the holy religion, the multitude of children (for there are eight), the constant hospitality, the meager stipend, and especially that I now have a daughter of marriageable age without a dowry, and such things, which you can do better than I.</p>
      <p>What I write about my daughter is true; she is in Padua with a pious and honest matron; they write to me that they have found someone to whom they can honorably marry her, if only I have a modest dowry ready. There is nothing, my brother, with me; I can barely support the family with my constant labors, and yet our house is never empty of Christ's poor, which I believe does not escape you. What I write is not for boasting, but simply to signify, so that you may understand and make the English understand that my family is worthy of being supported by royal generosity; for I do not write everything to you, which is more than enough for me, that they are known to my God.</p>
      <p>Therefore, best brother, I beg you again and again to write to England, to whom it may seem fit, as soon as possible, and diligently commend us for your singular love for us all. Concerning Lord John Hooper, the bishop, I dare not promise myself anything, who, although he promised me much when leaving and I have often written to him, I have never received even a word.</p>
      <p>But I fear I may already be bothering you, so I will end, praying that you greet your household in our name, to whom I wish all things prosperous and holy. Farewell, my brother, patron, half of my soul. Basel, November 25, 1552.</p>
      <p>I almost forgot: I hear from some who come from there that you have received something of the magnificence decreed and assigned to me by the king. If you have anything, I ask you to inform me.</p>
      <p>To the holy church of ZÃ¼rich's Antistes, Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed brother and especially respected lord. Zurich.</p>
