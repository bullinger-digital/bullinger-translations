      <p>Greetings and peace through Jesus Christ, our Lord, and my most humble commendation.</p>
      <p>Since, contrary to our expectation and after long deliberation, it has finally come to pass that this servant is suddenly sent to you, I did not want to omit writing something to you through him, even though I had decided and still intend to send more extensive letters through those who will bring money for the Myśkowis to you. However, I could not refrain from sending these few words now through the servant, so that at least through them I might inform you about the money I am arranging to send to you. It is being sent by the same courier through whom you sent letters to us, that is, through the Guteter merchants to Nuremberg to Erasmus Gutteter, who resides in Nuremberg. He will entrust it to the people of St. Gallen, and the people of St. Gallen will deliver it to you, most esteemed Father Bullinger, the sum of which will be two hundred and thirty thalers. Furthermore, I want you to know that the father of your Myśkowis has passed away, a magnanimous and outstanding man, whose death was rightly mourned by good men, and the republic has lost an uncommon man. But since it was the will of God Almighty, what can be done except that the children accept this visitation from God with a grateful heart, as you will endeavor. You, with your wisdom, will know how to handle the children in this grief and console them paternally and Christianly.</p>
      <p>The books you sent, Wolphius, I have carefully taken care of for everyone, as I have already informed you. They have been most welcome to all, and I hope that each will thank you, as I alone give immense thanks for my copy. May God grant, my most illustrious teacher Wolphius, that I may be able to repay you in some way.</p>
      <p>Now, in a few words, my condition. For two months I have been confined to bed, afflicted by severe illnesses brought on by my scholastic labors, especially by fever and the pain of migraine, which prevents me from dealing with you at greater length. I add this one thing: whether I am sick or healthy, I will always remember your kindness towards me and my respect towards all of you, with whom living or at least seeing you would be my life. But if I should pass away, know that I will depart in the faith and religion that resounds in your churches, which I recognize as prophetic and apostolic, with the help of Christ, my Lord and God.</p>
      <p>As for our ecclesiastical and political affairs, they are such that I would prefer to explain them in person rather than describe them, as I do not wish to burden you, most pious men concerned with the entire church and republic. I commend myself to you and your prayers and respectfully greet my dearest and most esteemed teachers Rodolphus Gwalter, Josias Simler, Ludwig Lavater, Zwingli, the younger Bullingers, Julius, and our Froßhofer. Oh, may it still be granted to me to see them, may the heavenly Father grant me this, who preserves you safe and sound for His church. Given in Krakow, November 14, 1566. I dictated this from my sickbed to an amanuensis, so please forgive me. Your most devoted and respectful Christophorus Thretius.</p>
      <p>[...] to the most learned men, Heinrich Bullinger the elder, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, Johann Wolphius, the most excellent in theology and esteemed teachers. Zurich.</p>
