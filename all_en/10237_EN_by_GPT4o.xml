    <p xml:id="regest1">The consultation of the Bernese countryside revealed that they intend to remain faithful to the evangelical faith and defend it in the event of war. In Zurich, a corresponding consultation is said to have been conducted only half-heartedly. Haller inquires about the situation in Zurich, as the brief letter from the Zurich council has alarmed the Bernese. Bern fears a war. Bullinger is to communicate what he finds fault with at the Bern Synod. Haller wishes for a reunion. Utz Eckstein was hospitably received in Bern. Tensions between Haller and Megander. Haller requests Bullinger's scholia on the Gospel of John.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Regarding what I recently wrote about the envoys sent to the countryside, we have learned that, although it was also established among you, it was neglected for certain reasons: Our people in the countryside agree on this, that they will remain in the religion we now profess, and would sooner die than allow themselves to be torn away from it. If the violence of the enemies attacks either themselves first or the allies of the religion from the confederates, they will confront the enemy with all their might, provided that other armies and war leaders are subordinated to them. I would prefer that you alone know all this, rather than it being spread from me to others. We write to you, see that we are informed of your affairs. For the letter from your council, although sent by the diakosies, has somewhat alarmed our people, being so abbreviated and curtailed, that we understood neither the beginning nor the end of the assembly. The people of Bern fear wars, but as long as it cannot be otherwise, the countryside promises to be most steadfast.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you have never yet indicated, even in words, what you desire in our synod, except what I understand from elsewhere, that many things are dragged into calumny, many are considered as seedbeds of errors. If I had not daily expected your presence, with which I will nevertheless be perpetually frustrated, sooner dying than seeing you again, I would have long since remonstrated with you. Therefore, through Christ our common Jesus, through the love of each for the other, I beseech you, as soon as possible, to indicate, along with the arguments by which you are moved, and also to respond to the questions raised. For Satan is plotting the worst among us.</p>
      <p>We received Udalrich Eckstein with the liberality we could. Many of these come to us.</p>
      <p>Moreover, dearest Heinrich, truly my heart, I am now exposed to new dangers, I say of false brothers, who are so devoted to their own glory that they would not spare to tear apart any good people if they could. I detest contention, I was not born to contend. I would rather yield the city and office than wish to expect new tragedies daily. I would rather shed tears than move the pen. This is the grace that is owed to me for the services poured out on some. May the Lord, with your prayers, deign to preserve me for His glory. I fear this man is driven by a spirit of arrogance and ambition and faction. You know whom I mean. There is no enmity with me, but in the meantime, I am circumvented and badly slandered. My old friend Franc is of the same mind with me. We fear more for the church than for ourselves. But about these things more extensively another time. Pray to the Lord for me and keep this calamity of mine in your heart.</p>
      <p>That Eckius barely spoke three words to me, although I was detained by gout and lying in bed.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Ah, when will I finally be able to say farewell to you in person? I am in poor health physically, and my mind is daily disturbed. I would have made nothing of Satan, if only he had left the brothers intact.</p>
      <p>The last of March in the year 33.</p>
      <p>Yours whom you know.</p>
      <p>What you noted about John, I will not cease to demand, until I have extorted it for my use for at least a month.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zurich, his always dearest brother.</p>
