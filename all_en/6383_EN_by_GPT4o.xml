      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, dear brother, written in detail about these movements of yours in the Rhaetian region, somewhat late.</p>
      <p>They were written on February 10th; I received them on the 20th of the same month, but I had already seen those you had written to Joachim Beldius; for these were shown to me by the interpreter of the king's envoy, who is staying in Solothurn.</p>
      <p>He had been in Chur, was returning through us to Solothurn, and greeted me here.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I thought it necessary to explain the whole story to the councilors, which I did.</p>
      <p>At the same time, letters from Lucerne were brought, also testifying to the seditions occurring among you.</p>
      <p>Our people were indignant that you had exposed your danger to the Lucerners sooner than to us.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, our people have convened a meeting in Baden on March 4th, in which a remedy for those disturbances will be discussed.</p>
      <p>At the same time, our people sent a courier with letters to inquire about your situation, and it was indicated that a meeting in Baden was convened on account of you Rhaetians, etc.</p>
      <p>You undoubtedly already know this.</p>
      <p>I am very grieved because of the foreign princes and the partisanship that divides us so in Switzerland; this tearing apart is a very certain prognostic that our affairs will soon collapse.</p>
      <p>Someone returning from Locarno the day before from Milan reports that a proper army of Spanish soldiers has been brought to Genoa by ships, which is to be stationed through Piedmont and Milan.</p>
      <p>What is this, if what he reports is true? He adds that San Pietro has already occupied the whole of Corsica, except for one or two places; and that a fleet is also being prepared by the Turk.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received anything about the death of Maximilian.</p>
      <p>I have been expecting letters from Nuremberg and Augsburg for a long time; otherwise, I have had nothing from Germany for several weeks.</p>
      <p>What has been extensively written to me from the borders of Transylvania, I have collected and described here, but I send it so that you may return it with the next messenger; share it with the most honorable lord envoy, whom you will greet most respectfully from me.</p>
      <p>The envoy of the king of Solothurn is said to have descended to Basel, because there are great obstacles there to the treaty being concluded, which he is trying to remove.</p>
      <p>I do not know whether the Bernese have accepted it.</p>
      <p>For a long time, I have received no letters either from Bern or Geneva.</p>
      <p>If you have any certain news from Italy, share it.</p>
      <p>To your complaint, I can respond with nothing other than what I do in similar cases, I teach you the same: look to God, invoke Him, and persist in duty.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>February 23, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours always.</p>
      <p>Greet the councilors and good men.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
