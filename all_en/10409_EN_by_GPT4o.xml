    <p xml:id="regest1">Waiting for letters from him. Constance informed the council of Zurich on May 16 about the victory of Philip of Hesse against the troops of King Ferdinand I in the Battle of Lauffen; further successes in the war for the reinstatement of Duke Ulrich of Württemberg. Due to the Free County of Burgundy, the council of Zurich wants to avoid approaching Philip of Hesse and Ulrich of Württemberg as much as possible, so as not to offend them; Bern cautiously asked the two in a letter to show restraint towards the county, considering the existing inheritance agreement with the Confederates. The Zurich response (in this matter to the other Confederates) has probably been delayed due to coordination with the deputies of other places. Guillaume du Bellay negotiated in Zurich with Bullinger and Pellikan about the prerequisites for an agreement with the Catholics; the proposals of the reformed places of the Confederation are then to be sent to Paris. The people of Zurich assured him of their peacefulness, but emphasized their intention to adhere to the truth of the Gospel; du Bellay asked for the avoidance of harsh formulations. Bullinger remains skeptical. In his opinion, du Bellay's goal is: 1. To present King Francis I to the Protestants as a protector of the Gospel and 2. To make certain, hardly genuine concessions of the Pope popular. Further details are evident from Vadian's enclosed letter. What is the situation with Karlstadt's matter?</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I cannot express how much I long for your letters, nor do I know if I have ever been without your letters for so long. In the meantime, I have been wishing for them very frequently amidst these turbulent times.</p>
      <p>Constance wrote to our council on the 16th of this month about the king being defeated by the Prince of Hesse and put to flight near the small town of Lauffen at the Neckar, where two thousand were killed and drowned in the Neckar, and also about Philip of the Palatinate, the commander of the king's army, being wounded, etc. How much we all wish this to be true. Indeed, we anxiously pray to God between hope and fear and rejoice somewhat - we would rejoice more if it were confirmed to be true. Others report that the duke has besieged and stormed the small town of Calw - indeed, it is very fortified - located by the Nagold stream near the ancient monastery of Hirsau, but we have no letters about this matter, only rumors have spread. If you have anything certain we can rely on, I beg you to write.</p>
      <p>Regarding the County of Burgundy, my lords did not want to write to the princes. I think those from Bern have written to both Württemberg and Hesse. I have also seen the copy, in which they express that they have heard no practice has been made over the County of Burgundy. If it is so, they ask to remain still, as the county is related to them by inheritance, etc. Our people, however, not wanting to offend the princes in any way, since it is not allowed to assist as desired, did not want to write anything for this reason. The reason why no envoys or letters were sent recently, as I had hoped and the senators had raised my hopes, was the shortness of time, and because certain men were appointed by the council to prepare a response. But I believe it has been discussed with the envoys of the other cities.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Guillaume du Bellay, the orator of the King of France, brother of the Bishop of Paris, came to Zurich, called us to a meeting, and there he discussed much about restoring the church's concord, asking that if we had any advice, we should indicate it, and also in which matters we would be willing to concede something to the Catholics and in which we would want to persist. He therefore asked that the people of Zurich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, etc., show some middle ground in writing, through which the church could unite, and send it to Paris. We responded, for Pellikan was with me, in many words to each point, but in summary: we have no other medium of concord and peace than the word of the Gospel and peace which the peaceful King Christ entrusted to the apostles. We preach this, have instituted everything according to this rule, and it is not safe to deviate from it even a hair's breadth. However, we love the king, who desires to restore concord. For his sake, if it also seems good to the other brothers, we are gladly prepared to set forth the sum of our doctrine and to give whatever we can to the weak, as long as it is consistent with the truth. Here he advised us not to write anything too harsh: "In this we will be, in this the Roman church erred, we will not tolerate the tyranny of the Roman pontiff, the Roman pontiff is the antichrist, etc." From this, I understood there is little hope unless we concede more than is reasonable, etc. We therefore departed and promised to communicate to the other brothers what he had told us. I seemed to see in the meantime that the learned man was pursuing two things: 1. To commend the king to us, so that he might have our spirits more favorable and bound to him, so that if he began anything, we would object less, hoping that through him the Gospel would be restored. 2. When the Roman pontiff sees that superstition is almost over, which he cannot defend with any tyranny, he turns to simulated clemency, offering what is unjust (as far as he is concerned) to take away what is just, that is, desired, etc. The rest is evident from Vadian's letters, which I ask you to return. I could not write more, indeed I could not even reread these; the messenger was in such a hurry and the business was pressing.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest of friends, keep me commended to you. But what about the matter of Karlstadt?</p>
      <p>May 18, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your H. B.</p>
