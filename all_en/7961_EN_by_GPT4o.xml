      <p>Greetings. I wonder if my letters have reached you, dear brother, as I have not received any from you for quite a long time.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the scarcity of messengers is hindering you; for I do not think you are ill. Whatever the case, I know you are willing, as long as the opportunity presents itself. Recently, I wrote about the affairs in England; now, I will tell you what is being circulated about the affairs in France. I will not say how certain they are; those who write and report these things claim they are very certain. On June 25th, the Italians were killed by the faithful before they could join the king's army. Then, when the royal forces besieged the town of La Charit√©-sur-Loire (Scharite) on the Loire, it is said to have been relieved by the admiral, who defeated and routed the royal troops, capturing all their baggage and artillery. It is reported that distinguished men fell here, and some were captured and taken to La Rochelle. When the king was thus worn down by such defeats, he withdrew from the field and stationed his forces through garrisons, preparing for a new war. Therefore, the Swiss and the Rhaetians are now being called for assistance. If they go to war, they will destroy themselves. For winter is already approaching; they are setting out to a region devastated and emptied by long wars; provisions will be lacking; the plague has also occupied those places, and there is an incredible scarcity of necessary things, which must inevitably lead to severe hardship. Now, even if a large salary is paid, it will hardly be possible to buy bread with it. But usually, a small salary is paid; for the captains take care of their own affairs, not at all concerned about the soldiers, who perish daily; for they themselves receive the money or salaries of the dead, etc. And many other things happen that destroy the wretched, which I do not wish to list here in order. Therefore, it will be your duty and that of all the pious to warn them and impress upon them how to guard themselves from destruction. But if they absolutely refuse to obey, let them suffer the consequences of their own fault. If we do not warn them of the dangers, the Lord will punish us.</p>
      <p>The people of Glarus do not want to give soldiers to the king; I think the same will be done by the people of Basel and Schaffhausen, etc. You understand what needs to be done. Speak privately with wise men, so that they too may do their duty. Greet them and farewell, and write sometime.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 12, 1569.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you. May your wife, children, and household be safe.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful pastor and minister of the church in Chur, my esteemed lord and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
