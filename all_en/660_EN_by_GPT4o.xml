      <p>Greetings. I do not know what to write; just as we did in swearing, so now we have done in the French treaty, if it is true, which I have heard in passing from some insignificant people. However, the one who delivers this will narrate everything better; for before it was concluded, he complained to me that he feared what has happened. Sultzerus on the ninth Sunday cried out so sharply against it that some from the Cantons threatened to confront him legally (so says Gastius). Veltius on the same Sunday acted in the opposite manner and on the following one even more vehemently and seems to have prevailed. Those two have caused us to be in danger, which, however, we can excellently despise in the Lord. It was not possible to stop this torrent except with great danger, not indeed ours and perhaps even ours, but of the gospel; for some have begun to boast: The priests bring us, if we follow them, the gospel in eight days, thus arguing: If we accept the alliance, we will keep the gospel along with our freedom; for the Frenchman either challenges it; if we do not accept it, we are of the emperor, who challenges both our freedom and our righteousness, given by God, namely Christ Jesus, etc. Thus it happened that I, as much as in me, kept silent along with all the others. Indeed, I spoke about the oath and clearly; I spoke about alliances in general, that they are permissible if honest; I also spoke about the tyranny of the king against the pious, but not rashly. Nevertheless, I did not move except to some tragic words, which I preferred to restrain by silence, and I succeeded. However, I wanted that the gospel should retain its place through me. Enough about this matter.</p>
      <p>Today I learned that the people of Magdeburg, surrounded by two bishops and some unknown prince, have broken out of the city and won bravely, capturing nobles up to 26. The news is from the court of the Palatine, from SÃ©lestat, from Colmar. Besides this, I have nothing.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all yours and the brothers. In Basel, hastily, August 26, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his in the Lord.</p>
