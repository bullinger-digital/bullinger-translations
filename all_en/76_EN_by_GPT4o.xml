    <p xml:id="regest1">Curione received Bullinger's letter [not received] and also his Christian and well-designed book [«Series et digestio temporum»] as a gift through the Zurich student [Konrad Forrer?] recommended to him. In his rich and significant writing, he vividly presents to the reader (indeed to all of Christendom!) the work of the Apostle Paul, which surpassed the tasks accomplished by Hercules, in chronological order. While he did not surpass the great achievement of the Apostle, he certainly accomplished something comparable. Bullinger's depiction of the events of that time even allowed Curione to immerse himself in that era!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Bullinger should continue to contribute to the promotion and glory of the Church with such works and at the same time encourage his colleague and godfather, Rudolf Gwalther, who is so famous and learned for his young age, to publish something as magnificent as his work «Der Endchrist» or his writing [«Οἰκέτης sive servus ecclesiasticus»], which Bullinger included with his book gift. If the pastors and church administrators thoroughly read Gwalther's latest work, they will make fewer mistakes in the exercise of their offices.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">To return to the [mentioned] Zurich scholar: Curione received him very kindly and offered him every support. But what happened to him? One day after his arrival with Huldrych Zwingli the Younger, he disappeared again! Some claim he set off for Paris. Such a sudden change of mind in young people is indeed astonishing... Yet he appeared to Curione to be well-mannered and to have received a good education in Greek and Latin. Bullinger should know, however, that it is not Curione's fault if the students recommended to him by Bullinger are not well received by the people of Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Curione found Bullinger's judgment, conveyed by letter, about the Augsburg Religious Discussion [not received] very accurate. Unless God thwarts the decisions [of the interim committee], [Bullinger's fears] will likely come true.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">There is no news from Basel. However, from Italy, it is learned that the Venetians fear the arrival of Emperor Charles V's troops [in Italy] and have therefore appointed a supreme commander. This only happens in the greatest danger! According to some coming from Italy, Pope Paul III and Charles V are said to have concluded a truce. This is also evident from the fact that a large part of the papal soldiers and garrisons have been dismissed from Parma and the other cities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">As soon as Bullinger has news, he should share it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Greetings and a request for prayer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Greetings to Bullinger's family and to Theodor Bibliander, who has just published his new work [«De ratione communi omnium linguarum et literarum commentarius»], as well as to Rudolf Gwalther and the other [pastor colleagues].</p>

      <p>Greetings through Christ Jesus. From the one you recommended to me, the student of your church and school, most wise and beloved Bullinger, I received your letter along with the holy and elegant gift. You have rendered a remarkable service, worthy of your unique teaching, by presenting to us (indeed to the Christian republic!) the labors of Paul, more than Herculean, and the order and deeds of those times as if on a tablet to be viewed. In this matter, if you have not surpassed, you have at least equaled Paul's immense labors with a happy style and treatment. Your little book pleased me so much, and the description of ancient times affected me so, that I seemed to be not of this age, but one of those times.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, continue, my most learned Bullinger, to enrich and adorn the church with such gifts and to encourage your illustrious young man in age, but old in learning and wisdom, Rudolf Gwalther, your godfather, brother, and sacred colleague, to also produce something daily of this kind, like his Antichrist and this sermon, which you sent to me attached to your little book. If pastors and dispensers of God's mysteries will look upon it, they will err less in their administration. I thank you for both.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>But to write something about your student: I received him most kindly and offered all my effort and study. However, I do not know what was on his mind. They say he left the day after he came to me with Zwingli. And there are those who say he is going to Paris. I was indeed not a little surprised by the young man's sudden change. And he seemed to me otherwise well-instructed and to have made considerable progress in Greek and Latin letters. However, I wanted to inform you, my brother and patron, so that you would understand that it is not due to me that those recommended to me by you are not in good favor and care with us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I had previously received your most courteous letters, in which your judgment about the Augsburg religious colloquy greatly pleased me. For I do not think otherwise, unless the Lord thwarts their plans.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I hear nothing new here. But from Italy, it is said that the Venetians especially fear this preparation of the emperor. Therefore, they have appointed a dictator, which they scarcely do even in the greatest danger and trepidation. Those coming from Italy affirm that there is a truce between the pope and the emperor, and that this is a sign of it, that the pope has dismissed a large part of the soldiers and garrisons he had in Parma and other cities.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>If you have anything else, as soon as you write to me, you will inform us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell, happy father, and pray to God for us. Basel, 12th day before the calends of April, 1548.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Greet your family in our name and also Mr. Bibliander, who has also given a new work, and Mr. Gwalther and others.</p>
      <p>Yours as always, Caelius S. signed.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious bishop of the church of Zurich, most wise teacher, and most vigilant pastor, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed friend and patron. Zurich.</p>
