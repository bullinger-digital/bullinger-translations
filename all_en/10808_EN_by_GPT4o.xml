    <p xml:id="regest1">Complains about the long silence from Myconius and Grynaeus. The Zurich council has approved the [First Helvetic] Confession and has again appointed [Werner Beyel and Kaspar Nasal] for the upcoming meeting, to which only council representatives are to be invited; they will bring some improvement suggestions. Recommends Grynaeus and Vadian as delegates for the planned convention in Saxony, possibly also [...] von Wattenwyl and Pellikan; he himself is needed in Zurich and cannot travel due to his gout, furthermore, Pellikan seems to him to be more suitable because of his reputation and acquaintance with Luther. Sends through Froschauer his commentary on several Pauline epistles [HBBibl I 81]. Instructs Myconius and Grynaeus to align the Latin version of the Confession with the German translation [Leo Jud's].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your prolonged silence almost exhausts me. I am writing for the third time now, yet you have not responded even once. How, I ask, is it that you write less frequently now than before, when we had not yet met in person? Either I have done something displeasing, or your health is in jeopardy. What I miss and accuse in you, I also miss and accuse in Mr. Grynaeus. He too has written nothing so far, except for a single sheet. Therefore, you will be more diligent in the future. For I cannot be persuaded to believe that you lacked topics to write about.</p>
      <p>Our council approves the confession in all respects. The previous delegates have been appointed. We have added some things, but have changed nothing, removed nothing; we added them only for the sake of clarification, which the delegates will bring to you in writing. For our presence now did not seem necessary, nor are others than the councilors said to be invited, and rightly so. For what would we do after the articles have been drafted?</p>
      <p>If indeed it is decided to send delegates to Saxony, about which discussions have recently begun, I would think it sufficient if two from the Swiss go on behalf of all: Mr. Simon Grynaeus and Dr. Joachim Vadian. [It seems to me] that these two would be enough. But if it seems necessary to add some from Zurich or Bern, let Wattenwyl and Mr. Pellikan be chosen. For my recent nomination seems unwise for many reasons, especially since our church would not want to be without my presence for such a long time. I have to preach more frequently, and in the meantime, there is no one to take on this burden, nor do we have many suitable ministers left. Other churches have almost exhausted us. Furthermore, I am beginning to suffer from gout in my left foot. It has not yet completely confined me to bed or house, but it has so far only weakened my step. But you know that those afflicted with this disease are less suitable for long journeys. Finally, Pellikan is more suitable for undertaking this task as he is older, more learned, more prudent, and of uncommon authority, and also familiar with Luther himself.</p>
      <p>What I have written in the epistles to the Thessalonians, both the first and the second, likewise in both to Timothy, in the one to Titus and Philemon, Froschauer will deliver. Please accept this as a gift from me.</p>
      <p>We impose upon you and Mr. Grynaeus the duty to compare the Latin confession in all respects with the German one and to restore it so that it corresponds to the latter. For in many places they differ otherwise, and the German is clearer and more comprehensive. Hence, we want the Latin to be restored and composed according to this one.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 22, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the dearest man Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the people of Basel, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
