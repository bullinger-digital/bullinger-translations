    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer thanks for Bullinger's letter [from January 22; not received]. The [letter from the Zurich council] has been received with thanks by the people of Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In the meantime, Bullinger will have received Blarer's letter [No. 2763]. In it, Blarer reported on the [Hohentwiel] treaty [between Duke Ulrich] of Württemberg [and Emperor Charles V.] and about the rider [...], who inspected Thurgau.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The negotiations mentioned by Bullinger of the Commander [Johann Werner] von Reischach with seven Konstanz councilors did not take place. Blarer would not have concealed this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Contrary to what Bullinger and the Zurich council have understood, [Konrad Zwick and Blarer] did not think of an official contact [with King Francis I. in favor of the cities of Konstanz and Lindau]. Neither the council nor the secret council would have agreed to this, especially since such an approach would not be advisable. [Zwick's and Blarer's] idea was this: Since Francis I. and the Swiss Confederates are interested in ensuring that [Lindau and Konstanz] do not fall to the Emperor, one (or preferably a Confederate) should skillfully draw Francis I.'s attention to the situation of the two cities to prompt him to make contact. If the cities were then interested in France's offer, they would accept it. If not, Francis I. would suffer no disadvantage. However, if the cities were to contact Francis I. first and achieve nothing, it could be disastrous for them. [Zwick and Blarer] consider this a good plan, and Bullinger will know what to do.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] He should report whether the Swiss Confederates have granted Francis I. as many mercenaries as desired.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Blarer encloses the "consolation note" in which Georg Frölich reports on the despondent people of Augsburg. May God strengthen His own so that they do not become entirely a subject of ridicule and disgrace!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The rumors about the Emperor's death persist. The envoys of the upper-land cities [Biberach, Isny, Kempten, Memmingen, and Ravensburg], who were to pay homage, have not yet been admitted, citing the Emperor's poor health. A letter to Konstanz reported that Maximilian, the son of King Ferdinand I., had come to Ulm and demanded that the people of Ulm swear allegiance to him instead of the Emperor, which was refused. The Konstanz council is sending a messenger [...] to verify the truth of this news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] From Milan, it is learned that Genoa was not conquered. The 6000 Italian mercenaries furloughed by the Emperor are supposed to move to Milan, which is causing concern there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Reports from Augsburg and Nuremberg also speak of a victory by Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony [over Duke Maurice]. Perhaps God will let His light shine again and let the Philistines fall upon Saul [i.e., the Emperor] elsewhere to be delivered from the present distress. God's will be done! However, since God's children have brought this situation upon themselves, they should bravely face the enemy to die an honorable Christian death rather than perish disgracefully. Bullinger and the Zurich church should pray to God to grant heart and courage to endure everything in His name.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] About 4000 Spanish [soldiers] (who, however, make up only part of the army) have been quartered in Ulm. They are arrogant. Some people of Ulm have given them their entire house instead of hosting them and thus exposing their wives and children to disgrace and shame. The Spaniards cannot change their nature and continue to lead a shameless, impure life.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] One awaits the things to come. The priests of Konstanz and their followers display great arrogance. Hopefully, this mischief will not have to be let back into the city, as that would be a sure sign of God's wrath. Although there are still a handful of brave, pious people in Konstanz, the majority are weak, and the fickleness of the common people causes Blarer great concern. He hopes that God will make the people strong should it come to battle. What an honor it would be to seal one's faith with one's blood! Blarer often thinks of the city [Alexandria] (in Eusebius' [Historia ecclesiastica]), whose inhabitants all showed themselves ready to die in the flames. If only one could muster such courage and zeal!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Blarer must break off, as he also wants to write to Augsburg and Strasbourg. Konstanz messengers are being sent there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Greetings, also from [Thomas] Blarer and [Konrad Zwick]. Bullinger should inform whether he has received Blarer's letter [No. 2763].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] [P.S.:] The brave Captain Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz, who captured the Ehrenberg pass, is in Konstanz with his wife [Anna, née Zehntmeier] and children. He has left Ulm because he does not trust the situation there. The Innsbruck government has had [Albrecht] Völker von Knöringen arrested in [Radolf]zell. They also wanted to arrest Captain [Hans] Egli. Since he was absent, his assets were inventoried and confiscated. The house of Captain Mundi [Eadimundus Precht] (who is currently in Konstanz) was also plundered. They want to take everything from them!</p>

      <p>Friendly, especially trusted, dear brother. For your very faithful, diligent writing, I express my utmost thanks. May the Lord let you enjoy it both in time and eternity. The letter from your council has been received here with friendly thanks, as is proper.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have recently written to you about the Württemberg treaty; also about the rider who inspected the area all around in Thurgau, etc. I hope it has reached you as well.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Know and believe me, there is nothing to the negotiations of the Commander, the one from Reischach, and that seven councilors were with him, as you wrote; I would not have concealed it from you otherwise, etc.</p>

      <p>Regarding the French, the intention was not at all that it should be such a grand presentation as you and yours understood. Much less would it be appropriate for my lords, whether the secret or other councils, to request and insist on it, as this would not be advisable for them in any way. However, this was our plan: Since the French and the Confederates are quite interested in ensuring that these two cities do not become too imperial, he was reminded of this by a person, and then instructed to find out whether such an intention could be achieved with these cities; if a good decision was found, the matter would proceed. If not, this inquiry and experience would not be disadvantageous to the French. However, if these cities were to approach the French and achieve nothing, it could bring them significant harm for several reasons, as you can imagine. I wanted to remind you of this good intention. You can judge for yourself that this matter would have a much more skillful appearance (also with the king) if it were not done by these cities themselves, but by others, especially someone from the Confederation. It seems to us that it would be very well done and worth the cost. But you know well how to do it right.</p>

      <p>Write to me whether the Confederates have allowed and granted the French as many mercenaries as he requested.</p>

      <p>What Letus wrote to me as a consolation note regarding his own situation, I send to you herewith. In summary, everyone's heart has fallen! May God raise and strengthen us again, so that we do not become entirely a subject of ridicule and disgrace!</p>

      <p>There is still persistent talk that the Emperor is dead. The envoys from the upper-land cities, who are supposed to pay homage, have not yet been able to proceed. They are being held back. It is said that the Emperor is somewhat weak; they cannot be let in. A letter has come from someone, stating that Maximilian, the king's son, has come to Ulm and demanded that the people of Ulm swear allegiance to him instead of the Emperor, which they have refused and said: When the Emperor comes in person, they will do it. If it is true, my lords want to find out through their own messenger, whom they are sending for this purpose.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Letters have come from Milan stating that Genoa has not been conquered. It is well understood, but they have not been able to carry it out. Meanwhile, it is said that the 6000 Italians, who were furloughed by the Emperor, are hastily moving towards Milan, which is why the people of Milan are worried.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Regarding the Elector and his victory, it is also consistently written from Augsburg and Nuremberg as you wrote. We trust in the dear God, that He will perhaps let His light shine again and let the Philistines fall upon Saul elsewhere, so that we may be delivered from this distress. But if it is God's will in heaven, so be it! We have all deserved it. Therefore, I would very much like us to bravely face the enemy, so that we die an honorable, Christian death, which we have well deserved, rather than perish disgracefully. Oh, pray to God earnestly with your entire church for us, that He may give us heart and courage to endure everything with a joyful heart and to bear everything for His name's sake.</p>

      <p>About 4000 Spaniards have been quartered in Ulm. There are still few there. They are very arrogant. They have been lodged in all houses. Some have completely vacated their houses for them. They would rather leave them entirely than have them with them, and have their wives and children in disgrace and shame. For they do not change their ways and lead their impure lives without any shame.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>We are still waiting to see what will be done with us or what will be undertaken. Our priests and their followers are very arrogant and proud. I hope, dear, faithful God, that we will not fall into this disgrace, that we will have to let this abomination back in; for this would be a sure sign of His grim wrath and certain, miserable ruin. There are still a handful of brave, pious people among us, but many are weak, and the inconstancy of the common people's minds makes me fearful. But I hope and trust in the merciful Father in heaven, if it comes to a fall, He will make His spirit strong and powerful in all, so that we will bind everything to it. Oh, how could it go better for us and how blessed we would be if our blood sealed our confession! How often I think of the city apud Eusebium lib. 8. cap. 10, where everyone let themselves be burned. Oh, that we also had such courage and zeal! Well, I assure myself of all good things from God. If the need is great, His help and support will be even greater.</p>

      <p>I must break off. I also have to write to Augsburg and Strasbourg, as my lords are sending messengers to both places.</p>

      <p>Greet all good lords and friends. May God be with all good things with you and your household in time and eternity.

      <p>Captain Dietrich Marcell, who captured the Klause, is here with his wife and child; a worthy man. He can no longer be in Ulm. He does not want to trust. The government in Innsbruck has had the Felcher von Knöringen arrested in Zell. They also wanted to arrest Captain Eckle. He is not there. They have inventoried and confiscated everything from him. They have also raided Captain Mundi. He is now here. They want to take everything from them!</p>
      <p>To his beloved lord and brother, Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, to be delivered, etc.</p>
