      <p>Greetings. We received your letters much too late; for they were dated in ZÃ¼rich on November 19th, but were delivered to me along with the books, which are most dear to me at such a small price, on November 29th at the fourth hour in the afternoon. Then, the ones you wrote on November 26th, we received at the fifth hour of the same day. On November 28th, Mykonius wrote about holding a meeting among us, which he said would be useful and necessary, but he omitted when and where it should soon be held. We replied to him that we do not object to the meeting, which the people of Basel could indeed announce to our people and to you at the best opportunity. Now you see how it happened that we neglected this meeting. We ask, however, that you do not abandon your plan, since it seems to be done for the highest glory of God and the advancement of our churches, but that you set another day for the meeting at the same place, namely in Aarau, in due time, so that you can be sure that we are aware and ready to visit it. And the more secretly it can ever be done, the more willingly we will attend. But if you cannot have a messenger to us at all, arrange to send letters to the prefect of Lenzburg, but ensure that he takes care to have them delivered to us by his messengers soon, which he will do, once you indicate to him even the smallest note. You know him to be a good man, to whom we can safely entrust everything on both sides. Therefore, nothing delayed us except that we received your letters very late and that we could not understand from Mykonius' letters that the day had already been set.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell, my Heinrich, with the other colleagues, men and brothers most dear to us all in the Lord.</p>
      <p>November 29th, at the ninth hour after dinner, in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. Haller.</p>
