      <p> Greetings. That Transylvanian delivered your letters to me along with two writings from those who in Transylvania bend and twist the main tenets of our religion into the rule of ancient heresies. May the Lord convert them or overthrow them. Enclosed you will find the latest news as it reached me. Since I had it recorded for you, a letter arrived from Bern, dated November 2nd, stating that some papists in Lyon, pouring out in the conflict in France, have killed Cond√©. The opposite is said by others. It is certain that the young Guise and Lord Montpensier and 4 or 6 great lords of the king's order have been captured and killed. Much else of the like is being said, which at this time I am unable to write. If I live or have the opportunity, I will write more completely in 8 days and perhaps more certainly. </p>
      <p> The 5 places say that the Spanish troops are in Burgundy and are at odds with each other. Bellievre has gone to Lucerne, would have liked to stop the march, but was unable to, and is also held in low esteem and not in great honor. I think the people will not relent until they find that they gain nothing. </p>
      <p> May God grant us grace and peace and protect us from misfortune. At this time it is not possible for me to write more; consider it good. God be with you. Greet for me the three mayors and good gentlemen and friends, Mr. Gantner, Mr. Pontisella, etc. </p>
      <p> Friday, November 5, 1568. </p>
      <p> Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable lord and beloved brother. </p>
      <p> Chur. </p>
