      <p>Greetings. I received, venerable Father Bullinger, what was sent to you from Strasbourg. I took care to bring to myself a certain testimony of truth very necessary for my reputation; for it was necessary to close the mouths of insolent and ungrateful men, who, lest they seem to have unjustly expelled their pastor, invent all sorts of slanders, with truth and the testimony of good men. Therefore, I thank you and send back the letter of our Conrad.</p>
      <p>In Italy, everywhere is being gathered for France against our people. The Duke of Savoy, when asked to be the leader, is said to have refused. What our lords have conceded, I believe you have long since understood from others. We pray to the Lord that He may be present to those defending a good and just cause and may restrain the wicked and scatter, confound, destroy the plans of the Antichrist, and turn all evil into his camp. A certain brother, who was from my church, an Italian, but a truly pious and honest man, whose wife and children still live in Chiavenna, when he had gone to Italy for certain business, was captured by monks and thrown into prison, and by the grace of God has remained constant and strong in the confession of faith as he remains; he is to be commended to the prayers of the church, that the Lord may keep him in good and deliver him from evil.</p>
      <p>Count Ulysses is still suffering from consumption, but there is hope of life. He sends you many greetings. I wish all the brothers to be greeted in my name. Farewell; may the Lord keep you. Amen. I prepare myself and my family for the journey.</p>
      <p>Plurs, 17th of November, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours always from the heart, H[ieronymus] Z[anchi].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, H[einrich] Bullinger, pastor and father of the church of Zurich, most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
