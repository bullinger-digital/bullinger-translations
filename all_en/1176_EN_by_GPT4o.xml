      <p>Ten days ago, I returned home from the Diet of Augsburg, most learned Bullinger, where I stayed for the eighth month, saw many things, and heard even more, which brought me great distress and not just annoyance. In the final act, a disgraceful retreat of our men took place. You already know that for many years, pious and serious opinions have been expressed by our people regarding the council, and serious requests have been made to the Emperor about the manner and order of recognition, and it was obtained and decreed in previous diets that the council should be free, general, pious, and Christian, and the Imperial Majesty promised to procure this. At the beginning and middle of these diets, it was also requested by the temporal electors and some princes, quite consistently and seriously, that the Emperor should ensure that the qualities sought concerning the council are provided and maintained, and that everything is examined and established with a comprehensive and thorough judgment, so that the prejudices of a few do not deceive such serious causes. For if the Pope continues to decide alone in such serious matters with usurped judgments, the expected fruit of the council will not only be delayed by intercessions and exceptions but will entirely fall and perish. And under this hope, while matters were pending, the bull itself was presented and read in the assembly of all the states, which openly and without any circumlocution wants the council to be continued and its prosecution and completion to be carried out as it was begun, and to be completed from the remaining terms. The Pope also says that the convocation and governance of the council are owed to him as the supreme pontiff by divine right. This bull, I say, having been read before the states, no one except the Mauritians interceded, and all the states were ordered by the Imperial Majesty to appear and participate in the council according to the prescription of the bull. Some of the cities indicated in writing that they consent to the council according to the decrees of previous councils and the writings given on this article; however, this response of theirs was rejected by the Roman king. Some were separately asked how they wished to consent to the council and whether they had decided to dissent from the will of the Imperial Majesty in this article. From these, it is clear what is being sought. I observe the inclination and servitude of the present times, consider the multitude, power, frauds, and hypocrisies of our adversaries, have well-known the slippery faith in the nearest and the Vatinian hatred against us; what counsel do you think should be taken in such great difficulties and impending dangers? Shall we betray and deny our most just and holy cause and God through silence, fear, and disgrace? Otherwise, the judgments of the judges are null and void, and by the silence of the parties, they become valid and pass into a res judicata. We owe thanks to the Pope, who acts against us in open battle and openly attacks our religion, which, unless we wish it to be prostituted and deserted, we must stand against. In these matters, I seek your judgment, most learned Bullinger, through this messenger, who is a good and pious man, and trust him in a certain other narrative, which I entrusted to him to be communicated to your lordship, and remember the opinion that Demosthenes has: the greatest bulwark of republics is distrust. Commend me to your son-in-law, also to Bibliander and others. I offer my services to you. Farewell well in Strasbourg, February 17, 1551. I ask that you ensure these other letters are delivered to Mr. Vergerius.</p>
