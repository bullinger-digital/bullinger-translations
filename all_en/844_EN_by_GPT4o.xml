      <p>Greetings. Through Lord Vergerius, I conveyed to you and the brothers my greetings, because at that time there was no leisure for writing; and although I could not write anything then that I thought you could not understand from him, I still considered this duty owed to your virtue and your constancy in maintaining friendship, so that you might understand from my letters as well (which I trust you have long since known otherwise) that my spirit is and will always be most ready for you and the brothers in Zürich, just as you also write that yours is ready for us in your letters. All of you in Zürich owe me much (I speak of the learned and those who are known to me), both for my love towards you, which I have never kept hidden, and also for the testimony I have proclaimed about you among foreign nations, wherever I have been. I have said that I have seen no place in Germany (and I have seen the best part) where I have found so much piety, learning, and humanity combined; for while these qualities may be found individually in the highest degree elsewhere, I believe I have seen them united among you. But again, I willingly confess that I owed this very testimony to my conscience, so that, whenever the occasion is given, I should candidly proclaim what I feel about each matter. Therefore, if you repay my love towards you with equal love, you will perform a duty worthy of you and indeed very pleasing to me, nor will there be a need for other duties, such as you, Bullinger, promise in your letters, if I come to Zürich.</p>
      <p>Though absent from you in body, I am most present in spirit, and you have abundantly compensated for everything, as I understand that I am loved by you. I will come, however, if the Lord grants life, and I will candidly share with you what I have, nor do I doubt that I will depart from you filled with great consolation of the Spirit of Christ. In the meantime, I will not cease to write whenever I find the opportunity to send letters, which I have hitherto sought diligently but have not been able to find. I request the same duty from you. Yesterday I received letters from England written in Cambridge on January 21st, and with them other letters from Lord Gesner, which he wrote in Zürich on the seventh of June and the third day before the Kalends of September of the previous year, which have traveled quite a long time before reaching my hands. Now in my letters, they write that Fagius is indeed with God, which we knew before, but that Bucer has recovered and is lecturing on Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians in the presence of a large gathering of students. There is great hope for the liberation of the Protector, and envoys have been sent to the King of France regarding the conditions of peace. The rest, God willing, in person. Farewell with all the brothers and the whole church. Basel, February 24, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
