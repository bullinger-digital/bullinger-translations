    <p xml:id="regest1">Suspected as the reason for Bullinger's silence is the burden of his office. The following news can also be shared with Vadian and others. [Konrad Hubert] wrote on May 21 from Strasbourg, according to a report from Speyer, a religious peace is to be concluded at the [Reichstag] that will satisfy neither [the Protestants] nor, even less, the followers of the Pope; more details may be available in two days after the return of [Martin Bucer]; most of the princes have departed, the city representatives not yet. Soldiers are damaging the surroundings of the city [Strasbourg] like locusts. A hailstorm has caused great damage, also in the surroundings of Speyer, leading to high prices; King Ferdinand was surprised by hail on May 14 near Speyer during a ride with his sons and many horses, reportedly falling and being separated from his sons, as a merchant reports; this is a divine warning to him. Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] brought two wolves to Speyer and hunted them there, which some bishops took personally. A good friend [Bucer?] writes, Emperor [Charles V] behaves according to his motto "plus ultra", King Ferdinand seeks help against the Turks, [Duke Henry of] Brunswick flatters the princes; they indulge in pleasures and hardly care about religion; among the preachers there is calm, those from Cologne, Saxony, and Hesse preach only occasionally in monasteries, [Ambrosius] Pelargus, however, in the [Cathedral]; the latter disapproves of the concord zeal of [Georg] Witzel and [Bucer?]. A Latin and a German booklet were published about the Duke of Brunswick [“Vera, constans et solida responsio” and “Bestendige, ergrundte und wärhafftige antwort”]; the Emperor will hardly condemn his misdeeds, as he loves robbers more than Lutherans, hears mass daily, has his proud motto carried ahead on two pillars, and brings along a mistress from Ghent. Margrave Ernst [of Baden] has certified the validity of a priest's marriage but refused a church wedding. [Sebastian] Lepusculus and [Ulrich] Hugwald are soon to receive their doctorates. Greetings, also to Vadian, if Bullinger shares this news with him. Gast intends to come to Zurich soon; further greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I cannot sufficiently express my wonder that you, Bullinger, do not write back to Gast at all. If church matters are hindering you, I can easily bear it, for they must be attended to first; but I suspect no other obstacles. Therefore, continue in the Lord to illuminate the Church of Christ with your labors; you will receive a worthy reward from Him.</p>
      <p>The news that I want you to know and that is of some importance, which has come to me, is as follows, which you can also share with Mr. Vadian and the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Someone wrote to me from Strasbourg on May 21: It is written to us from Speyer that a kind of peace has been given to religion, which, although it does not satisfy our people, satisfies the papists even less. I have not yet heard the conditions of peace, perhaps I will receive them in two days after my lord returns. Almost all the princes have already left, but the city representatives have not yet.</p>
      <p>Soldiers are consuming everything in our fields; these are our locusts. Eight days ago, a great hailstorm devastated fields, vineyards, and trees in the vicinity over more than 30 banns, as they call them. It is also reported to have happened in Speyer and in the surrounding countryside for more or less 12 miles in length, but not so much in width.</p>
      <p>The prices of grain and wine are rising here. King Ferdinand was caught in a hailstorm in Speyer and had difficulty returning on foot from the field, having left the town on horseback, which some interpret as a presage of future and imminent evil. This hailstorm came so suddenly that I heard from a certain merchant, who saw it with his own eyes: "It happened on May 14, when I came from Speyer and had just dismounted from my horse, there was a violent wind, and Ferdinand with his two sons and many horses were in the field for a walk. Then suddenly a terrible storm came with hail, lightning, and thunder, so that the horses became wild, one ran out here, the other there. No one paid attention to the other; for stones fell down like goose eggs. Ferdinand is said to have fallen into a ditch; the servants afterwards, who were badly battered, with the Count of Salm, who protected the king; all the other riders came into the city with the two sons of Ferdinand. The gates were closed, and there was a great outcry in the city. Ferdinand came afterwards with a few, he was let in, he asked: 'Where are my sons?', he was answered, they are in the city unharmed. Ferdinand is said to have been so struck that he looked like wax, although he is otherwise dark enough. Some say he came off the horse, got caught in a bush with his clothes; for there were many rumors about this story." The Lord warned him in time, that he might repent and give glory to Christ.</p>
      <p>Also, when the Landgrave came to Speyer, he brought two live wolves in a barrel with him, which he hunted the next day in the field, and none escaped him, which some bishops were very annoyed about; for they could well notice that they were the wolves.</p>
      <p>A good friend, who saw these things in Speyer with his own eyes, writes to me as follows: "The Emperor is acting according to his motto 'plus ultra' etc. King Ferdinand complains about the tyranny of the Turks and humbly seeks defenses and assistance against it. The Duke of Brunswick is a flatterer and a more frequent little fox of Aesop in the court of princes, an excellent sycophant. The cat causes trouble for the wolves, lest there be none to pursue. Others play, drink, whore, commit adultery, with Christ and sincere religion relegated. Of the large number of princes, very few have Christ at heart. Among the preachers, I have heard no disturbances. Those who are with the princes of Cologne, Saxony, and Hesse do not preach in public temples so far, but in monasteries, with closed doors, nor do they have frequent sermons. Pelargus preaches in the highest college somehow and does not displease himself very much. Vicelius and I do not hear well from him, as he thinks we are too eager for concord." So far he.</p>
      <p>Two booklets about the Duke of Brunswick have been published, one written in Latin, the other in German. Immortal God, what cruel crimes that beast has planned against the pious! I would never have believed that a man could rage so against the word of God. What sentence the Emperor will pass against him, I divine, that is none, because he still delicately cherishes him in his court and clings to his side as an inseparable companion. The Emperor loves robbers more than Lutherans; he hears mass daily with the highest veneration with his people; he has two pillars, the columns of Hercules, carried ahead with his 'plus ultra'. The Lord will break that title of arrogance shortly without a doubt. The Emperor took a fine girl from Ghent from her mother's lap, whom he uses in place of a mistress.</p>
      <p>Margrave Ernst, our neighbor, allowed a priest to contract marriage before all the people, but he did not want to allow him to enter the church publicly with the usual ceremony and pomp; he gave letters of testimony that the marriage is just, the wife will be the heir of all goods, the children will be legitimate and succeed the parent. See the sinister plans of that prince. We will soon have a notable act: Lepusculus and Hugwald will receive the insignia of a doctor. Who would ever have believed that an Anabaptist would become a doctor and that Lepusculus would be adorned with such dignity? 'Mopsus is given to Nisa, what should we lovers not hope for?'</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and take this my loquacity in good part. My wife and I wish you and yours well in the Lord. June 3, 1544.</p>
      <p>You can also share this with Mr. Vadian, to whom say greetings from me, if you dare to disturb his studies with these trifles.</p>
      <p>Your Gast from the heart.</p>
      <p>I will visit you shortly if the weather is clear. Greet Frisius in my name along with the old Pellican.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
