      <p>Greetings. Although I do not hope to achieve much with this writing, dearest godfather in the Lord, I did not want to deny this small amount of effort to your request. Therefore, I am sending a rough and unpolished treatment of the proposed question, not to be published as it is, but so that it may be reshaped by you and adapted to the intended purpose. I am not familiar with the customs of your people, so I cannot provide what you wanted with effectiveness. It will be your task to add what seems to be missing and, if anything is said inappropriately or superfluously, let alone dangerously, to either remove or correct it. I am not permitted to say more at present. We are well at home by the grace of the Lord; we wish the same for you and all of yours. Farewell, dearest godfather. Greetings to your entire household and all the brothers, Mr. Pellikan, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gwalther, and Mr. Bullinger. Bern, 1551, December 23.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your godfather in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dearest godfather in the Lord.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
