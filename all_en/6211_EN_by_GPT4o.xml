      <p>Grace of the Son of God be with you.</p>
      <p>So that our Johannes Wolf does not return to you empty-handed, most pious Bullinger in Christ, I have briefly written these lines as a greeting; for (as I do not doubt) he will report what is happening in this republic and in the church of Rheinau.</p>
      <p>For there, the ceremonialists, twisting the consciences of the pious, are so troubling with the ubiquity of the body of Christ, which they neither want to accept nor believe; yet indeed, out of fear of punishment and dread of imprisonment and proscription, they make themselves participants in the carnivorous Eucharist, adding hypocrisy to hypocrisy, as the prophet says, etc. And what do you expect to happen except a severe retribution and punishment of divine vengeance? Hence, I earnestly beseech you and your pious fellow ministers, for the sake of Christ, the true God and man, dwelling in heaven in his humanity until he comes to judge the living and the dead, to commend the remnants of his church to your church in prayers, lest Satan so precipitously obliterate and uproot the doctrine of piety, which has had a place there for over thirty years, etc.</p>
      <p>About the teacher from Kaisersberg, a pious and learned young man, Wolf will tell you, who, after returning from his homeland, will turn to you/us?</p>
      <p>I commend him to your kindness.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most valiant athlete of Christ, to whose prayers I commend myself.</p>
      <p>Greet your family and fellow ministers, etc. Rappoltsweiler, July 30, 1564. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Yours, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>Georg Pennar greets you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent doctor of piety and especially of sincere theology, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger of ZÃ¼rich, esteemed brother.</p>
