      <p>I am among those, most learned man, who have received a purer understanding of Christian doctrine aided by your writings. For it happened to me twenty years ago, by the providence of the divine will, to have the opportunity to peruse your books, even provided by the Spanish inquisitors themselves: from which, because I feel I have received the most abundant fruits, I am compelled to thank you, since I cannot repay you, out of a duty of gratitude. The son of Rudolf Gwalther, who carries this letter, will explain in words who I am and where I reside. I also gave him a certain booklet, which I wished to publish these days; but due to the negligence of the printer, ignorant of the Latin language, as are most of those who work here, it happened that so many errors crept in, that I am truly ashamed to present this little work, otherwise too meager, so negligently printed, to learned men. But since my intention in this writing is not to display how much learning is in me (for it is little or nothing), but to show what I think about Christian piety, to refute the slanders of some, to the evangelical churches; therefore, I would wish that some other printer would print this dialogue, and that the copies, at most three hundred, which are here most corruptly printed, would be suppressed.</p>
      <p>The articles of religion, which I placed at the end of the booklet, are taken from your confession, to refute the malice of those who, out of private hatred, with which they pursue me, have condemned these same articles, handwritten and offered to show my innocence, with utmost impudence, thinking they were my offspring.</p>
      <p>You will perceive a specimen of this malice in a certain folio here printed in Latin and English, Corranus[...] with the censures of a certain Aristarchus: so that, as is commonly said, you can recognize the lion from its claws. The younger Gwalther himself will hand you the folio and will narrate much more about the absurd manner of some towards me.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, most vigilant pastor, I pray you to consider me among those whom you have led to the knowledge of Christ through your labors and vigils; and if there is anything that does not please you in this booklet, correct it according to your judgment and remarkable prudence, and order it to be printed corrected. If you do this, you will bind me and my service to you forever in a greater way. Farewell.</p>
      <p>London, on the Nones of July, in the year of our Lord 1574.</p>
      <p>Your most loving and respectful, Antonius Corranus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, my uniquely esteemed lord and father. In Zurich.</p>
