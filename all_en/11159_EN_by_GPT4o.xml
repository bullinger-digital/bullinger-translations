    <p xml:id="regest1">Expresses impatience, as he is writing for the third time and has not yet received any information about his future position. Despite Basel's urging, Erasmus [Ritter] has ensured that Bern does not simply adopt either the Basel or Zurich draft of a response to Luther, but instead interprets the presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper in the sense of the [First Helvetic] Confession and the letter to Luther. In view of the upcoming meeting, all hopes are directed towards Zurich. Reports on the disputation with the Anabaptist leaders Hans Hotz, Mathias [Wiser], Michel Utt, and [Georg Treffer]; since agreement could only be reached on the first of several articles, the Anabaptists were threatened with banishment and the death penalty, which, however, moved only a few to recant; details of the debate can be found in the published records. Announced his resignation three weeks ago for Pentecost, after which [Simon] Sulzer was appointed as his successor; urgently wishes for information about his new office. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Health and a quiet conscience through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>If the care of the church, our common and venerable matron, did not stimulate and concern me more than my own affairs, I could also, like you, maintain a deep silence in writing. For now, I am writing to you for the third time, and none of you have deigned to respond to any of my letters, even though I have been eager for a response. I know and gladly acknowledge that you are occupied with many and various much more serious matters, so that you cannot satisfy everyone equally. I also consider that you have not yet wanted to write to me because nothing certain has been decided about the small province to be assigned to me, and it has not been your fault that it has not been resolved and communicated to me. But I would like you to consider the mind of someone who has been waiting for a long time and to put yourselves in the position of those who have been waiting even longer; for if you do this, you will be somewhat more equitable to others who are more impatient with the not entirely brief delay. So much for your prolonged silence.</p>
      <p>As for ecclesiastical matters (for which reason I have mainly decided to write this), although the people of Basel have, as they say, moved every stone to make our people agree with their, not your, draft of a response to Luther, thanks be to Christ, both your and their draft has been tempered mainly through the work of Erasmus [Ritter], so that neither does our senate agree with them on rejecting the mediators, nor has it entirely followed the opinion of the people of Basel. For where they excessively desire us to confess that Christ is present in the supper of believers, and that his body and blood are eaten and drunk as Luther says, that is, to leave it to divine power how he is present and consumed, an appendix has been added by our people, in which we acknowledge that presence of the Lord in the holy supper and such a consumption of his body, which is explicitly contained in the Basel confession and the response given to Luther at the Schmalkaldic convention.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, since our senate has agreed to the tricks of the people of Basel to the extent that ecclesiastical assemblies are announced in your metropolitan church, it will be your prudence to weigh that uncertain matter on both sides, namely whether it is expedient for the church of Christ to hear those logodaedali (word-wranglers) so often and to renew the contention or not. Certainly, you bear a heavy expectation, dearest men and brothers in the Lord, so much so that the papists, Anabaptists, and orthodox people of the entire Christian world are turning their eyes to you and are awaiting the outcome of this tragedy, alas, too long delayed on the stage. For some of them partly murmur around that we will soon return to them, since some of us say with Luther and Bucer that the body and blood of Christ are immediately distributed to the faithful mind with the offered bread and cup; others conjecture that we are entirely looking back to the Egyptian pots and will adore Luther as the already designated supreme pontiff. These, however, have good omens about you and hope that you will manage the matter with your providence, piety, and learning in such a way that you will establish nothing else in resolving the concord than what you have already established in the Basel confession and the response to Luther. Therefore, the greater and more dangerous the expectation of you is, the more it is fitting for you to be vigilant and to do everything in the utmost fear of God. I, for my part, will pray to God, as much as I can in this matter, that he may turn that discordant concord with Luther to the glory of his name and the benefit of the church, and not allow us to relapse into our former or far worse darkness due to our notable ingratitude towards him and his word purified from papal dregs, but rather that he may regard the glory of his name and so water us through his spirit, apply manure, and prune luxuriant branches, that we may bear fruits worthy of the evangelical profession and be an ornament, not a dishonor, to his name, while we foster public and Christian charity and concord among us. Amen.</p>
      <p>The disputation with the Anabaptists was concluded on the seventh day. The leaders of whom were foreigners: Johannes Hotz from the Zurich territory, a certain Mathias from Bremgarten, Michael the tailor nicknamed Utz, an Athesian, and a certain saddler, a little man from Bavaria. The articles that were debated are these: Whether the books of the Old Testament, contributing to faith and charity, are equivalent to the books of the New Testament. When this was conceded by the Anabaptists, they were first asked to give an account of their calling to the ministry of the word, then, what the church is and how it is twofold. Thereafter, as the order of things required, discussions began on paedobaptism, oaths, the Christian magistrate, and ecclesiastical censure, and were concluded on the sixth day. Since, however, agreement could not be reached on any article except the first between the Anabaptists and our evangelists, who did not debate badly, the Bernese senate and people pronounced a very harsh sentence on the Anabaptists the next day, namely that all should go into exile and be proscribed, as many as would not now repent, with the condition and omen that whoever of the proscribed is found hereafter within the borders of Bern shall be punished with the death penalty without any pardon. When this law was promulgated, scarcely one or two from the numerous multitude were found who, repenting, returned home. This was the outcome of the Anabaptist disputation. How and with what arguments the debate was conducted back and forth, the published records of the disputation will testify.</p>
      <p>The state of my affairs is as follows: Since I learned from you that I am to be recalled to my homeland shortly, I informed our preachers of this three weeks ago, so that they might inform the senate that I would be leaving here around the feast of Pentecost. Therefore, it is permissible for them, if they wish, to look for a successor in the meantime. They did not dislike the condition; for when Sulzer conveniently came to the Anabaptist disputation, the senate appointed him as my successor (as I hear). Since, therefore, a convenient opportunity for returning to my homeland by ship will present itself to me at the Durach fairs, I beseech you by Christian charity to distribute the provinces to be taught as soon as possible and to inform me of the condition decreed for me as soon as possible. For unless you inform me of it at the earliest possible time, I will stand between the altar and the stone and not know what I should do.</p>
      <p>All the orthodox here greet you and ask that you administer the office entrusted to you by God for the defense of sincere faith (as you have begun) vigorously and steadfastly, especially Ursifer Sepinus, Cyro, the secretary of the city of Bern, and Doctor Valerius, the physician and historiographer. In turn, greet your fellow ministers on my behalf, especially our Theodor.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, March 26, 1538.</p>
      <p>Johannes Rhellikan.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and pious men, Heinrich Bullinger, Megander, and Leo, presidents of the church of Zurich in the word of the Lord, to be observed as friends and patrons in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
