    <p xml:id="regest1">Read No. 463 at Blarer in Tübingen during his journey through Swabia. Nothing more stands in the way of a concord as it did during his visit to Zurich last year. Luther, who in his vehemence is not always correctly understood and has offended the people of Zurich with his writings, wants to affirm the true, firm presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, although Christ's body remains in heaven. He claims no local presence, no natural union of body and bread. From the words of institution, it follows that Christ's body is physically given with, in, and under the symbols. According to the biblical anthropomorphisms, nothing absurd should be seen in this. He leaves the manner of Christ's presence to God. The analogy of sign and signified according to Augustine's teaching was also recognized by Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther says: "Christ is present," the people of Zurich: "is present in faith." Luther's preface to the Waldensian Bohemian Brothers and Philipp Melanchthon give hope for peace, provided it is taught as in Bucer's writing "To the Münsterites." Before his meeting with Philipp Melanchthon, orchestrated by Philip of Hesse, Bucer wants to meet in one night with Bullinger, Leo Jud, Myconius, Karlstadt, and Sulzer in a small town in Schaffhausen called Neunkirch. He asks for a statement on this to Ulm or Augsburg.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I read, esteemed Bullinger, your confession at our Blarer in Tübingen. For this, I seek one or two churches in Upper Swabia. It is very pleasing, and nothing now stands in the way of a general concord, which you understand as Lutheran. I was going to discuss this matter with you extensively last year, so much so that I had come for this reason. But since you did not yet have a clear understanding of my intentions, as I believe you do now, you thought it would be more beneficial for mutual concord to civilly decline a more thorough examination of this matter. Now, however, the Lord so kindly paves the way for solid and certain concord that we should not, without grave sin against the entire church of God, desire it any longer. Therefore, I beseech you by the compassion of our Lord Jesus Christ, to persist in prayers, that He may enlighten our eyes on both sides, so that we may see in ourselves what He has given to both, and the matter will be resolved.</p>
      <p>Luther, as he is vehement in every direction, is not rightly understood by everyone, even if no feeling of offense stands in the way. It is therefore not surprising that many of his writings, especially the contentious ones, are not easily accessible to you, having been so improperly received by this man. If you have any trust in me - and you do, unless you fear somewhat my excessive zeal for concord, as it seems to you - I swear to you by my Christ, that Luther contends for nothing here beyond the true and solid presence of Christ, which can be established by the words of the Lord demonstrating and testifying to the exhibition, even if it is granted that the body of the Lord is in one place in heaven in a circumscribed manner. For he neither affirms a local presence nor unites the body of Christ with the bread naturally. Therefore, I am more surprised when I read your writings, why you so explicitly affirm that the bread remains what it is, when Luther never denied this, indeed he was the first to affirm it. He sees the words here as an exhibition, and especially of the Lord's body, the bread only as a symbol of this, and from there it follows that the Lord's body itself, which was given for us, is given here, and since it is not in vain, it is also received and thus present. Therefore, he simply contends that the Lord's body is given, received, and present, and since it pleased the Lord to exhibit Himself here with the bread and wine, it follows that it is also perceived and present in this way, he further contends that the Lord's body is offered and received with, in, and under these symbols. For these prepositions have the same power for him. As the symbols are perceived corporally by hands and mouth and the Lord offers Himself, His one true body with them, it seemed to Luther to express the faith of this exhibition with these modes of speaking: He is bodily there, is given and received into the hands and mouth bodily and fleshly, is by, in, and on the table, cup, because the symbols are present and perceived in this way.</p>
      <p>The reason why he wants to speak in this way, he presents as follows: In the scriptures, when God, angels, and the Holy Spirit exhibited themselves with certain and visible symbols, it is fitting to say: I have seen God bodily, with my eyes, that is, face to face, so also I have heard, etc. Why then should we not say the same in this matter, when the Lord so explicitly says: "Take, eat, this is my body" [Mt 26, 26 par], it is given and received bodily and perceptibly? Indeed, all the fathers spoke in this way, and no one will not say: The king received royal power with the scepter, he received the royal authority into his hands. But lest anyone imagine something absurd from these words in Luther's opinion, he frankly admits that no sensible things reach the Lord's body itself, but these, when they are with the symbols, are attributed to the Lord's body because of the sacramental union and the nature of the words, which are an exhibition of the spiritual thing through sensible things.</p>
      <p>From this, it is clear that what Luther establishes is nothing other than the first: here Christ Himself is truly and solidly brought, received, and present - he leaves this in general and does not descend to a local or any other kind of presence, he commits to God how He wishes to be present -, the second: when the Lord offers Himself with the symbols, those expressions are appropriate here, which scripture and common usage employ in the traditions or commemoration of exhibitions of invisible things through visible signs, namely that we attribute to the Lord's body what is proper to the symbols. Now this latter Zwingli and Oecolampadius never disapproved. For nothing unworthy of this mystery can be thought, it can be sufficiently guarded with an added explanation. The former, since it is nothing but a simple affirmation of presence and of Christ Himself, you cannot be burdened to admit with the accepted opinion of Augustine. Oecolampadius certainly approved it, Zwingli did not reject it, except that he wanted the right to interpret it expressly vindicated for himself. For you, since everything of Augustine is granted, nothing is imposed that is not to be borne by amphiboly. Certainly, you acknowledge that Christ Himself is apprehended here by the contemplation of faith. Now Luther makes nothing but Christ Himself present. And just as those do not fight among themselves, of whom one, seeing a man coming from afar, says: It is an animal, the other: It is a man, so neither do you, when Luther simply says: He is present, is given and received, you: He is present to faith, is given to faith, is received by faith. This your difference does not remove the genus, but explains it.</p>
      <p>But you should also wish to explain his. I also wish to. And he often does, sometimes he does not. Since I know that he does this not out of contention, but out of reverence for the word of God - for he did this before any contention arose on this matter, in the book To the Waldensians -, I think we should forgive this to such a great instrument of Christ. For from this simple and unexplained confession of Christ's presence, nothing absurd follows, nothing impious, and there is nothing in the position of the genus that derogates anything from the species. Therefore, Luther can be borne in his generality and we must strive that he bears our explanation in turn. Philip seems to have obtained this from him. For he expressed that he wants to make peace with us if we think and teach as my booklet To the Münsterites has it. About which you know what you have written, and your confession sent to Blarer agrees with this testimony.</p>
      <p>However, the work of Cattus insists that Philipp and I meet - keep this to yourself alone - which before it happens, so that I may more certainly negotiate with him and about you - for we have already agreed - I would very much like us to meet for just one night somewhere in a dark place, to which you and Leo could come without suspicion of my presence, likewise the Basel Myconius and Karlstadt, then one from Bern, Simon Sulzer. Your churches would be disturbed, and the adversaries would discover the plan if we met openly. Near Schaffhausen, there is a small town in the territory of that republic. We could fly there under the cover of night. It is close to you. You could go to Schaffhausen, and under the cover of night, go there. The pastor there is trustworthy, a man, as I hear, of gravity. Or if it would be less convenient there, indicate another place. For truly I seem to see our Lord Jesus Christ having mercy on us and having heard the prayers of many, so that He may finally put an end to this fury. There is no doubt that you yourselves desire nothing more, as you well recognize how much hindrance has been placed in the way of the evangelical course, how much good conscience has been disturbed. Satan has also not once attempted, now with singular effort he tries to stir up trouble in external churches. To which Christ beautifully responds, and as is His custom, He prepares a way to frustrate him with his own deceit. May He only grant that we do not neglect to enter it.</p>
      <p>Write back, I pray, brother, your opinion on these matters either to Ulm or Augsburg. For I will be in one of these churches this month.</p>
      <p>In Tübingen, on the first of November.</p>
      <p>Your Bucer.</p>
      <p>To his dearest Lord H. Bullinger.</p>
