      <p> Greetings. We also rejoice that Postel has departed from here, whose doctrine certainly tended in some parts manifestly to not only recount but also surpass the delusions of the Valentinians and Gnostics. What could have been more pernicious to the small remnants of the church than such prodigious and pernicious poisons? Among us, indeed, he lacked approval, let alone applause from anyone, and he was diligently and gravely admonished and gave thanks; but shortly thereafter he set out on his journey. May the Lord Jesus grant that, truly educated by His spirit, he may embrace and follow the way of truth, or at least that the simple may be preserved, lest they be led into impious errors, captivated by the appearance of doctrine. For there is enough and indeed too much of evils and scandals in the church. I received immense consolation from your letters about the King of England, and it would certainly be a dreadful sign of divine indignation if such great and unusual hope in this young king is prematurely cut off in its prime, not only for England but for the Christian world; for which reason, the Lord must be prayed to all the more, that He, who can raise the dead, may preserve and protect this instrument for us. </p>
      <p> Furthermore, regarding the Saxon conflict, I heard yesterday that it was not of foot soldiers, but of cavalry, in which Maurice was indeed wounded, but not mortally, nor dead from the wound, as rumor had it; however, the margrave was found among the corpses of the dead, wounded indeed, but still alive, and transferred by the victor to Wolfenbüttel, and 8000 foot soldiers came into surrender, with four thousand men killed on each side; also fallen was Lord von Heideck, a man distinguished by piety, prudence, and greatness of spirit, the chief commander of Maurice's cavalry, for whom it would certainly have been better if several princes had fallen. These things were reported to us as certain. May the Lord mercifully settle this disturbance and grant unity in the Lord to the most divided and afflicted Germany. In France, the fury of the antichristians is kindled as never before; they seem to want to hasten to fulfill the measure of their crimes, so that God's vengeance, kindled by such frequent fires, may blaze upon them all the more quickly. But now, farewell in the Lord, who may deign to heal your headache. Greet all your people. Basel, July 28, 1553. </p>
      <p> Yours, Sulzer. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, fellow minister and brother in the Lord, to be respected. </p>
