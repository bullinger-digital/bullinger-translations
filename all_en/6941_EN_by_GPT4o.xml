      <p>Greetings. At the same time, this young man informs me that he is about to leave for you and, if I wish to write anything, I should give it to him. You know, however, the storms of business with which I am occupied; hence I know that my brevity is sufficiently excused to you. I read what you wrote to me, but I did not understand a good part of it; for I do not know who this Doegius, your adversary, is, nor do I know what cause you have with him, nor have any complaints about you been brought to me. But if they had been brought, I know that the other ear should be open to the accused. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I order you to be secure and I am not accustomed to lend a favorable ear to informers. Then I have recommended your business to certain senators; I myself was about to bring your petition to the consul; but the young man said he would present it to him. Today both the consul and the treasurer, most distinguished men, report to me that your requests have been recited in the senate and the whole matter referred to the lords who are in charge of accounts, except that it has already been decreed that you be given documents of favor, defense, and return, etc. As for the rest, there is no doubt, the matter is in the best place, which perhaps you will understand more correctly from your own people. I wanted to throw these brief notes onto this paper, lest you suspect that your business is not equally recommended to me.</p>
      <p>Live well, farewell, my dear Tobias, and greet all the brothers and fellow ministers. ZÃ¼rich, November 6, in great haste, 1566.</p>
      <p>Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, fellow minister and faithful and beloved brother. Russikon.</p>
