      <p>Greetings. I hear, my dearest Bullinger, that you are preparing a book against Dr. Luther on the matter of the sacraments. If this is true, I am deeply saddened that the old wound is being reopened. Among us, there is no one who embraces that corporeal and gross presence of the body in the supper. Our church is at peace and is very content with the spiritual presence of the body, unaware of any contention. But if that old conflict is revived, I fear you will once again disturb the Swabian churches. Therefore, I implore you by our common Savior to act prudently, considering how dreadful it is in the sight of the Lord to provoke and unsettle souls won for Christ.</p>
      <p>The brothers in the territory of the Landgraves are said to be contemplating a book in favor of polygamy. If this is true, what do you think this will bring with it in terms of evils? Do we seem so tranquil that we may once again consider the matter of carnal indulgence? Oh brothers, I beseech you, consider how full everything is of turmoil, deceit, and fraud!</p>
      <p>The messenger is hastening his departure; I can scarcely write this much. But with the next messenger, I will write more.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am reading your commentary on John, which indeed pleases me greatly; for it breathes a singular gift bestowed upon you by the Lord. May the Lord keep you safe for His church for a long time.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, November 24, 1543. Respond with the present messenger.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, my lord and teacher in Christ, to be especially revered.</p>
