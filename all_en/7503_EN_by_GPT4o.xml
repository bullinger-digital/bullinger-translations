      <p>Greetings from Christ, our Lord and God, our Savior, I sincerely wish to your fatherhood. Letters have been delivered to me, for a long time now, from you (always to be honored with paternal love, most pious man) through an excellent man, our mutual friend, Lord Trecius, in which you most kindly and, as you are accustomed, piously, for the most holy duty of your office and for your always unique love towards me, urge and incite me to promote the glory of the Most High and to defend His most holy name from wicked and impure attacks. Indeed, so that I may act without doubt and admit nothing that might seem to deviate from the rest of my life, I have become much firmer and more constant in the course I have undertaken, thanks to your authority. Therefore, I turn with all my heart to the most merciful God, and I trust in His kindness alone, seeking His help, and although oppressed by sins, I desire to serve Him with a zeal for good will. I am held by the hope that, relying on divine assistance, I may someday satisfy, at least in part, the expectations of the afflicted Church of Christ and the good people regarding me, especially since your unheard-of goodness and piety, and the virtue and religion of your colleagues, most excellent men, have always from my tender years until this day inspired and educated me. I will not be able to stray from following in their footsteps and imitating their virtues to the best of my ability. Therefore, I give thanks to your piety for this kind of paternal admonition, for writing to me so kindly, so lovingly, and so piously, and I promise and offer my efforts to you and all yours, so that, as far as it can be done rightly by me and usefully for you, you will have few equals in love and desire for your favorable affairs.</p>
      <p>Finally, I do not indeed ask you to be of the same mind towards me and my compatriots, especially my own, as you have always been up to now (for I do not fear that you will act otherwise, given your piety); but yet it comes to my mind to wish for it. I pray to God that He may wish to keep you long surviving, safe and sound, for the benefit of His Church. Farewell in Christ, pillar of piety, venerable father. June 20, 1568.</p>
      <p>Yours and always yours, most observant of you, Nikolaus von Kottwitz, written by my hand.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, with piety, learning, and utmost humanity, the chief minister of the word among the Zurichers, a lord no less than a father, venerable and most observant.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus Dluski 1568.</p>
