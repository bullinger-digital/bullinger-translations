  <input>Gratia et pax.

Quantum ex «Propheta» tuo voluptatis, imo quantum fructus coepimus, Heimrice suavissime, silentio pręterire duximus, ne vel in faciem laudare vel palpo percutere videamur. Itaque non laudamus solum, sed miramur potius inventionem tam raram, iudicium tam acre pulcherrimamque dispositionem. Hic vivunt omnia, omnia constant ac quadrant, clara ac perspicua sunt omnia. Quare te oro atque obtestor, ut hunc expolitissimum «Prophetam» non clam privatis quibusdam amicis dumtaxat, sed toti orbi communices. Quandoquidem prophetę videntes Ebreis sunt adpellati, quis vero in tenebris videt? Videntem ergo luci exponas, velim. Nam ut mihi semper displicuerunt quorundam scribentium audacia, qui confusissimis libellulis totum orbem replent, quibusque simplicium christianorum animos sic capiunt, ut eos a scripturis sacris abducant, ita mihi horum non potest non probari labor, qui huc dumtaxat spectant, ut fideles animos ab hominum commentis ad divini spiritus oracula rursus inducant. Cui rei si studuissent hactenus christiani omnes, non essent inter eos tot hypocrises, tot contentiones, hereses, audeo dicere: nunquam in tam diram Antichristi servitutem incidissent. Proinde quum videam «Prophetam» tuum in hoc totum esse, ut populus dei creatoris, redemptoris, salvatoris sui solius verbis hereat, persuasissimum habeo christianę reipublicae ingentem fructum oboriturum, si industria tua revisus ac expolitus ac typis excusus in publicum exeat.

Coelestis pater, qui in te semina vere pietatis iecit, ipse ad messem copiosam fructumque centesimum [Mt 13,23] promoveat, quo tibi ceterisque perpetuo prodesse possis. Vale et benefacere perge.

Ex Tyguro, pridie nonas iulias 1525.

  <output>Grace and peace. We have refrained from mentioning how much delight, indeed how much fruit, we have taken from your "Prophet", Heimric most sweet, lest it appear that we are praising or flattery. Therefore we not only praise but marvel at the rare invention, the penetrating judgement and the beautiful arrangement. Here everything lives, everything is in harmony and clear and perspicuous. Therefore I beg and implore you to share this highly perfected "Prophet" not with just a few private friends but with the whole world. For since the prophets were called seers to the Hebrews, who then sees in darkness? Therefore I wish you to expose him to the light. For as I have always disapproved of the boldness of some writers who fill the whole world with their confused pamphlets, and in such a way as to captivate the minds of the simple Christians and lead them away from the sacred scriptures, so I cannot but approve of the work of those who are only intent on bringing the faithful souls back again to the oracles of the divine spirit from the commentaries of men. Had all the Christians hitherto taken this to heart, there would not have been among them so many hypocrisies, so much contention, heresies; I dare to say that they would never have fallen into such dire servitude to the Antichrist. Hence, seeing that your "Prophet" is solely directed to the people of God to hearken to the words of their Creator, Redeemer and Saviour, I am convinced that a great benefit will accrue to the Christian republic if your work is revised, perfected and printed for public consumption.

May the Heavenly Father, who has sown the seeds of true piety in you, himself bring forth a plentiful harvest and a hundredfold [Matthew 13:23], that you may benefit yourself and others for ever. Farewell and continue to do good.

From Tyger, July 5th, 1525.

Your Leo Jud.

To Heimric Bullinger, most excellent youth and brother in Christ.</output>
