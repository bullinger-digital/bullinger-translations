      <p>That I have not responded earlier to your recent letters to me, I beg you not to take it badly, most illustrious Mr. B[ullinger]. The long delay of Mr. Martyr, who wished to be my messenger, was certainly the cause. His departure from here to you testifies to the highest favor of God towards your church. If only my affairs were so arranged that I could accompany him, certainly not less for the sake of hearing him than for yours! That you arranged for the place of Ignatius to be copied for me through Mr. Gesner, I give you the greatest thanks. The name of this man holds such authority with me that the very paper, which I know by your testimony to have been written by his hand, is placed among my dearest possessions; for I am indeed gladly superstitious in preserving the records of such men. I hear nothing with greater pleasure than what you write, that you will take care that our friendship in Christ, once confirmed, remains enduring; for in this regard, I seem to myself to be entirely transferred to you. What you wrote to me about Mr. Cheke, I wish had not been prophetic! I do not doubt that he will seal his testimony to the gospel with his blood. What will Pharaoh not attempt against Israel, especially one returned from flight? In the name of Mr. Parkhurst, the Englishman, I acknowledge myself most obliged to you and your church. My services, although they are plainly nothing, whatever they may be, are all yours, if I can be of service in any way.</p>
      <p>Please greet on my behalf Mr. Gesner, to whom I would certainly have written, had not modesty overcome boldness; if anything has been done amiss here, I beg you to excuse it. However, I hope that he will soon arrange for Ignatius the Greek to be printed. May God, the best and greatest, preserve you both unharmed for a long time for His church.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, John Ponet of Winchester.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, a most dear brother.</p>
