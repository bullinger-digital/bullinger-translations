      <p>Do you, Bullinger, strive with me to be received into my friendship, which I ought to offer, not wait until it is requested? But what is praiseworthy in you, I think is blameworthy in me: for those who seek true friendships are like good farmers; those who receive, like good soil. However, since I am outpaced by you and slower in cultivating friendships, I have the worse part: for as much as a farmer is better than the soil, so much am I surpassed by you. To give a benefit is a virtue, to repay is a duty; and it is far more blessed to give a benefit than to receive, indeed more than to be grateful or mindful or a compensator. However, since your teaching, your zeal for true religion, and your books published into the light are known to all, and my love, long conceived, had not yet burst forth; consider with yourself, I pray, even if my zeal towards you was unknown to you, that I have long been devoted to you.</p>
      <p>The books you wrote to the royal majesty were as pleasing to him as they ought to have been. I delivered a good part of them to him, and I can explain how kindly and humanely he received them, and in what regard he holds them, and judge you fortunate in this part. But since the royal majesty, broken by a long illness, has scarcely yet fully recovered, I can hardly promise you anything about obtaining letters from him to you, but I can assure you that he is of the mind towards you that you would especially wish. If a longer life should be granted to him, as I hope he will enjoy the use of this light for a very long time, I indeed predict, with the Lord leading the way, that he will be such a prince that he will yield neither to Josiah in vindicating religion, nor to Solomon in establishing affairs, nor to David in cultivating piety. And if nature or grace can do anything, indeed if God, the author of these things, whose providence is not contained even within the bounds of the immense world, it is likely that he will not only bring the greatest aids to the preservation of the church but also illuminate learned men with all honors. He has long since raised the sign of these things, who has done more and greater things in this age than others could in a constant and confirmed age: he abolished the law of six articles: he expelled images from the temples: he overthrew idolatry: he exterminated the mass, and destroyed almost all kinds of superstition. He established the best form of common prayers: he promulgated good and pious homilies to diminish the ignorance of unskilled ministers. He summoned the most learned men to teach at the academies, and many other things of the same kind, each of which would be great in others, but in him, they are nothing, considering the magnitude of the things to be done. Recently, he also recommended the catechism of the Bishop of Winchester to the schools by his authority, and promulgated the articles of the Synod of London, which if you compare with those of Trent, you will understand what the spirit excels the spirit. What more? I send you a booklet, a token of my love towards you; and consider me to be yours in Christ. Farewell excellently. Greenwich, June 7, 1553. 7 Ed. 6.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, John Cheke.</p>
      <p>Greet, I pray, Mr. Rodolph Gwalther and Mr. Conrad Gesner, to whom I will write shortly.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
      <p>The last letters of Sir John Cheke, knight, tutor of the King of England, shortly before the king's death and imprisonment.</p>
