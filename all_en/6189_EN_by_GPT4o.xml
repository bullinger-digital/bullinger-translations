      <p>Joy and peace through Christ.</p>
      <p>We have been sitting here until now, my lord Bullinger and reverend father, in great expectation of the colloquy held in the Duchy of Württemberg, wondering what it would finally produce or what was accomplished in it.</p>
      <p>And while we were thus waiting, behold, by chance I am called to Erdbach. I therefore planned my journey through Heidelberg, where I encountered some men, both pious and learned, with whom I discussed this matter.</p>
      <p>And although I do not doubt that everything has been most diligently written to you, nevertheless, what was accomplished in that colloquy, the main points will be communicated to you by our lord, the elder Erbius. May Almighty God ensure that His glory is vindicated among all.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name all the best lords and brothers known to me, and take care that you may be well and strong, so that you can review Brentius's book of recognition.</p>
      <p>Given hastily at Rapperswil, July 7, in the year 1564. Your most obedient Thomas Schöpf, doctor of medicine, physician of Colmar.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy herald of the divine word of the renowned city of Zürich, his lord and brother, to be greatly respected.</p>
