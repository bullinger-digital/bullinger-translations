    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for [No. 1150]; previously, he was not even deemed worthy of a greeting. He is ready to welcome [Gwalther], but warns of the plague, from which some students are already fleeing. He wanted to translate and print one of the booklets from Wittenberg, but the messenger [Niklaus Appenzeller] demanded it back too soon. He is urgently awaiting Bullinger's opinion on Luther's response. He does not want to judge his book [“De scripturae sanctae authoritate”], but is pleased to own it. He is unclear about the consequences of the Peace [of Nice] for the council; Emperor [Charles V] is said to have proposed Constance, Basel, and Geneva as council locations. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Your letters were most welcome to me, if only for this reason, so that it is not always asked, when someone inquires about you, why no one from Zürich even sends me greetings. It pains my heart, which is hard to bear, from which I have never derived any benefit. May the Lord be with us.</p>
      <p>Regarding the young man, it is not that I refuse anything, but I do not know how safe it is to be in Basel at this time, especially for someone of that age; for the plague is beginning to show itself, for which reason I would prefer even to be without those whom I have with me. Some nobles and other students are fleeing; it will hardly be pleasant for those who are outside to visit us. However, do as you see fit; as far as I am concerned, it will be allowed. I have not discussed this matter with Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>I had received one of the booklets, which the messenger brought from Wittenberg, on loan until I had read it to the end. I liked it so much that I had it translated into Latin, so that it might be printed here more willingly, and thus become known and useful to many. The messenger interrupted the translation and demanded the booklet back so rudely that I returned it, after I had begged him to take yours and send it to St. Gallen; for I would soon send the one I had here to you, not without interest. But he used such words that it seemed better to be without it. The coarse and inept man does not wish to bear from me what his father bore. I complain about this to you, nothing else.</p>
      <p>It is indeed strange that you write nothing about Luther's response; for it may be that it does not come to us from the council until we have requested it. When this will happen, I do not know; for we are not inclined to ask, especially since it should be done voluntarily, what is received by asking. I would have preferred your judgment on his response rather than the whole letter here.</p>
      <p>It is in vain that you advise me about judging your book. How could I judge others, who scarcely understand myself? It pleases me and is welcome, and I rejoice to find it among my books.</p>
      <p>What do you think the peace between the Emperor and the French, concluded by the Pope, will bring? The Pope cannot bear a free council; the Emperor is devoted to him, although it is said that he is diligently striving to have the council transferred to Germany. They say he has named Constance, Basel, and Geneva; but I do not know what the Pope thinks. If the Lord grants true harmony of minds, there is no reason for anyone to be feared by us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours. I wish Theodore and Pellicanus good health. Basel, July 29, 1538.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most worthy Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, my lord and brother in Christ, to be revered.</p>
