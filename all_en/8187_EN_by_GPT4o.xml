      <p>God with us. Beloved son, the unrest in Lucerne has been settled for now, and my lords are back home. The four cantons have separated: Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug. The old mercenaries from France, they say, are all (at least those who are left) coming home. The departure of the 6000 will soon begin; there is neither good weather nor any other fortune or blessing. May it happen to them according to God's judgment. I thank you for the 2 partridges and 2 sausages. Here I send you the thick penny for the 2 partridges. If you are happy that I pay you, then give the thick penny to Susana.</p>
      <p>Greet her, Lysinli, and your household for me. I have not heard anything from Glarus yet. All my people greet you. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Sunday - eat herring - Oculi Mei 1570.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>Greet young master Hans and his household for me. To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
