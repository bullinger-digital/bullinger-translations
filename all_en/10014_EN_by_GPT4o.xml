    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to the letters from Bullinger and Enzlin, Stiltz rejects their reformist standpoint and attempts to refute individual points: justification by faith alone, the rejection of the Mass, and the unfavorable assessment of Erasmus's work "On Free Will." He accuses the reformers of discord and contentiousness, and primarily opposes Zwingli's symbolic interpretation of the Lord's Supper.</p>

      <p>Christoph Stiltz to his presbyter Johannes Enzlin, greetings in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
      <p>I received and read your letters along with others written by another hand. In them, I indeed sense and embrace your spirit towards me, but I do not entirely approve of your approach, either because you and those like you attribute too much to yourselves, or because you disdain others as if they were mere shadows compared to you; those, I mean, who refuse to consume the dish you have prepared. You utterly despise Master Johannes Hagnover of Zurich, which neither Paul nor indeed your Christ taught. But what then? Surely, we should make those who are evil or do not know Christ better through humility, tolerance, familiarity, and (not to mention everything) Christian gentleness and example, and express Jesus, our avenger, in ways worthy of him, not just in words. You write much about the word of God, as if you and those like you have received such grace from God the Father that even Saint Jerome, Augustine, and others of that kind, both learned and pious, are nothing compared to you. From where, I ask you, does this superstition come? Should I not believe Jerome, and believe you instead? He expressed Christ even in deeds and confirmed his teaching, but you do not perform deeds worthy of Christ, but rather propose faith (I know not what kind) even without works. But listen, my son, not to me, but to Christ speaking in the gospel: "By their fruits you will know them" (Matthew 7:16), and again: "Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). Do you not know that if we trust in God, good works will follow of their own accord? - which indeed do not come from us, but from God the Father through Jesus Christ. But why do I speak of such things, being distracted by six hundred affairs!</p>
      <p>You complain about me not writing; but I complain and protest that you have not replied. However, there is nothing I wrote to Johannes Hagnover except that your approach displeases me; not, I say, because you took a wife, which indeed Christ did not forbid, but because you speak as if you cling to her and abandon Christ. How, you ask? Surely, how have you fallen into such madness that you do not sacrifice with others, that is, read or chant the Mass, as it is called. Alas, you are already prepared with full lungs and almost rise against me, I know; but listen through Christ Jesus, my son. We do not offer or sacrifice Christ in the Mass, who was offered once for our sins, but our prayers, which are poured out to the Father outside of consecration, even according to Luther himself; read him on the sacrament of the altar. But if Luther is not sufficient (which has nevertheless become widespread among us), behold, I now challenge you with your own sword, there is nothing you can use as a pretext, except your faith, I know not what, not unlike a certain tanner from Rütlingen, who, disputing about faith with peasants over drinks in Tagerscheim, as it happens, asserted in my presence and others that there is no hell and that hell cannot be proven from scripture, and when I asserted from scripture, he fell into such perversity that he even denied the kingdom of heaven. See, my son, how easily we believe and depart from the truth. It is true what I report, even with 20 or more witnesses to prove it.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, certain rumors arise among us that Luther, Pomeranus, Zwingli, Matthäus Alber of Rütlingen, and perhaps some others are fighting among themselves with even the worst insults. Luther asserts the Mass, the others despise it, he admits even auricular confession, they disdain it. Whom should I believe? Where is that easy scripture, which even idiots should understand, that those most learned men do not understand or certainly do not agree? But what have they achieved with their rash writings? Have they not promoted the ruin of more than 10,000 men? How many widows, how many orphans have they made? O good Jesus, help human weakness! Yet I do not attribute that fault to them, but for the most part to those who misunderstand. In summary, however, this one thing displeases me above all in all Lutherans, that they provoke individuals with insults; as if they have undertaken a contest in this one thing.</p>
      <p>But what am I doing? You yourself compelled me to write such things with your elegant and sufficiently pious letter, which some learned man wrote in your name, to whom I ask you to convey my greetings in Christ, and encourage him to exercise that style of his for the glory of Christ, not of men. He wrote familiarly, but in this one thing he seems somewhat harsh, that he attributes to me that I attribute the spirit to Saint Jerome or the "fathers" in such a way that I leave almost nothing for the men of our most deplorable age. My opinion is not so, indeed I attribute nothing to any man unless he proves it from scripture. But I prefer Jerome and Augustine and the other fathers, who confirmed their writings with examples and lives worthy of a Christian man, to those who assert faith even without good works, as if it suffices for a Christian man to have believed without consequent works. But Christ did not teach this, as was evident above. Furthermore, what he writes, that you will not sing a recantation because of this, nor will I sing a recantation because of you, unless you prove your things with scriptures, but I do not think you assert everything.</p>
      <p>And these indeed about our Erasmus, whose little work "On Free Will" he astonishingly despises, yet not with such strength as to persuade me to either blame or despise Erasmus. He asserts this book to be "not only impious but blasphemous," but does not add a reason; this is, that he attributes more to himself than to Erasmus. But I attribute nothing impudently to anyone, I attribute everything to Christ. However, our Erasmus has not yet sung a recantation with those embellished words, although he says he cares more about number than energy, that is, effectiveness. But if he proved something with this word: "When indeed some Gordian knot presents itself, good God, how miserably the poor little Erasmus twists himself" - now my Erasmus is plainly convicted. He indeed promises scriptures, but produces none, as if he should be believed even without scripture. I do not defend Erasmus, whom I do not know as a man, nor do I blame him, which I cannot accomplish. Furthermore, I leave the question of free will to those who have prepared the dish, and there is nothing at all that I do not consider good, than if you attack with insults those who have deserved well of us. But if he so despises Erasmus in theology, why does he not also despise others, who introduce new rites in the most arduous matter even without scriptures? Like your Zwingli, whose little book or letter on the Eucharist I had the chance to see, and by chance I fell into a place where he discusses the crux of the matter and brings up two, I think, places where "is" is used for "signifies," and immediately infers "is" in this proposition "This is my body" (Matthew 26:26; 1 Corinthians 11:24) is used for "signifies." But by the same reasoning it would follow that "is" in this sentence "Johannes Enzlin is a black man" would also be used for "signifies" and the sense would be: "Johannes Enzlin means a black man." From this it would follow that you are not black, and yet you are black, unless you have put on a new skin along with a new faith. By similar reasoning, six thousand propositions would follow, and in summary it would follow that "is" does not mean "is" and now there would be no word to express the affection of the mind, unless you prefer "exists" or "would be." And, to play the sophist for a moment, from singulars does not follow the universal. But if the sacrament only signifies the body of Christ, why would it not also follow that any bread signifies the body of Christ, if taken in the name of Jesus, when neither is the body of Christ.</p>
      <p>This fervor drives me to irreverence of the sacrament, yet the affairs by which I am distracted in different directions do not allow me to pursue what I have begun, nor is there anything now that I can use as a pretext, than Christ Jesus in the gospel and Paul writing to the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 11:23 ff. But if they do not accept, let them allow me to believe in my own way, and let them believe in their own way.</p>
      <p>Farewell and reconsider.</p>
      <p>From the little town of Ferimont, the last of January in the year of the virgin birth 1526.</p>
