      <p>I send to your charity, my brother, this very old coin of Vespasian, recently found in the fields of Lenzburg, which I bought from a certain rustic man for a small price, but it is very pleasing to me due to its antiquity. Please accept this old coin as a token of our old friendship, I beseech you; now I send only this, as much as I can be to you.</p>
      <p>If your purse desires such a coin, I desire nothing more than for it to be adorned with this one very old coin; if not, you can return it. Farewell, most excellent patron. Greet the little mother for me, etc. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given at Lenzburg on the 19th of October in the year 1550. With my wife returning to me, respond at least with one word.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gervasius.</p>
      <p>Love must have quarrels.</p>
      <p>To my dearest Bullinger in the Lord.</p>
