      <p>I and all of mine wish you and all of yours all happiness and good fortune in our one and only solid salvation, Christ Jesus, for the joyful beginnings of this new year, with all our hearts, my esteemed and always dearly beloved Bullinger. Conrad, who is surnamed Freno, recently returning from there to here, affirmed that you are very surprised that I do not write to you; but for some time now, it has been certain to me that, when I have nothing worthy of your reading, I should not trouble you with idle letters, otherwise already more fatigued.</p>
      <p>Augusta now rarely brings me anything new, namely about the deceased Mr. Welser, our mutual friend, and then about Johann Zangmeister, who has been bedridden for several months, a most holy and certainly very friendly man to me; although I have many there who are very favorable to me, most of them are such that they either do not care about the news that is brought there or are certainly reluctant to write. However, what is written to me from elsewhere, I know, reaches you sooner through the diligence of friends. Therefore, my more than venerable and most desired Bullinger, do not interpret this cessation of mine as negligence or a colder spirit in loving you than it once was, since my zeal and love for you now, which I solemnly confirm to you, burns more than ever before, but rather I would like you to accept it as me fearing that what I have written without cause of necessity or utility might be a detriment to the entire Christian world, while you spend some time reading my writings, which otherwise you would much better spend in aiding the public cause of the church, so exceedingly afflicted.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I value your great zeal and indefatigable effort so much that with the perpetual prayers of my faith, since I cannot promote it otherwise, as much as the spirit of Christ grants, I would rather hinder it even a little with my foolishness, and this more willingly because the sweet and most beneficial fruit of your labors, by which I am always so cheered and refreshed, returns to me by your usual gratuitous kindness, by which your singular and constant generosity towards me has long held me so bound to you that I utterly despair of ever being able to respond even in part to those accumulated and innumerable benefits of yours, but I will always substitute our Christ here in my place, so that he may abundantly pour out and bless you from the inexhaustible fountain of heavenly goods, which he contains in himself. Your catechism, which you recently gave, brief indeed for the length of the subject, but nevertheless clear, learned, and full, I have embraced and kissed most closely, as I am accustomed to do with all your works, having prayed with as many sighs of vows as I could for the spirit of the Lord, that he may so imbue you entirely, so add strength to your body, so add cheerfulness to your spirits, that, as you have hitherto done with such happiness and to such progress of the church of Christ, you may do so vigorously with him as the author, for as long as you complete your course, about to receive the crown of righteousness long since laid up for you from him, who is the just judge, in whom fare well, my soul, and diligently commend me to the patronage of your pious prayers. To your household, with the most esteemed men Mr. Peter Martyr, Gwalther, Theodor, Wolf, Frisius, and your other colleagues, may you wish in my name the longest courses of life, happily flowing with the concurrence of all heavenly and earthly goods, as lovingly as possible, and may you exhort them to assist my old age with their sacred prayers, so that it may more and more rejuvenate towards the blessedness of eternal life, I both ask you as a friend and earnestly beseech you. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Winterthur, January 8, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his both venerable and dearly beloved brother.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
