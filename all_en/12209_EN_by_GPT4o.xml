    <p xml:id="regest1">Since thom Camph has a messenger [Hans Rudolf Lavater] at his disposal, he takes the opportunity to send news about himself. In [Baden], there are, among others, people from Zurich and Swabia, including Lutherans, Zwinglians, and Papists. The friendly-minded people from Constance [...] have already departed. Subsequently, a bailiff from Uri [Martin Im Hof or Jakob a Pro?] arrived, whom he now also misses. Both he and thom Camph tried in vain to convert each other. Each was eager to do good to the other. - He often converses with the people in Baden about the Holy Scripture. On Ascension Day [May 14], they talked about sin and Paul's statement that neither adulterers nor drunkards nor the greedy would inherit the Kingdom of God. A Lutheran [...] from Kempten remarked that false teachers would also be lost, which thom Camph confirmed, only to soon realize that he was the one being referred to. Thom Camph replied that he only converses with those who like to talk about the Word of God and that he only seeks the good for his neighbor in doing so. However, the jealous Lutheran assured that he would rather be an adulterer and fornicator than a Zwinglian, while thom Camph responded that he was neither a Lutheran nor a Zwinglian, but a Christian. - He was also able to persuade a learned preacher and pastor from Freiburg [i. Br.] [Christoph Wertwein] and a young Cistercian prior from Bavaria [the Premonstratensian Joachim Widman] to visit Zurich on Saturday [May 16]. The people of Zurich should especially take care of both, as both are not far from the Kingdom of God and profess justification by faith. Through both, Christ could enrich many. - Thom Camph bathes daily for seven to eight hours. - Since Pellikan may be absent, he also addresses the letter to Bullinger. Greetings to his wife [Elisabeth, née Kalb] and son [Samuel]. May Pellikan forgive the mistakes in thom Camph's letter due to his cold. He had to write very early in the morning and hurry to be able to give the letter to the mayor [Lavater]. - [Konrad] Gessner should inform whether the thermal water should also be drunk. - [P.S.:] Perhaps Pellikan did not know that Bullinger sent thom Camph a silver coin of [Emperor] Trajan. - [Under the address and in Pellikan's hand:] Bullinger should see how this zealous bee of the Lord even gathers honey from the flowers growing in the abominable field of Tophet!</p>

      <p>Greetings, which are in the Lord Jesus, to all of you as true brothers, I wish and pray from God our Father of all mercy and consolation and His only Son, our Lord and brother.</p>
      <p>I cannot, my father, regardless of my circumstances, refrain from writing to you and through you to all of you (since the opportunity of a messenger is given) about the condition of my affairs. Know, therefore, that I am using the same baths with various kinds of people, with the people of Zürich, Swabians, etc., and - why do I name them? - with Lutherans, Zwinglians, and Papists, monks and prelates, as they call them, and now, those who were the best of friends, the people from Constance have departed, and in their place, a prelate from Uri has been received, whom we also did not leave untested. I recognize him as a good and learned man, but not very skilled in the scriptures, as far as the judgment of the spirit is concerned, yet not all papist things please him.</p>
      <p>He, with a good spirit, I have known to deal with me, and again I with him in the same spirit. Finally, he said with regret that he had never dealt with any of the Lutherans whom he could convert, so he was not surprised if he achieved nothing with me. In short, he wished me well, and I wished the same for him.</p>
      <p>So much for him.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, when I often converse with those bathing about the word of the Lord and on the very day of the Ascension of Christ, I had spoken about certain things concerning the ascension of the Lord, and we had finally come to converse about the sins of the saints and against conscience, and I had brought forward this sentence of Paul, neither fornicators nor adulterers nor drunkards and the greedy, etc., will inherit the kingdom of God, then a certain man from Kempten, very devoted to Luther, responded not only these but especially those who teach falsehoods and seduce people. With me agreeing, he added, whether I did not think that this applied to me, because I acted as a preacher and seduced people. I replied that I was neither a preacher nor seducing people. He, on the other hand, said: Why do you preach daily in the baths? Then I said that I speak with no one about the word of the Lord except those who seek it, and that it is commanded to everyone about his neighbor, and I believe that is why I speak. In short, I recognized that he could not bear to obtain among the bathers what he desired, namely, since there was no one who would counter him in disputation, so that the truth would seem inferior, and he could attract others to his opinion in this way. And I see that I was sent by the Lord at the right time, because no one from Zürich is present who either wants or can openly defend the cause of truth, as I see it. The disputation was concluded with me certainly resisting and not agreeing, that he would rather be an adulterer and fornicator than of my faith, that is, a Zwinglian. I replied that I was neither a Zwinglian nor a Lutheran, but a Christian, and I trust in Christ in this matter. I ask, please, the Lord, that He does not disdain to have mercy on these, but gives them a better mind and confirms us in His truth, so that we do not deviate from the way of truth due to the perverse zeal of these men, and grants us His spirit, so that we may speak the word of the Lord as it ought to be spoken, and in the sight of all men, and adds this grace, that the word of God and truth may not be spoken ill of because of us, and may He deliver us from all error.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>The other two, the one from Freiburg and the prior monk, I have brought to the point that they say nothing of their trifles and wish to come to see you and converse with you, I believe on the next Saturday. I would like you all, for your humanity, not only to receive them with hospitality, but also for your piety to feed and satisfy their souls with the sumptuous dishes of the divine word; for they need it for themselves and others. For although they are not far from the kingdom of God and do not approve of all things of the Antichrist, and in the main article of faith about justification they agree with us, yet I do not know whether out of superstition or for the sake of convenience - which I believe they have not a small amount from there - they defend the masses and oppose our true opinion about the sacraments and think that we have no less errors in doctrine than the Papists. I would like you to bring them by your authority, doctrine, and piety to the point that either, having renounced impiety, they fully approach the truth or do not seem to oppose it. The one from Freiburg knows no one else besides you, whose commentaries he diligently reads. The monk, since he is young and from Bavaria, has heard nothing of you except that you are the worst heretics. I say, bring them to the point that they recognize that they and others have erred and regard you as brothers; which I do not doubt you can do by the grace of God, if you strive. However, how much fruit you will make for God and the church from this will easily appear from this, that the one from Freiburg is a pastor in Freiburg, I do not know in which church, then a public lecturer, learned and of great authority, the monk indeed a prior in a certain Cistercian monastery. These, having returned home, could win many for Christ. Therefore, in the name of Christ and the church, make sure that your humanity, piety, and learning abound towards these.</p>
      <p>But what need is there to add spurs to a running horse? As for me, I am well and bathe diligently every day for 7 or 8 hours. May the Lord grant that both body and soul may be better and preserve me from all evil. Amen.</p>
      <p>Since I sensed that you are already on the journey, I addressed this letter to my Bullinger, always to be respected as a brother and friend, in your absence. Farewell, you with your wife, son, and finally the whole family, whom I would like you to greet most diligently in my name along with the always to be respected teachers. Farewell again and again in the Lord. I composed this very early in the morning with the journey urging and my chest laboring; therefore, forgive the errors, father.</p>
      <p>Whether I should drink the water of the baths, please consult Gessner again, and what else he thinks I should do.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, farewell in Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>From the Swiss Baths of Baden the day after the Ascension of the Lord 1545.</p>
      <p>Gerhard zum Camph, your always most obedient son.</p>
      <p>It is not necessary to write that Mr. Heinrich Bullinger sent me a most welcome gift, a silver coin of the divine Trajan; however, since I doubt whether it is hidden from you, I could not omit it.</p>
      <p>To the singularly learned and pious Mr. Konrad Pellikan, professor of the sacred language of the Zürich church, most learned and faithful, his father and always to be respected host.</p>
      <p>If he is absent, let it be delivered to Heinrich Bullinger, my always dearest and most respected friend and brother.</p>
      <p>I pray, my compadre Bullinger, read this letter too and see the zealous little bee gathering honey of divine diligence even from the sordid little flowers in the field of Tophet and serving Christ everywhere, whom he loves and desires to be worshiped by all. Sometime you will return this letter.</p>
