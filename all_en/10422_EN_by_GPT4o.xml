    <p xml:id="regest1">He will do his utmost to ensure that the reformed regions negotiate an agreement with Duke Ulrich of Württemberg; such an agreement has indeed been proposed by the Duke for the first time. The Small Council of Zurich assured the Duke of the friendly feelings of the people of Zurich, but informed him that the Great Council was responsible for such an agreement; this matter will be addressed soon. The meeting then took place on May 30: Many were moved by the Duke's offer; a commission under Mayor Diethelm Röist is currently deliberating on the response. Bullinger will report on this soon. The Zurich Council is displeased that it has not been officially asked by Basel for Karlstadt's leave of absence and therefore does not want to release him; his salary was increased. Guillaume du Bellay, the French envoy, narrowly escaped to Lindau from Eck of Reischach. Greetings to Mayor Jakob Meyer.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>For those at whose command you wrote, I respond in German words as follows.</p>
      <p>As far as it depends on me, I will strive to ensure that, with the common counsel of the Christian cities, negotiations are conducted in peace and understanding with the Duke of Württemberg. He has never before, as far as I am aware, made such a proposal through any letter or in any reasonable manner as he has now. Lenigni's command was something else. However, as the Duke has now written and requested a response, on May 26, my lords from the Small Council have most amicably replied to him, praising God, who has brought him back to his own through the help of Christian pious princes, etc. But as he desires an understanding with them, as his predecessors, the Counts of Württemberg, had with the city of Zurich, he should not expect anything from Zurich other than love and good friendship, who will do everything for him that is dear and serviceable, etc. However, a special alliance, as he desires, is not appropriate for them to answer or negotiate without the Great Council; they will, however, let this matter be brought forward and respond to him amicably. I have not seen the copy, but I report this from the mouth of a man of no low rank.</p>
      <p>On May 30, it came before the council and citizens, and when it was read, it was accepted with such gratitude that some wept, all praised God that it was still so with them, that their prince desired their friendship. And they have appointed how and what they will decide against the prince: Mayor Diethelm Röist, Master Felix Wyngarter, Master Niklaus Setzstab, Jacob Funck; they are to bring their proposal back to the council and citizens. What is further negotiated and made known to me, I will report, how and what happens. Now, as I write this, 12 PM on June 4, they are together in the house of Röist.</p>
      <p>I suspect, my lords of the council have taken it with displeasure (I speak only out of suspicion), that an honorable council of Basel did not write to them, but only to us alone. Therefore, they did not want to allow Karlstadt, but improved his salary with 10 measures of wine and 10 bushels of grain. Previously, he had 80 guilders alone, now they have added the 20 pieces to the 80, making it 100. However, I will write separately about this.</p>
      <p>Guillaume du Bellay, the French envoy, hurried here from Munich and almost got caught in Eck of Reischach; however, he escaped to Lindau. Now he has blocked the lake and all roads, so that he could not get out and is concerned that he will be handed over, etc.</p>
      <p>If you have any further news from Württemberg and France, write soon.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 4, 1534.</p>
      <p>I wish safety to the consul, father of the fatherland.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most faithful doctor of the church of Basel, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
