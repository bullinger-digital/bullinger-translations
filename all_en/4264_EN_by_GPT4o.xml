      <p>S. D. If I have rendered any service, most reverend and distinguished man in both learning and piety, to your son, I confess it is much less than what I owe you. His character seemed to me not unpleasant and his mind open; when admonished or reproved by me, he bore it with equanimity, for which reason I loved him as a son. I lent a hand to assist his literary studies as a physician would, considering his age and the intended goal; for I discovered by more than one indication that he had been neglected before he moved here. I wanted, therefore, at some point to receive into my house a certain pious and learned man of French nationality, with whom he could become accustomed to speaking Latin continuously (for he would not have been allowed to use any other language), but somehow I was unable to bring my plan to fruition. Nevertheless, I am very glad that you consider favorably the little that I have done.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I again offer my services and all my duty to you, ready to gratify you in every way in the future. The money sent, fifty-three gold coins (each valued at 15 batz.) and 5 batz., Mr. Froschauer gladly paid me in your name as soon as I came to Frankfurt; thus, I want it to be testified by this letter as a promissory note that no more money is owed to me on account of your son. I also received from the same Mr. Froschauer seventeen gold coins to be distributed to some creditors you named, which I promise to do in good faith when I have returned home. Peter von Stäf had your letters before I set foot out of the house to depart for Frankfurt, and he promised to wait until the autumn fair.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Mr. Froschauer handed me two large cheeses, one for Peter Stäf, the other given to me, and also a copy of your excellent work against the Anabaptists, composed this winter. But how shall I repay the favor for such great benefits from you, or what shall I send in return? I have said before and am compelled to repeat now that our little field is barren and cannot produce such fruits as the broad, rich, and fertile soil of Mr. Bullinger yields.</p>
      <p>An additional copy has been added, which I will ensure is neatly bound so that it may soon reach the hands of the most illustrious prince along with your letters, and if the opportunity arises, I will personally deliver it as you wish. I will also ensure that Mr. Dryander receives the third copy with an attached letter to him. I have nothing to add at present, except that I wish all happiness to you and your entire family, for what is said in widespread rumors and is not yet certain, what is the point of mentioning? I wish to convey my greetings to Mr. Peter Martyr in my name, for whom, as for you, I pray to God the heavenly Father to grant a long life for the benefit of the churches; for there is no one who does not know how greatly all the churches are helped by your most holy labors. Farewell with your most honorable and pious wife and the whole family, to whom my wife also wishes all happiness. Given in Frankfurt on the 11th day of April, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Andreas Hyperius.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and as much pious as learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zürich, a lord to be honored with the highest respect.</p>
