      <p>Greetings. I cannot refrain from informing you whenever something new happens. The Duke of Florence has made incursions into the Sienese territory and threatens to besiege the city. The Emperor cannot allow it to remain free. It is said that the Pope will not lean to either side, which is hard to believe.</p>
      <p>Soldiers are being recruited in Upper Germany; the princes are wasting time in consultations. How pleasing they are to the Emperor, who considers the delay to be his gain! Our people are preparing for war with great zeal. Those things are to be feared which people see less clearly, but you and those like you see them well enough. Farewell. Chur, on the fifth of February.</p>
      <p>Your Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zurich, dearest friend.</p>
      <p>In Zurich. To Zurich.</p>
