      <p>Returning from Franconia on the first of March, I found your letter, my most desired relative, at home, and having read it, I rejoiced to observe that you are well in the Lord. Your advice regarding that vocation not accepted is wonderfully approved by me: about which I will discuss at length with you when it pleases the Lord that we may converse.</p>
      <p>Although I wished it could happen now, I fear it may not be possible due to the upcoming Easter festival: from which you do not seem able to be absent from your church. Nor would you want to, even if you could, as your services are needed at this time. Therefore, at the next fair, or during the summer, either you will come to us, or we will come to you. For I think my mother-in-law will soon be present: she was in December with her son in Venice, and with the weather becoming milder, she was contemplating her departure. I suppose she will be brought to us by our relative with the merchants going to the fair.</p>
      <p>We will learn something certain about Lavinia's childbirth from the booksellers passing through here, I hope. I pray to the most good and great God with all my heart, that it may be most fortunate for her and the offspring: pleasing to God: and delightful to you. Amen.</p>
      <p>You are too anxiously concerned about our affairs. Nor is there any reason to believe whatever anyone says: especially from more liberal and not sufficiently prudent men. For all of us, it will be as God wills. Before anyone here drives me away unwillingly, there will be a need for skill and arts. Impudence alone, in which my adversaries are most distinguished, will perhaps suffice less. But these things are placed in the will and counsel of God, to whom I have long since entrusted myself and all my affairs entirely. May He grant that, instructed by His spirit, we may do all things piously: as we have hitherto desired with His certain support.</p>
      <p>I wrote to Lord Isaak, and recommended to him a certain Polish baron bringing our matters to you: but I have not yet received any response. His teacher delivered the last part of the second volume of our disputations against Paracelsus.</p>
      <p>It will sting many, especially the Chemists whose foolish attempts I have diligently exposed. If I live, I will sometime continue this same thread with more.</p>
      <p>In my absence, my wife suffered somewhat from intestinal and stomach pains, but she was somewhat better upon my arrival.</p>
      <p>In the third part of the Antiparacelsus, you will see in the manuscripts of these, not a man, but the impiety and stupidity of monsters and beasts alike.</p>
      <p>Unless the opportunity were given to more often explain more clearly useful matters treated by many rather poorly, I would have long since abandoned the work. May the most good and great God keep you safe with your dearest mother and most excellent woman, your wife, and brothers. Amen. On the first day of March in the year 72.</p>
      <p>Yours in heart, mind, and body. Thomas Erastus To the most excellent man, adorned with outstanding doctrine and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his most revered lord like a father.</p>
