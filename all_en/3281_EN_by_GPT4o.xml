      <p>Greetings. I sent you the main points of Menno's doctrine against the incarnation of our Lord Christ this summer, which we hope have been faithfully delivered to you. I eagerly await some response from you to these.</p>
      <p>I have not yet had the time to address a response against Menno; indeed, I have been compelled to contemplate an apology against the slanders and lies of Westphal, with which he has once again burdened us and our church. I do not think it escapes your notice that this summer a confession of the Saxon churches on the matter of the Eucharist has come to light, in which many and various letters are inserted, among which some are almost inserted at the end against us Nordens. Therefore, the counsel of all the brothers was that we should publicly clear ourselves from such slanders. Thus, throughout this summer, whenever there was leisure, I labored in writing an apology, to which I added a treatise on the matter of the Eucharist, in which I refuted the argument of the adversaries in order according to my modest ability. However, many now dissuade its publication, lest we seem to disturb or impede the peace, which seems to have begun at the previous council in Frankfurt, with our writing.</p>
      <p>Thus, I am here suspended in doubt, as to what should be done with counsel, whether we ought to publish or suppress our response. Furthermore, our church is now in a good and tranquil place, just as we hope yours is by the grace of God, who preserves you all for the glory of His name. Amen. Hastily, Norden, August 23, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Martin Micronius. To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, to be revered as lord and patron in Christ, the most faithful minister of the word among the people of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
