      <p>The news coming from France is so atrocious that most, and almost all, of our countrymen not only refuse to serve in the French king's army, but are also very ready to withdraw from the alliance made with him.</p>
      <p>My fellow countrymen from the Pre-Gallia region are amplifying the atrocity and indignity of the deed in a remarkable way, and they are now supported by the people of Engadin. Only some from the Upper League (as they say), neighbors to your cantons, speak of nothing but massacres in their daily conversations. The authorities will restrain them and will not let it go unpunished if they lead soldiers from our territories against the decree of our republic. The ambassador can no longer excuse the king nor will he support those who, against our edicts (as he did before), wish to go to France to destroy the remnants of the Christians. The people of Orl√©ans, leeches of Christian blood and reminiscent of their founder Aurelian's nature, have savagely attacked the Christians, as I believe you have heard from someone who came here to the ambassador and who greatly praises your humanity and generosity and asked me to greet you in his name. The ambassador's mother-in-law (as you also wrote to me) along with two sons and two daughters of outstanding beauty were slaughtered; her corpse was treated with cruelty, with a hook driven into it as if in the Roman manner.</p>
      <p>Montmorency, invited to those ill-fated weddings, which produced not epithalamia (wedding songs) but epitaphs (funeral inscriptions), preferred to stay away, suspecting a trap laid for him. He went to Dieppe (a maritime city and port from which one crosses to England) and fortified himself there. - From the Valtellina Valley, my relative Ruinella writes that the Turkish fleet has been almost completely destroyed and Ochiali has taken refuge in flight. - I wrote to Mr. Simler the day before yesterday about the state of my affairs and what I have in mind. I ask you to kindly consider these few words written amidst the noise of the court.</p>
      <p>From Haldenstein, October 2, 1572.</p>
      <p>Small assemblies, in which the ambassador will be answered whether our countrymen wish to provide soldiers to the French, will be held on the 11th of this month, if I am not mistaken.</p>
