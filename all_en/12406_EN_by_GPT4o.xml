    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian is not so proud of his [written] works that he would, like a young man, believe that Bullinger and [Johannes] Stumpf must yield to him in everything. Rather, he is ready to relent and orient himself by their mildness and sound judgment. Such an attitude is already evident in his previous letters. Vadian actually began writing only because he knew that the people of Zurich would stand by him with advice, especially since he is aware of his naivety, his recklessness, and particularly his excessive openness in writing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Vadian cannot imagine that one could refer to him if one wanted to deny any value to monasticism, as he also highlighted good things in what he wrote about the origin and development of monasticism. If only the monks were as they should be and generally walked in the footsteps of their founders! Then Vadian would not only tolerate them but also praise them! But as they are, as everyone knows, one must endure them in certain places without being able to praise them. It is very important to Vadian that the Zurich book censors are persuaded to tolerate, for the sake of religion, the passages where he criticizes the monks for their greed, avarice, laziness, and excessive involvement in worldly affairs, because he does not want to be accused of secret agreement with the monks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- For example, he holds the hypocritical Abbot Ulrich VIII [Rösch] responsible for strife and war, but not to please his hometown [St. Gallen] or the neighboring [Appenzell region] (for this abbot was much worse). Vadian's [presentation] should therefore not be changed. A favorable judge will notice that Vadian did not pursue his own interest or that of his compatriots - whom he rightly criticizes at this point as well - but felt committed solely to the truth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Similarly, he criticizes Abbot Franz [von Gaisberg] for his greed and great aversion to righteous people (whether foreign or local), and this, even though he is related to the abbot, as indeed also to [Abbot] Kilian [Germann] (whose maternal grandmother [..., born Talmann] was the sister of Vadian's maternal grandfather [Ulrich Talmann]). Respect must be shown not to blood relations, but to the truth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger should therefore defend Vadian [against the Zurich book censors] and urge them to allow [the criticism of the abbots] out of love for Vadian's hometown St. Gallen (which has earned much from the people of Zurich). It is known how much the [abbots] have tried to bring St. Gallen into disrepute with the Swiss Confederation!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger's letter [No. 2353] was very welcome to Vadian, and not only because it shows that Bullinger is willing to help Vadian, but also because of its interesting [news transmission]. In gratitude, Vadian sends two [news] sheets [not received], which he received from Augsburg and Nuremberg. Friendly merchants usually lend him such for copying.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- On one of the sheets, the names of the princes and cities that have joined the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] are listed (Bullinger will notice how cleverly the use of the term "alliance" was avoided). There is also a list of the cities, including Nuremberg, that were admitted to the alliance [at the last Schmalkaldic Diet in Frankfurt]. It is very likely that the Elector of Mainz [Sebastian von Heusenstamm] and others, whose names are no longer on the incomplete list, were also admitted. Moreover, the meeting in Frankfurt (which is to be continued on April 1) was so unpretentious! Everything was negotiated by envoys. Meanwhile, a message was also sent to King [Francis I]. A delegation is soon to be sent to the Swiss Confederation as well. There is one more thing to report; however, it is so unheard of that Vadian prefers to remain silent about it, especially since the news is not confirmed. One thing is certain: If Emperor [Charles V] continues with his aggressive policy, there will be major changes in the [imperial] estates!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- From the [Second] Regensburg [Religious Discussion], it is learned that monks are causing news! Vadian was amused to learn how Bullinger's [Johannes] Cochläus hurried to Regensburg on his own initiative. Certainly, Cochläus' guard would not manage without this fabulist, especially since he himself serves as their bodyguard! Veit Dietrich, on the other hand, could not go to Regensburg because of his gout.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [Andreas] Osiander is said to make himself hated by many because he is too concerned with appearances and wealth. This man, loved by the [Nuremberg] patriciate and enriched by his third marriage [to Helena Magenbuch] as well as by his [annual] salary of 500 guilders, now ascends the pulpit with ring and necklace in a womanly manner to preach!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Philipp [Melanchthon] was probably prevented from participating [in the Second Regensburg Religious Discussion] by important matters. If that one [meaning Luther] continues to rage, the whole world will be informed in writing about the appropriateness and legitimacy of the [Swiss] concern [in the matter of the Eucharist].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], and [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- [P.S.:] It is considered certain that the [imperial] estates are well-disposed towards the Swiss Confederation for obvious reasons.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Do not think, most esteemed man, that I am so youthful in my exultation over the birth, so to speak, of my labors, that I wish you and our Stumpf to yield to me, and not rather to give place to your moderation and humanity, as well as to the soundness of your judgment. For I have testified differently in previous letters, and when I set my mind to writing, I was especially relying on the hope that I could easily be helped by your advice, if anything had been omitted by me or admitted too intemperately or negligently, indeed even committed. I know well and am fully aware (for I do not know whether nature has formed me with this as a gift or a fault), how I am not only simple and incautious in writing, but sometimes even more free than the equanimity of even benevolent people can bear.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Furthermore, since I myself have been compelled to attribute something to monasticism, both by its very origin and by the course of time demanding it, how could it be contended or demanded by me now that nothing at all should be attributed to it? If only monks were today as they ought to be, or for the most part followed in the footsteps of their fathers, then not only could they be tolerated by me, but even praised! But as they are, as you know and indeed the world knows, it is necessary to endure them in some places, difficult to praise, and entirely alien to the morals of pious men. I was only urging this, which you yourself clearly feel, that those censors of yours should not be moved, so that if in any place the greed of these men or their immoderate desire for wealth or unrestrained laziness or excessive zeal for civil and forensic matters or leisure filled with every kind of luxury and lust, etc., is censured and turned to vice due to the indignity of the matter, in that place they should not wish to connive and give anything to religion, lest we seem to approve entirely or bear with an even mind what is most alien to the very institution of monks.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I attribute to Ulrich VIII, by far the greatest and most pernicious hypocrite, the cause and blame of great dissensions and even wars, and I do this truly, not out of love for either my homeland or our neighborhood, and I rather obscure him with his own colors incidentally than paint him as he deserves. Here I would wish that this be granted to me for my own and piety's right, and thus be permitted, while fair judges are compelled to admit that I have not spared even my own so much that truth should be considered to have an exact account. For I do not act to defend or excuse my own as if they had no blame for evils; but having rightly reproached them, I meanwhile uncover the source of the entire calamity, which the necessity of those times was urging.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I did the same somewhere with Abbot Franz, whose greed, combined with great hatred of the good, made him so detestable not only to strangers but also to his own people, that his death brought much joy to many; and indeed, although he was closely related to me by blood, as was his successor Kilian (whose maternal grandmother was the sister of my maternal grandfather), yet, to remain faithful to history, I thought it far more necessary to defer to truth than to blood.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In these matters, may you help and protect me, and urge them to grant something out of love for your homeland, which has deserved well from yours. It cannot be said how much the dignity and reputation of this place have been tarnished by the malevolence of these people among the Swiss orders in more than one place and time. But too much about these things, all of which I entrust and confide to you as a most loving brother.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Your letter was most welcome to me, both because you promise me nothing undeserved from your own, and also because you reminded me of certain things at the end, which it was somewhat important for me to know. In return, I send you two sheets, one brought from Augsburg, the other from Nuremberg. For friendly merchants frequently send such things and lend them for me to copy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>In one, you will see which princes or cities have joined the Elector of Cologne and how they prefer to use the term adhesion rather than alliance, marvelously prudent. There you will find cities recently admitted to the alliance, the chief of which is Nuremberg. Nor is there any doubt that the Elector of Mainz is in the alliance and some others, whose names are presently omitted. You will also consider how humble and lowly the form of the entire assembly is. Everything was conducted through envoys, and they now write that the Frankfurt assembly has been dissolved, with a return appointed for the first of April. Thus it is written to us. Meanwhile, a most distinguished delegation will approach the French king in the name and mandate of the Protestants, and they say a similar one is destined for the Swiss, which will soon appear. Some incredible things have been entrusted to some of ours, which indeed, since they exceed belief, it is better to be silent about than to report. Be persuaded of this, that a great change of orders is about to happen, provided the emperor does not put a brake on his intemperance and does not turn away from his plan of raging. Meanwhile, monks are heard at Regensburg, what new things they bring.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I laughed at your Cochläus when I saw him fly there of his own accord, evidently lest that fable of his should lack its adornments; for from this assembly he likewise acts as a bodyguard. Vitus Dietrich would have been present at the Nuremberg disputation, had not gout laid him low.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Osiander is said to have made himself odious to many by his excessive concern for appearances and wealth. He ascends the pulpit adorned with a ring and necklace to preach, showing himself off in a womanly manner, now blessed with a third wife and not a little enriched by wealth, besides an annual salary of five hundred gold coins; for he is loved by the patricians.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Philipp is absent not without reason, undoubtedly engaged in grand affairs. For if he continues to rage, the world will be reminded in writing, so that everyone can be assured of the quality of the cause and favor can be won everywhere for a war undertaken for just reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>But these things I share with you as a brother, whom I wish well with all your people, especially Pellican, Theodor, and Gwalther.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>St. Gallen, the 18th day of February, in the year of our Lord 1546.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>It is certainly said that the estates favor the Swiss for many reasons. The reason is obvious.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most ample church of Zurich, most worthy lord.</p>
