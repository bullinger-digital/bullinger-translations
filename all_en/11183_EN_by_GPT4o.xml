    <p xml:id="regest1">Hopes to receive a letter from Bullinger. In Chur, there are plans to convert the monasteries into schools; Rudolf [von Salis?] can provide more information. The council in Vicenza may not have taken place. Pope Paul III achieved nothing in mediating between [Emperor Charles V and King Francis I] in Nice. Megander reported to Comander and his colleagues about the meeting [of the evangelical Swiss cities] in Zurich; they desire peace between the churches, but without compromising the truth, and ask to be kept informed. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace, peace, and a life of innocence from the Lord through Christ. Having found such a suitable messenger, I could not refrain from sending you a letter, most learned Bullinger, using this opportunity primarily to request a letter from you; I consider my own letters so dry and barren as to be worthless, but I highly value yours, full of all kinds of learning. Here among us, there is talk about the monasteries with the hope that schools will be established. May the most excellent God bring it to a good outcome! But how far this matter has progressed, our Rudolf himself will recount better than I could achieve with the pen. A council was supposed to be held in Vicenza; certain cardinals from Rome were appointed or sent there. We do not know what they have done; this little council produces no rumors, perhaps it is completely dormant like the previous one, which was supposed to be held in Mantua. Paul III has not yet departed from Nice; there, in the matter of restoring peace between the monarchs, he achieved nothing; they say those monarchs have each returned to their own. Megander informed us about your meeting in Zurich. Indeed, we greatly desire peace between the churches and earnestly pray to the Lord for it, but a peace that is not at the expense of truth, but with its benefit. We therefore ask and beseech you, that if anything further is done in this matter, which is worth knowing or beneficial, you would deign to write to us. May the most excellent God preserve you for us. From Chur, on the eighth day before the Kalends of July, 1538. Greet in my name Leo, Pellican, Megander, and Johannes Amman, men worthy of all honor.</p>
      <p>Devoted to you, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and primary friend.</p>
