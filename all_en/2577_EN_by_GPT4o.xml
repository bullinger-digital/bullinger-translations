      <p>Greetings. Meanwhile, while my relatives departed, your letters were delivered through Valentin Ampelandrus, Musculus' son-in-law, sent together with copies of your sermons and the letters of Mr. Gallitius. I thank you for everything, and Musculus also thanks you. He himself greatly fears the peace agreement between the Emperor and the French; but we hope it will not proceed. Various rumors are circulating here, but they are uncertain: it is said that the Emperor is determined to return to Spain, having handed over everything to his brother and son; that the Antichrist is raging in England; that Hooper and some others have been burned, and that the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, and Latimer are still in chains. These things greatly distress us; may the Lord strengthen them to the end. You think the collection for the people of Locarno should be postponed to another time, until they obtain certain settlements; but we saw it differently. Therefore, while we had the opportunity and the spirits seemed willing, we established and obtained by the grace of the Lord that 100 crowns be given from the treasury and, as we still hope, a contribution from wealthier private individuals will be forthcoming. Perhaps so much could not have been obtained if this enthusiasm had cooled through a longer delay, and I prefer our church to be among the first rather than the last. If anyone wishes to come to us, they will nonetheless be received.</p>
      <p>What I recently wrote to my brother about the defeat suffered in Piedmont, I hear is nothing. They say Siena has been captured by the Imperial forces; but how certain this is, I cannot affirm.</p>
      <p>Our Beza told me about a remarkable deed of a certain Christian named Scaevola, which seems worthy to write about to fill the page. He says that in Tournai, France, a certain commoner violently snatched the host from a priest who was raising it during mass, broke it at the altar, threw it on the floor, and trampled it with his feet, exclaiming to the people: "Oh, what kind of god do you worship," etc. Soon after being apprehended, he received such a sentence that first his wicked hand, with which he committed such a crime, was to be burned, then the other foot, with which he trampled the host (as they call it), and afterwards he was to be entirely cremated. When the fire was applied, he voluntarily placed his hand in it and endured its burning without any sign of pain; similarly, he laughingly placed his foot in the fire, saying this was the happiest step or stride by which he would enter eternal life. And so, when he was already failing, he was thrown onto the pyre and departed to the Lord, a truly worthy example for history. Thus Christ still triumphs through the cross; to Him be glory forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>I return the letters of Mr. Philipp Gallitius; the power of God has also marvelously manifested itself there; blessed be His name forever. All of ours greet you: Haller, Hagius, Diespachius, Giron, Musculus, Schlatter, and others. May all of yours be safe. Bern, March 5, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his honorable lord and compatriot.</p>
