      <p>God with us. Beloved son, I recently wrote to you with the gifts for St. Nicholas to share with the children, and have not heard from you since. Since then, I have also received nothing except from Nuremberg, dated November 24th, confirming what I previously wrote to you about the Queen of England, as it was reported to me from Augsburg, and furthermore, that in the treachery, the house of Guise (house of Ahab) and the Count of Arundel along with many other great English lords, indeed traitors, of whom a good part has now been judged, etc. I lent you my written book, in which the letters I wrote about the Lord's Supper to the Landgrave, Count George, etc., and others are copied, so send it back to me with the next sure messenger, so it does not get lost, also the notes in Joel and about the ringing of the bells. I am currently in poor health; a strong and severe catarrh along with incessant coughing has overcome me, etc.</p>
      <p>All our people greet you; greet Susanna and the children for me, etc. Sister Regula will hold her wedding on Monday with Caspar Thomen, etc. God be with you. December 8, 1571.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
