      <p>Having already written the letter, I decided to send a certain messenger, who will escort my Josias, since it is written: Woe to him who is alone, for if he falls, there is no one to lift him up. You, however, will be able to not only write to me through this very messenger, but also send any letters that might have arrived addressed to me from anywhere. If only you had written about the Catalog, which I asked you about and you promised you would do; for you could send it now, and I would print it directly. Write if you have any news from Italy, especially who has been appointed as the new Doge of Venice. Josias will tell you what I have thought about it; listen to him and definitely write what you think; to me, it certainly does not seem like such a good opportunity should be scorned; but you see more. Farewell and be well. In Tübingen, on the very day of John, 1553.</p>
