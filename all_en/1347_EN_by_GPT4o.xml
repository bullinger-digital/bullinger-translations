      <p>S. D. You have understood what I wrote about the upcoming assembly to be held on July 26, honorable lord and dearest brother. But listen to what has happened in the meantime. The Bernese, when called upon, respond that it does not seem appropriate to them to hold an assembly because of the pope's or the emperor's request, and that it was not long ago decided and declared by common votes what kind of council we should agree to; however, they do not want to add anything to that response. Although our people did not want anything changed, they did want the cities to meet once in these dangerous times and discuss all matters amicably, not just the response to be given. However, since the Bernese wrote that they would not send anyone, our people also informed your people and those of Schaffhausen about the assembly, so that by meeting alone without the neighboring Bernese, they would not provide an occasion for rejoicing and suspicion. Time and experience might teach us that it is better to come together than what is happening now. The decision of our people was excellent and very beneficial; whether they refused out of imprudence or stubbornness, I do not know. I write this to you alone and do not want you to share it with anyone, for many reasons. It is written from Italy that war and the turmoil of wars are raging so fiercely that nothing more atrocious has been done in human memory. The Dukes of Urbino and Ferrara and the Count of Mirandola openly profess the French side. There is great hope that the Venetians will also follow the French side. Soldiers have come to Constance directly from the Maurician camp, who report the same about the Magdeburgers as you write, but not a word about Maurice being captured. I thank you for your diligent writing. May the brothers and all the fellow ministers be safe, to whom you will say, my lords have postponed the day again for valid reasons; since the Bernese are not willing to attend the day, my lords have considered it good to postpone the day so that no one wonders why it is happening. Farewell with all yours. Most hastily.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 17, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother. Basel.</p>
