Urges caution regarding the participation of secular representatives in the negotiations. Also sends a letter from Vadian. Recommends Benedikt [Kromer]. Wishes a safe return.</p>

      <p>We sincerely wish for the Spirit of Christ and the progress of the churches, as well as holy concord in the will of the Lord, most pious and friendly Bullinger.</p>
      <p>On the very day of Charles, while Theodor was delivering an excellent impromptu sermon on ecclesiastical authority, all the letters arrived in our hands, which we now send to you and Leo for examination, so that if you wish to discuss anything with the people of Strasbourg, you may do so in time, namely, so that they do not take offense at the sending of Erasmus, but rather love their neighbor sincerely and console and assist him where necessary. A letter also arrived from Constance from Doctor Johannes Zwick, which we likewise send, perhaps it will be useful. The messenger, who was sent from Richenwil and brought the letters, will indeed descend to Basel, but will not arrive before Thursday. We have asked him to inquire at the inn zum Storken if you have left any letters there, so that he may take them with him. Therefore, if you write letters to Erasmus, entrust them seriously to the innkeeper, so that the messenger may find them upon his arrival, unless you have a more certain messenger than the one who is a citizen of Richenwil and was sent by Erasmus. We also send with this messenger Erasmus's letter to you and Leo along with our common one, as I wrote. In the meantime, we have heard nothing new.</p>
      <p>I wish you to act strongly and circumspectly in the Lord. For you have with you men endowed with very worldly prudence; would that they were equally strengthened in the fear of God and in the love of the word of God! It is expedient to act cautiously before them, lest they be scandalized perniciously. It would be better if they were simpler in matters of faith. But the Lord sees to these things, who is also present through grace.</p>
      <p>A letter from Vadian is also sent to you with these.</p>
      <p>Farewell. If you can do anything in his business for this Benedikt, do so for the good man, as he deserves and is worthy. All your things are safe by the grace of God; would that it were always so!</p>
      <p>In Zürich, the day after Charles's day, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Con. Pellikan. I wish my dearest compadre Leo to be safe with you and to return soon and happily.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the people of Zürich, compadre and dearest friend.</p>
