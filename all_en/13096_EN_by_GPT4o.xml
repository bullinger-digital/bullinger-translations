    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Count Georg thanks for Bullinger's message sent on October 17 [not received]. He would gladly reciprocate with news from Augsburg, but he is still waiting for the return of the messenger [...], who has gone to his envoy sent to Augsburg [Hans Henman Truchsess von Rheinfelden?].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] King Henry II of France has not yet taken up the fight [against Emperor Charles V], but he still retains the German mercenaries he hired. Ravensburg and other cities are being asked to provide winter quarters for the imperial soldiers or to pay money instead. This shows that peace with the Emperor does not mean that one is out of trouble!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] As Bullinger wished, herewith is the return of the Electors' response to the Emperor's proposition regarding the religious matter. In the meantime, Bullinger will have received the Count's letter [No. 3045] from the Zurich city messenger Melchior Schlosser.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] So much for Bullinger's letter. Blessing wish.</p>

      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard, etc. Our greetings beforehand, dear special one! We have received and understood your letter dated the 17th of this month, in which various new tidings (news) were conveyed with gracious thanks. And we would have gladly sent you what has arrived from Augsburg (as our messenger, whom we daily expect from our envoy in Augsburg) back to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, we know nothing new now, except that the King of France still sits quietly and still, but he still has the German mercenaries together, as Ravensburg and other cities are concerned, that they should provide winter quarters for the soldiers or give money, etc. This shows that even if one has already made peace with the Emperor, one is not out of worries and dangers! May the Lord graciously deliver us once! Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We also send you herewith the Electors' response, which they gave to His Imperial Majesty on the points of religion, back to you, as you requested. We also assume that you have now received our letter from Melchior Schlosser, your city messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We have graciously wanted to respond to your letter. Herewith we commend you to the Lord. Dated Basel, the 20th of October, in the year, etc., 47. G. Count of Württemberg, etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, our dear special master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
