      <p>Greetings. I hope you are in good health with all your family, most esteemed lord and brother; I pray to our Lord God that you may be well. Since it is not unpleasant for me to converse with you through letters, I write to you some things about the state of our affairs, and indeed very few, since at this time almost everything is in the utmost silence with us. Our Emperor is urging the assembly to be held on May 1st, if possible, in Augsburg, or in Nuremberg or Regensburg. Meanwhile, I perceive nothing that is being done that might offer any certain hope for the future assembly. They say there is an urgent necessity for the assembly to be held because of the immense military preparations of the Turks, whose direction is not yet known; therefore, money must be contributed, which the moneylenders will surely seize. While it comes to mind that tribute is paid annually to the Turks by our Emperor and thus peace is bought from them, it can rightly be said that the Turk rules over us, since it is certain that we are his tributaries, and since the history of the people of Israel can rightly be compared to our own affairs, while I imagine some comparison between these, I am reminded of many and various things, which I do not wish to recount to you, since your writings provide the greatest occasion for such thinking, nor could I recite many things that I would not have drawn from them.</p>
      <p>Many unfortunate things happen, which anyone from the common people could, if they wish, notice and not judge with difficulty what we might hope for from them. The cost of food with us does not decrease at all, and not much hope is yet shown for this year's yield; many are perishing from cold, hunger, and hardships, so that a notable plague, which will soon be very severe, is to be feared. What will happen with the war in Germany is very uncertain; some think there will be significant uprisings in the autumn; I can perceive no signs of this. However, I have no doubt about the Turk, that we will experience his forces, which we despise, to our great harm. May the Lord be with His own.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, March 14, in the year 71.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>To the reverend, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
