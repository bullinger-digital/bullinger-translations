      <p>Greetings. Since all things are common among friends, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, I have no doubt that some concern for my exile touches your mind. Therefore, it seemed right to briefly inform you where that storm has cast me, which attempted to unexpectedly overthrow Konstanz. Meanwhile, while that city was being attacked by the Spanish, having already taken my wife and children, who were in a state of great distress, I left the city along with the remaining multitude of women, children, and foreigners, through the open way. And since, as a foreigner, I was ignorant of the roads, I followed those to whom the moment of that departure had joined me, thinking it mattered little where I would arrive by that route, as long as I was among those who were safe from the enemies. Thus, I came to a small town called Bischofszell. When I arrived there, some of my children began to fall ill, not seriously, but enough to prevent further travel. After three days, since I understood that St. Gallen was only one mile away from Bischofszell, I decided to go there with my wife and children. I wrote about this matter to Vadianus; he, having sent a certain minister of the gospel to me, conveyed the goodwill of the council. Embracing this, I came to St. Gallen, where I now live with my family, having experienced the counsel of the Lord, on whom not only my salvation and fortune but that of all mortals depends. Meanwhile, I commend myself to your prayers and brotherly love. If you think there will be anything from me in the future, please let me know in due time, I pray.</p>
      <p>Farewell very well, dearest of men, greetings to your wife, children, brothers, Mr. Pelikan, Theodor, Gwalther, and the rest.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, August 11, 1548.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, yours in Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, dearest lord and brother.</p>
