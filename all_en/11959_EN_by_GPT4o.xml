    <p xml:id="regest1">He does not want to elaborate on his sad fate, but his opponents should beware of self-righteousness; God has helped him up again. Bullinger can imagine why he is only writing now; due to the [adultery] that occurred, he is very much opposed [in Zurich], but thanks to a recommendation by Johannes Piscatorius [in Balzheim] on January 1st, [Martin] Frecht in Ulm received him kindly, granted him forgiveness, and recommended him to Adam Bartholomäus, [the court preacher] of Duke Ottheinrich, after which he was initially allowed to preach at the residence [Neuburg an der Donau] and then sent to the Medingen Monastery; here he lives with his wife and preaches - with uncertain success - against images, altars, and the Lutheran Eucharistic rite. The court preacher holds Bullinger in high regard, reads his and Oecolampadius's writings, and has brought Meyer into contact with the prince; he seeks Bullinger's friendship for himself and the prince, and Bullinger should not deny it to them. Bullinger should reconcile the [upper] bailiffs of Stammheim and the mayor so that Meyer can do penance and return to Zurich; apart from the committed adultery, he is not a bad person; God will punish his slanderers. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To Mr. H. Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>Amidst the many vicissitudes of human affairs, dearest brother and lord Bullinger, and the unstable and frequent changes, you know what has happened to me.</p>
      <p>Of which now a few things must be written, although many would also be needed; but since I do not know all the slanders and false accusations of all my enemies and do not have suitable witnesses, I have deemed it more sacred to touch upon nothing concerning the course of this tragedy, but to give place to fate and yield, not to believe everyone, and to bear the necessity of fate patiently. Even if I know that many have said quite a lot against me in my absence and overwhelmed by the weight of misfortunes, what then? Truth is the daughter of time; they will also see that God's just judgment will someday be executed upon them, who have added calamity to calamity and, not knowing themselves, namely that they are human, have not considered a similar fate. Let him who stands take heed lest he fall. However, the Lord of heaven has so far protected me, a wretched man, with His right hand, has again exalted me with His right hand, has entrusted me with the administration of the word after my humiliation, and has stood faithfully by my side both on the left and on the right; to Him be glory forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>Now it has pleased me to inform you of the state of my affairs, partly because I love you greatly, partly because I trust you and pour these things into the bosom of Christian faith. For although another place holds you and I now live under another sky, nevertheless our minds, duty, administration, faith, charity, and indelible love for the homeland, which I still love today, to which I am devoted, to which I have consecrated all my abilities, if I can do anything, are united. But that I have not sent any letters to you and the other best men until this day, I have reasons not to be despised, which I have now decided to enclose and keep in bonds. But you, as a prudent man, can easily smell what might be an offense to the church, what modesty, what the slippery happiness of former fortune, and the stings of enemies, etc. These have cast me out until this hour and not the biting conscience of any evil crime or deed. Add the power of the first fervor, the cartload of slanders, the wounded church, the indignation of the most holy senate, the defiled reputation of an impure little girl, and the phalanx of friends and the most ardent hearts for revenge, etc., finally the treachery of those with whom I had consulted, who overturned all my affairs and threw the blackest pebbles into the pot, stirring and arousing the hornet's nest everywhere afflicted. Among so many evils, among such severe heats of divine judgment, I went away more wandering than the Numidians. Finally, the kindness of fate cast anchor and added strength, vigor, place, favor of great and flourishing men, to whom I am dear, who love and respect me.</p>
      <p>For on the first of January, armed with the letters of Johannes Piscatorius, a good and learned man, I approached the excellent man M. Frächt of the Ulm church, and openly cast the burden of my sin into the heart of the man not without great shame, found Christian consolation and burial of my sin with him. Indeed, he did not want it to spread further, therefore he cut the nerves and weakened the strength. He finally adorned me with his letters and sent me to the Palatinate of the most illustrious prince Ottheinrich to the learned and most humane man Mr. Licentiate Adam Bartholomäus, making no mention of my fall. Thus he both adorned and recommended me with his Christian charity and also his remarkable prudence, so that I soon obtained a province and, after a few days, was appointed to the Medingen Monastery, where I still live today with my wife. Among other things, however, which impose the burden of Atlas on me, these are: Images, altars still stand, they perform the Lord's Supper with Lutheran rites and ceremonies. However, I have so far opposed them, but how successfully, I do not know; I have fought with many, publicly confessed our faith against images, against the Lutheran rite of the supper, not without, as I hope, fruit, nor without, as happens, also the envy of some.</p>
      <p>Now as it pertains to you, the most learned bishop of the Zurich church: Mr. Licentiate, the prince's preacher, loves you greatly, reads your works, praises you, uses your and Oecolampadius's writings, vigils, and labors, and wishes with the greatest desires to enjoy your face, your conversation, and to bring the most illustrious, best, and most humane prince, who recently called me to him by letter, joined his right hand to mine, spoke with me most familiarly, into your friendship and to draw your favor and serene mind to him; he would be overwhelmed with great joy if he were to achieve his wish, etc. Therefore, dearest Bullinger, according to the wisdom given to you by God, make sure that the wishes and desires of that most illustrious prince and Mr. Licentiate are satisfied and that they feel you pursue them with Christian love and that my letters are held in esteem by you. You will certainly see that you have neither wasted your effort nor your oil.</p>
      <p>As for me now, I beseech you again and again through Christ, consult my affairs, placate the bailiffs of Stammheim in the city and greet the consul, the best and most prudent man, gently. With the slanders silenced, I promise to bear the burden of penance, I burn to return to you and my best homeland. Certainly, I am not a very bad man nor have I ever been except for this adultery, which I know is erased before the Lord. The rest of the insults, slanders, and I don't know what portents of evils were added by Satan using the ministry of some sooty men, who, opening Pandora's jar, heaped this hail upon the head of the afflicted. Whom the Lord will soon finish with the arrow of His fury, unless they repent. You will write what needs to be done. Farewell, remember me. Again, farewell in Christ our Savior, to whom I commend you together with all your family and church, and also to all the best men.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Konstanz, May 12, 1544. Laurentius Agricola, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the man of great learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, his most esteemed brother and lord.</p>
