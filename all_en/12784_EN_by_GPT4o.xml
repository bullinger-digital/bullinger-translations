    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Curione takes the opportunity to send a letter to Bullinger with his host Johannes Herwagen, who is traveling to Zurich. Bullinger will be surprised, but Curione is in Basel, and has been for quite some time! He wants to work here for as long as possible. Bullinger's influence on his Basel friends can only be advantageous for Curione. Bullinger should continue to favor him, especially since the scholars of the University of Basel are beginning to appreciate him. A recommendation from Bullinger would promote him even more!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Curione left Lausanne mainly because he and his wife [Margarita Bianca, née Isacchi] could not tolerate the climate there. He has almost always expressed this in his letters to Bullinger. Moreover, he has been subjected to a great, almost unbearable injustice. He seeks all his comfort in Christ, for whom he has always stood up even in the worst dangers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Perhaps more later. Time is short, Herwagen is already setting off. He has promised to visit Bullinger and to greet the entire family. Curione (who will never forget Bullinger's support) jokingly said that Herwagen should toast him while drinking Bullinger's five-year-old, golden-yellow wine, while he in Basel will drink Herwagen's wine in thought with Bullinger and Herwagen!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] May God protect Bullinger, his wife Anna [née Adlischwyler], their children, and the church! Greetings also to Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, and the other scholars.</p>

      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his S. D. through Christ Jesus. When Mr. Herwagen, my host, announced that he wanted to travel to Zurich, most learned and kind Bullinger, I did not want to let him go without a letter from me to you. But what will you say? Is Caelius in Basel? So it is! For I have been here for a long time, and it is decided for me to be in this city as long as it pleases the Lord and as long as this city does not reject my service and duty, however small it may be. In this matter, I am not unaware that you can greatly help me with some of your friends here. Therefore, I ask you, my most kind Bullinger, to continue to support and honor me as you have begun. For the best and most learned men of this academy are already beginning not to reject me; but if your recommendation is added, you will not only encourage those who are running but also push those who are hesitating.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The reasons why I no longer wish to be in Lausanne are many, but two are especially important: the harshness of the air and climate there, which is harmful to me and my health (for I remember that I have hardly ever written to you without mentioning the adverse health of either myself or my wife); and secondly, what moved me more, a certain notable injustice, which I can hardly bear with a calm mind even now. But the Lord, my Jesus Christ, whom I have always worshipped from the heart and whom I have never hesitated to preach even in the midst of dangers, now also comforts me and does not abandon me, nor will he ever abandon me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Perhaps more another time. Now there is hardly time to write these few things, as our Herwagen is about to depart; whom I have asked to visit you in my name and to greet you and your whole family courteously. This he promised to do, given his kindness, especially since he had already decided to greet you himself. And, as I (who can never forget your kindness and rather divine charity towards me and my whole family) was recounting your services and merits towards me to Mr. Herwagen, jokingly, as is customary, I mentioned to him your five-year-old wine, which I usually call golden wine from its color, and I asked him to drink a cup with you in my name, while I here will drink another in the name of both of you. But this, as I said, in jest.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Now there is nothing else that I can write to you, my dearest Heinrich, my soul, except I pray to God that he may keep you safe for me and for his church for a long time, along with your most honorable wife and sweetest children, whom you will greet in my name, and also Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellikan, that good and holy old man, and the other most learned brothers. Farewell through Christ Jesus. Basel, on the first day of January 1547. Yours always most devotedly from the heart, Caelius S. C. signed.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant and in every way learned overseer of the church of Zurich, to be respected by him. In Zurich.</p>
