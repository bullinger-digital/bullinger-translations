      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>There was nothing, dearest Bullinger, that you could ask of me in your prayers, if you saw anything in which my service was needed. Regarding those letters you mentioned, I again approached Peter Maclaine, the bookseller here, to whom those letters were sent by Abel, as he wrote to me. Our Laurence was also with me, to whom Abel addressed the entire bundle of our letters (as he wrote to me). Peter responded to us in this way: a certain man came to him with letters, who was not the driver, but was hired by the driver, or who had bought those letters from the driver, so that he might later sell them at a greater profit. Therefore, Peter, offended by the man's importunity for money, and because he saw that the matter did not concern him but the English, sent the man to the nearby inn of the wild man, affirming that he would find the English there, who would receive the letters from him. However, I know of no Englishmen who were in the city at that time except us; nor can I quite understand what came to Peter's mind to send the man to the wild man, when he knew well enough where we were in the city, to whom he could have sent the man much better. Therefore, when I expostulated with Peter on this account, he replied that he thought and heard that the English were then with the wild man, etc. But the fact is: because Peter did not want to spend money on the greedy man, we lost the letters. However, this does not grieve me so much for my own sake and my letters, which I lost enclosed in the same bundle, as for yours, most excellent and dearest Mr. Bullinger, which I understand from you were written by an old friend. And I wish, as I told Peter then, that I had given him triple, provided that the letter-bearer, or rather the letter-thief, whoever he was, had been satisfied! The more I see you concerned about this matter in your letters, the more the same matter concerns me as well, to confess to you frankly and simply. Nor do I know what to do in this matter, or where to search further.</p>
      <p>Although your letters offer me little good hope concerning Frensham, yet because he still breathes, and while he breathes, we will not cease to hope well for him. There was an English youth of 16 years here, who this year from a similar cough and consumption was not only near death, but could be seen as death itself; and yet, to the astonishment of the doctors here, he recovered, and went to England with his parents. Praise be to Christ the Lord! Would that our Frensham might also play some similar trick on your doctors sometime, if it seems good to the chief physician, Christ the Lord! But let His holy will be done.</p>
      <p>If you have anything about Mr. Grynaeus, whom you mention in your letters, I ask that you send it here as soon as possible, and share it with us. I wish to be informed whether Hooper married his wife there with you or here in Basel. While we are gathering the other German martyrs, I would not want Zwingli to be overlooked: if you have anything about him, or if you wish to share anything with us, if it cannot be conveniently done through the German printers, we will arrange for it to be printed in England, God willing.</p>
      <p>I wish, if the Lord grants life, to visit and greet you there before my departure to my homeland, most kind and learned Bullinger. I pray, advise Frensham, if he still breathes, not to lose heart so, and not to cast away all good hopes, nor let the despair of the mind seem greater than the disease of the body. Please greet Mr. Peter Martyr very much in my words.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus daily advance your labors along with your safety for the benefit of His church! Amen. Basel, June 17.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, John Foxe.</p>
      <p>Please share this other letter with Mr. Frensham, if he lives.</p>
