      <p>To the most distinguished Heinrich Bullinger, adorned with both piety and learning, pastor of the church in Zürich, brother and fellow minister, to be greatly respected. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>Grace, peace, and mercy from God. What is read in the Psalms about the pious, that they go forth weeping, bearing their seeds, but shall return with joy, carrying their sheaves, is indeed visible today, and will perpetually be so. Now the word is sown with tears under a heavy cross due to the treachery of many, who betray it and incite many to defection. There is also a sea of offenses, which so burns the faithful disseminators of the word that they do not know where to turn, and unless He who commands to hope against hope were present, they would utterly collapse in spirit. But the Lord will bring it about, however tearful the sowing may be, that the harvest will be full of joy, and far more abundant than we could believe. When we came to you and first mingled our conversations with you, it was certainly not without great pain. The cause we were advocating, the more equity it had, the more weight it also had. We felt it was burdened with envy. May God grant a better mind to those who not only strive to inflame the magistrates but also endeavor to alienate those who are entirely one in Christ, of the same mind, and the same spirit, from their most dear brothers. If the Lord hates anything, it is that kind of people most of all. But Christ did not allow us to be swallowed up by such great sorrow: for He gave an outcome with Christian joy. You testified to a friendly and brotherly spirit towards Viret, and to the humanity, which we had previously experienced in the greatest measure, you added all the duties of piety towards us, and lest anything be lacking, you wonderfully refreshed us, while you encouraged us to hope well concerning Haller. A brief conversation with him increased our hope, but age held me back somewhat.</p>
      <p>I was indeed to be reproved in many ways because after such ample testimony from you about the brother and such a friendly conversation with him, I hesitated because of age, nor did Viret come to mind, whose cause, indeed Christ's, we were advocating in him. Although he was very young, compelled by the scarcity of workers to put the sickle into the Lord's harvest, he never admitted anything unworthy even of a grave old man, but did everything beyond his age, which indeed brought him no small amount of envy, both among the papists who tried so wickedly to destroy him with poison and other means, and among the drones who seek to live in the gospel without labor and to be held in esteem: from whom he suffered far harsher things than ever from the papists. This Viret, I say, and others, not to mention you, who unless I am entirely mistaken, were much younger when you were taken up to the evangelical office, in which by God's grace you have conducted yourself among your people in such a way that you have always seemed more to be imitated by others than to follow them, may God perfect in you and all His servants what He has begun, and has increased to this day, and grant true perseverance. Should not such a number of pious and so distinguished pastors compel me to fear nothing about Haller's age? And although I acknowledge fault here, there is yet something that should not render me so condemnable by those who love Christ. For I love the churches, indeed I cherish them all: but I must perpetually have the Bernese church before my eyes and carry it in my heart, since I have felt its innumerable services both at home and abroad. Moreover, how much is at stake in it, one can hardly believe who does not know. Therefore, not only I, having experienced so much, but everyone who has anything of Christ should strive with the greatest zeal for such a great church, that it may be as well as possible.</p>
      <p>For we have been taught by experience how much not only pestilent men, agitated by evil passions, but also those who are little attentive and do not act with great judgment, who seemed to themselves to be wise, have harmed this church and with it many others, by stumbling so often on the same stone, while admitting evils and rejecting goods.</p>
      <p>But now by the help of the Lord, I am freed from fear, since Haller, as this name is of good omen, provides for the Bernese what the former accomplished by building through the Lord, by preserving and restoring. He does not support factions nor dissolve unity, but, as befits a pious pastor, strives to unite all as one, studying to join minds: he does nothing rashly, not easily believing the accusations of scoundrels, he shows himself harsh to the good, and unless all deceive me, which cannot be, since all the pious speak rightly of him, he is a holy minister of God, who with much faith, zeal, care, and integrity and purity conducts himself in the house of the Lord, and to speak frankly, most excellent Bullinger, I seem to be in the greatest joy, nor could I hope so much for the Bernese church after the former Haller as now.</p>
      <p>But this my joy was disturbed by only one who, not without considerable pain of his own mind, but much more of mine, reported: the restoration of the Bernese church, which he praised wonderfully, would soon be lost, because Haller would shortly depart, being recalled from there by your Zürichers. I, sorrowful in spirit, think what I should do, where I should turn.</p>
      <p>I see that I can do nothing at all, since some have labored with all their might to burden me with envy among all, so that Haller, who had once gained everyone's favor for me, is excluded in this way. You alone are left today who can help the church of Christ, if it is so that this most pious senate, which has always stood so dutifully by the Bernese church, recalls Haller. Which I can hardly persuade myself. For it is not unknown in what state the affairs of that church have been, nor how useful Haller is to it, so that all should urge the senate and the Bernese church to retain such a suitable person. But if it is so, you, having compassion on that church and all that are French, should strive that Haller does not move his foot, but endures. For today I do not think a greater blow can be inflicted on any church, if anyone is taken away, than on the Bernese, and with it many others. Therefore, I ask and beseech you through Christ Jesus, if it is so that he is recalled, you with your colleagues should do everything with that illustrious senate that for the glory of Christ, and such and so great edification of all, it may allow, even if it is grievous to it, deprivation, and freely give to the uses of the Bernese church, since the love of Christ should compel the evangelical people to help the salvation of others, depriving themselves of very useful and necessary things. I preferred, though uncertain, to ask you rather than by waiting long, as it cannot be otherwise, finally being made certain, to groan heavily over a completed matter which I dread.</p>
      <p>And you will kindly consider my fear if it is vain: but if it is just, I beg you to free me from it, and from the most grievous pain, which joined with the most bitter torments from the ruins of the church, I do not doubt would destroy me and some with me.</p>
      <p>How dreadful it is even to hear that hearts are so broken that the free, who never bore the yoke, now admit it more than servilely. But that is little if it is compared with the yoke of Antichrist, which once rejected, those now most wickedly defecting from Christ again take up. How grave is the impending divine wrath? Who would ever have believed they would come to such madness and blindness? Who not only as before exposed their bodies for sale for a time, but now in addition add their wives, children, possessions, and finally their whole country. Thus gold blinds their eyes, that they consider the most hostile enemies, as long as they give, far dearer than parents, and are separated from the closest brothers, without whom they could neither stand before nor now. No fish ever bit the hook with greater loss than they have taken the gold: for they will return it with great interest and will never be freed, unless they repent in time. The judgments of God are open and certain; for as they did not want to hear the voice of salvation and much less admit it, but rejected Christ offered, so they run to their own destruction and most eagerly pursue whatever leads to it, and the more hatefully they have turned away the most friendly and faithful father, the more they observe the most hostile enemy, than whom you would not know what is more cunning or treacherous, with the greatest affection. They serve such a horrendous tragedy, who play the part of Judas among us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be gracious to us and kindly preserve what remains of the churches, raise up those already so foully fallen, destroy Satan, Antichrist, and the efforts of all the impious, and draw all to Christ, whom alone He may cause to reign!</p>
      <p>Farewell most excellently, my most learned and diligent Bullinger. Labor for the Bernese church. May Christ always favor your ministry and make it happy and as fruitful as possible! Bid all the pious to be well and to help me with their holy prayers; but among these, most dutifully greet the holy and pious old man and teacher Pellican with Theodor, also Gwalther, whom my colleague Christophorus greets with you.</p>
      <p>In Neuchâtel, December 10, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Farel from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Heinrich Bullinger, adorned with both piety and learning, pastor of the church in Zürich, brother and fellow minister, to be greatly respected. In Zürich.</p>
