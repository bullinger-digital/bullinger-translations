      <p>I have written you a letter and one to Haller, and now, as I search for them, I cannot find them, I should go mad; the copy of the letter to Bern is also included. I am exceedingly confused and cannot help it, I do not know where I misplaced it or if I accidentally sent it to St. Gallen with other letters. I hope I will find it again, but I am very dissatisfied. I am sending you the letter to the people of Bern; since Marcellen's servant is here, I have given it to him and gifted two coins, so that he will take it to ZÃ¼rich tomorrow with some other letters; he assured me he would deliver it or assign it to someone else.</p>
      <p>The content of the letter is everything, as I wrote to you the reasons, and I have also used the other reasons that you wanted.</p>
      <p>I have no news, except that a trusted, honorable confederate has informed me that he has read a long writing by [von Hertenstein of Lucerne]; it contains many burdensome articles that the king demands of the priests and bishops. He says there are several pages and many articles, and because the chapter of Lucerne is a citizen, they have given or sent it to this mentioned man and want to have advice from those of Lucerne; for they are very burdened and unwilling about the matter.</p>
      <p>They are now supposed to give the king 10,000 florins for the construction of the city and otherwise seven from the meadow, and the bishop and chapter are to recognize the dukes of Austria as their protectors, provide some places, with all towns, places, courts, etc., and there are many articles and grievances. There are factions among them, some pro-king, but few; some want, as they think, not to accept the city and this, but they will have to; no one can prevent it.</p>
      <p>Negotiations are now subtly conducted with the expelled through special persons, they would like them to request to return to the city, and they withhold the absolution from the ban, also the new government and regulations, how it should be maintained, until the others also come in; but they will not be able to do it.</p>
      <p>Forgive me for God's sake; I cannot do better, I am so very upset about the misplaced letters, you would not believe it; there is also one to Meuslin and the copy. I have driven myself mad with the search. Pray to God faithfully for me. May the Lord reward you and all good things here and eternally.</p>
      <p>Dated January 12.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
