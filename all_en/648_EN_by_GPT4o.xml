      <p>Your kindness, most honorable Mr. Bullinger, encourages me, a stranger, to dare to write to you; for being a man, as that one says in Terence, I consider nothing human alien to me. In the past months, we heard that the four principal cantons among you did not agree with the others on entering into a confederation with the King of France, and I think this was a prudent and serious decision. For no firm friendship can exist unless it is joined by a similarity of minds. And behold, in these days, someone who returned from you here consistently and diligently affirms that now all the cantons of the Swiss have pledged themselves to the French alliance. Although I am moved by the authority of the narrator, I still cannot bring myself to believe such reports, especially since the King of France recently, by a horrible and truculent edict, has proscribed all piety and sanctioned the grossest and most widespread superstitions with bloody laws, and I have found that such things are not unknown to you; for these punishments have been threatened and promulgated throughout the entire kingdom of France. Therefore, I ask your lordship to inform me about the rumor spread among us through this messenger. So that you may do this with less trouble, I will also share with you what has been certainly discovered to me from Saxony: The people of Magdeburg, still caught between a rock and a hard place, are expecting some more favorable fortune. The Emperor recently asked two things from them, first that they submit all their privileges granted to the city by the ancient Emperors to the Emperor's discretion, and secondly that they demolish the city's walls; both of which they refuse to do. The people of Bremen act according to their rights and customs to this day; for nothing is currently demanded from them, which I think is due to the proximity and closeness of the city of Magdeburg, so that two cities are not provoked at the same time. The city of Brunswick and Duke Henry devastate the neighboring fields with mutual raids, and these depredations are now carried out over the tithes, which each claims for themselves. There is no confederation among the maritime cities.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand, Maurice, and the Margrave of Brandenburg are currently holding a convention in Brandenburg, but it is not yet known what the negotiations are about.</p>
      <p>The King of Denmark still stands firm in religion and has summoned Brentius to him with his own messenger. In England, a rebellion of common people against the king recently arose; for they had been persuaded by superstitious and papist followers that the king wanted to abolish all sacraments and piety. But their disobedience, which arose from ignorance, was pardoned by the king's clemency and forgiveness. However, the authors of the commotion were removed by hanging. Due to the fever afflicting me, I am reluctant to write more at the moment. I offer all my services to your lordship.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, August 23, 1549.</p>
      <p>Christopher Mont.</p>
