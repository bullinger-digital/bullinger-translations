      <p>Having already written the letter, I heard that Mr. Haller has come to you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I earnestly beg you, Bullinger, to commend my cause to the lords of Bern in the best possible light, and also to give him letters of recommendation to carry. I will wait for him in Bern and have no intention of doing anything in his absence, whom I bid farewell. Farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
