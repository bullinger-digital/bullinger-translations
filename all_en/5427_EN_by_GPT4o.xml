      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to add to what I have already written to you extensively in recent days.</p>
      <p>I am now awaiting your response, especially regarding Castalio. It is rumored (though I dare not yet affirm it with certainty) that Condé, seeing that he has hoped in vain for peace until now and that his adversaries are attempting extreme measures, will bring the English into France; there are also large forces from Germany on the way to support him. May the Lord grant success, so that the churches may finally be freed from such severe tyranny! As for the people of Glarus, my lords would like to make a definite agreement with the cities, and they are serious about it; however, it does not resonate with many. Our envoys have the authority to go and negotiate with the other cities and articulate the issues. Your lords have been present at many discussions, but they have not given further instructions than to listen to what is brought to them, not to articulate. It is not at all my lords' intention to now lie at the Brünig Pass, as it is suggested; rather, they have proposed to consider that we must also be cautious at the borders and cannot rush to aid the people of Glarus with all our might. For we have troublesome borders with Unterwalden, Fribourg, and Solothurn; they lie almost in the middle of our land and are capable of nothing. Therefore, it would be good to sit down earnestly and deliberate on it; for if it takes long, it will be necessary. Basel is almost entirely withdrawing.</p>
      <p>I believe they would prefer to be back with Swabia. I hear that one should now soon come together with full authority; that would be good.</p>
      <p>Write, I beg you, if you have received anything from Germany and England, also from the Lucerne assembly. I have nothing from there yet.</p>
      <p>Mr. Beatus Ludwig von Mülinen himself writes to you.</p>
      <p>All the rest greet you, Steiger, Haller, Hagius, Vischer, von Madiis, Pistorius, the Zehenders, Musculus as well, my father-in-law and mother. Greet all the lords and friends, Mr. Martyr, Gwalther, all the sons-in-law with their wives and the entire family. Bern, August 16, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
