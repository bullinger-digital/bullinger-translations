      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Georg Grebel, endowed with uncommon learning and remarkable piety, is coming to you. Having worked not unsuccessfully in good letters for several years at the University of Basel, he is now returning to his homeland, driven by the plague's fury and his mother's command. However, he has not previously experienced much goodwill from his brothers and relatives towards his studies and fears that these unrefined and inept judges of matters might attempt to draw him away from the company of the Muses as something useless. Now, as I take up his cause before you, esteemed patron, I earnestly ask you not to deny him your support in this matter and, as per your usual custom and ancient practice, to act on his behalf with your friends, educate them, demonstrate the usefulness of studies to them, and finally, ensure that he can remain a student of good letters. For I do not think you will expend your efforts in vain, as he is both pious by nature and wholly devoted to the study of letters. But I do not think longer prayers are needed in this matter, as we have long known you to be the most eager patron of all scholars. As for other matters, Georg himself will explain them to you abundantly; therefore, I now end my writing.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, I sent you some letters through a coachman, but I do not know if they have been delivered to you. In those, I asked you to send Cicero to me through the same coachman; I earnestly beg you to also add a Greek lexicon. For now that Grebel has left us, I can no longer do without it; he has taken away his own, which I used before.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to write. Please consider my request favorably and strive, I ask, to keep our Grebel in the register of scholars.</p>
      <p>Master Miconius wishes you well. In my name, greet your entire family in return. Farewell, esteemed teacher, and always keep your Gwalther recommended to you.</p>
      <p>Basel, from the house of Master Oswald Miconius, October 7, 1538. Rudolf Gwalther, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of remarkable learning and piety, Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Church of Zurich, his patron and teacher, especially to be respected.</p>
