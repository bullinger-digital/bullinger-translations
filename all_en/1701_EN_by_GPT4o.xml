      <p>I would have written to you, most illustrious man, that your letters, which mentioned Schertel, had not been returned to me, and so it was; but since that time I have received them, which was the reason that I sent your book to Schertel along with the letters you write to the royal majesty. I also wrote to him to respond, and I do not doubt that he will do in good faith what you request. In the meantime, Sebastian, your firstborn son, also passed through here, to whom I diligently entrusted the matter. What I should say about the princes of Germany, I do not know, since so many new and uncertain things are brought from all sides. Peace is certainly thought to have been established between the Emperor and the princes, except for Margrave Albrecht, and Zasius writes that he was present at the conditions and completed the business not without great trouble, so that he seems to be an eyewitness, unless his credibility is suspect to me, as he often delights in fabricated stories. On the other hand, on the 4th of this month, Duke Moritz was expected in France; now, since we are so close, how is it that we cannot know the matter for certain?</p>
      <p>The Flemish have suffered a great defeat and exposed themselves to danger; for the powerful, through treachery, corrupted Therouanne, a fortified royal city in Picardy. The treachery was detected by the governor, which was nevertheless feigned, so that, leaving one gate of the city open, he awaited the enemies coming by night with increased garrisons outside the city, having summoned neighboring cavalry, who enclosed the Flemish thinking they were entering the city, of whom many were killed and fifteen hundred remained captives... I could not obtain the permission to leave, which I had requested; but I am only free to go to Lyon; however, because the air of Lyon does not please me much (although I have some estates in the vicinity and a house in the city), I have decided to remain here for some time; afterwards, unless the illness subsides, I will depart, which is certainly very uncertain and changes every week, and winter is especially suspect to me. May the will of the Lord be done.</p>
      <p>Farewell and commend me to your church in your prayers. Basel, 17th August 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Maurilius Musaeus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zürich, dearest brother and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich</p>
      <p>August 1552.</p>
