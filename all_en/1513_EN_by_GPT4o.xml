      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Concerning Guͦtschick, I still have no definite information about what our people intend to decide about him. The poor man is still detained in the Asinine Tower, and he prefers to be punished rather than detained and at some point subjected to the torture he deserves, even though his steadfastness daily suggests enough punishment; for he said he had often wanted to kill Mr. Sch[ertlin], but did not dare and was not prevented by anyone. I will write shortly about what our wise senate intends to do with him next.</p>
      <p>I rejoice that the Gospel is being purely preached in Hungary, and who among the pious would not rejoice? We are unworthy of God's word due to our ingratitude towards God's benefits. I also grieve over the Turkish invasion due to the act of a treacherous monk. Those cardinal hats are red with the blood of the pious and desire nothing else than the shedding of Christian blood; for where does all evil come from if not from the treachery of Christians?</p>
      <p>Osiander, a proud man, has stirred up a new controversy in Königsberg over the article of justification; he has led the pious prince to his opinion, among many others.</p>
      <p>He published a booklet written in German on this matter, over 20 pages, which that prince sent to Strasbourg to be judged by theologians. Did he not send it to you as well? We have received nothing; either they have proscribed us from the church, or they have another church gathered by the imperialists? Thus, the Lord tests us in various ways from all sides.</p>
      <p>We have no definite information about the council. The second session will discuss articles on penance, extreme unction, and the sacrifice of the mass. The papal idol has decreed safe conduct for the Protestant theologians invited to the council (note this, they do not want us). The deadline is until the day of the Conversion of Paul; by that time, they must prepare and be present. Various confessions have been prepared by the princes and cities, which they will present to the demigods of Trent.</p>
      <p>A good friend writes to me these words. They say the Emperor will return to Augsburg in a few days to the garden of pleasure.</p>
      <p>The Spaniards lack the delights and luxury of Innsbruck, they have robbed the poor by theft; the rich have fled with all their valuables, leaving their homes empty with their families, and this grieves the Spanish rascals. In the Netherlands, everything is calm. The Emperor sent five wagons loaded with silver to Flanders; what do you think he will establish there with the money?</p>
      <p>A war once begun will not easily come to an end unless the authors are killed. The window to the Turks is open; let him come, therefore, and humble Germany, which has so far plundered and devastated almost all nations. Farewell. December 26, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>Are you going to publish the propositions of Peter Martyr on the Eucharist or the booklet he published in England? I fear for that good man because of the English sedition. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
