      <p>He sends his regards. Behold, with impudent boldness, I have again thought it necessary to address you, Bullinger, the most illustrious of all learned men, with my writings. For what reason? As long as I indulge my own inclination, even if you find it difficult to direct your eyes to these writings. I am a Walliser from Brig, a district of that most illustrious people, who long ago began to seek your esteemed counsel regarding the recovery of my paternal inheritance. Therefore, let it not be burdensome to you, most learned Bullinger, to once again endure the tedium of reading these things for my sake. I am not seeking advice again on how to return to my paternal inheritance by right of return.</p>
      <p>I have been excluded as if an apostate and deserter of the orthodox religion (for so my Walliser friends have recently written back).</p>
      <p>Nor do I seem to be held by any hope by which I might ever be admitted. But even the thrice-great Brentius, with all hope cut off, despairs with me. But there is something else I wanted to discuss with you now. What is it, you ask? You know that so many excellent translations of the Bible have been published, such as those of the Zurichers, Vatablus, Castalio, etc., which could be nothing more delightful under heaven for candidates of theology and more useful for professors of sacred literature, if these were placed side by side in columns of four or five (for I wanted the Vulgate to be added to them for the sake of the obstinate papists). What could contribute more to the exact knowledge of sacred literature? I cannot be helped so much by many battalions of glossators on the Bible as by the various translations of the text. It cannot be said, I say, what these translations contribute to the mystics of sacred literature. But you, with your supreme erudition and that of your Zurichers, could easily accomplish this, as you have many other things, through your most illustrious printers. See, I beseech you, reverend Bullinger, whether you could not, by this industry alone, provide excellent counsel to your name and to our Switzerland, and to the entire Christian republic, if you would apply your mind to publishing these translations side by side in their columns (as in the Psalter, Campensis' translation of Zwingli is placed opposite). I call God himself to witness that nothing more delightful could happen to me in my life than this study of yours dedicated to this work. I therefore ask you to consider what needs to be done. We owe to our learned Swiss (even by the testimony of Luther himself, whose public support is available in this matter) the most excellent books of all, which come forth daily from Switzerland. But nothing greater could be offered by your city to the world. Then, with hardly any labor, they will be available to you, only that you be the author of this to the printer and adorn the work itself with a preface. Recently, Lord Valentin Vannius, the visitor of this duchy, while delivering a methodical exercise of the Gospels to his students (whom he has with him in his household) and examining the translations of the text more diligently, said, "I observe this study of examining the text more strictly among your Swiss. For they first of all weigh the text and translations and inquire and compare each thing more thoroughly. Almost all of Germany has this custom from the Zurichers."</p>
      <p>But even Wicelius himself, the most ardent defender of the papal kingdom, in a published booklet, requires a better translation of the Bible in the idioms of the holy language. For he writes thus: "There is no doubt, indeed, that the church, among so many other things, desires both the most faithful translation and the most correct interpretation of the sacred books of the Bible. We admire the vigils of Xantis Pagninus and Sebastian Munster as grateful readers."</p>
      <p>We expect the effort of Leo Jud, the Swiss, about which Conrad Pellicanus from Zurich recently wrote to me. Would that our Ulm Lucretius [Widmanstetter?] had so much free time from the court that he too could undertake something in the Bible, it would be a wonder if he were to be the last interpreter. For in this very Lucretius, our nation scarcely has a superior in every kind of languages and disciplines, etc. This he says in the prologue. But I know nothing of that Lucretius. Therefore, remember what I write. For you could never better place your studies than in this. I therefore ask again and again that you commend this study of yours to God and the church.</p>
      <p>But I also wanted something else, namely a complete index according to the alphabetical order in the six books of Claudius Ptolemy (after his maps). For who among the unlearned would know where Cana is in Ptolemy, celebrated for the wedding of Christ? Or the city of Naim, where life in Christ conquers death? But these things a more learned person might seek in the maps of Palestine. Come now, tell me, where will the city of Patras, noble for the martyrdom of Saint Andrew, be sought? Or where is Tagaste, the homeland of Saint Augustine, which Philip Melanchthon in his declamation on Saint Augustine claims to be called Thebesta by Ptolemy, not far from Madaurus. But who would find all these things unless worn out by long study of searching through all six books in the maps of Ptolemy? However, these could be arranged in alphabetical order with very little labor by even a slightly learned person in your school, so that all the places, sites, and regions of proper names in Ptolemy could be found immediately with this labor. The whole world owes much to our Switzerland for the restoration of the excellent arts of all philosophy. Therefore, it should also owe this, so that with this index, the entire Ptolemy, an incomparable author otherwise, would be made more suitable and convenient for use even by the unlearned. It does indeed have an index, but only of the most notable names added by Munster.</p>
      <p>I confess that some very learned people do not need Ptolemy much, nor, I would say, an index so exquisitely collected for him. But for the less learned, like people of my sort, this labor would be beneficial. I therefore ask and beseech your kindness to also consider in this place what is in the interest of the humble students.</p>
      <p>The reverend Lord Brentius, our most esteemed teacher, was recently elected by our most illustrious prince to the position of provost of Stuttgart, in place of the nobleman who perished in this war, which our prince successfully waged against the Teutonic Order, and he still lives happily with his young wife, who is the most charming of all. Frechtius, however, is the ordinary lecturer in Tübingen. Now nine princes, including ours and the Duke of Bavaria, are said to have convened in the imperial town of Wimpfen near Heilbronn to consult on important matters and perhaps to settle the dispute between us Württembergers and the Teutonic lords. We breathe again and are better off from so many imperial assaults, after the eagle departed inferior to the rooster. May God grant him the spirit of a disturbed mind and enough of all kinds of unjust assaults, so that he forgets about us. Twice through him and his followers, I have been deprived of all my fortunes.</p>
      <p>Adam Bartholomaeus, your licentiate, still bravely maintains the interimistic profession in Ulm. Through him, I could live more comfortably, if I did not refuse to exchange the eternal for the perishable.</p>
      <p>If I did not fear that you would be ashamed or rather weary of me, I would more frequently send letters to you, so that even while you are in Zurich, you could more thoroughly learn all the news of our Germany, which is carried back and forth. But if you can bear me, I would like to be reminded of this by you. I hope to visit our Wallisers this summer, God willing, and I will visit you either passing through or returning.</p>
      <p>But since I have begun to write, I will write something more to my lord as a supplement, since I am poorly initiated in letters and inexperienced. The author of the dictionary apparatus not only appended a dictionary of words but also of things or names at the end, but this is very brief and not sufficiently complete. Hence, I instructed my son to complete it more fully, as you see many things added by him in the margins of the book. But since the margin could not contain all that needed to be added, he added this long register. But even so, not even half of it was completed by him. However, I wanted to send these things, which my son added in the book and register, to you only so that you might more easily recognize my plan of making such a dictionary. Therefore, if anyone among the learned, or even the semi-learned, in Zurich attempted to complete this dictionary of names in this manner, not to say to complete it, but to rewrite it entirely, they would have to take in hand that great dictionary of Doletus Stephanus or the Zurichers, so that they might only describe the examples of it. For example, the word "acuo" (to sharpen) collects many elegances from the associated names, which, however, should be placed before the examples, such as to sharpen: age, pen, whetstone, cruelty towards someone (Cicero), teeth, to incite someone to speak, iron, sickle, fury, sword, talent, industry, anger, youth to speak, tongue, millstone, art, leisure, hatred, to call to arms in a fight, prudence, someone's heart, solitude (Cicero in his duties), anxiety, to incite someone to anger, poison, voice. And truly. To each of these, add complete examples from Doletus Stephanus and others.</p>
      <p>Perhaps more names could be found in Doletus and others, to which this word "acuo" is attributed. These, however, will have to be diligently investigated.</p>
      <p>Such a dictionary, where names precede verbs, would be twice as useful as those dictionaries where verbs precede, which the author of the apparatus also admits in the prologue of the second part, that it would have been far more expedient if he had added examples to each name, than what he added only to the verbs.</p>
      <p>These things, reverend Bullinger, I wanted to write to you, not fearing the highest level of your erudition with a noisy hand. May God grant that you pay attention not to who writes to you, but to what is written. However, you will easily accomplish this, which I now advise about continuing the dictionary of names, even through some school supervisor. We have all been aided by your studies and labors, so why would you now finally reject the useful advice of a sworn Swiss and most grateful disciple? Johannes Godscalcus has beautifully collected the elegances of adverbs, conjunctions, and interjections in a booklet called "Observations of the Latin Language," printed in Cologne by Johann Gymnicus, which could be added to this of yours.</p>
      <p>I hear that Gervasius is now residing with the Bernese. I wrote to him. But he did not deign to respond to me. He is still plainly angry with me from the great movements of anger conceived from our former dispute. He considers this crime of mine to be expiated with sharp vengeance. Farewell, reverend Bullinger.</p>
      <p>There seems to be no biblical book left that has not been adequately interpreted by evangelical professors except the prophet Ezekiel (or perhaps Jeremiah as well). Would that we could be aided by your commentaries on this one too, as in other biblical books. Certainly, that obscure one would be worthy of an interpreter with some happy eloquence to unravel it.</p>
      <p>Your writings are also most pleasing to me; I kiss them as if they were from one of the few most learned. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given at Hedelfingen near Stuttgart. On the Saturday before Laetare in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Peter Venetscher, ecclesiastic of Württemberg. To the most sacred restorer or purifier of holy theology, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most sacred Antistes of the Swiss in Zurich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
