      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, it is not well with me either that you are wandering back and forth. You should not be unwilling to serve the young lords in other ways; but this wandering back and forth, where you have nothing to do, may be interpreted badly for you, especially by and from your ill-wishers.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter you know of, do what you can. I have also done my best so far; do not think that our loyalty will be blamed by anyone. Pray to God above, if it is His divine will, that He may further it.</p>
      <p>I thank you for your half lamb; it was well received; for our sister Elisabeth Füßlin came to visit, which was very dear and valuable to me. Heinrich and his family also came; they dined together in the evening and sent some to brother-in-law Walthart, thinking of you and Susanna, etc. Luci has taken everything to godmother Agatha's house, which I did not expect; but she sends it up. He says he does not know if he got a hare or not; for he did not bring one. Nor does he need to; for I have asked you before and still do, not to incur any costs. God be with you, Susanna, Elisabeth, and Regula. Not a word from France.</p>
      <p>Wednesday morning before daybreak, January 5, 1569. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
