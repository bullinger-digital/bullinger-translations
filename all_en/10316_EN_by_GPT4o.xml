After a proposed truce was rejected by the Reformed, the arbitration locations have agreed to settle the dispute without delay. The Reformed bailiff of Dorneck, Thomas Krepser, was to be replaced by a Catholic, but Krepser could not be driven out. Bern does not want to start a war but is prepared against an attack or passage. Zurich's restraint is not understood.</p>

      <p>Greetings, dear brother Heinrich.</p>
      <p>The evangelical cause in Solothurn is being severely slandered, as if they are rebels with violent hands, as they initially acted, also perjurers, and that they intended to murder the others, which they never had in mind. Both parties are stubborn. A truce was proposed, but the evangelicals did not want to agree. The arbitrators are divided: 5 places, Fribourg, Valais, the Bishop of Basel's envoys on one side, Zurich, Bern, Glarus, Biel, Basel, Mulhouse, Schaffhausen on the other side. I do not know where Isenhuet from Appenzell stands. The 5 places with their allies do not want to accept God's word at all, which is the cause of all the tension. Finally, the arbitrators have all come together to defend (settle) the matter of the rebellion, so that everyone can return home and to their own. We currently hold council and citizens with us for their sake. I do not know what will be decided. Burckard might tell you by word of mouth, if I can learn of it. In summary, those from Solothurn in the city do not want the gospel, neither in their city nor in the land. The evangelicals are remarkably active, but I fear they will be worn down by the negotiations. In Dorneck, the bailiff is Thomas Krepser, a capable evangelical from Solothurn, who was recently appointed. The people in the city have appointed a new bailiff, and when he wanted to ride up and demand the castle from Krepser, who did not want to do it because he was not obliged to, the other had to withdraw. Thus, Krepser remains in the castle of Dorneck with his support and good artillery, which has been there since the Galgenkrieg, and he has about 400 peasants. They will all pledge life and property to the evangelicals, of whom there are still about 1300 together. They can (are able to) without any need cut off (block) all the mills in the city. In summary: Either the evangelicals must stand firm in their faith and take the punishment, according to the arbitrators' decision, or I fear a strange war. Now our lords in the city and land have written to the Solothurners' actions, also their report, they do not want to start a war with anyone. But if they are attacked or their territory is forcibly passed through, everyone should be prepared. Everyone is well satisfied and well prepared. If the matter cannot be resolved, I think, though according to hearsay, the evangelicals will try their luck with those in the city, renounce, but promise peace to all peasants who return home from the city and sit quietly. I believe, if no one had intervened, it would have been settled long ago. You (I do not know what you are writing here and meaning, you should see in the alliance, you want to have explained to you, to hold the same in Solothurn) do not understand well and with little trust. Now I do not know what more to write. I await my messenger.</p>

      <p>B. H. yours, Continue in Corinthians. I return the booklet with the utmost gratitude. If only I had the one on providence.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
