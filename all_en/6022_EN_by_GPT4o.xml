      <p>I send back to you, my father, the letters of that brother from Basel and I am grateful to you for sharing them with me. Here, by the grace of God, we are well and continue in our usual manner.</p>
      <p>The conspirators from the Bernese territory have retreated into the Savoyard land. Of the captives, two have been beheaded, who persisted in the confession of their crime until death and otherwise died piously.</p>
      <p>The Lord will undoubtedly keep us safe as long as it serves His glory for this church, which Satan particularly attacks, to remain safe and intact.</p>
      <p>Our Calvin indeed struggles in his usual way with a host of illnesses, but now again he seems to me to have become somewhat stronger. Balduin again provokes us with another recently published collection of Cassander and his own medley for ecclesiastical traditions, to which we must necessarily respond. As I see it, I was too true a prophet to Castalio when I said that the Lord would soon avenge his blasphemies, although I do not wish to judge the dead. But from those letters, I am led to suspect that my booklet was received by that school as if I wanted to cast some infamy upon it; that thought never crossed my mind, and therefore, if you ever write to him, I ask that you make some mention of this matter, if you judge it appropriate to do so. Oh, that wretched old man, who could not even please the devil when he sold himself to him! Truly a dreadful judgment of God, which I wish all would notice and learn from!...</p>
