    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer has just learned from this messenger riding to Zurich. However, he has guests, so he can only write briefly. Bullinger's letter [not received] was delivered to him. Now he just wants to report that the council of Konstanz has been informed that Emperor [Charles V] expects from the cities that have submitted to him, among other things, that they will no longer enter into any alliances without his knowledge in the future.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Therefore, it seems sensible to Blarer that the Confederates, and especially the people of Zurich, write to the council of Konstanz that they have heard of this, can recognize the true intentions of the Emperor, and in the name of the old friendship with the people of Konstanz, would like to ask them not to make any concessions to the Emperor that would end this friendship and cause tensions with the Confederates. In return, the people of Zurich, and probably also the other Confederates, are always ready to stand by the people of Konstanz with advice and assistance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Such a letter could prevent the people of Konstanz from falling into the [Emperor's] trap. Blarer is very afraid that he will lead them to ruin with kind words.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blarer must break off.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [P.S.:] He will write more about this with the next messenger. He does not want to keep [the guests] waiting now.</p>

      <p>In great haste, I learn from this riding messenger. I have guests in the middle of it, so I can do nothing. Your letter has reached me well. I can say nothing this time, except that my lords have learned how the Emperor imposes some burdensome conditions on the cities he takes; among them also this, that they shall henceforth make no alliances with anyone without his knowledge, etc., and that a peace shall also be negotiated, in which this and other conditions shall be included.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, I thought it might not be useless if the Confederates, and especially now your lords of Zurich, had written to my lords and pointed out that they should prevent such things as now mentioned, and, since they can well assess to what end all this is aimed, and above all, if those of Konstanz should accept such peace and articles, that it would not only hinder future friendship, but also extinguish the old neighborliness brought so far, and thus would cause not insignificant harm to the city of Konstanz and to them, the Confederates, they could not refrain from reminding them of this, with a friendly request to consider all this diligently and not to agree to anything that might disrupt the goodwill between the Confederates and the city of Konstanz and cause bad neighborliness. If then they could at any time show them friendly will, good advice, and support, they would not spare it. And do not doubt, other fellow Confederates will be of the same mind, etc.</p>

      <p>Such a letter on this opinion might be good for many things, so that one does not rush into it. For I fear badly, badly, good words will cut our throats.</p>

      <p>I can no more. Forgive me. Dated December 29, in utmost haste. Ambrosius Blarer.</p>

      <p>Will write you more by the next messenger. Fear, I am delaying myself.</p>
      <p>To my especially trusted lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
