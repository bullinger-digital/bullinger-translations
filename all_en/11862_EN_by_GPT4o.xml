    <p xml:id="regest1">His conflict with [the party of the Chur Bishop Lucius Iter] has indeed been officially settled by the Gotteshausbund after hearing the accusation and defense, yet his opponents continue to attack him and attempt to push him [out of his pastoral office at the Chur Regulakirche]; does not expect these attempts to succeed unless the power of the opposing party continues to increase; asks for understanding for his actions, as he wanted to defend the honor of the Gospel and the freedom of the fatherland; sends Regelbirnen [cf. Grimm VIII 500], as these are rare [in Zurich].</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius to the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his S.</p>
      <p>Although I am reluctant to trouble you, most esteemed man, necessity compels me to be more bothersome to you than I would like. You have already understood my situation with the papists well enough, especially from Travers, a man more prudent than to omit anything that might be relevant. Thus, it is both resolved and unresolved, indeed resolved by our Gotteshausbund (House of God Alliance), which, after hearing the accusation and defense, settled the entire matter. The explanation of this settlement is somewhat lengthy, so I refrain from writing more at this time. However, since the legates of the House of God have not been severe enough on me according to the will of the papists, they persist in attacking me now in this way, now in that, and continually harass me, trying everything to expel me from here, which, I hope, they will not be able to do legally, unless their faction becomes stronger. Moreover, I hope to be more commendable to you than for anyone to be able to remove me from you for any reason, although I do not wish to argue with you - for who is wise at all times? - and I know well that we all err in many things. You know the cause of this error, namely, wanting to defend the glory of the Gospel and the freedom of the fatherland, etc. I send you some royal pears because of their rarity there. Farewell, most humane man, and allow me to be yours. From Chur, November 19, 1543. The same yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and most humane Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful bishop of the Zurich church, his most esteemed lord.</p>
