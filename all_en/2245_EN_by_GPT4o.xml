      <p>Behold, I have finally come to Augsburg, but I see well enough that the magistrate will not tolerate my lingering here much longer; for I am neither silent nor do I spend my time in idleness. If my prince arrives, then I will be safer at his home. Indeed, diets (meetings) are being prepared, that is, lodgings for the princes; but there are still those who think they should not be held; but we will see this shortly. I will return to TÃ¼bingen next week, if the Lord wills. Here there are many Schwenkfeldians, more than anywhere else. The Gospel is preached purely, and certainly the ministers are doing a good job, especially Meccardus, and he fights vigorously against heresies. There are many who have good opinions about the Eucharist, but most dissemble; for they think the other way is safer regarding the flesh. The only son of Duke August, the elector, has died, and he himself is laid low by a dangerous illness. It is openly stated that the Brandenburgian has returned to favor with the King of France, which pleases all those here who love the freedom of Germany. Keep this one thing secret, which I will now say: at the recent assembly of princes, it was discussed how the imperial proscription or ban against the Margrave of Brandenburg should be executed, and the matter was left unresolved. But shortly another assembly will be convened on the same matter.</p>
      <p>I have finally obtained the book I have long sought, namely that of Cardinal Pole, the Englishman, for the papacy. It was indeed printed in Rome, but it was not for sale anywhere and was only granted to staunch papists. No book was written against our doctrine that was either more cunning or more eloquent. In the third book (for there are four books), there is inserted a speech to the Emperor, in which he calls us Turks and strives to persuade him to act against us with arms. I have given this excerpt to the brothers in Augsburg, and shortly it will be spread throughout Germany; indeed, I will print this separately adorned with notes, and thus the prince of hypocrites will find the minds of the good prepared if he comes to the diet.</p>
      <p>Not long after, I will take care to have the whole book printed with notes and will add Luther's booklet on the papacy and the Antichrist by Rudolf Gwalther, and what you have written on Matthew 16 and the last of John, and what the rest of our countrymen have written, and I hope you will see everything before they are published. Farewell and be well. Pray for me, who is perpetually laboring, and for you, Heinrich Bullinger, who loves you sincerely. I bid all the brothers to be well.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, March 30, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
