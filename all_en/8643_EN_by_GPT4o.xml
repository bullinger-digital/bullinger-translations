      <p>God be with us. Since this messenger is being sent to you, beloved son, I wanted to write with him and remind you, as you last saw me and said, you have arranged to send me both of my books of the chronicles; you may do so with this messenger, if it is possible due to the rain or if you can keep them safe, etc. I suppose you will be invited to the wedding this Monday. If so, you might bring with you what I lent you for the short term. Now I am sending you the written comfort, transcribed for the sake of Mrs. Selkelmeister; you may copy it within a month and send it back to me. Herewith I have included a very beautiful and useful printed booklet on the authority of scripture and the church, which I urge you to read diligently and quickly. By the grace of God, things are well with us; may God also grant you and yours all good things. From Italy, Cyserius, who first came out, says that John of Austria, the illegitimate brother of Philip, has arrived in Genoa with many galleys; there he disembarked the two sons of Maximilian joyfully, so that they may go to the wedding of Charles in Vienna; but he has immediately traveled with the fleet to Naples, where in Spezia and Naples a large number of soldiers and the landsknechts, who came in the summer, are gathered.</p>
      <p>All of this is being put together on the ships, so that they may forcefully sail to Africa and take the war there. They intend to go to Algiers again; they promise themselves certain victory; that is still uncertain. Also, 100 Turkish ships have surrounded 60 Venetian ships, if they do not escape, they will not be able to hold back, etc. I have nothing more or further at this time.</p>
      <p>God be with you, Susanna, Elisabeth, and all of you; all my people greet you.</p>
      <p>Thursday, August 23, 1571.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
