      <p>Not so many months ago, I wrote to your magnificence, and at the same time, I also sent a copy of the confession of faith and doctrine of the Swiss churches, printed and bound, and I hope your magnificence has received all of it. All the churches of France, England, Scotland, and other nations have subscribed to our confession; I also hope that it will not be disapproved by your piety, especially in those matters about which I now hear there are great disputes in Poland and especially in Lithuania, concerning the mystery of the Trinity and the true divinity of the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ. Our confession contains what is necessary to believe about these matters. For what purpose is it to investigate more and higher things than sincere religion admits? Indeed, God (as He Himself testified to Moses) no one will see and live. When we finally migrate from here and our souls are deemed worthy to behold God, and our bodies are glorified, then we will see God, as the scripture testifies, as He is. While we live in this life, we perceive those sacred mysteries as through clouds, as Paul the man and according to our measure. And the prophets and apostles have handed them down with such simplicity and purity, which is necessary to believe about these things, that no one can complain about obscurity, and those who inquire more curiously deserve to be overwhelmed by glory and finally not know what they believe. This is what happens today to more curious investigators than is beneficial to them.</p>
      <p>What indeed is simpler than what the prophetic and apostolic scripture hands down, that there is one God, not two or three or more, and yet this one true God is called not only the Father, but the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Yet, because we hear three, we do not therefore believe there are three gods; for the scripture, to which we must adhere with sincere faith, clearly says both three and one. For John says: "And these three, he says, are one," and the Son himself: "I and the Father are one," he says, and because he says, "I am," not "I am not." In that unity, certainly, every property of the person is also clearly asserted. For the Father sends the Son, but the Son is sent, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from both.</p>
      <p>What then is clearer than that he is not the Son nor is this the Father? For the Father was not incarnate and suffered for us, but the Son, meanwhile in that divine essence and unique and indivisible nature, the Son is not divided and torn away or something different from the Father, since it is clearly said in John 5 that the Son is coequal with the Father and he also says to the disciples: "You believe in God, believe also in me."</p>
      <p>Philip, who sees me, sees the Father. And again: "That all may honor the Son, as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him." What indeed is simpler than this Catholic truth? Namely, that there is one God in essence, three in persons; for thus the Latin church has spoken from the very times of the apostles, and these expressions have been taken from the very faith and rule of faith, the holy scripture, so that those who reject those words should not be listened to. Again, what is more tortuous and dangerous, and more curious than to want to investigate higher things and about these divine mysteries, about which the scripture speaks no differently and no more in summary, to introduce new expressions or those once used by heretics, but meanwhile condemned kinds of doctrine about these things. But many such people wander today, who disturb the churches and subvert the true faith of many. From these, I pray, most merciful prince, guard yourself as from a deadly plague; I pray, do not listen to such innovators. For when heard, they wound consciences, inject various scruples into minds, lead away from true simplicity and tranquility, whence soon arise wounds of the soul, fears, doubts, disputes, finally such depravity that one does not know where to turn or what to believe, and is perpetually vexed by the mockeries of Satan.</p>
      <p>Beware, beware for yourself, most excellent prince. I love your piety from the innermost depths of my soul and fear, knowing that those fanatical men roam all corners, lest they also aspire to harm your mind, which is still well aware and tranquil.</p>
      <p>Although again, I am consoled by that ingenuousness of your magnificence and that singular candor, with which I have learned you are adorned by the grace of God with not a few nor contemptible arguments at the time when you lived with us in Zürich. I therefore pray to the Lord, that He may keep your piety in the true and simple confession of orthodox faith, in which alone is certain salvation, and preserve you from all evil and especially from... the corruption and torture of conscience and the impostures of those men. I also ask your humanity, most merciful prince, that you may consider these my letters, written as God knows, from sincere charity and my exceedingly singular zeal towards your magnificence, most excellently, and hold me commended, who otherwise am most ready to serve your magnificence most willingly and faithfully.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, most excellent prince.</p>
      <p>Zürich, August 14, 1567.</p>
      <p>May all who were with your magnificence in Zürich be safe in the Lord. Dr. Josias Simler is struggling with very high fevers, Dr. Johannes Wolph is bathing in Baden; both send their most dutiful greetings to your humanity. Other brothers and fellow ministers also greet you, Dr. Gwalther, Lavater, Haller, etc. Wickius, Zwingli.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Johannes Kessler, Palatine of Wittenberg, etc., my most merciful lord.</p>
