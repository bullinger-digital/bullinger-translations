      <p>Greetings. Regarding that supplication, which you know, I will say nothing else, except that I judge it in the same way as you do, without any dissimulation. Your judgment was easy to gather from some of your previous letters.</p>
      <p>For who can endure that more than Sorbonic arrogance? They occupy everything with their prejudices and dare to assume for themselves what they have hitherto been unwilling to grant to the Roman pontiff and his councils. Ah ah, how they scatter, how they tear apart these ill-behaved men, the Church of Christ, so that now the dangers hanging over the faithful of Christ from these professors of the gospel are not a little greater than from the most papist papists. Therefore, let our sighs continually penetrate the heavens and intercede with Christ, that He may vindicate His bride, who is uniquely dear to Him, from these evils that are more and more gathering, and may He preserve her, bound in the bonds of solid peace, in the unity of the spirit forever. As for what you wrote to the most illustrious princes of Württemberg and the Landgrave, I hope you have done so successfully! Of this, certainly, my mind holds good hope, that he has always kept himself whole in such controversies and is of no ordinary judgment; but as for the other, I do not see what you can hope for, with whom the authority of Brenz is great and sacrosanct. This man, who is to be revered and respected for many other reasons, and endowed with singular prudence, is so foolish in this matter and more superstitious than many others, that I greatly fear for the prince from him, especially since his wife has been more than sufficiently steeped in this leaven from childhood, following in the footsteps of her parent. I am sending you a pasquinade or rather a satire on the new papacy, which my brother recently received from our Laetus and promised to send to me, but especially to you, if it seems worthy to you to be published. Therefore, having read it with our happy poet and chief friend Gwalther, whose judgment I greatly value in this kind of writing, send it back as soon as possible, but not without your judgment, which my brother, who has not yet read the whole, eagerly awaits. As for my Constance, love me as you did before the 9th of the calends of September; yesterday, indeed, I was entirely of the mind to write to you about those things which you anticipated by sending them to me to read, except that I also hear that an Italian, in the name of the pontiff, is performing a legation with the bishop of Laibach and Bolwiler. I hear, however, that the Constanzian Mezler, with the canons, can be induced by neither threats nor prayers to resign that impious bishopric, although there are those who think that with the most splendid promises and persistent importunity they may finally achieve their desires; we will await the outcome from the Lord. As for what some whisper about a council being held there, if it is true, I will plainly understand that the measure of the fathers, who in the previous council marked the city with fire, which burned several holy martyrs of Christ, as with a cautery, will be filled and overflowed, which now, after being illuminated by the light of the gospel and as if exalted to the heavens, but nevertheless was most ungrateful, will be cut down to the roots, giving deserved penalties to the Lord, who will nevertheless rescue His own, led out in His own way, with His strong hand and will preserve them eternally.</p>
      <p>From the fragment of Hoser's letter, which I send here, you will easily understand the state of our Schenck's case; thus the works of the dark ones flee the light. You also receive Tilemann's sermon with two sheets sent by Hoser. If you have not yet seen the booklet of Philipp, which Hoser mentions, let me know, and you will receive it with the next message; it contains responses to the impious articles of the Bavarian inquisition, printed in 1559 in Wittenberg.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother in the Lord, with your domestic church, with whom commend me and mine to the Savior Christ in perpetual prayers without ceasing. Greet all the brothers and friends who love us in Christ.</p>
      <p>Ah, my soul, when we see in this delirious old age of the world greater confusions and lacerations arising daily in the churches of Christ, let us be vigilant with the utmost zeal at the throne of grace, asking with constant groans and prayers that the best and most faithful shepherd Christ may govern and preserve His little flock, among whom we are. Certainly, extreme dangers are imminent over the heads of mortals, and soon the wrath of God will be revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness, and the fury will be for the patience of God, which has been offended so many times.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore urge serious repentance, wherever we can, if perhaps we may gain some for the Lord, extracted from that immense whirlpool of evils. May He always make your ministry in His house, as He certainly does, eloquent and fruitful by His spirit! Farewell again. Winterthur, 5th of the calends of August 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>What I send, you will soon return except for the pasquinade or satire, which you may keep a little longer, to be returned later with your judgment. I commend to you Jacob Mezler, the son of Bartholomäus Mezler, my former colleague, of better note and as much as I can, so that some suitable condition may be provided for him, as he walks with difficulty. He is a pious and not at all unlearned young man, who now sends his confession formula to Herter. His father was a faithful and very much beloved minister of the church of Constance.</p>
