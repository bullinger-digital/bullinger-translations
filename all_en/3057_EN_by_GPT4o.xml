      <p>Greetings. You feel the same about the Bavarian matter as I do; it is a new trick of Satan, so that under the pretext of the vernacular language, impiety is concealed and thus causes more harm. But this mask will be exposed just as the Interimistic was a little while ago. The Diet of Regensburg is said to be proceeding; for Ferdinand has promised his arrival at the end of November and urgently exhorts the electors and others to appear, especially the Elector Palatine, because he wishes to confer with him privately on great matters. The Livonian and Bruttian wars have been settled; but military preparations are meanwhile great and in various places. The people of LÃ¼beck are being attacked in a hostile manner by certain pirates, who are supplied with aid from elsewhere. Rostock, however, is troubled by the Duke of Mecklenburg due to some unusual exactions or others along the Baltic Sea. The Duke of Brunswick is assembling a proper army of cavalry and infantry; but where he intends to go is unknown, and everything seems to point to uprisings, which the prodigious ingratitude of the world deserves, abusing the good of peace to such a degree of license. We, who could have lived securely at home, are invited by a small amount of money to seek wars elsewhere and bring upon our heads and those of our descendants the guilt of blood. We are held captive by a poorly made treaty, and many are enticed by the insane desire for war; you might say that most have sworn to their own destruction.</p>
      <p>Farewell well in Christ Jesus with all yours. Basel, on the calends of December, in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
