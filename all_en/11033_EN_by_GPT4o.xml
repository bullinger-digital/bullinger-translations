    <p xml:id="regest1">After reading the letters from Bullinger, Bucer, and Vadian [Nr. 981], he is on one hand impressed by the clear stance of Bullinger and Vadian, and on the other hand affected by their distrust towards Bucer, whom he fully trusts and who, as a mediator, could not have acted otherwise. It is in the nature of the matter that a mediator stands between the parties and therefore easily falls into disrepute. Since he does not fully belong to any party, he is - like Christ and his followers - easily seen as a deceiver, even though he is committed to the truth. The fear [of the Swiss] of being deceived is unfounded; it also shows that the dispute is not so much about the matter itself. Anyone who wants to mediate cannot claim that the same thing has always been taught on the Zwinglian side; rather, at the beginning of the conflict, the distinction from the false teachings of the Pope and Luther was decisive. Due to the then rapprochement with those who see the Lord's Supper only as a memorial meal, the mediator now had to - as Zwingli himself did - emphasize the importance of the sacraments in return; furthermore, he had to justify allowing an interpretative response to the articles [of the Wittenberg Concord] presented for signing. Gryn√§us vouches for Bucer, who values the Zurichers no less than the Baselers and has gained Luther's goodwill for them; keeps the matter to himself and speaks only with Myconius about it. Plans a spa treatment. Asks to show the letter to Vadian, Theodor [Bibliander], and Leo [Jud] and to send it back afterwards.</p>

      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I have read your letter, as well as those from Bucer and Vadian, not only carefully but repeatedly. I am greatly pleased by your faith and steadfastness in the cause of Christ, which both of you believe that no offense is so great that it should deter you from the truth of the Christian republic you have set forth. I thank God the Father through Christ that there is now such excellent strength everywhere, which can certainly oppose not only flesh and blood but also the wickedness of Satan. Let this be the true consolation of the church, as the Lord grants us such hearts. On the other hand, I am greatly disturbed that he, who has labored above all for concord in every matter, and has exposed his name, reputation, and everything to danger, and has truly become all things to all people to reconcile the church's dissension, has come into such grave suspicion among such distinguished men. Therefore, my mind is greatly troubled. The Lord Christ is my witness that nothing could happen today that would shake my mind more, as I rightly consider the state of the church. What then do you want me to write to you, my dear Bullinger? I see that this opinion is firmly fixed in you. As for Bucer, I feel thus, and I am confirmed by his most holy and solemn protestation and oath, which he recently used so gravely before all the Swiss envoys, that I believe this man acts in good faith in the whole cause and does not plot anything sinister, especially against us. Therefore, having long considered this very letter with myself, I believe that Bucer would not have changed one iota if he had hoped that it would reach you, so inevitable do the things written here seem to me, in this cause and at this time, and from that mediator.</p>
      <p>I beg you by the Lord, most candid heart Bullinger, while I say these things to you, that you will bear with me for a little while according to your custom. Nothing is more similar to slipperiness and treachery than to act as a mediator among dissenters. For there were laws somewhere that thought this kind of person, who in civil contention does not rightly and openly follow one side, should be expelled as treacherous and slippery. While we did not sufficiently attend to the force of this matter, we have almost fallen into the same suspicion about Bucer from both sides since the beginning of this concord. He has almost lost all faith, even among his own, by acting. But he who is in the middle, Bullinger, is neither of the extremes and yet both kinds in every dealing by the law of nature, so that, though it lacks a name and is in no place of things, it nevertheless has the most excellent and necessary force, a prodigy and monster among men, neither true nor false among the true and false, neither friend nor enemy among friends and enemies. See, such is the nature of this matter. When one party says "no" and the other "yes," and each says what it says explicitly, what will the mediator say, I ask? "The same yes and no." Behold the monster of a man, behold a man blowing hot and cold from the same mouth, lukewarm, that is; behold, unless you rightly observe his nature, an impudent impostor. But what will you do? He is in the middle and necessarily says both.</p>
      <p>Again, when each party is greatly persuaded about itself and it is necessary for them as dissenters to oppose, if we alone hold the truth, they alone err, what will the mediator say? "You hold the truth, they do not" will he say? By no means; he is no longer in the middle, but an extremist if he says this. "They hold the truth, you do not" - this too is extreme. Marvelous straits, marvelous ingenuity of middle things: It is neither air nor fire, but a warm vapor. It is neither water nor earth, but a thick vapor, a mist, smoke. In sum, you would call it imposture. But this is the glue of the nature of the mediator, reducing itself from the monstrous strife of the elements to the concord and equality of the world and succoring its own laws. He who placed himself as a mediator between the best and the worst, the whole matter was immediately monstrous by its very condition and nature, was a man-god by nature, soon dead by this name as an impostor and cast on the cross. Then men following in his footsteps, not only because they opposed the world but because they became all things to all people, were also considered by all as impostors. "What then," you will say, "will you make a prevaricator out of a mediator, a deception out of mediation, and will he who is in the middle have only a poorly mended favor between the parties, not also the truth proposed?" By no means, Bullinger; far be it. That mediation in nature has only the truth proposed, so that some state may be made for the elements. But while it is in the middle, it is in no state itself, and it is not truly, but it begins to be and ceases to be.</p>
      <p>I beg you to recall your mind a little to the contemplation of this matter. Certainly, the matter itself is more sacred, the parties more circumspect, the thing done longer and among more witnesses, than that deception could be made here, however there are some who, while they are too wise and wish to see too acutely, think they see deception when they cannot look at the truth, that is, the nature of this matter. These are the snares of those men, namely the detection of treacherous letters. They have detected themselves, Bullinger, certainly not the matter and the thing. For I wish to appeal here to your conscience - I mean yours and Vadian's, wise men - whether the dissension and conflict have been fiercer in minds and studies, or in the matter and cause. I say more in minds than in the matter and cause. For I see how this contention flared up, when one cursed the other as a certain plague of the church, both of whom we know by the same conscience of yours to have been distinguished and good men. And this had happened to them. What would not happen to us little men?</p>
      <p>Suppose the contention still grows; suppose a man of the most suitable character is provoked to you, to Vadian. What, I ask, will Bullinger as a mediator say about his own to Luther? "Our people have never erred in this cause, they always think rightly as they now teach, they are led by no affection here." Would you say this there? Suppose it is truly said; but how does the mediator say this? How with this party? Zwingli himself would not say it if he were alive. Luther certainly now at last often confesses that he has been carried away beyond the heat of contention and, slightly reducing the heat of his fire, begins to approach the middle air. The greatest injustice in this letter, I think, is that it is not always taught by our people. If you look at Bucer's position, it has nothing at all outside the nature of the matter; if you look at the thing, I think and believe you can easily see what it is. Certainly, the first contention and conflict was only about what was not here, not what was here. Indeed, all the machines aimed at refuting the errors of the Pope and Luther, who were establishing something gross and intolerable to the truth here, from which we also gave the appearance as if we were leaving nothing at all. Therefore, the whole first conflict for us was in denying. How then did we not teach the same at the beginning, who did not even touch upon what we now teach and profess at the beginning? Nor do I deny that we have always established the same thing that we now teach; certainly, we have not always taught the same, nor did the zeal of contention allow it, which was entirely in refuting and restraining the adversary.</p>
      <p>Then we certainly took up the parts of those and joined our forces with theirs, who left nothing at all in the supper except a certain shadowy memory, although not in the opinion they held. Therefore, it should not seem so grave when it is said by a mediator with a party, which can be said truly without our injury. For when our most distinguished leaders, the hero Zwingli and the excellent man Oecolampadius, felt the same as we now profess and nothing else, yet they did not teach exactly the same. For the contention did not allow it, and if they taught, certainly what they wrote bore that more than this. For you see, my Bullinger, how diligently Zwingli, a divine man, treated the sacraments in his own little book, wishing to insinuate that he felt more augustly than many thought, and to remove that suspicion from himself and to render the most august signs of the church. Add that beyond the nature and marvelous ingenuity of this matter, another great necessity surrounded Bucer in these last assemblies. The articles were presented naked by Luther as a Lydian stone for exploring our opinion. Thus, Luther's party wanted a naked and straightforward response. What did the mediator do? He neither offered them naked nor returned a naked response. He knew that the naked ones were not tolerable for us, so he added a long gloss. "Oh, falsifier! Thus Luther had not ordered. He adds an interpretation against the order of the other party with the other, and that diffuse and, as much as possible, alluding to our senses. Oh, circumlocutions," you will say, "and trifles!" But if he had acted straightforwardly, we would have long since burst apart, and there would have been no place for action. Therefore, when we responded to his articles in such a way that his implicit interpretation was in our response, two great things had to be excused to Luther: both why he had allowed the interpretation and why he had received a response other than simple. Suppose you were sent, Bullinger, how would you excuse both things there? What would you say? "Indeed, Luther, our republic does not hear us so immediately. The whole people is involved in the deliberation. They fear everything, lest they be deceived by trickery; they cry out that we are plotting defection. The name and sweet memory of Zwingli, an excellent man, is so great that even to hear someone who seems to dissent in the least is considered a crime." You would certainly say many such things and pray to Luther to consider the weakness of men.</p>
      <p>But that which Vadian thinks we are preferred to you is otherwise if you read the place correctly. He speaks of the people, not of the ecclesiastics. And certainly, our people here have heard more often about concord than yours. In other respects, the letter contains nothing but the fullest encomiums of your nation and learned men. And you see the goodwill of Luther, which if it is not through Bucer, I do not see how Bucer could have been tolerable to that man for six whole years. But I beseech you, through Jesus Christ, to do diligently what most illustrious and wise men do, that we may resist the wiles of Satan with united forces. I, as I once did, if there is any grain of truth in me, pledge to you for Bucer. Be assured, I say nothing to him about this matter; I only communicate everything with Myconius. I will go, I think, to the baths due to my poor health. You will pray to the Lord that I may not offend anyone by my example.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Please let Vadian, Theodor [Bibliander], and Leo [Jud] read the letters, and send them back to me.</p>
      <p>Your Simon Grynaeus.</p>
