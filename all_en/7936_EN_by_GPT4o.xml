      <p>Four days ago, I wrote this letter, signed by order of the lady mother, who said she had a messenger who would be going to ZÃ¼rich. But the woman left without saying goodbye to me. What she might have committed, I do not know. Hence, I have entrusted this to Egidius to be delivered. We have heard nothing in these few days, except that the rumor is spreading that Mr. von Heideck has fallen in a minor skirmish; but I think it is false. You know how rumor is a bad thing, and it thrives on mobility and gains strength as it goes, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. July 27.</p>
      <p>Yours, Matthias Erb.</p>
