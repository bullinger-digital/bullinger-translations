      <p>The one who will deliver this letter to you, whom I wish to be most recommended to you, whom I hope you will receive most kindly as usual, whom I most sweetly desire you to recognize and embrace as a brother in the Lord, is Mr. Michael Dillen, who is so solidly learned and thoroughly imbued with the fear of God; he is or was the most vigilant pastor of no small flock of the Lord, which is held in Speyer. He is most loving and respectful towards you, he is by far the dearest to me, and finally, he is so agreeable to me in all things that, lest you have two Lelios there at the same time, I will delay my return to you until after his return to us. There will also be another with him named Jacob, a man entirely honest and not at all unlearned; if he should need your help in any matter, I beseech you, assist him, although I have given him letters to Mr. Gasner, whom I do not doubt will diligently take care of his business. The third is Mr. Wilhelm Plank; he is the teacher of our Polish lord, he has recently become a very dear friend to me, whom I wished you would love, and now I congratulate you on having loved him for a long time.</p>
      <p>I also commend, if in this way he could be loved more fervently, the one who has hitherto been most beloved, and what else do you see, while I so confidently implore your favor for others, how greatly I have found him favorable to me and hence how much and in how many ways I feel myself obliged to you, most illustrious man. May God support you and yours forever.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 3, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most respectful Lelio Sozzini.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in doctrine and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, always to be respected. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
