      <p>Pious, honorable, etc. My willing service and all good things beforehand. Your letter has been delivered to me by Caspar.</p>
      <p>In response, knowing that many letters are coming, yet all contradicting each other. What we have here, you have enclosed herein. However, many are coming, the summary of which: the Rhinegraves are leading to the king with 3000 horses, the Duke of Zweibrücken with 4000 horses and 2 regiments of foot soldiers. Aumale is waiting for the Rhinegrave with a train, wants to join him and hurry to France. The Prince of Orange is said to be ready and asked to join the Count with all his might, is said to have arrived at Saint-Quentin a few days ago and is hurrying. I have nothing more at this time. Consider the short writing as good; I also do not want more. It is true that 500 of Aumale's men were slain, who were moving down from Montbéliard; they were ambushed at night by 4000 shooters. There were 800 foot soldiers and 200 horses; the commander is captured, etc.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given on December 10, 1568.</p>
      <p>Greet my good lords and friends.</p>
      <p>Yours.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable lord Joachim Bäldi, former Landammann of Glarus, my kind, dear lord.</p>
      <p>Glarus.</p>
