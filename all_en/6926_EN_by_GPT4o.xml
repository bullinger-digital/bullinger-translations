      <p>Greetings in abundance.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday, right after the sermon, a well-spoken gentleman with a companion and three servants came to my house, greeted me, and said that through the diligent reading of my books, he had given up the papacy and accepted Christ Jesus as his head and savior, etc. He wanted to make acquaintance with me so that if he wrote to me, I would respond, etc. And after I gave him some replies, I asked him where he was from. He said: "From Antwerp. And what is your name?" Albertus Nonius[?], and Nonius the elder, counselor of Charles V and Philip, was my father. "Where are you going?" To Antwerp, to my home. "Where are you coming from?" From Italy, from Bologna, where I studied, also in other places in Italy. I left my homeland because of the situation and found the devil in Italy." Was he not afraid to go to Antwerp, since Philip was at sea and wanted to cross over Antwerp? He answered: "King Philip has much to do in Spain, and the power of the white Moors is so great that he will not come out of Spain at this time, and it is not the time to sail. There is nothing to it. In Italy, they know nothing about it. But I heard it in these lands when I came over the mountains. If he were to suffer a mishap, he would lose his kingdom. Therefore, his counselors do not advise him in these dangerous times. My people have called me home, indicating that they have a lasting peace with the estates of the House of Burgundy and that God's word is read to them as in France. Therefore, I trust the matter well and am hurrying home. I will help as much as I can," etc. Thus he spoke. Now, how much you attribute to this, I leave to your judgment. To me, he seemed to be an excellent and truthful man. Farewell.</p>
