    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Birck cannot explain how he has earned Bullinger's goodwill and the greetings that their mutual friends Georg Frölich and Johannes Haller have conveyed to him several times. He is grateful for it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He only learned late about the return journey of the pastors Lorenz Meyer, Rudolf Schwyzer, and Thoman Ruman to Zurich, otherwise he would have sent letters with them for the other Zurichers Konrad Pellikan, Rudolf Gwalther, Konrad Gessner, Johannes Wolf, etc. Greetings to them. Bullinger should remain well-disposed towards him.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Our mutual friends, Frölich and Haller, venerable father, have conveyed your greetings to me several times, and they did so not less dutifully than familiarly; from which I gather your singular goodwill towards me, which I cannot account for how I have deserved. However, I do not place it in the least part of my happiness. For I judge that there is nothing more excellent in human affairs than the goodwill and favor of the best people.</p>

      <p>Your apostles, undoubtedly good men, are returning to you, whom I love sincerely, yet I confess I have rendered them no service. They prepared their departure beyond my expectation; otherwise, I would have written to my other friends in Zurich, to Master Pellikan, Gwalther, Gessner, Wolf, etc., to whom, I beseech you, convey my dutiful greetings and continue to favor Sixtus, as you have begun. Farewell. Augsburg, 9th October 1546. Sixtus Betuleius, your most devoted.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, well-deserving Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his master and friend, with the highest respect.</p>
