    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius received two letters from Bullinger on July 17 [not preserved]; the last written was delivered in the morning by [Ulrich] Hugwald, the first written in the evening by [John] Burcher. The [handwritten] notes [of the speech that the delegation] from Pope [Paul III] [gave at the Baden Diet] greatly annoyed Myconius. The letter from the Pope addressed to the Swiss bishops and abbots also testifies to his unscrupulousness!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- It is said that the recall of the [Swiss] mercenaries [from German service] has been decided. If only they would not obey, especially since they have a good reason! If the cities [of the Schmalkaldic League] counted on the Swiss, they will be disappointed. But perhaps they don't think much of the Swiss anyway, just like the Imperialists. They mock the Swiss who went to Picardy and died there: The latter have made many cows widows! While drinking, the [Germans] joke about how many Swiss they could take on. In the Freiburg [i. Br.] region, it is particularly bad. They are imitating their prince [Emperor Charles V]. If he [defeats the Schmalkaldic League], one can imagine what consequences the hatred against the Swiss would have for them. Even the Emperor could do nothing about it, but of course, he doesn't want to.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Myconius asked Heinrich Lüthi in a letter, along with his colleagues and the community [Winterthur], to pray for harmony among the Swiss. Without it, the [Swiss Confederation] is doomed!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The day before, [Emanuel], the son of [Matthias Bomhart], the innkeeper "Zur Krone," told a dubious story. He had seen in Constance the messenger [...] who brought the following written message: The huge sum of money that the Pope has made available for the war is said to have reached Landsberg [am Lech]. [Sebastian] Schertlin then surrounded the city and threatened with a violent takeover. However, the [Landsbergers] claimed that the gold was not with them and also emphasized that their sovereign [Wilhelm of Bavaria] was keeping peace. As a result, the population was so frightened by artillery for one night that they promised Schertlin everything. He left with 30 tons of gold and several thousand ducats.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings to [Rudolf] Gwalther. Bullinger should share verified news. There is no news from Lower Germany.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [P.S.:] Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg is said to have called his brother [Count] Georg of [Württemberg] to him, and his [court] believes that he wants to make him the army leader. May the Lord protect his church!</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received all your letters on July 17th, the later ones written in the morning delivered by Hugwald, the earlier ones written in the evening by Burcher. The summary of the Pope's speech greatly annoyed me. The most desperate men dare to take the name of the Lord, our God, whom they attack, into their mouths. May they be gone and perish! The letter to the bishops and abbots, whom he calls the Swiss Church, is so confident and imperious (as if there is not a single scruple in the heart of the beast that would trouble him even a little, and I believe his conscience is easily dead with leprosy!), it is no wonder he writes and acts in this way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I hear that the recall of the soldiers has been decreed. If only the Lord would instill courage so that no one obeys! They have a good, honest, divine cause, against which, in my view, there is no need to comply with the orders. If the cities had any hope in us, the recall would not be successful, unless perhaps there are those who bear the same attitude towards Switzerland as all the Imperialists do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>They mock us, despise us, curse us, and contaminate us with the most shameful words and songs. They say: "The Swiss went to Picardy. They have made many cows widows. Then they died there. Many cows have become widows." Even today, they do this over drinks in their usual manner: "I bring you one, two, three Swiss. What will you do to the first? What to the second? What to the third?" etc. In short: There is no end to such insults. Around Freiburg, these are most frequent, and our leaders follow their example! If victory inclines to him (which the Lord forbid), what do we think will follow from such immense hatred against us? Not even he, if he wanted, could prevent it - but the insolent, impious, and ambitious spirit will not want to. I wrote to M. Heinrich Lüti in passing, to encourage the brothers and the church to pray for the concord of the Swiss in this cause. For if we obtain that from the Lord, there is no need to fear. If not, I truly fear it is over for us.</p>

      <p>I will tell a story I heard yesterday, certainly presented and likely true. However, I am forced to doubt its truth. The author is the son of our citizen, the innkeeper of the sign of the Crown, who says he saw in Constance a messenger who brought letters about this matter. The Pope is said to have sent a huge amount of gold for this war. It is said to have reached Landsberg (I believe it is called Landsberg). After Schertlin learned of this, he hurried there with all his troops and surrounded the town, demanding that they hand over the guests and the gold.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>If they handed them over, they would be safe; otherwise, he would attempt and inflict violence. The townspeople first denied having anything; their prince was at peace; they therefore asked him to leave. Upon hearing the response, he immediately brought in the cannons and so disturbed the townspeople throughout the night without interruption, that with raised hands they sought peace, promising to give everything they had. He accepted the offer and left in peace. The gold is said to have been transported in two wagons: 30 tons of gold and several thousand ducats. I write this as I receive it, etc.</p>

      <p>Farewell with yours and Gwalther. If you have anything more certain, let me know. From Lower Germany, not a word. Basel, July 23, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>It is certain that the Duke of Württemberg has called his brother Georg to him. And his people think that he intends to appoint him as the leader of the army he is gathering. May the Lord protect his church and make his word go forth into all the earth for his glory! Amen.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger in his Lord.</p>
