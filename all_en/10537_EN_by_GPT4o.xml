    <p xml:id="regest1">It is certainly known to Bullinger that in [Thurgau] the power lies with the opponents of the Reformation, and he will have heard of the persecutions. He recommends his brother-in-law Hans Sunnenmann, who was forced into exile due to statements that allegedly violated the Landfrieden treaty, and asks for help for him. There is much talk about war preparations, and there are concerns about the plans of the Anabaptists in Münster. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace of conscience through Christ.</p>
      <p>It is certainly known to you, excellent man, what the current fortune of my homeland [Thurgau] is, namely that all authority there is administered by men who are professed enemies of the religion we follow as true. This results in the fact that the more freely someone admits that this pleases them, the more severely they experience the power of those men. You, being nearby, have undoubtedly learned this truth more than once from the refugees. Indeed, through my brother-in-law Hans Sunnenmann, I have been abundantly informed of this in recent days. He is forced into exile solely because of certain statements made incautiously against the public treaty (as some falsely reported), and, as far as I can suspect, no hope of return is left to him. Therefore, I earnestly wish to commend to you this man, who has been undeservedly cast into this calamity by certain wicked men. If you bestow any benefit upon him, I believe you will do so neither to an unworthy nor an ungrateful person, and you will certainly bind me to you not moderately. It would be greatly to his advantage to devote himself to theological study with you for a while, and he plainly desires this, if only a little support from ecclesiastical goods could be provided to him. You will therefore make an effort, if it can be done, to take some account of him until a better condition presents itself or some position he can conveniently oversee. What makes me so boldly request this from you is the friendship that has long existed between us, to which you may attribute whatever fault I seem to commit.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us that is worth writing to you about, except that much is being said about war preparations and that the plans of the Anabaptists in Münster and their faction are causing many to be very anxious about what they ultimately intend to do.</p>
      <p>Greet for me the entire choir of the Muses there, especially Leo, Pellican, and Theodor.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From our literary school at the Carmelites in Strasbourg, on the first of January in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Peter Dasypodius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and equally upright Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor among the people of Zurich, his primary and much esteemed friend.</p>
