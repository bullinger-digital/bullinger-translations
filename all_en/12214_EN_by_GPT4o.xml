    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian understood from Bullinger's second letter, written within a short time [not received], what he wanted from him for the sake of [Johannes] Stumpf; he will make an effort to satisfy Bullinger and Froschauer. He hopes to bring clarity to the history of the "Thurgau." He has no doubt that the educated and astute Stumpf will offer something valuable to Froschauer. Vadian does not doubt that [Stumpf's "Swiss Chronicle"] will be comprehensive. Already [Stumpf's treatment of] the "Thurgau" allows such an assumption. Vadian will strive to deliver his handwritten work [to Stumpf] by the promised date [August 1545]. - He is sending back the learned book of [Johannes a] Lasco. The second will follow as soon as the friends have read it. - From a friend [Hieronymus Sailer] he received from Antwerp the repulsive Louvain [“Articles”], with which [Charles V.] allegedly justifies his anger, although this writing was probably instigated by his court and not by the Emperor himself. [Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle and [Cardinal Gaspar de Avalos of Santiago de] Compostela hold [Louis de Flandre, Lord of Praet] responsible for it. Bullinger should ask Mayor [Johannes] Haab to review the French version of these “Articles.” - [P.S.:] News: There is distrust of the monarchs and the Antichrist and instigator of all armaments [Paul III.], who [use force], as they cannot protect themselves with the truth. From Antwerp, [Hieronymus Sailer] writes to a [St. Gallen] citizen [...], this should convey to N. [Vadian], [Charles V.] is too partisan on the side of the clergy at the Diet [of Worms] and before his departure from [Brabant] had several articles of faith printed and decreed under penalty that they must be adhered to. [Sailer] enclosed a copy of these [“Articles”] written in Latin and French for N. [Vadian], with the request to further inform him that he suspects [Paul III.], [Charles V.] and [Francis I.] are plotting something against England, which is why now probably a peace with [Sultan Suleiman I.] is being negotiated for several years. [Sailer] hopes, however, that the Swiss Confederates and the Imperial Cities will deter the Emperor from such an attack if they are ready to attack. So far [Sailer]. - King Ferdinand [I.] is said to have concluded a peace treaty with [Sultan Suleiman I.] for five years with the knowledge of [Charles V.]. Through [Paul III.'s] mediation, England is also said to be reconciled with France again, but no details of this agreement are known. - Credible sources from Hungary and Austria report that [Suleiman I.] is moving north with a strong army through Wallachia and Transylvania against the King of Poland [Sigismund I.]. If this is true, the peace [for the Protestants] is over. For then it is to be suspected that [Paul III.] has persuaded [Suleiman I.] to frighten the princes bordering Poland, [Joachim II. Hector] of Mark [Brandenburg and Hans of Küstrin of Neumark-Brandenburg], [Philipp I. and Barnim IX.] of Pomerania, [Johann Friedrich I. and Moritz] of Saxony, and to separate them from their allies within the Empire, in order to better defeat them along with the [Imperial Cities].</p>

      <p>S. Your letters, as always, full of learning and humanity, were most welcome to me, having been sent a second time within a short interval, from which I understood what you desire for the sake of Stumpf and what you command. I will ensure that both you and our Froschauer are satisfied. Indeed, I hope to bring clarity to our ancient history, dispelling all the fog from our Thurgau hills. Perhaps I am mistaken, but I will appeal to your judgment. However, I have no doubt that our Stumpf, being a man endowed not only with humanity and integrity but also with learning and a genuine sagacity for investigating matters, will spare no effort to make his work valuable to our Froschauer. Regarding the history, I do not doubt that he will publish it comprehensively. This impression was given to me by just one part of Thurgau that I saw from him. Therefore, I will ensure that by the agreed date (provided nothing adverse happens to me), he receives my work written by my own hand, etc. - I am returning the wonderfully learned book of Lasco; the other is still being read by friends; once they have read it, I will send it. From Antwerp, a friend sent me that rancid booklet of the hot-headed Louvain theologians, which, as I hear, Caesar has most indignantly used to justify his fury, if indeed he has used it; but I think this is the business of the imperial court, not of Caesar himself. Granvelle, Compostela, and Fradello are stirring up this tragic mess. May the Lord finally avenge his people, who have been so miserably deceived for so many years. Amen. Let my lord mayor have the French version read, even if it is difficult to get through. The matter is almost worthy of being translated into French as well. But I fear syncretism. Farewell. St. Gallen, the 28th day of May, in the year 1545.</p>
      <p>Regarding the news, I have inquired among our people and find all sorts of mistrust concerning the monarchs and the Antichrist, the Pope. However, there is no doubt that all the armament and movement of these leaders are instigated by the Pope along with his desolate retinue. They know they cannot recover the protection of their being with the truth. Therefore, they want to use force. However, it is hoped that they will not have much success with these plans, as with several past ones. May God grant that they become inclined to place God's honor and the salvation of their souls above their own benefit and the prosperity of their pomp. A very honorable man writes from Antwerp these words to one of our citizens: "Tell N. how I found Emperor Charles V. on the way. He is heading to the Diet. God grant that much good will be accomplished; but it does not seem so; for Emperor Charles V. shows himself too partisan on the side of the clergy. Before his departure from these lands, he had several articles of faith printed and ordered under great penalty to be observed. I am sending you one in Latin and French. Give it to Mr. N. and tell him I am concerned that there are many secret plots and practices between the Pope, the Emperor, and the King of France against the English. And therefore, a truce for several years with the Turk has been made, as you may know better than I. But I hope in God that all things will turn out for the best. For if the Swiss Confederates are in arms and the Imperial Cities rely on them, one knife might keep the other in the sheath. May God grant what is good." So he writes. It is written here as certain news that King Ferdinand has made a treaty and truce with the knowledge of the Emperor for five years, such that the Turk will remain in all the lands he has won, and King Ferdinand will pay him an annual tribute of 2100 ducats. And England is also said to be reconciled with France through the mediation of the Antichrist (as it is written), though it is not known for how long or with what terms. Furthermore, it is written to our people, who are dealing in Hungary and Austria, credibly, that the Turk is advancing with a significant number of troops, and it is thought he will turn towards Wallachia and Transylvania against the King of Poland, with whom peace is broken. And if this happens, it will certainly be a plot by the Pope, who undoubtedly has an understanding with the Turk, namely to frighten the princes in the Mark, Pomerania, and Saxony, who border Poland, to see if they can be separated from their other allies and then defeat the other states, which were previously in the Empire, more easily and suitably. Now one must lie and listen; for the devil does not rest. However, it is hoped that God (who has begun to open his word) will turn the counsels of the godless to ashes. May God grant this. Given as above. Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, his esteemed friend.</p>
