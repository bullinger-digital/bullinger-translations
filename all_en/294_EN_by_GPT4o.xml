      <p>S. It is always most pleasing to us, and it has been and will be in the future, your diligence in writing about all things that are of interest for us to know, with which I would indeed compete with great effort, if my current solitude, which hides me from all human conversation that has knowledge of public affairs, allowed it. I have received nothing from Augsburg for a long time, and from the other cities of Swabia perhaps a little more than nothing, so much so that the path of letters is blocked partly by the fear of the pious, partly by the insidious and very diligent observation of the impious; indeed, even now I receive very little from our people about the state of the city in this confusion and intemperance of all things.</p>
      <p>Recently, that Ecclius, having first obtained the security of safe conduct, arrived among our people, but he brought nothing new, except that he doubted whether it was true that some neighbors in Thurgau, calling the baron Sax, were attempting, so that if the imperial or royal forces occupy one gate, he himself would preemptively occupy another. Then he indicated that his lord, who called himself the commissioner of the emperor and king, had not yet returned from abroad, so that certain things that the senate had previously requested could not be declared and clarified. I hear that no response has yet been brought from the Transrhenane (beyond the Rhine) regions; however, some of the more prudent think that they are nurturing some kind of monster. Therefore, my people (if it is still right to call them mine) are stuck, as it is said, between the altar and the stone, holding the wolf by the ears, that is: they stand between Christ and the world, and from both sides they have voluntarily aroused danger for themselves, and now they hold the donkey for the wolf [Greek]; which, although it was not dangerous to let go, they still hold more easily because they have ears to spare. It is said that the emperor asked Duke Christoph to hand over Montem Pelargi or Peligardi, promising certain things in return concerning his father's duchy.</p>
      <p>Letters and rumors vary greatly about many things, so that it is annoying to write to you about those things that are spread around by no credible author.</p>
      <p>It is said that the emperor is coming up again to make his son emperor. Someone who was also in Baden said that the pope and the French wanted to make an alliance, but they could not agree on one article, so they were broken apart. Also, the French, who were granted a pass by some places, were willing to take Constance. Also, the pope's embassy has asked the four evangelical places to also agree to the council; it will be very advantageous for them, with the pretense that the pope is very dissatisfied with the Interim, which the emperor has interfered with in his office.</p>
      <p>The copy, which I previously requested from you, is from a letter that my lords have sent to the people of FÃ¼rstenberg, in which he is asked for a friendly negotiation, issued on the 10th of August; a similar one was also sent to Weingarten; it is not known otherwise than that your lords have also received a copy of it. I would like to have it.</p>
      <p>Ah my venerable and dearest brother, pray to the Lord for me, that he may hear me praying for his kindness. The more than miserable misery of my people consumes me more and more beyond measure; although this levity and oblivion of the benefits of God, which is plainly Lethean, must be considered very abominable, yet, whenever I look around at the adversaries and the desires of the world and consider with myself that whatever hard thing happens, it cannot be said to have happened for the cause of evangelical truth, I cannot express how much I pity the flock that does not have or even despises a shepherd, so that I dare to pray to the true and truly good shepherd Christ from time to time, that he himself may again take care of the bleating ones, while he can still be recognized by them as the master and this life-giving food.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will pray with me with humble vows, that the Lord may not completely abandon the care of this church nor fail to provide timely advice and help, which may assist it, so greatly preserved. Farewell with your household, which I diligently and lovingly greet with my words, along with all the brothers and friends, especially your ministers in the work of the Lord, then Butler and Hopper, the best and most Christian men, with the treasurer Arnold and the rest of ours. My wife and sister wish you well. I commend to you this young man Melchior, who will devote himself to studies there and, unless I am mistaken, will live comfortably with our Wolphius and other compatriots. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Griesenberg, 7th of October 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>You will greet Musculus and Gervasius, venerable and dearest brothers, from me very reverently, whose sacred prayers I greatly desire to always be commended to the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and doctrine, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, an incomparable friend like a brother, Antistes of the church of Zurich.</p>
