    <p xml:id="regest1">How often has thom Camph (especially in these unfortunate times) thought of Bullinger's words, that alliances with princes and powerful cities [the Christian civil rights] have never ended well for the people of Zurich, but that the Gospel flourished after the end of the alliance and no misfortune has befallen the people of Zurich since then.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Consequently, the people of Zurich had relied too much on their own power and on this alliance instead of trusting solely in God, who would have protected them. However, since they did not [follow] the Holy Scriptures, God broke their power as a warning example [through the defeat in the Second War of Kappel]. Thus, they came to realization in time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Nothing has harmed the princes [of the Schmalkaldic League] more than their excessive power and arrogance! Therefore, God destroyed the Schmalkaldic League for the glory of his church and for the humiliation, but also for the salvation of the arrogant princes [Landgrave Philip of Hesse and Elector John Frederick I of Saxony]. Through their disempowerment, he made them a mockery for all as an example. Thus, he can raise them up again from this humiliation. Through this, they should no longer trust in their human powers, but solely in the living God, who is able to protect the believers from the power of the devil and the world. Thus, they should also no longer judge anything based on their success in the future.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">If Luther had foreseen the [defeat of the Schmalkaldic League], his judgment of the people of Zurich and their cause would not have been so disparaging. However, he died in time so that no one associated his confession of faith with this defeat. Otherwise, God would have started [this war as] punishment during Luther's lifetime. But it is the sins [of the Protestants] that have deserved this chastisement! Yet God tends to refrain from punishment after the believers have shown repentance. Through these warnings, the [Protestants] should be prompted not to rely on human alliances and their power, but solely on God and his word, and to be prepared for both success and failure.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">What has corrupted all communities? What has always been beneficial to the people of God? Trust in God! In this war, only the right behavior towards God and people was effective. Bremen has committed itself to true religion and piety more than any other Saxon city and therefore received the greatest support from God. The city of Constance near the Confederation has also remained steadfast and will undoubtedly experience God's help if it perseveres.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">About [fifteen] years ago, the [Zwinglian-oriented] churches of Zurich and East Frisia [suffered under their distress]. Now it affects the [Lutheran] churches, which were once so arrogant. During the [Schmalkaldic] War, the East Frisian church, however, was left in peace. They place their future in God's hands! He does not abandon his own, even if he tests them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Thom Camph did not write to Bullinger to instruct him, but to share his views on these defeats with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Konrad Pellikan will report on everything else, the situation of the Protestants in Emden, and the events in East Frisia.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Just this: Johannes a Lasco is alive and well, but due to his many obligations, he could not write to Bullinger, especially since he feared that his letters would not be delivered to him. He would have also returned Bullinger's writing [«De sacramentis»] if a safe transmission had been possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">The people of Emden will report more later and request, if possible, news from the Confederation, as they are very connected to the people of Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">The people of Zurich should pray for them, as the people of Emden also remember them. May Jesus stand by the afflicted church!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">Greetings, especially to Bullinger's colleagues, children, and wife [Anna née Adlischwyler].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">Thom Camph's colleagues and his wife [N.N.] send their regards. Bullinger should excuse his frankness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[P.S.:] Neither Thom Camph nor the other people of Emden know [Gerhard Westerburg and Jan Mączyński], whom Bullinger mentioned in his last letter [not received] to greet. They are probably Davidianists, who like to use false names and present themselves [like Jacob] as Esau. Bullinger should be cautious in dealing with such people! For deceit and fraud are not offenses to them, and in conversations about faith, they only reveal their [actual] opinion when they are sure they can win over their interlocutor. These people become the new Antichrist, through whom God will punish the world for its ingratitude! Thom Camph would write more if his time allowed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">Another greeting.</p>

      <p>Grace, peace with perseverance in the recognized truth in all dangers that may befall you in the name of Christ and the gospel. How often I have remembered your words, my most learned and kind Bullinger, especially in these most calamitous times, when you said that it never (never!) went well for you while you had an alliance with powerful princes and cities! Meanwhile, when you abandoned this, the gospel flourished and nothing sad happened to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>From this, I gather that you relied too much on your own strength and on this alliance as if it were a human arm and not likewise on God, who was able to preserve you if you had trusted in Him alone. And to admonish you by example (since you did not heed the scripture), He confounded your power so that you might begin to be wise in time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>What do you think has harmed our princes in this war more than excessive power and self-confidence? Therefore, God, so that the glory of the church preserved for Him might remain and to humble those proud ones under His hand, so that they might finally be saved, He alone broke this alliance, not by human strength! And He shattered all the power of those on whom they relied, so that they became an example and a mockery to all, so that thus humbled under His mighty hand, He might raise them up again, so that they might not henceforth trust in human strength, but in the living God alone, who is able to preserve those who trust in Him against the power of the devil and the world. And therefore, also, that they might not judge so poorly in the future, thinking the cause is determined by the success of events.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>If Luther had seen this, he would not have judged you or your cause so unfavorably. But the Lord took him away in time, so that all might see that the bad outcome did not happen because of the profession of religion, otherwise it would have begun with him. But our sins are to blame, which have deserved this chastisement. But He is wont to visit His own with the scourge after repentance and to deliver them to the fire. But taught by these examples, let us distrust ourselves and all human alliances and strengths, and rely solely on our God and His word, and be prepared for either outcome!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>What has destroyed all republics? What has always benefited the people of God? Trust in the supreme God. I see in this war that nothing has benefited anyone except piety towards God and men. Among all the cities of Saxony, none was more devoted to true religion and the pursuit of piety than Bremen. Therefore, God also helped it the most. Then also with you in Constance: Therefore, it also stood firm, and if they persist, they will undoubtedly see the help of the Lord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Your churches and ours also bore the cross fifteen years ago, but now the others, who then boasted, do. We, on the other hand, have enjoyed tranquility during this tumult. What we are to expect further, we commit to the Lord. Let us only strive to trust in Him, and expect help from Him! He does not forsake His own, even if He tests them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I have enjoyed discussing these calamities with you, not because you were unaware of them, but so that you might also have my opinion.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The rest, which you wish to know about our affairs and what is happening among us, our Pellicanus will report.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Just know this: Lord a Lasco is alive and well and, due to many affairs and fearing that his letters might not reach you, he could not write. He would have sent you back your booklet if it were safe.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>We will send more later. We all ask, if it is possible, that you write to us about the state of your affairs. For as we love you from the heart, so we wish you well and desire to know about you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Pray, I ask, to the Lord for us. We remember you. May the Lord Jesus be with you with His spirit and protect you with His help and lift up the church, which is wonderfully afflicted.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and greet all your colleagues, especially your most pious wife with all the children. Emden, hastily, February 26, 1548.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>All our ministers and my wife greet you in the Lord. Forgive my frankness.</p>
      <p>You know the hand of your Frisian.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>You wrote recently about some whom you wanted me to greet. I do not know them, nor does anyone of us. But I will say what I think: I believe they were Davidianists, who are free to invent names and put on the glove of Esau. See, my lord, that you deal cautiously with them! For to simulate and deceive is not a sin to them. And even if you discuss religion with them a lot, they will not reveal their opinion until they know you are committed. My opinion about these people is that they will be the new Antichrist, after the old one is removed, through whom the Lord will punish the world for its ingratitude. I would write more if time allowed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, his brother in the Lord to be revered.</p>
