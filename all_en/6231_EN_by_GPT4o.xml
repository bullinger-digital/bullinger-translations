      <p>S. Since there was absolutely nothing, reverend father in Christ, that would be of interest for you to know, I thought I should write to you anyway, to inform you that I received your letter and that Mr. Consul handed over the Danish and Swedish matters to me with the condition that I should send them back to you. Thus, you would at least know that I have nothing to write about. Today, I had a long conversation with Mr. Tscharner about French affairs, and from his words, I understood that the situation of our people there is quite precarious, except that Mr. Beza writes to me that Christ is nevertheless triumphing wonderfully in the meantime; this is the last papal attempt.</p>
      <p>I assume you have read the papal bull, which confirms the council and at the same time exhorts his most obedient son Ferdinand, the elected emperor, who was then still alive, and other princes and republics, who sent their envoys to the council, to fulfill in deeds what they promised to the fathers in person and to assist them in executing what the canons of the council dictate. But now this most obedient son, whose assistance the pope professes to have used primarily in procuring this council, is dead; perhaps some part of the practice is buried with him. - The senate writes to ours about matters concerning Glarus; letters from the people of Schwyz to the people of Zurich are attached. I read them and marvel at the impudence of the people of Schwyz.</p>
      <p>For who does not understand how openly they criticize the religion of the people of Zurich, to whom they themselves write? But I am surprised that your senate does not affirm the death of the emperor for certain in their letters to ours, while here there is no longer any doubt about it. - The envoy of Philip was entirely expected here, and already the people of that faction were raising their crests, which they now gradually lower as his arrival is delayed; however, they have not yet given up all hope of his coming. There is nothing about Hannibal in the meantime, which is surprising.</p>
      <p>I ask and beg you, my reverend father, to kindly send this little letter to Mr. Bäldius, to whom it is addressed; I am responding to the one he recently wrote to me.</p>
      <p>When I recently wrote something about young lord Ambrosi and Luci Gugelbärg, the two brothers, at the request of Mr. Ambrosi Blorer and at that time used Mr. Tscharner's advice, who described to me their status and nature, perhaps revealing something about the daughter in between, and I asked again who she was, the one who had the daughter as a guardian, whereby I sensed that the Gugelbärgs were not particularly informed about these matters: my request to you is, if you still remember Mr. Ambrosi's writing, to inform me quietly with a word; I will know how to use it discreetly, without harm to anyone.</p>
      <p>But it is not necessary; if you write more, remember them with two words; for in Mr. Blorer's letter to you it was stated how you had once served the one who had him better in his protection, and perhaps also earned well for him. - Otherwise, by the grace of God, we are still well.</p>
      <p>There is no plague here in Chur, from which, however, Rhaetia is not immune in the meantime. We hear that the plague is worsening in Basel, about which you know better.</p>
      <p>I have taken care to inform the parents of Heinrich from Chur, who came to you; you are so much more humane to the people of Chur, who would not have received him, who came from the plague.</p>
      <p>But I want to warn you about him (secretly, however), not to make him familiar to you and yours; he is a man of a very unstable mind, although this does not appear at first meeting; but when he reveals himself, he is quite restless.</p>
      <p>Since he has tried it and his people have tried it with him and should not do anything, he thinks he is still good enough to be a preacher.</p>
      <p>But this is for you; for that man admits no sound advice. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, as happily and for as long as possible. Chur, August 14, 1564.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>I wrote to friends in Geneva, so that if a book were printed there, a few copies would be sent to you in Zurich, from there to me through my people in Chur, which indeed was done by me for no other reason than that your name is famous there and there is less danger in procuring copies. Therefore, forgive me for using your help in this matter; when they arrive, hand them over to Mr. Collin, your father-in-law; he will take care of it.</p>
      <p>If there is anything to be paid for the transport, I will pay it in good faith.</p>
      <p>Keep one or two copies; all the rest should be sent to me; for in Italy they will be of greater use than among the Germans. I sent some epitaphs of Mr. Calvin to Mr. Collin; if you have not seen them, you can inspect them.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and much honored father in Christ.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
