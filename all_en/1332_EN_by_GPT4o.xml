      <p>Greetings and best wishes. You have completely satisfied my mind, honorable elder and most esteemed brother; our mutual love will not fade, even if we write rarely; our friendship and mutual respect will remain intact. You will understand why a messenger comes to you from here from the common letter, which I implore you to use wisely; perhaps it will not be beneficial to spread this, but to keep it among the faithful. Please look after the churches; support the best cause; remember the admonitions of Christ and the apostles.</p>
      <p>Now the matter of the churches and our salvation is at stake; if we stray from the goal here, it will be over with the churches entrusted to our faith, unless the chief shepherd, our Lord, preserves us in a unique way. If we are united, I hope for the best; if not, there is no reason to think that an injustice is being done to us. May the Lord be with us and the church. By the grace of God, things are going well with us. I have nothing certain from Parma yet; when I receive it, you will not lack it. I wrote a word or two to Gast. Farewell with all your people. Zurich, July 8, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, honorable lord and most esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
