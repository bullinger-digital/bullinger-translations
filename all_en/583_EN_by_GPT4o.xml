      <p>You received a bundle of letters last evening, if that courier kept his word; in it, there were quite a few addressed to Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, and other friends there, as well as to my dear Vergerius. I now ask you, if you have not already sent them to Chur, to give them to the young man present; for he is faithful, especially to Christ the head, then to all members, and very dear to me. I am sending Bu[...] Spier's dreadful despair, but as you will see, it is written by Sigismund Geloo of Transylvania, with the condition that you return it, indicating whether you think it should be published for the greater solidity of history. However, since there has not been time for reading so far, I hope to read your judgment with much more fruitful follow-up. Nothing else occurs to me now, except that you declare yourself mindful of me by assigning something.</p>
      <p>July 8, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Lelio Sozzini.</p>
      <p>As for Mr. Florian, he writes from Mainz to MÃ¼nster, to carefully take care of the books you bought in Venice, while he was with us in Zurich; for he persuaded them for an entire month that he was in Venice, so much so that they hardly believe me when I affirm that it is false.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and most worthy pastor of the Church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
