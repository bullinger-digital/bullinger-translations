      <p>S. D. Your recent letters, most illustrious man, along with the bundle of a certain unfortunate man, have reached me in Neuburg. In them, as always, you urge me to write frequently. However, I sent lengthy letters to you in July, which I forwarded to Lindau to Papias. I am surprised if you lack them, especially because I confidently, not to say boldly, outlined many things that it is not advisable to repeat here. The face of Germany now seems entirely deformed to me, both due to the most ardent dissensions and also due to the evil and foreign arts, treacheries, plots, and flattery recently arisen. The priests certainly nurture some kind of monster. In Livonia, the bishop, the margrave, and the Duke of Mecklenburg, the coadjutor of the Teutonic Order, have besieged soldiers in a certain fortress and have taken many fortresses and towns by force, and have advanced so far that even the Duke of Prussia seeks peace with them.</p>
      <p>All the other shaven ones contribute as much as each can, hoping that their fortunes will also be greater from the fortunes of others. However, the King of Poland, the King of Denmark, and the margraves bring aid to Prussia, hopefully not too late. Otherwise, in our parts, a certain tranquility is still enforced.</p>
      <p>Our prince, the Elector Palatine, is expected here in four days with a large retinue. In the meantime, by his mandate, I am acting here as deputy chancellor. However, I want to relieve myself of this burden as much as possible.</p>
      <p>There is little hope here for maintaining the purity of the Gospel. Almost all the princes and cities who have given their name to the Gospel are entangled in the false opinion of the carnal eating of the body of Christ, knowing nothing of what the letter and the spirit mean.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, all worshippers of piety are held in utmost hatred and persecution. Laurentius Agricola has excellently cleared himself before the prince with writings and has freely conducted his case without a veil. However, what will happen with him is still unknown to me. But shortly, with the prince present, we will know everything, and unless delay and the hope of some good from the protracted time arise for me, I would already consider the matter as lost. Indeed, this cause is of great importance; if it falls unfavorably, not only Laurentius's, but also my and others' affairs will be at stake.</p>
      <p>In the diet, there is slumbering; however, not everyone sees what schemes are being built in the meantime. Margrave Albert will be here with our prince. Some believe there will be a settlement between him and the papist adversaries, some do not; for from this business, peace and war depend.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Very quickly. August 7, 1556, from Neuburg.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Laetus.</p>
      <p>Brentius has recently published a booklet on the Lord's Supper, full of absurdities, which the Lutherans regard as an oracle. I wish it soon finds an antagonist.</p>
      <p>[...] to the honorable and highly learned Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and brother in Zurich.</p>
