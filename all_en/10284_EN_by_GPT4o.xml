    <p xml:id="regest1">Finds satisfactory church conditions in Kempten and believes that the previous disputes have been overcome. Earnestly requests Bullinger's help for Benedikt Euander to come to Kempten as a teacher. Is disappointed about the negative response from Zurich regarding this matter. Fears that an opponent of the pastor might be chosen as a teacher, which would result in new tensions. Greetings. Request for news from Zurich.</p>

      <p>Through Jesus Christ, all health. If you are well, it is good, indeed I am well, God willing.</p>
      <p>From Constance, by the good will of God, called to the gospel of Christ in Kempten, as you know, dearest brother, I found the church quite benevolent in part, very eager for the divine word, which you should know was previously divided by Lutheran opinion, now finally, with the help of God's grace, I consider it to be gathered again. Some ceremonies still remain. I hope they will be abolished shortly. The council is sincere in part, as everywhere, otherwise lame. Yet, by the wonderful ordination of God and beyond thought, it acts in the increase of faith and charity in our church, at least in appointing ministers of the word of God and in placing learned and pious men over the tender youth. You know, dearest brother, how fruitful and pleasing to God and useful to men it is to take the utmost care of the youth in these times. Therefore, we brothers have labored with all our might by the commission of our council for Benedikt Euander, who is with you as a minister of literary studies, whom we know to be approved for many ages, to be summoned by his own given will to undertake the province of instructing the tender youth. He did not refuse the condition agreed upon before the council. I hear he is led by regret, which I cannot sufficiently admire. You brothers also write that your church needs that man, as if you have no learned and pious men like the owls of Athens. Why did he not write to our council himself, with whom he has to deal, also excusing us? Certainly, brother, I never had anything more certain to affirm with given faith before our council, if the matter had demanded it, that your church is so closely joined with ours in all good things, and if we had written for the whole help of Zurich for the glory of God and the benefit of our church, I would have found the utmost benevolence. I fear, not truly informed about the inconvenience to our church. He knows it exactly himself. I refrain from writing. Therefore, dearest brother, as you are accustomed, let that man Benedikt be restored as soon as possible, so that our church may be safe - and to your honor -, also we ministers from the prattle of impostors, boastful I know, delayed by any occasion: Behold this futile reasoning of the Schw√§rmer. May this evil be far away. Is there another church of the Zurichers than that of Kempten, to which you would like to be of benefit? By no means, there is one, brother. Your letters were intercepted for a whole month. We read them on August 20th. The courier is at the door. We do not know what we have to do. We are overwhelmed with the greatest shame before the council and the church. Do not allow, pious brother, as much as is in you, by counsel and help, us and our church to fall into any slander. Otherwise, ill-gotten peace. Not that we conspired against the knowledge and piety of Benedikt or another man, but we know that one of the impostors, who are with us, should be placed over the trivial study and thus we will have schism and all evil. May God avert this. We withheld your letters, lest we be ill-spoken of. It seems to me that the stipend for Benedikt is not large enough with us. Brother, I urge you, without any controversy, make that man return to us. If it happens sooner, well, if not, you will soon hear contention.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your beloved wife and pious mother. I sincerely wish Leo, Pellican, Erasmus Fabricius, and Carolstadt to be well. I wish that you would commend us to your church. Also write, if you ever have time, to us about the state of your affairs. We sometimes hear absurd things and many things done wrongly, which may it not be. Do as we know, in defense of the truth, etc. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>August 20th, Kempten, 1533, hastily.</p>
      <p>Veit Kappeler, your most devoted, etc.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a learned, pious man, diligent preacher of the word of God among the Zurichers, a brother in the Lord most dear.</p>
