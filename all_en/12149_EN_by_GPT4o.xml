    <p xml:id="regest1">The Zurichers received the letters from the [Neuchâtel pastors] dated February 22 [21] [Nos. 2086 and 2087] at the beginning of March, as well as the letters written a few months ago on the same matter. The latter were not answered because the [Zurich pastors] received them late and therefore considered a response unnecessary. Now, however, the desired opinion in brief: - The pastors of the countryside and city of Zurich conduct a similar [church] discipline among themselves twice a year during their [spring and autumn] synod as the Neuchâtel pastors do. Delegates of the pastors and the council preside over the synod. At the beginning, God's assistance is invoked. After reading the names of the colleagues, inquiries are made about the absentees. During a [communion service], the newly appointed pastors commit to preaching the Gospel with sincere hearts. Subsequently, the [Antistes] presents how a pastor should teach and live and urges everyone to proceed with common sense in evaluating the [colleagues] and not to be guided by emotions. After the Antistes has withdrawn, one of the presiding members inquires of the colleagues about him, whether he might have harmed the church. If not, he is praised. If so, he is interrogated and, after leaving [the hall] again, the brothers decide how he should be admonished. This has been the procedure for years with each individual [pastor], based on the [Holy] Scripture and the example of the [Early Church]. The writings of Emperor Justinian [I] [the "Codex Iustinianus," the "Institutiones," and the "Digesta" of the "Corpus iuris civilis"] among others, show that this has been handled in this way for a thousand years. This practice has further proven its public utility for the Zurich church, so its divine institution is not to be doubted. - [Chaponneau] refers much to brotherly love in his theses. May this also be effective in him by joining the brothers and submitting to the censure! If his case is good, he will be praised; if not, he will be admonished. [Solomon] does say that the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of a hypocrite [Proverbs 27:6]! How often have righteous people waived their rights to join their brothers! Just as [Chaponneau] is granted the right to his own opinion, he should also allow the brothers to have one. May he heed the admonition and request of the Zurichers! Everything should serve edification. - The Zurichers commend themselves to the prayers of the [Neuchâtel people]. - Enclosed is the [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio”] translated from German into Latin by Gwalther, with which the Zurichers recently responded to Luther's [“Kurtz bekentnis”].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. We, dearest brothers, received your letters written on February 22 at the beginning of March, and we frankly confess that we had also received others sent by you on the same matter a month earlier. The reason we did not respond to those earlier ones was simply that they were delivered to us too late, leading us to suspect that the entire matter had been settled with you before our response could reach you. Now, however, since we hear that our opinion is still awaited, we offer these few words. For we do not think that more is needed in such a small matter. We observe no other method, no other procedure in assessing the doctrines and morals of ministers than the very one you also practice. Once or twice a year, all the ministers of the churches from the countryside and the city gather in a synod. Selected ministers and magistrates preside over the sacred assembly. It begins with the invocation of the divine. Then the list of all the brothers is read, and inquiries are made about the absentees. Here, those who have recently been called to the sacred ministry bind themselves with an oath to the sincere preaching of the gospel. Afterwards, the chief minister of the church discusses the doctrine and life of bishops or ministers, how it ought to be. He urges that in assessing the brothers, judgment should be followed, not emotion, and he is the first to leave after the sermon is finished. Once he has left, one of the presiding members immediately asks the neighbors what they know about the brother that might offend or hinder the edification of the church. Here, therefore, his life and doctrine are examined. If he has done something worthy of praise, he is recalled and encouraged to continue. But if he has sinned in some way, he is heard to see if he acknowledges the sin, how he excuses it, or what he responds. Then, after hearing his response and once he has left again, it is deliberated what should be enjoined upon him in the name of the assembly. Thus, an inquiry is made individually, etc. Our church has had this custom for many years now, supported by certain places in scripture and examples of the ancients. For the writings of Emperor Justinian sufficiently prove that such sacred assemblies and ecclesiastical censures of ministers were in use a thousand years ago, to say nothing else. But much fruit and utility flow from this to our church, so that we do not doubt that God kindly favors this institution of ours, and that what is good flows from the source of all good.</p>
      <p>The good brother who collected the conclusions speaks much of charity. Let him therefore ensure that charity prevails with him, and so far let him devote himself to all the brothers, approving the method of assessment in all the churches, and let him submit to its censure. If he has a good cause, he will receive praise from the brothers. If not, let him hear friendly admonition and brotherly correction. Of which the wise man says, the wounds of a friend are sweeter than the kisses of a hypocrite. We see that the best people have often yielded their rights, at least to devote themselves to the brothers and serve them. Therefore, even if we grant him the right to his own counsel, let him still present himself to all of us as those most holy men have given themselves to the brothers. Indeed, we pray that the good brother may heed our admonition and faithful request. Among the saints, everything is done for edification in a just and decent order.</p>
      <p>We commend ourselves and our churches to your pious prayers, and we pray that you may always continue to embrace us with sincere love. For we love you with true and heartfelt affection. May the Lord Jesus keep you.</p>
      <p>We have added to these what we wrote in recent days against Luther's insults, slanders, reproaches, and condemnation. We wrote in German, Gwalther made it Latin. Farewell, beloved and esteemed brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 12, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your pastors, readers, and all ministers of the Zurich church from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the faithful pastors and ministers of Christ and the church of Neuchâtel, beloved and esteemed brothers.</p>
