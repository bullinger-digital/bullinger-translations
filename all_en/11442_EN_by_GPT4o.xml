    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends once again Hieronymus [...] from Siena, who is traveling to Bern later than planned, after spending 22 days with him. Thanks for the letter [No. 1398] and for returning the records of the Diet of Schmalkalden. Hopes that Bullinger and Bucer will come to an understanding with each other, and intends to write to him himself. [King] Ferdinand is in Hagenau; the [religious discussion] convened in Speyer has been relocated there due to an epidemic; call to prayer. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I recently recommended to you this Hieronymus from Siena, a priest and exile, and did so in a letter, which your Michael the Hebrew, I have no doubt, delivered to you. However, certain delays were imposed on him, so that only now has he been able to begin this journey. You, my most esteemed Bullinger, assist the man in every way possible, so that he may travel to Bern with whatever convenience he can. He was with me for 22 days, and I found nothing in him that was unworthy of a good man, so I do not doubt that what has been done for him was done for Christ, as he is a man miserable in more than one respect. I do not wish to burden you or anyone else, except as much as the utmost necessity demands; you can soon send him to Bern either alone or with companions, if by chance there are any.</p>
      <p>I have just now received your most welcome letters with the acts of the Schmalkalden [Diet], and there was no need to give such great and magnificent thanks to those who are entirely yours and over whom you can also command by the right of your charity and authority.</p>
      <p>What you write about Bucer torments us beyond measure, except that we hope that whatever this evil was, it will not spread further. We were not allowed to learn anything about this from anyone before the day I sent the last letter to you, nor do I think it is too late if even now you and the other reconcile, which we will pray to the Lord to make happen, and we will also attempt other things conducive to this concord to the best of our ability; for tomorrow or the day after we will have to write to Bucer for other reasons, and then we will also deal with this matter in good faith.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand is now in Hagenau, where what was to be done in Speyer will be done; for in Speyer, this deadly plague, which almost never ceases there, has raged more cruelly than usual against some, whom it has also taken away harshly and unusually. We, as the one or principal thing we can do, pray to the Lord to inflame the hearts of all on both sides with zeal for the glory of His name and public tranquility. Farewell, dearest brother, and if anyone can be dearer than the dearest.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and the excellent men and brothers who are with you most carefully and dutifully. Our people send their regards to you. Farewell again and forever. May 28, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours truly from the depths of my heart, A. B.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, a lord and brother most esteemed and dearest.</p>
