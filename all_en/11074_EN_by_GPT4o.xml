    <p xml:id="regest1">The fact that Bullinger mostly corresponds with his colleague Megander, while Rhellikan himself corresponds more with Bibliander, will not harm their friendship. He requests support for the concern of [Christian] Hospinian, who is studying in Tübingen under the supervision of his brother Johannes and wishes to rely on the proceeds of a chalice endowed by his ancestors; God loves those who care for widows and orphans. Reports on the machinations of Bucer's followers, who have unsuccessfully tried to expel Megander, Erasmus [Ritter], and himself from Bern. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and a peaceful conscience through Christ the Savior.</p>
      <p>That we write to each other less frequently, most learned Bullinger, I take in the part I should, namely that you are occupied with more serious studies and duties than to play with mutual letters with a friend, especially since in the meantime, as far as duty is concerned, you have our Megander as an equal, with whom you handle serious church matters. In your writings, you do not neglect me so much that you not only bestow friendly greetings upon me but also advise that certain secrets should be communicated. This ensures that nothing diminishes my love for you. Nor do I fear that your love for me will be diminished by any silence in writing. For you possess such humanity, prudence, and dexterity of mind that you suspect nothing sinister from the silence of friends, let alone intentionally blame it. For thus you think: That Bibliander and Rhellikan, your friends, send letters to each other back and forth is fair. It is fitting for professors of good letters to write to each other. And you think you are less neglected because there are almost no letters from me that our Theodor does not share with you.</p>
      <p>But why I have now decided to write to you: Piety towards my widowed mother-in-law compels me. For she has two sons dedicated to the study of letters, one already a young man and well advanced in the camp of the Muses, whom I instructed from the first rudiments, the other still a youth, whom, though I was unwilling, the boy's Minerva willingly dedicated to studies. In Stein of the Zurichers, he made some progress in the grammatical elements under a teacher named Leonard. Now, however, for the span of a year, he has made much more progress in Tübingen under the auspices of his brother Johannes Hospinian, so much so that he writes letters not without polish. Since the widow's slender means can no longer support him in his studies, she has appealed to me to write to you on his behalf, so that you may assist and advocate for him when he presents his case to the Zurich council. He will request that 30 gold coins, for which a golden chalice consecrated by his ancestors to the monastery of Stein was sold, be restored and converted to the boy's studies as the true use according to the testator's will.</p>
      <p>For since he who bequeathed it regarded the glory of God and the benefit of the church, undoubtedly both this and that can be promoted in the church no more than by honest letters and learned men. Nor is there any need for me to urge you further or, as they say, to add spurs to a running horse. For I do not doubt that the honest widow and the orphan are most commendable to you. For since you know from the prophet Isaiah how much God hates those judges who do not admit the cause of widows and orphans, you infer, on the contrary, how dear those are who help them and do not sluggishly hear their cause. So much for these matters.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is no need for me to describe the state of our church to you; for I do not doubt that this is being done accurately by our Megander. But in the meantime, I cannot remain silent that Bucer's followers (I think the Bernese) have tried with all kinds of plots, tricks, and machines to first remove Megander, then Erasmus, and finally me from office and position. Megander, indeed, because it was said that in our next synod he had disparaged the decrees of the first, so much so that he called it a worthless book, in German "ein hudelbuch". Erasmus, however, was to be appointed to some municipal Bernese church because Cunzenus publicly protested before the council that he did not want to act as Erasmus's colleague in the ministry of the word, and unless he himself were removed, he would already request a mission. And when the cause of this report was sought, he could not provide any just reason. As for my removal, they presented no cause except that the college from which we are supported is burdened with excessive expense. But thanks be to God, those technical men achieved nothing. For most of them, both from the lesser and greater council, immediately suspected the deceit. But about these matters, I will discuss more with you in person, if the Lord wills, during the grape harvest.</p>
      <p>Master Erasmus ordered me to send you many greetings. You will also greet Master Theodor in my name and communicate these things to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, August 21, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Rhellikan, friend and client.</p>
      <p>To the man endowed with uncommon learning and piety, Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed friend and patron. Zurich.</p>
