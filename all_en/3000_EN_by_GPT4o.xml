      <p>S. D. P. I received your response last year, my dear Bullinger, for which I am grateful. Although you yourself seemed to doubt what advice to give me, I understood from your letters that it was not advisable for me to come to you. I am still in the same place and residence, intending, however, to change my location when it is convenient and, unless death intervenes, so as not to leave my children among papist abominations. Your Decades of Sermons recently came into my hands, and I read the four sermons of the fifth decade on the sacraments to investigate your opinion on why, although the nature of the sacraments is the same, Christians are baptized only once but receive the sacrament of the body of Christ more frequently. However, since I did not find your opinion on this matter explicitly, I invoked God for true knowledge of this matter. After invoking, I began to feel that the will of Christ is the cause of this difference, so that if Christ had wanted people to be baptized more frequently without changing the effect of either sacrament, and to approach the Lord's Supper only once in life, it would have been necessary to obey His will, just as, if I am not mistaken, in the old law of sacrifices the same principle applied, although not all were offered equally often. If I am beginning to err in this matter, I would wish to be informed of your opinion on this matter. Those four sermons pleased me so much that I have decided to arrange for 500 copies at my own expense and, God willing, to send them next year from Amsterdam, the famous town of Holland located by the sea, as a gift to the preachers of the eastern towns not far from the sea, if perhaps in this way the truth can be somewhat promoted. In the meantime, I ask for your kindness and piety to first examine and transcribe for me any errors that may have occurred due to the printer's negligence in those sermons, so that I do not leave errors in the corrected version. The errors I seem to have observed are as follows: In the copy published in Zurich in 1532, folio 322, page 2, line 5, I would read "they think"; folio 334, page 1, line 19, I would read "are not very dissimilar"; folio 338, page 1, line 44, see if the sentence is complete "It is undoubted and that the apostles did not weaken the adversaries about the sacraments with any other battering ram more strongly and indeed" etc.; folio 341, page 1, line 44, see if instead of the word "signs" it should be read "ceremonies or elements joined with those ceremonies or something similar"; on the same folio, page 2, line 42, I doubt the case of the word "grace"; folio 342, page 1, line 45, I would read: simply, "they will ascend," not "he will ascend"; folio 344, page 1, line 8, see if the sentence is complete: "In this manner" etc.; folio 358, page 2, line 19, see if the word "in" is redundant; folio 360, page 2, line 13, see if instead of "next" it should be read "afterwards," for before the next night Christ had already shed blood; on the same folio, page 2, line 45, I would read "most"; folio 361, page 1, line 45, I would read "additions"; folio 369, page 2, line 3, I would read: "Likewise if the little word is"; folio 375, page 2, line 14, see if the word "indicates" is redundant; folio 376, page 1, line 23, see if the period is complete: "Moreover, when we experience in reality" etc.; I would read: "moreover we experience." It is now for you to judge, my dear Bullinger, whether I have correctly noted the errors or not. You, imitating Paul in describing the sacraments, use the words "sealing" and "seal"; I thus perceive that to seal for you in that place is the same as to bring to our mind, for the sake of confirming our faith in Christ, those things that are taught in the evangelical doctrine about our free justification, and that this is certain in this order first, when we see those ceremonies instituted being celebrated or otherwise remember them, certain thoughts as questions arise in us, why Christ instituted ceremonies, and to those thoughts almost at the same moment, with the help of the Holy Spirit, other thoughts succeed as a response that those ceremonies were instituted by Christ to be memorials, that those things which are taught in the evangelical doctrine and represented by those ceremonies are most certain and indeed as certain as those ceremonies instituted by Christ are. For unless our mind conceives such thoughts, the sacraments have no effect in us, just as the word preached about the remission of sins has no effect in us unless by the help of the Holy Spirit. This is signified by the word: that we revolve in our mind and believe; for I am fully convinced that the sacraments are considered among the given signs and that there is no cause for giving a sign (to use Augustine's words) except to impress upon another's mind that which is in the mind of the one who gives the sign. If Augustine had firmly kept this opinion in mind, he would not have doubted so anxiously about the salvation of unbaptized infants, as if baptism had some other power of justifying in itself. If that is your opinion about the word "sealing," I feel that I agree with you in this matter; if not, I would wish for a clearer explanation of this matter. Furthermore, if any Anabaptist here were to ask me: "What then, if that opinion is valid, should be thought about the baptism of infants, since their mind, as it appears to human reason, is not capable of such thoughts," I would respond that God, out of His ineffable love, has signified to His faithful adults not only themselves but also their offspring that He receives them into grace, from which they would never be excluded except by their own fault and disobedience (to use your words). Now, since God once deemed certain things, unworthy of the kingdom of heaven, worthy of observing signs of His goodwill towards the human race, much more should the bodies of infants be deemed worthy of observing the sign of divine grace, who are also partakers of that grace, especially since this is not only not contrary to the word of God but is rather confirmed by it. If infants cannot, as it appears to reason, transfer those sacred signs to use, let them at least transfer them when they have grown up and laid the foundation of faith. But why do I mention the Anabaptists, since they (as you also feel) have their Anabaptism as a sign of conspiracy into a new fellowship of superstitions or as a sign of new hypocrisy, not to write anything harsher about them. May the Holy Spirit enlighten all who wish to be taught.</p>
      <p>Make an effort, I ask, if you have the time, inclination, and ability, to send me a somewhat clearer explanation of the passage in John 3 about baptism in those sermons, and I think it would not be without benefit if it were also declared that the passages in Ephesians 5 and Titus 3 are to be understood sacramentally.</p>
      <p>I wish you would more often emphasize in those sermons that nowhere is it found that Christ said: "Whenever you do this or that, pronounce these or those words, then that bread, next to which this will be done, will be converted into my body or my body will be in or under it, etc." For we more readily impress upon our mind and remember things that are repeated more often. If it would be troublesome for you to repeat this often, then I myself, God willing, will emphasize it in a letter prefixed to those sermons, and indeed I will be more inclined to emphasize it because it was this very thing that first led me to discover that Luther, along with some others, was mistaken in this matter. For when the dispute arose about the presence of the body of Christ, and I did not have the writings of Oecolampadius or Zwingli, I read the words of the Lord's Supper with the utmost attention to see if it could be inferred from them that the body of Christ is really present in the Lord's Supper. The more often I read those words, the less I found that this could be inferred from them, so that before I left Wittenberg, I saw the true meaning of the words as if through a sieve. Later, I found the rule observed by Augustine and often repeated, cited in Oecolampadius's Antisyngramma, which, once impressed upon my mind, further clarified my vision, namely that signs often take the names of the things themselves. You, imitating Augustine on folio 333, affirm that signs, unless they have a resemblance to the things of which they are signs, are not signs. I doubt whether I should agree with your opinion; for (unless we sometimes wish to draw very distant similarities) there are many signs in general that have neither in substance nor in effect any resemblance to the things of which they are signs. However, I admit that the sacraments have a great and indeed suitable resemblance to the thing signified for reminding. It would not be useless if it were inserted into those sermons at what times consubstantiation and then transubstantiation with their circumstances began to prevail, noting at the same time the historians from whom this can be gathered. Since we should not doubt the truth of the body of Christ, I feel that each nature in Christ has retained its own property. However, I myself oppose this opinion with the fact that Christ sometimes walked on water with His body without sinking, although with the property preserved, the opposite would have happened; likewise, Christ fasted for 40 days and nights, etc. I wish to know how this argument is explicitly resolved. If you do not wish to respond to everything, I do not want to be a burden to you; respond as much as you wish. If you will not be burdened by responding to something, then send your letters with this address: "This letter should be sent by the honorable Bartholomeus Boichorst or Jasper from Lennep, borrowed in Cologne, to Diederich Beck, citizen of Ruremond, my good friend." Since you do not write very perfectly or clearly, I ask that someone else write your letters to me, so that I do not perhaps deviate from your writing in correcting errors.</p>
      <p>For what I have proposed, God willing, I will accomplish unless death prevents me, which indeed can easily happen; for the plague is raging here. I judge the natural cause of the plague to have been frequent earthquakes or corrupted air, which, erupting from the earth, moved the earth and infected our air, which we inhaled. For between the twenty-first of March of the year 54 and an unknown date in May of this year 56, we felt the earth move more or less fifty times here and in neighboring towns and villages. Meanwhile, on the sixteenth of July of the year 54, this city suffered a great disaster with about 700 or 800 elegant buildings burned, and on the twenty-sixth day of the same month, namely ten days after that incredible and horrible fire, a large part of the walls of those burned buildings was thrown down by a great wind, so that even impious men admitted that this city was being punished by divine intervention. However, I do not see repentance, which is why I would like to have conveniently changed my location. May God deliver me from all evil and keep me in His truth, for which I ask you to pray to God for me; I will pray to God for you and have prayed. Do not send your letters to me more certainly than during Lent through merchants going to the Frankfurt market.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given at Ruremond in the Duchy of Guelders on the twenty-eighth of August in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>Theodricus Beccius Laurentius, your sincerely devoted friend.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest friend.</p>
