    <p xml:id="regest1">The reasons given by Bullinger for not sending him his [Commentary on Matthew] are not convincing; however, this should not be understood as a request. Together with [Ludwig] von Reischach, he welcomes the dismissive attitude of the Zurichers towards the French [King Francis I]; the people of Basel pay too little attention to the mandate [against the mercenary service]. The Basel councilor [Niklaus] Escher, originally from Zurich, moves to Solothurn because of the French money; even in the council, there is shameless talk in connection with the mercenary service. After the devastation of the J端lich lands, another French advance into Luxembourg is of little use to [the Duke] of J端lich [Wilhelm V.]; as Cleves and Guelders also take up arms, a bloody war threatens. - Continues writing after the sermon: Reischach has heard from passing horsemen that only a few [Dutch] troops would winter in Luxembourg, which is why he considers the news from Strasbourg about the return of the French to be false. Rumors about an attack on the Confederation, postponed only because of the war in Hungary, and about Emperor [Charles V's] plans to occupy Milan. Whoever trusts in God is well provided for. Greetings. The messenger came too early.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is surprising what you write: "I did not want to burden you with a large book," etc. Do you not know that books are compared to gold? And indeed, the greater it is, the more pleasing it is.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there must be another reason why you have sent nothing, even though you have sent everything you have written so far; for the other reasons you add are entirely invalid. Although I accept and consider fair whatever you bring forward in your defense. Nor do I wish you to interpret this as if I am asking for something; but I wanted to respond to you in a friendly and straightforward manner.</p>
      <p>I greeted Lord von Reischach in your name and explained what you wrote about the Frenchman; thus, the people of Zurich are more and more pleased that they do not want him, and they pray for their steadfastness in the Lord. And indeed, they seem to me to act wisely because they do not respond, lest they come into conversation; for that devil is so cunning that he would use it badly. May they endure, and the Lord will be with them. Here, we certainly stand very poorly in the French business, while after such a severe mandate, a penalty is imposed, so that the best people say it will be a spur for many to rush out in groups at the beginning of spring.</p>
      <p>In these days, a citizen and senator of Basel, having renounced his citizenship, is preparing to move to Solothurn, only because of the French gold, which he does not need at all, so it is astonishing for a rich and young man to act this way. His name is Escher from the family of the Aeschers. There are leading figures who marvel at chains made from twisted crowns and do not conceal this in front of fools.</p>
      <p>They dare to speak quite shamelessly when the conversation turns to soldiers, even in the senate. This is for your ears only.</p>
      <p>The Duchy of J端lich has been most miserably devastated and occupied by the Brabants, and although the Frenchman has returned to the Luxembourg region and devastates again whatever is left, perhaps if he can thus distract the queen's army, I do not see what benefit there is for J端lich. The people of Cleves and Guelders are now finally preparing arms. Here, unless peace is made, a very bloody war is to be feared.</p>
      <p>I wrote this much before the sermon; after the sermon, Lord von Reischach, during a conversation, said: "Yesterday," he said, "I met some horsemen on the bridge, who came directly from the royal army. When I asked them about the leaders and the army, they replied: 'The leaders have gone to the queen to request a dismissal (Entlassung), as they call it. The soldiers have been dismissed except for a few banners, which will winter in the Duchy of Luxembourg.' You see," he said, "the lies that are spread about the Frenchman, that he had returned to the Luxembourgers." Therefore, I am at a loss, after I have learned the higher matters from Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, a merchant from St. Gallen said here in recent days that he had heard through the Palatinate's territory that if the Hungarian disaster had not occurred, war would certainly have been waged against the Confederates. And something is truly to be feared, especially if the rumor flying about the emperor, that he is about to occupy Milan temporarily, turns out to be true.</p>
      <p>Thus things stand. Blessed are those who can say from the heart: "I am the Lord's."</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all good things. Greet Theodor. Basel, November 22, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>The messenger came too early for me in my haste.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the Church of Zurich, his venerable in Christ.</p>
