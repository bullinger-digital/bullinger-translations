      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. It would not be worth the effort to describe the state of German liberty, with so many widows and orphans exiled everywhere, so many treasuries finally exhausted, so many crops devoured by locusts, not Spanish, but German ones.</p>
      <p>For you, with your unique wisdom, understand more, indeed you can predict the future state of Germany better than I could proclaim with many words. Once, the Germans were valiant, but now everything is boiling with sedition, deceit, crime, lust, and anger. O good God, turn your wrath away from us, give us the spirit and courage to truly repent by worshiping you rightly, and let the Son free us; then we will truly be free. Our prince has not yet returned; he is dealing with a relative. May the negotiations be successful, so that we are not reformed from the truth once confessed and the practices observed in our church until now to ducal customs, which God forbid. We are all so stubborn that we will not change even a finger's breadth from the old practice. You understand what I mean. Pray for us to the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, that he may preserve us whole with his usual mercy, etc. The mercenaries from Lausanne who were recalled will be sent to you. The rest from the younger Fagius.</p>
      <p>Greet everyone in Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, 6 days before the Kalends of September 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>Our people in Christ greet you, the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, their esteemed brother.</p>
