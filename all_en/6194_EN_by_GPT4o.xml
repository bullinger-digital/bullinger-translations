      <p>Augustin Blaurer.</p>
      <p>S. I am responding to your very detailed letters, but later than I would like, because I am overwhelmed with countless tasks. I am grateful to you for what you have written so diligently about that Hannibal, whose forces are rumored to be heading towards Genoa.</p>
      <p>They also say that the Neapolitan coast is being harassed by pirates and that uprisings have been stirred up in the kingdom itself; it is added that some fleet from Barbary is expected in Corsica by someone who has rebelled against the Genoese. Others think that all these things are fabricated by the executors of the Council of Trent, so that we do not inquire into their plans, and it is certain that even last week the king was solicited by the pope against this city; but nothing was answered to his legate except perhaps something privately.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Savoy has recently begun to test our spirits through that Ringrave, as if he seeks nothing less than our freedom. He also openly affirms that he is thinking of nothing less than war, and we know that he is by no means equipped with money or soldiers. It was answered that we too are very desirous of peace and will not refuse any fair condition with the neighboring prince, but have no plans separate from our confederates. Meanwhile, we are fortifying the city as much as we can, and we keep frequent watches day and night, at great, but necessary expense, until our Lord also dispels this storm, which all our friends bid us to hope will certainly happen.</p>
      <p>What you write about some people being beheaded in Lyon is completely false; only one commoner was hanged for seriously wounding a nobleman with a dagger who was searching the citizens' arms by the king's order.</p>
      <p>Our people were forbidden from public assemblies; but privately, sermons were always held in many places and baptisms celebrated, and our people were promised to pursue the building of their churches. However, it is certain that much deliberation has often been made about establishing a council and taking away all freedom from our people.</p>
      <p>But the Lord has so far miraculously broken all the efforts of the enemies. The Navarrese, the Ferrara, and even the Savoyard continue vigorously.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the plague is very severe, so much so that sometimes two hundred are buried in one day, and people suddenly fall dead in the streets; finally, it has invaded the very chambers of the nobles.</p>
      <p>Thus it finally happened that the dead pushed out the living and the plague expelled the court to a nearby town called Crémieu.</p>
      <p>Our people immediately returned to the sermons.</p>
      <p>The enemies tried to have Viret expelled as a foreigner; but he did not lack patrons. As soon as the king arrived in that town, he suddenly began to fall ill, and after lunch, when he vomited his food and was seized with a headache, he caused many to fear that he too was suffering from the plague; but the next day he recovered, indeed, what everyone marvels at exceedingly, the queen mother is entirely intent on bringing him back to the city immediately; but I do not think he will have many companions.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Ferrara, as I believe, has also arrived there to greet the king, as they say. In almost all other places in France, there is quite a lot of peace, especially in Paris.</p>
      <p>In Burgundy, a massacre of our people took place in a small town called Cravant. Aumale, the brother of Guise, the governor of Burgundy, was sent to punish the seditious, as if it were possible for prostitutes to hinder brothels. However, unless he does his duty, I fear that many neighboring nobles of our party will not bear it patiently. Therefore, the Lord must be asked that no greater tumult arises from there.</p>
      <p>Condé, having sent letters to me, laments that many things were done not only negligently but also disgracefully last year, which he also did in the assembly, and he promises everything will be better.</p>
      <p>His wife, truly pious, is either already dead or utterly despaired of health, as I learned yesterday from the letters of her mother. He himself wrote very sharply to the queen, whose letters to Philip he intercepted, and there is no doubt that this also greatly helped to impede the plans of the malevolent. The Admiral and many other nobles of our party were together with Condé for some time, and I do not doubt that they too are taking counsel about their affairs and the church. May the Lord God of hosts look upon his own with his serene countenance and scatter his enemies with terror. As for us, we continue by the grace of God, who has so far kept us in peace.</p>
      <p>We are also free from the plague; but the senate was forced to decree that no one coming from Lyon may stay in the city unless they have been purified from contagion for eight days.</p>
      <p>Nor should this be burdensome to them, since there are quite frequent villages and some inns not far from the city. If the plague continues, I greatly fear that stricter measures will be taken; I hope, however, that our people will always remain far from that most monstrous barbarity, which is exercised elsewhere so much so that those coming to us from Lyon are forced to spend the night under the open sky and endure countless inconveniences.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant us to make progress in these great calamities, so that we may seriously turn to him.</p>
      <p>I have commended all those you wrote to me about; but those noble Poles immediately left, and I was not able to speak with them. I gave letters to that Hungarian to friends, not only in Bourges but also in Valence and Orléans. As for that writing, it is not yet completed, but I hope it will be finished next week, and then it will be easily printed, since it is very brief; for what can you do with those who oppose manifest truth with mere obstinacy or certainly with insensitivity.</p>
      <p>However, I hope that whatever this writing is, it will not be displeasing to you. Something will also be added to Eber's empty talk. A response to Baldwin's insults has also begun to be printed.</p>
      <p>Thus you see that I am not lacking in things to do, and may the Lord grant that I do something for his glory and the benefit of the church.</p>
      <p>My father, I pray the Lord to keep you happily along with the rest of your colleagues, whom I also wish to be greeted in my name. But behold, I have passed over what should have been said first: I am very grateful to you for having received those boys into your home, by which singular kindness you have bound not only me but also their excellent father to you forever; I hope they will be obedient to you and therefore pious and good. Your people who are here, by the grace of God, satisfy us.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. July 15, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>When I write to you, I think I am also writing to our dear Blaurer, about whom whenever I think, and I think very often, that wound* reopens, the feeling of which I will never lose except with life.</p>
      <p>I wish him to understand all these things and that our well-being is most commendable to him.</p>
