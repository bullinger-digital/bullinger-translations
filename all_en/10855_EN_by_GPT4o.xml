    <p xml:id="regest1">Feels very connected to Bullinger due to his Bible commentaries, even though he does not know him personally. Comments on the use of the verb "allegare" in Bullinger's writings and sends his description of the Diet [1530], which was already promised to Zwingli, for evaluation. Bullinger should arrange for the printing of his [rhymed] Bible summary at Froschauer's - the first edition was carelessly produced - and then have a hundred copies sent on account to Göppingen or to Ulm to Hans Varnier or Martin Frecht. On May 1st, Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, Landgrave Philip of Hesse, and several city leaders came to Göppingen with Bucer, where Bucer and the Landgrave had a conversation the following day; after Bucer attended the sermon on May 3rd, he rode with Musculus, Wolfhart, Frecht, and Schuler via Esslingen to Eisenach.</p>

      <p>Neither with tongue nor pen can I express, most learned Bullinger, how much I pursue you with love, though absent and unknown to me by face; for the silent points of your commentaries somehow inspire us with the affection of your mind. Having therefore found a correspondent so suitable and humane, I could no longer remain silent like Angerona or Harpocrates.</p>
      <p>Receive, therefore, in place of a keepsake and the beginning, as I hope, of a friendship, two bonds: First, like a pig advising Minerva, I remind you from time to time that the word "allegare" is used improperly, if we believe Cardinal Hadrian in "De modis Latine loquendi," for citing and adducing. Zwingli used this word elegantly in "De magistratu," saying: "God must be more frequently entreated, so that he may finally allege a Moses to us." If this admonition is pleasing to you, make it so that I may receive a book in exchange for a little word. Second, I had promised your, indeed our, Zwingli, in the presence of Carolstadt and others who were dining with us in his house, that I would describe the emperor's diet in the vernacular. Therefore, these trifles, until now sung or rather murmured by me and the muses alone, I send to you, who hold the place of that hero of the divine and incomparable word, and I pray that you do not disdain the trifles and trifles for the sake of a friend.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, the parish priest of the Palatine Duke and Boniface, acting as a churchman in Augsburg, extracted from me a summary of the Bible, and a certain printer, too hasty for the sake of profit, omitted many things. I would very much like you to act as an advocate with Christoph Froschauer in our name, so that he may reduce it into three volumes, as they call them, in the smallest type and format in which he published the New Testament in 1533. Many pious and learned people complain daily, so that they can carry it with them in their bag. As soon as he has brought the work to completion, let him send us a hundred copies, or if the courier to the bitter spring is lacking, send them in our name to Martin Frecht or Hans Varnier towards Ulm; to whomever he then wishes, money will be paid in his name (for we ask nothing for free).</p>
      <p>On the first of May, Duke Ulrich, the Duke of the Cattans, and the leaders of the cities came to us with Bucer, who the next day had a conversation with the Duke of the Cattans for almost an hour. On the same day, our prince's parish priest, in my hearing, asked Bucer to preach the next day. He immediately promised to do so. However, when the compulsion was made and Bucer was ready, he was compelled to act as a spectator, not an actor (the princes know what the cause was). Furthermore, scarcely was the sermon finished when Musculus, Boniface, Frecht, Gervasius the Scholar, and many others were coming to the chapel, with whom, after taking food, Bucer rode towards Esslingen. We must pray to the Lord that the concord of Eisenach in Thuringia does not succeed in the manner of Mandrabulus, as it is said.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From our study in Göppingen, on the eighth day before the Ides of May in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Joachim Aberlin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his [own].</p>
