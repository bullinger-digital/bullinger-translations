    <p xml:id="regest1">[Oswald Myconius and Simon Grynaeus] came to Bern on August 17 [for discussions about the Wittenberg Concord]. Since the Strasbourg theologians [Bucer and Capito] explain in their clarification of the [Wittenberg] articles that the body of Christ is received by the faithful mind as spiritual nourishment, just as Abraham and the fathers have already enjoyed it, and that there is no contradiction to the writings of Oecolampadius and Zwingli, the Bernese theologians recognize this clarification as consistent with the [First Helvetic] Confession. They assume, in agreement with the Zurich and Basel theologians, that the article on the manducatio indignorum can be understood to mean that the godless eat only the sign, not the body of Christ. This position, drafted without consultation with the other Oberland churches, is not to be understood as a [binding] resolution.</p>

      <p>On the 17th day of August, the well-learned and our exceedingly beloved lords and brothers came to us in Bern [...].</p>
      <p>Regarding the declaration and explanation, as set forth by our dear lords and brothers from Strasbourg concerning the articles, we say thus, yet explain it in a non-conclusive manner: Since they state that the opinion of Doctor Martin Luther and his followers is not that in the Holy Supper of Christ there is a bodily, but rather a spiritual nourishment, which is received only by the faithful mind, and that we also do not eat the body of Christ, who sits at the right hand of God, in any other substantial way than how Abraham, along with other holy fathers, ate it before His incarnation, and in summary, that this explanation contains nothing that Doctor Oecolampadius and Master Huldrych Zwingli, both of blessed memory, have not taught in their writings about this supper, as all this is handled with many words in the writing from Strasbourg, we can only say that such an explanation sounds exactly like our confession, set forth in Basel, except for what is written in the fourth article about the eating and drinking of the body of Christ by the unworthy, where if that article can be endured, as far as a person is faithful, he eats the body of Christ, but if he is godless, troubled in heart, with evil intent, then he does not eat the body of Christ, but only the sign and the sacrament, we can well tolerate such an explanation, as our dear lords and brothers from Zurich and Basel also do, by our confession, which we have set forth with sincere and righteous hearts, in good hope that we may remain by the same confession and Christian understanding. We also do not intend with this our explanation to have decided anything for all other Oberland churches, but if we could find better and be informed of it, we would always gladly follow for the sake of divine truth. Amen.</p>
      <p>The servants and readers of the church in Bern.</p>
