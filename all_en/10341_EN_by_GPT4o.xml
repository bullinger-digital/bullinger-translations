    <p xml:id="regest1">Even if Mayor Jakob Meyer was disappointed by his negotiations in Zurich, the people of Basel should not give up their mediation efforts between Bern and Zurich, nor their hope for success. The response from Zurich to the mayor was not dismissive, but cautiously awaiting; Zurich is asking for concrete proposals. The foundation for unity has been laid; with a little goodwill from Bern's side, further progress could be made on this.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Even if your consul, the true father of the country, a most holy and wise man, was not entirely pleased with our response, I do not want you to despair. For now is the time to apply diligent hands to the weary matters. If you cease, you will bring harm to both us and yourselves. Therefore, encourage your people to continue tirelessly. Our response was as follows: "If the people of Bern have attempted something impossible in our misfortune with us, we must commend it to God. However, we bear no ill will towards them, considering them faithful and dear confederates. If they or Basel were to propose something now in Baden or elsewhere, it should be resolved amicably and further pursued. But if nothing is proposed, silence should be maintained." This was decreed with the greatest consensus of all - I know this for certain -, even if some have given a response filled with verbosity. You see, the foundations of concord have been laid, provided your people do not cease and the Bernese do not continue to be Bernese, that is, arrogant and obstinate.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray that the Lord may guide His church.</p>
      <p>Last day of December 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most faithful pastor of the Basel church, dearest brother.</p>
