    <p xml:id="regest1">Happel hopes that Bullinger has received his letter sent about four months ago [hbbw XX, No. 3061]. Martin Frecht, the head of the Ulm church, was supposed to forward it to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">In the letter, he asked Bullinger to pay him the [owed] amount he had lent to the Zurich students in Marburg. However, if the amount is instead handed over to the young people from Wetter [Johannes and Justus Vulteius] studying in Zurich, Bullinger should acknowledge this to the Wetter family with a letter. This way, Happel could soon get his money back from them. So far, he has only received 40 guilders. The outstanding 34 guilders, as well as an additional four and a half batzen and four white pennies, he can hardly demand from the unwilling-to-pay [Vulteius family] without the receipt, because the payment to the young people from Wetter has not yet been confirmed. As Happel knows from a letter addressed only to him by [Johannes] Fabricius [Montanus], a part of the money owed to him has already been paid to the students from Wetter, and they are supposed to receive another part shortly. However, Fabricius did not note how much it is. Since the relatives of the Vulteius brothers cannot rely on Fabricius's letter, they refuse to pay Happel the remaining amount. In case Happel's last letter with his request never reached Bullinger, Bullinger is excused, and also if Happel should not be paid at the upcoming spring fair [in Frankfurt]. However, it could also be (which Happel does not want to assume of the Zurich students) that they cannot immediately settle their debt due to their poverty, but still pretend to Bullinger that they have paid Happel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Happel's last letter included the printed anti-Pauline theses by Theobald Thamer, which he still defends persistently and sharply. Thamer has written an entire book on the matter and now wants to publish it, provided the Marburg church leadership allows it. Ultimately, he is a hypocrite and enthusiast, whose dismissal and exclusion from the Marburg church every reasonable man demands. But that is impossible without the consent of the [imprisoned] Landgrave Philip of Hesse! Thamer has returned to Marburg from Kassel and behaves just as before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">In view of the difficult times, the University of Marburg is thriving quite well again. As far as Happel knows, it is not in any danger. Therefore, the people of Zurich can certainly [again] send students there, especially since everything has become cheaper now. If it comes to that, Happel would be at their service and would also ensure that they only acquire the necessary books and clothes and consequently spend much less [than the previous Zurich students]. This would work particularly well if they were accommodated with him, which could be arranged very well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Apart from that, Happel has nothing to report. Bullinger should forgive him if he made a mistake in haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Best wishes to Bullinger and his entire family. Greetings to Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Gessner, Rudolf Gwalther, Otto Werdmüller, and all other [pastors and scholars].</p>

      <p>Four months ago, I wrote to your kindness, most esteemed sir, and ensured that the letter reached the hands of Mr. Frecht, the head of the Ulm church, so that it could be forwarded from Ulm to Zurich, and I hope it has been delivered to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The letter contained a request that you would be so kind as to assist me in promoting my cause or that of the young people from Wetter in my name and in procuring the payment. If this was done, you would inform the friends of the Wetter family through a letter, so that they could settle the matter with me more quickly. For I have only received 40 guilders from them. The remaining 34 guilders, as well as an additional four and a half batzen and four white pennies, I could not decently demand from the unwilling, because neither I nor they have been informed until now whether the young people from Wetter have received what is owed to me from your students, except that Heinrich Faber alone wrote to me that they had received part of the money owed to me. However, he did not specify how much, but mentioned that they would receive the rest shortly. The friends of the Wetter family found this letter suspicious and therefore refused to make the full payment to me. Therefore, if your kindness did not receive my previous letter on this matter, I excuse you, especially since I have not been fully satisfied at the upcoming fair. For it could be (though I do not dare to assume this of your students) that, due to poverty, they cannot immediately pay, yet claim to you that they have settled the debt with me.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, my previous letter included the printed anti-Pauline theses of our Theobald, which he still defends most stubbornly and tenaciously. He has written an entire book on the matter and wishes to publish it, if he can obtain permission from the leaders of our church. In essence, he is a hypocrite and enthusiast, and every sensible man, as far as I know, wishes him to be excluded from the ministry and the register of our church. But this cannot be done without the consent of our most illustrious prince. He has returned from Kassel and is behaving like the old Theobald.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Our school has begun to flourish again, despite the difficulties of these times, and as far as I know, there is no imminent danger. Therefore, I would not dissuade you, if it seems good to you, from sending more young people to us. As for me, I promise you all my effort, diligence, and loyalty. Everything is now purchased at a lower price, and if they are recommended to me in this way, I will ensure that they only acquire the necessary books and clothes and spend much less, especially if they live with me, which they can now do comfortably.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Besides this, I have nothing to write. Therefore, I ask you to kindly overlook any mistakes I may have made in haste due to the pressure of time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell with your entire family. Please convey my greetings to the most esteemed and reverend gentlemen, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Gessner, Rudolf Gwalther, Otto Werdmüller, and all other good men.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious gentleman, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy head of the Zurich church, his lord and teacher, to be honored with holy faith. Zurich.</p>
