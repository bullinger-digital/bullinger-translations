      <p>S. Lysmaninus delivered your most loving letters to me, whom I was expecting at any moment and did not want to return to you without my own; however, since he is delaying his return more than expected and has indicated that he will be traveling to you, I preferred to inform you through him about my health, which has been confirmed by the Lord's kindness, rather than leave it in doubt until his uncertain arrival. Around the beginning of October, I went to Rheinfelden with my entire household, except for one maid, and returned after a month and a half, minus one day. On the fifth day after my return, I was seized by certain chills throughout my body, followed by a convulsion on my right side and difficulty breathing, along with several other accompanying ailments, with which I struggled for almost an entire month. But the Lord looked upon me with favor and granted me relief through the prayers of many pious brothers and sisters. Indeed, it would have been better to be transferred to that blessed and most desired rest than to be tormented here longer amidst the pressures and storms of the world. But it is only right that we submit to the will of the best Father, which cannot be anything but the best, and not abandon our post without the Emperor's command. I earnestly ask you to join me in imploring Him, so that I may complete the remainder of my course, which is undoubtedly brief, with His company and support, providing strength to my body and cheerfulness to my spirit, successfully and with some fruit. As for you, my dearest Bullinger, you count me among the excellent and pleasing minds, much more as a friend than in truth, for I fully recognize how I excel in nothing and how irritable I am. The Lord has made use of my ministry, however small, in establishing certain churches in Swabia, and I now realize too late how imprudently I have watched over certain matters, which I would now wish to have executed more accurately and according to the rule of the divine word, especially concerning the discipline worthy of Christian men, where I see with great sorrow of my soul how everything lies in neglect and coldness. Ah, how gravely many have sinned here, whose efforts and works, if they had been as vigorous and indefatigable in building Christ's church as they were in destroying those papal abominations, would not now disturb and almost completely ruin the churches of Christ with so many offenses. You, my Bullinger, my dear and cherished brother in Christ, who are so influential among your people with the authority and spirit of Christ, do this with the greatest care and diligence, as much as you can, so that you may not justly be seen to have failed here and to your own.</p>
      <p>We must soon stand before the tribunal of Christ, whom we must have as a favorable judge, and you know how we must conduct ourselves in His house. May He preserve you, as I uniquely desire with all my heart, in good health and strength in His work for as long as possible. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Biel/Bienne, December 27, 1555.</p>
      <p>Greet very respectfully your entire household with all the brothers and friends, especially your fellow ministers in the Lord, the very venerable old man Mr. Pellican, Theodor, Gualther, and the others, whose prayers, especially yours, I uniquely desire and hope to be aided by before Christ. Fuchsius, who is neither a consul nor a senator now, also suffering from poor health, Funclius, Mr. Jacob Witenbach, etc., send you many honorable greetings. I wish my cousin and I could be as present to your wife's brother as we desire with all our hearts.</p>
      <p>I spoke to the pious old man in Rheinfelden, truly anxious in spirit and overwhelmed by his son's misdeeds. My cousin, although she will not need his services much longer, as she has handed over the deceased husband's estate to the heirs, has decided to give him 20 florins annually out of pity for such a good old man. Nowhere does it seem that enough can be done to meet the man's needs. The Lord of Landeck wanted to appoint him as a steward, as he had a fairly good position; but he fears the son, as he might have to ride out. He is a fearful man, looking far and wide around him, unable to finally decide; it is too short here and too long there, and truly difficult to help him. He is old and declining, so it is feared he will not be of use much longer. The miserable wretched son also causes him much grief. Oh, how good it would be if he did not hover over the ground, for he has committed much and great evil in many ways; I have heard wonders upon wonders, entirely credible, and yet, if one did not know him, he could wonderfully deceive people. Duke Ottheinrich should truly be warned before he might suffer with him. May the Lord God have mercy on him and on all of us. I trust you have read the imperial decree concerning religion; you should have prepared yourselves accordingly. If this peace is maintained, it would indeed be more than a great gift of God; but it is feared that when the enemy sees his advantage, he will say that faith is not to be kept with heretics, and, as they say, the Emperor's speech is always: "There is a time for promising and a time for not fulfilling." Well, it is up to the Lord whether He signs the matter with His Fiat. Nevertheless, it is a peace worth more than gold, although the free and imperial cities are burdened by having to tolerate idolatry as they have until now, alongside the word of God, against which they should have rightly protested. Although I hear that Strasbourg has sent an embassy to the king.</p>
      <p>To the very distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed and most beloved brother of all.</p>
