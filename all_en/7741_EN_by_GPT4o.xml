      <p>I pray to the Lord God and our heavenly Father for the most prosperous entry and progress of the present year for you and yours. I also hope that you, my most esteemed lord and friend, and yours are in good health. By God's grace, I and mine are quite well. As for the state of our affairs, nothing occurs to me now that I consider worthy of writing, except that the things that happened in the Netherlands some time ago have now been more clearly reported to us. I send these inscribed on the present sheet along with a few others to you. Otherwise, everything is in the utmost silence everywhere. Rumor says that within a few weeks new plans and new expeditions will emerge, which, although I think it is fabricated, the current state of affairs makes it not unlike the truth. Furthermore, I ask you to receive with your usual kindness the small gift, namely the 8 gold coins enclosed here, which I send to you in the customary name of New Year's gifts.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, January 5, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your most observant, Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
