      <p>S. For the example of the French response, my dear Bullinger, I am very grateful; for its use may perhaps be necessary for us and hopefully equally fruitful; however, we will use it with the caution that faithful communication may not be a fraud to you. The turbulent and calamitous state of Italy sufficiently declares the endeavors of the Roman Antichrist, whose fruits these are. The same proves how much he strives more than his predecessors to extinguish the light of truth shining everywhere, even by condemning not only some of the ancient fathers for merely Erasmus's criticism, but also some of Augustine's writings simply, and even Scotus himself, adding that he tries to change some things in Gratian's decrees, to remove not a few things that do not serve his tyranny. We hear that Cardinal Morone is held in chains as suspected of Lutheranism, and also that the Bishop of Cremona has been summoned to Rome for the same reason and is in danger. Reginald Pole has also been summoned to the city more than once, who, fearing something, uses the intercessions of the English queen and other pretexts, and finally turns in every way not to come.</p>
      <p>Cardinal Carafa, who passed through here, had an encounter with Philipp in Brussels for the sake of honor, from whom he is said to have been received with more than royal magnificence; however, he suffered misfortune in his lodging, as it burned down to the foundations in the dead of night. He barely escaped safely, while all his belongings were consumed by fire; but he will easily compensate for that loss with the king's preposterous generosity, by whom he is almost worshipped. A trustworthy man told us for certain about the Bishop of MÃ¼nster, that he has been seriously striving for a long time to obtain legitimate and truly episcopal administration and legitimate marriage, and when he realized he was playing a futile game with the hardened college of his canons, he voluntarily abdicated the bishopric. The same indicates that the Duke of Cleves is seriously deliberating about the reformation of the churches in his principality and is inclined towards the form that was formerly instituted by Archbishop Elector Hermann of blessed memory.</p>
      <p>We must pray to the Lord to mercifully assist these pious endeavors, so that His name may be propagated in those two famous and quite large duchies. The Worms Colloquy, as you write, has been completely broken off, which they hoped would be restored by the resolution brought by the Roman king. However, the adversaries could neither be moved by arguments nor by the royal mandate to return to the conversation they had begun, distrusting the cause they support, which is both very bad and against their conscience. President Julius Pflug also insisted not ignobly among his party's men that they should comply; but it was a tale told to the deaf. Therefore, our people, to make it clear that the cause of breaking off the colloquy was not given by them, published a document in their name, of which I send you a copy. Moreover, what I especially wanted to write, you are not unaware, my dear Bullinger, that for a long time now, some of the most pious men of our churches and most loving of us have sought through serious and varied deliberation a way by which not only those who profess Christ in the empire, with dissensions removed, might establish Christian concord among themselves, but also we, who have embraced Christ in the Swiss regions, might be included in the same bond of Christian agreement, who indeed desire the complete society of the members of Christ to coalesce, to remove scandals born from controversies, from which triumph comes to the adversaries, grief to the pious, and a grave impediment to the weak in undertaking the true profession of Christ. And since those same good men did not think they could achieve as much as necessary through writings here and there or through legates and intermediaries, because writings of whatever kind in controversial chapters hardly ever satisfy the reader, a fuller explanation and diligent back-and-forth discussion is often required, it seemed right to direct their plans to a universal synod of the pious and learned, where the doctrine of religion would be discussed fraternally and peacefully. They seem to have progressed so far with faith and diligence that we can hope for a place for our churches in their assembly and that we will be heard, which (as you know) could not be obtained until now, when the adherents of the Augsburg Confession met among themselves with the Swiss churches excluded and condemned. Therefore, we indeed earnestly approve of this endeavor, intending to give thanks to God if He has opened this door to mend the common peace of the true churches, and we are in good hope that the same spirit will not be lacking to those who will gather in His name, so that without the loss of truth, the unanimity of Christ's servants may be mended and confirmed, and as if with joined hands, it may be allowed to attack the common enemy, powerful and persistent, with Christ as leader. But we also piously presume that this opportunity, if offered, will be judged by you, dearest brothers, and others as neither ungrateful nor to be neglected, especially since it is known that the illustrious Philipp Melanchthon will be present at the assembly, whose clear testimonies of respect and love for our churches exist. He recently promised the brothers, when leaving the city of Worms, that if a synod is convened in those regions, he will attend of his own accord, even if the Saxons refuse to come; besides him, other outstanding men of God, known to be endowed with singular fairness of judgment and moderation, will not be lacking if it proceeds, with whom we hope for a pleasant and fruitful conversation about piety and religion. I write this at length to you, my dear Bullinger, not only in my own name but also in the name of my fellow ministers, wishing to be informed of your (missing word: will) and the brothers', whether, if a convention is ever called and you are invited with other Swiss ministers, you would be willing to appear, provided it is allowed by the consent and permission of the most illustrious magistrates, so that we can signify to friends not only our readiness but also that of others and add encouragement to proceed in undertaking the pious work. Once we have received your opinion, we will also seek the opinion of the Bernese and others. The outcome of the deliberation is indeed uncertain, and there are many things that often delay holy endeavors; but we write this, raised in the best hope, who do not think there is any danger in declaring our readiness.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with the fellow ministers, whom you may greet reverently in our name. Basel, January 7, 1558.</p>
      <p>By this student, please reply.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer in the name of the fellow ministers and his own.</p>
