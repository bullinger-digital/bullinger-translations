      <p>Greetings. When Mr. Vergerius was with us in Zürich last May, in the presence of Mr. Rod. Gualther and Mr. Laelius, most esteemed and beloved brothers in the Lord, he presented letters from the most illustrious Prince of Württemberg, in which he said that the most honorable Basel council was being admonished not to allow any books, even those containing objectionable content, to be printed without selection. The occasion for the prince's concern was given by that booklet on the greatness of the kingdom of God, written by the blessed one, which I so greatly approve. To which I replied: "What do you say, Vergerius? Do I approve so greatly? When you know that in letters written to Mr. Caelius, I have dissuaded the publication of that book in every way." He replied: "I know, Bullinger, nor am I unaware that Martyr in Strasbourg did not approve of that book in every respect. What gravely offended the most illustrious prince was that it says in it that men can be saved even without Christ." I, however, said: "In the written copy," I was saying, "I did not see or observe that; the printed version given to me by the author himself I have not read. However, I do not believe that anyone can be saved without Christ, since I know that in Him alone is the salvation of the whole world; therefore, I abhor such doctrine." "What then will you say," he added, "if someone writes that the miracles of Christ were done by magic art?" I replied: "I will say it is an impious writing." But Vergerius said that something like that was printed in Basel. I, however, had neither seen nor heard of such a thing before and added: "I would prefer that such books be printed nowhere in the world, since the world, otherwise most depraved, questions and almost mocks divine matters. Here my Gualther also added that he would prefer only the best to be printed and therefore praised the zeal of the most illustrious prince, who has some reason for this matter. All these things were heard by Mr. Laelius, an eyewitness and earwitness, and these are the very things that were transacted in the matter between Mr. Vergerius and us, about which you wished to be informed, I have faithfully explained. If you, Mr. Caelius, have initiated any accusation or excuse, beware not to involve me in the matter. I hate disputes and such contentions from the heart, nor do I write this to supply you with arms and material, but so that you may not be ignorant or suspect otherwise of what was said and done between us.</p>
      <p>See to it that you do not misuse these my letters with ingratitude; for I do not wish in any way for either my letters or myself to be involved in these disputes. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zürich, 16th of July, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet on my behalf, from my wife, your most honorable wife and dearest children.</p>
