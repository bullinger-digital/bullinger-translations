      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Regarding the servant of the baker in Vienna, Austria, who was burned, I have this to say: You know how the priest took the sacrament with the monstrance from the hands on the day of our Lord and trampled it underfoot into pieces. They captured him for a long time and tried to persuade him that he had sinned against the Holy Spirit, and if he would retract his error and say he was misled by the Zwinglians, then he would receive a mild sentence. He refused and consistently said that idolatry is the most cruel, for which the Lord has finally sent the Turk. He was brought before the judge, and 1. his tongue was cut out so he could not speak to the people, 2. both his hands were amputated, 3. he was burned by fire.</p>
      <p>He was very steadfast and constantly directed his eyes towards the people; he moved many to shed tears. The priests triumph. The martyr said to the judges: "If it was God, why did he not defend himself, why did he not destroy me with lightning? You will soon have others who will criticize your superstition, and if you do not listen to them, you will be servants of the Turks." This about the baker.</p>
      <p>We hear absolutely nothing from England, and someone came to us yesterday who returned from the Netherlands, telling various stories about the Emperor's illness. The eldest son of the captured Duke is in Denmark, perhaps to solicit the king, to see if he can free his parent from that Caesarean captivity. The Saxon cities still defend themselves strongly against the tyranny of certain scoundrels. You have undoubtedly heard about the treachery in Brunswick. The cities must be vigilant so that they are not overwhelmed by these plots. Farewell. January 15, 1550. Greet Theodor, Pellican, Gwalther, and especially our Frisius. Farewell.</p>
      <p>I send to you the bull of the devil; for the pope is dead, who gave these... most vain bulls.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>As I was closing the letters, these sad news were sent to me from Strasbourg: Fagius in Cambridge has passed to the heavenly homeland on November 23 from a long quartan fever, which almost ended in consumption. Bishop Latimer is lying mortally ill.</p>
      <p>Bucer is in good health, if it can be said that he is in good health after the death of his most faithful colleague and fellow exile. You will hear more about this soon, undoubtedly from Mr. Montio himself, who received letters from England in those days, which he will also share with you.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his ever-revered lord.</p>
