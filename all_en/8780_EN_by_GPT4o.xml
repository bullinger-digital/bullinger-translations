      <p>Greetings in Christ. Dearest brother and most esteemed lord, I would like you to attribute the fact that I have not responded to your frequent letters not so much to my ingratitude, but to the very serious impediments of various matters. For, to omit many other things that have hindered this journey of my love towards you and the habit of writing, the first and most serious cause is the extreme force and magnitude of a recent illness of mine, with which the Lord has so miserably and for a long time exercised me, that I had completely abandoned the thought of these matters.</p>
      <p>To this is also added a certain daily burden of affairs, which that place in which I am now placed causes me daily; by which I am so nearly overwhelmed, that no opportunity is granted to me either to relax myself or to write to others.</p>
      <p>Finally, even if enough time and leisure were given, the nature of this time is such that nothing can be sent from us to you, especially since everything is so blocked by land and sea that it is not safe to send letters.</p>
      <p>I received your most recent letters last December, and having read them, I took care with as much diligence as I could to satisfy your request.</p>
      <p>As for that nephew of yours and those others of yours whom you recommended to the Bishop of Norwich, you have fallen upon a man who perhaps had the greatest willingness to gratify you, but certainly not the least ability. For while he recently entrusted the management of his affairs too confidently to treacherous men, it was accomplished through their work that he was overwhelmed by a large debt: thus it happens that he cannot extricate himself from these miseries, let alone be able to assist others. However, partly moved by the memory of your kindness, and partly because I understood that I would be doing something pleasing to both God and especially to you, I undertook to help them. Therefore, I quickly took care to send them to the University of Cambridge; and to make the way easier, both for learning our language and other languages, I decided to place them in different colleges, so that their constant association would not hinder the study of learning foreign languages. Although I myself am greatly troubled by the difficulty of my own affairs and expenses, I nevertheless provided each of them with twenty crowns from my own resources, so that the burden of living in foreign places might be lessened. In all other matters, as far as my own circumstances will allow, I promise not to fail them, so that they may more freely pursue their studies here, which will someday benefit the Church of Christ.</p>
      <p>For I have always considered it a noble thing to sow a benefit, which the sheep of Christ can later reap in due time. As witnesses of my not the greatest liberality, but of my sincere goodwill and love towards them, I have sent their letters to you; so that you may understand more fully from their letters than from mine what I have done. I also earnestly ask you to convey my many greetings to my dear friend and brother in Christ, Rudolf Gwalther. May the Lord Jesus Christ promote you and your labors, which you endure in spreading the Gospel of Christ!</p>
      <p>Given in London, England, 17 February 1572. Your dearest brother in Christ, Edwin Sandys, Bishop of London.</p>
      <p>To the venerable father and dearest brother in Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the Church of Zurich in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Letters of Edwin Sandys, Bishop of London, and Rod. Zwingli, Rod. Gwalther, Heinr. Buttler, 17 February 1572.</p>
