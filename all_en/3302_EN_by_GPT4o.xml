      <p>S. I received your letter, most esteemed Bullinger, quite unexpectedly at that time (for I was expecting the autumn fair) on the fifth of June. The reason I have not responded until now is that I have not found a convenient way to send a reply; for I am detained in my house as if a captive. I am not allowed to go out in public; hence, I am forced to be ignorant of whatever is happening there. I indeed asked the bearer of your letter, that barber from Z端rich known to me for twelve years, a good man, today held in honorable regard among the citizens of Worms, to return to me when he found someone going to Z端rich; but since he did not return, I must conclude that he found no one. In those same letters, among other things, you piously exhort me to patience in bearing the troubles which are especially burdensome to the elderly, particularly if they come from those who were once more friendly and from whom you had deserved well. Therefore, I will anxiously and diligently pray to God to grant what you exhort; otherwise, it is impossible for my corrupt flesh. You, too, will help me with your prayers to God in this, I know.</p>
      <p>I am greatly delighted by your homilies on the Apocalypse. I wish I could read them before I depart from here.</p>
      <p>For hardly any book has tormented me more until now. The same joy I have for the annotations on Jeremiah; but that you have decided to dedicate them to me, as I embrace your love towards me, I still do not recognize myself as worthy of such an honor. It would be more pleasing to me if you, with your colleagues, the most holy and God-loving men, would deign to intercede with your prayers to God for miserable me, that He may grant a blessed departure from here, worthy of a little sheep of Christ, so that on that day I may be placed at the right hand and hear that joyful and eternally gladdening voice: "Come, you blessed of my Father," etc. What you write about the affliction of Italy due to the perpetual and incessant war grieves me greatly; I would have wished better for her, regarded as the parent of humanity and good letters, for us Germans, who, subjected to a torn empire, truly (as you write) have a mirror set before us in which to look, we who for more than thirty years have heard the Gospel of Christ preached more sincerely than our fathers, yet hardly made better by a hair. I rejoice indeed for the people of Piedmont for their great faith and pious and steadfast confession of Christ (if all), who bear the name of Christ and today rejoice to be called evangelical, that we might be like them in piety and fearless confession. However, the pious among us hear with joy that your delegation and some of our princes have softened the king's tyrannical decision. I embrace the blessing you appended at the end of your letter, as indeed from a true apostle of Christ and most faithful minister. It will be a consolation to me when I must depart from here.</p>
      <p>Thus far in response to your letter received on the 5th of June. Then, on the 30th of July, another was sent by you, brought by your son Johannes Rudolf, upon seeing the inscription, I immediately said: "This is the hand of my Bullinger," and turning to the son (I did not yet know who he was) I asked: "From where do you bring the letters, are you from Z端rich?" Smiling, he replied: "Yes, indeed, the son of Master Bullinger." Hearing this, I was filled with no small joy: I asked how your father is, how your mother, and your sisters with their husbands... and that you all may be well, also how many children you have. He answered modestly and wisely to each, so that I plainly recognized him as the true son of Bullinger, silently congratulating you with myself, not so much for the numerous as for the noble offspring; for this is a singular blessing of God, from which I, miserable, am deprived. However, as he was hurrying to the ship with his companions, I was not given the opportunity to inquire further or to open and read your letters in his presence, but having wished him well, I then dismissed him. From this, I easily gather that you, as a parent of so many children, must incur no small expenses, and also supporting two sons in the study of good letters abroad. I praise both your prudence and piety in this matter; very few parents have such things at heart. I now return to you through Froschauer fifty Rhenish florins, a moderate and small aid for such expenses, which I received from yours. Perhaps, if I survive, there will be an opportunity to add to this from time to time, which may the Almighty grant. Amen. Regarding my wife, I cannot conceal even this from you as a friend: she is not towards me as she was (do not understand this concerning marital chastity or fidelity), when in recent years we were together with you... I could now be much more generous to your church, which I love most ardently, as I do its ministers. She is bewitched by relatives who cause this trouble for me, men without God and particularly hostile to me because of my confession. They render my wife disobedient and slanderous, and it is their greatest joy to exercise me in this way and to hasten death for a seventy-year-old, so that through my wife they may finally obtain what I have acquired and earned by my labors. This is that Helen.</p>
      <p>However, following your advice, as I have not ceased until now, so I will not cease hereafter to admonish her to be better, if perhaps God may deign to inspire her with a sounder mind. But if not, this cross must be borne by me, an old man, as much as is given from above, patiently.</p>
      <p>In this, I ask that you deign to assist me with your prayers to God. But lest I conceal anything from you: Agninus has begun to interpose his efforts between me and her; there is good hope not in vain. If you commend this matter to him at your convenience, I do not doubt he will apply greater diligence. I had not yet received your letters to be sent at this fair when I was writing this; for I sent these ahead to Frankfurt to Agninus; but after I receive them, I will respond even if it is necessary to do so. Farewell with all yours in Christ Jesus, most excellent and happiest, most esteemed Bullinger, half of my soul. From Worms, 5th of September, in the year etc. 57.</p>
      <p>Most devoted and entirely yours, Wolfgang Waidner. To the most illustrious, most learned, and at the same time most pious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister and indefatigable teacher of the greater church of Z端rich, his most esteemed lord and most beloved teacher and father in revealing divine mysteries, etc.</p>
      <p>"He gives to the sons 50 florins in the month of September 1557. I thank him for the gift, I received nothing from him; for I ordered Froschauer, who wanted to count it, to retain it, as I would not accept it."</p>
