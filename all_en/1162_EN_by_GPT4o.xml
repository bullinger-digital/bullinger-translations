      <p>I truly implore the healing hand of the Lord, that He may restore you to health as soon as possible and preserve you in it for a long time, since you, if anyone, are truly worthy to be strong in the fight, as you devote yourself entirely to the salvation of others by meditating, preaching, writing, and doing all your work. Farewell with all your brothers and friends, both yours and mine. Pray diligently for us; my only little daughter is ill, whom her mother and I have always loved tenderly and uniquely; if the Lord would now, in this bloom of age, protect her with mercy from all the dangers threatening the world, the dearer she is to me, the greater thanks I would have for Him. Farewell. January 22.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new that you do not know, except that a pious, credible nobleman told me he knows and has good knowledge that there is great wealth and estates together on these lands of the foreign people, which are constantly increasing; for many from the nobility are also constantly waiting for news, including some Confederates, among whom he also named Josef von Baier to me. The servants are well and honestly paid, having various ducats, crowns, thalers, etc.</p>
      <p>Oh, God the loving Father, let us see that He can, might, and also gladly would help us, if we now also arranged ourselves in such a way that He could answer for it with honor.</p>
      <p>But now your letters dated January 18 have been returned to me, for which I am grateful. The package you received from Bern was sent to Bern by my Funckli from Biel. Do with Schero what seems right to you; I know he loves and respects you as hardly anyone else, a man truly worthy of your reciprocal love. As for the merchant and the other, about whom you write, I will not be further concerned, as I see myself burdened with great hatred; if the ministry of that church were to fall to Johann Rudolf, and perhaps he would moderate this game of his, to which he is now called. If Schertlin is wise, he will give way to anger, so that others are not exposed to either hatred or dangers because of him.</p>
      <p>But farewell, my dearest and best brother. It was most pleasant to read in your letters that you have recovered by the Lord's kindness; commend me to Christ.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
