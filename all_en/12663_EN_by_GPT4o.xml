    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] has received Bullinger's letter from September 25 [HBBW XVII, No. 2597] and has taken note of his concerns. He also thanks Bullinger for his expressed goodwill and good wishes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The inaction of the [Four] Cantons is really not the right stance. If the enemy were attacked from multiple sides, they would have to divide their forces and would be easier to defeat. It should also be noted that if the Pope [Paul III], Emperor [Charles V], and King [Ferdinand I] were victorious, they would attack the Four Cantons, whether they had gone to war or not. One should also consider the pressure exerted by the Duke [Charles III] of Savoy on Bern [due to the occupation of Vaud in 1536]. All of this should be carefully considered!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Several times, they were very close to the enemy, but no battle ensued because the latter avoided it. The events at Ingolstadt have already been reported [with HBBW XVII, No. 2581]. In the present attachment, Bullinger will now find records of the recent events.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The [Schmalkaldic League] naturally always ensures that they never completely give up their advantageous position. Even now, they are in a camp that is difficult to capture. However, if one wants to engage in combat, the enemy must be provoked even more.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] This as a friendly communication.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [Attachment:] When the [Schmalkaldic League] learned on October 3 around 2 PM that the enemy was moving towards Nördlingen to capture the city, they hurried after them with the entire army. However, as night fell, no attack took place.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] On October 4, the [Schmalkaldic League] aimed to protect the city of Nördlingen from an attack by the Imperial forces. Early in the morning, however, the enemy turned against the rearguard of the commander [Friedrich von Reifenberg], probably with the intention of preventing the [Schmalkaldic League] from occupying a hill near Nördlingen, which they might have wanted to occupy first. Therefore, the Landgrave, who led the middle column, allowed the Elector to advance with the vanguard so that this hill could be occupied. Meanwhile, the middle column moved slowly, and the rearguard was urged to move closer to the middle column.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] After the vanguard crossed the [Forellen] stream, the landgrave's troops of the middle column camped on a hill from where both the rearguard and the vanguard could be observed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] It seemed as if the imperial army intended to attack the middle column and the rearguard. Therefore, the Landgrave sent some strong cavalry squadrons to assist the rearguard and positioned himself with the cannons in a broad battle formation (if the middle column had also crossed the [Forellen] stream to join the vanguard, the rearguard would likely have suffered damage). The Elector, who was informed of the situation, also sent several cavalry squadrons back and moved his troops towards the middle column.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] When the enemy saw that the [Schmalkaldic League] was in battle formation, they hesitated to advance. Nevertheless, skirmishes occurred throughout the day, during which the Imperial forces suffered quite significant losses, while the [Schmalkaldic League] lost only two cavalrymen and four or five infantrymen. Afterwards, the enemy withdrew, while the [Schmalkaldic League] remained in position and only moved to the camp in the evening.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] On October 5, the enemy provoked fierce skirmishes, in which they lost 50 to 60 soldiers. There were also several losses on the side of [the Schmalkaldic League]. [Prince] Albrecht of Brunswick-[Grubenhagen] had a cheek pierced; hopefully, he will recover (he has since died). Count Johann of Waldeck was only shot, a Polish servant [...] was hit in the arm, Philipp Schenk in a leg, Andreas Finck in a thigh (he then died). Johann Awerswalt was shot in the back (he has also since died). Additionally, [Henning] von Burtfeld fell. The [Schmalkaldic League] accidentally shot one of their own, the noble Stenilz.</p>

      <p>Philipp, by the grace of God, Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc. Our gracious greetings beforehand. Highly learned, dear, special one, your letter, which was given on the 25th of September, we have read its contents and graciously noted your concerns, and we thank you for your goodwill and wish that God grants us victory.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>However, we do not believe that this is the right way, that the Christian places remain silent and do not act now (since it concerns the eradication of religion). For if the enemy were attacked on more than one front, they would have to divide their forces, and it would be easier to deal with them. You should not think otherwise (whether the four places of our religion remain silent or not): If the enemy were to attack us (which God graciously prevent), those same four places would not remain unchallenged by the Pope, Emperor, and King! Furthermore, you know how Bern stands against the Duke of Savoy, - which is still not forgotten. You should further consider this carefully!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>As far as the war matters are concerned, we have approached the enemy several times. However, he never wanted to engage in battle. What happened at Ingolstadt, we have reported to you before. What has happened recently, you will find enclosed to see.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Now we do not intend to completely give up our advantage. Therefore, we have positioned ourselves in such a camp where he can hardly defeat and break us. However, if a battle is to be fought and something achieved, we will have to seek the enemy even more. May God grant us His grace for this. For it does not seem to us that he is eager to fight us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Which we did not want to hide from you out of gracious intention, to whom we are particularly inclined. Given in our field camp near Nördlingen, on the 8th of October, in the year, etc., 46. Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, signed. For the chancellor S. Bing, secretary, signed.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, our dear special Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the Holy Scriptures in Zurich.</p>
      <p>1546. What happened with the enemies on the 3rd, 4th, 5th of October.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>When we learned on the third of October, albeit somewhat late, around two o'clock in the afternoon, that the enemy was moving towards the city of Nördlingen to take advantage and also capture the city, we quickly rose with all the troops on horseback and foot and moved towards the enemy. However, night fell, so we could not engage in any significant action on the evening of the third of October.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>On the fourth of October, however, our final intention was to relieve the city of Nördlingen, which the enemy had taken up (since he had challenged it) with force. Just at daybreak, the enemy engaged our commander, who had remained behind us on the night of the third of October and therefore also had to follow on the fourth of October. Now we thought the enemy wanted to prevent us from reaching a hill near Nördlingen, but rather that the enemy might have wanted to occupy it before us. Therefore, we, the Landgrave, allowed the Elector of Saxony to advance with the vanguard towards such a hill and height. And we slowly followed with the middle column, and were intent on calling back our rearguard from the skirmish to follow us, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Now when the vanguard had completely crossed a water and was a considerable distance ahead, we did not hurry too much with the field column, but rather occupied a hill and stayed there for a while, so that we could observe both the vanguard and the rearguard.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>We then noticed that the enemy was advancing with all their troops, and since our vanguard was a good distance ahead, the enemy seemed to intend to attack our middle column and rearguard. They sent some strong cavalry squadrons towards our rearguard. Now there was a water between our vanguard and middle column. If we had attempted to cross such a water with the middle column, it would not have been possible for the rearguard to join us without damage. Therefore, we quickly decided to strengthen our rearguard with some cavalry squadrons. We formed our battle order, spread it out wide, and positioned our field artillery with it. And since our dear cousin and brother, the Elector of Saxony, was with the vanguard, we sent to his grace, that his grace send us some cavalry squadrons back; which his grace did. And when his grace learned that the enemy was so strong, his grace moved back with the troops of the vanguard towards us and the middle column.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>When the enemies saw that we were arranging ourselves in such a battle order, they hesitated to advance; but various good skirmishes occurred throughout the day, in which the enemies suffered quite significant damage, and we, on our side, thank God, lost no more than two cavalrymen and about four or five foot soldiers. Afterwards, the enemies withdrew and, to cause more disturbance, fired their artillery on horseback at all costs. We, however, remained in position until the evening, when the enemies had all withdrawn. Then we also moved with our troops in good order to our camp. And it was truly a fine spectacle to behold.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Yesterday, on the fifth day of October, the enemies advanced hard against us and started a skirmish with us, which was so fierce that on their side well up to fifty or sixty remained. And on our side, several good people were also injured. Duke Albrecht of Brunswick was pierced through the mouth with a spear. We hope it will not harm his grace (he has since died). Count Johann of Waldeck was also shot, but it did not harm him. One of our servants, a Pole, was shot through an arm, Philipp Schenk through a leg, and Andreas Finck through a thigh (he then died). But Johann Awerswalt was shot hard in the back (he has also since died). Over this, one of Burtfeld's men was killed. And another, named Stenilz, a nobleman, was shot by our own, as he had no field sign; and our men thought he was one of the enemies.</p>
