    <p xml:id="regest1">In the name of Abbot Joner, he urges his friend Asper, who has become estranged due to Joner's friendliness towards the Reformation, to restore their old friendship and to follow him (i.e., the Abbot) on the path to understanding and recognizing the reformational principle of scripture. He describes this path as his own experience, how he advanced from the Scholastics, especially the Decretists, through the Church Fathers, finally to the Holy Scripture, provides a theological justification of "sola scriptura" and defends it against Roman Catholic objections.</p>

      <p>Letter to Rudolf Asper about the matter of scripture. To the distinguished man Rudolf Asper, my most sincere friend, Volcatius.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Certainly, I could justly complain about you, who suddenly from a most ardent friend have become quite lukewarm. What is it that you desire in me? What venerable bond has been broken? Who is the author of this unjust separation? Who is so wicked, so nefarious, and so impious? What tongue is so venomous and deadly? May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips! What can you not do, impious tongue? What, I ask, do you say is neglected? Please, if there is anything that is alien to your mind, indicate it and do not wish to give credence to the insane clamor and fabricated lies of anyone. You know that until this day, evil demons, envious and contentious men have envied friendship. If you desire anything in me, come, I am ready, behold you have an old friend and more than an old Volcatius, indeed an old Anius, for you will not find the spirit of Polymnestor in me. Arsocomas, a common man from the people of the Scythians, was about to discuss great riches before Leucanor, king of the Bosporus: "I do not possess wagons," he said, "nor herds, but I have two honest and good friends, such as no other Scythian has." He meant Macenta and Lonchates. The outcome of the matter itself taught how much strength the true friendship of two had. True friendship is so powerful in all things that it surpasses royal power and conquers the greatest riches. It is clear that this was no less mutual between us. Let Amizoce and Dandamidis go away, let Blitte and Blasthenes depart; why then should I not complain about sudden misfortune? The Virgilian Nisus thought he had lost his life with the death of Euryalus; and could I believe that I could live securely with my other Euryalus alienated? All the works of Cicero, Valerius, and Lucian are small compared to ours! - But where does grief carry me, meditating on far different things, if perhaps by the grace of God the ashes or sparks of ancient friendships could be rekindled, restored, and revived! And unless I have little favor with God, if not the true friendship of anyone, yours above all, I hold sacred in my esteem.</p>
      <p>I know that various opinions about me and mine are being circulated here and there, perhaps if they were brought to light, they would be more lies than opinions, bringing me envy rather than friendship, discord rather than peace, fabricated only by the most wicked men, to whom the devil is dearer than Christ. For he has always been the author of both murder and lies, as this one is of truth and peace. I would wish them to be endowed with the same spirit with which I would have wished them to be endowed. And so that you may recognize my intention from me, I will speak with you briefly, so that you may recognize my innocence and at the same time your unjust hatred towards me. I am convinced, however, that if you appoint that former spirit, gentle as Hercules, as judge, it will not oppose me. But if he knows better, I beseech and implore by Christian charity, the symbol of baptism, and if anything remains anywhere of our old friendship, let him act as a teacher; although in the meantime I am certainly persuaded that no wise or good man will oppose my undertakings.</p>
      <p>Thus far, we have spent a good part of our life on those decrees and decretals, the summaries (as they call them) and the sentences, not without considerable labor and finally even (if it is permissible to say) with the greatest tedium, because one attacked the opinion of another and another rescinded the decree of another. We hesitated frequently, examined all opinions, found contradictions, with some adducing Innocent, others Nicholas. Here I eagerly turned my mind to those foremost and leaders of the church, read, pondered, and found them not in agreement, with one determining this, another decreeing something else. The reading of Eusebius and Epiphanius will provide abundant testimony, in which it is necessary that there was deviation, at least on one side. The arms of these I saw to be scripture, the goal scripture, the target scripture.</p>
      <p>Cyprian, that most eminent writer among the Greeks and Latins, bishop and martyr of Carthage, wants everything to be regulated by the scriptures. There are still testimonies of this matter in the first book of letters, letter 8, in this manner: "It is adulterous, impious, sacrilegious, whatever is instituted by human fury, so that divine disposition is violated." "Let no one, brothers, make you stray from the way of the Lord, let no one snatch you Christians from the gospel of Christ," etc. And in book 2, letter 3: "From that," he says, "which Christ the master both commanded and did, one must not depart by human and novel institution." "One must not depart at all from the evangelical precepts; and the same things that the master both taught and did, the disciples also must observe and do, the blessed apostle teaches more firmly and strongly in another place, saying: 'I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace' etc. Gal 1,6. 'And that Christ alone should be heard, the Father also testifies from heaven saying: 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear him' Mt 17,5. Therefore, if Christ alone is to be heard, we should not attend to what anyone before us thought should be done, but what Christ, who is before all, did first; for it is not fitting to follow the custom of man, but the truth of God, when through the prophet Isaiah God speaks and says: 'But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men' Jes 29,13. And the same Lord repeats and says in the gospel: 'You reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition' Mt 15,6; Mk 7,9; but also in another place he puts and says: 'Whoever breaks one of these least commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven' Mt 5,19. 'Now if we are priests of God and Christ, I do not find whom we should follow more than God and Christ, since he himself says in the gospel: 'I am the light of the world; whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.' Therefore, lest we walk in darkness, we must follow Christ and observe his precepts, because he also said in another place when sending the apostles: 'All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth' etc. Mt 28,18. 'It is therefore fitting for our religion and fear, that we keep the truth of the Lord's tradition, so that when he begins to come in his glory and heavenly majesty, he may find us holding what he advised, observing what he taught, doing what he did.' I omit the letter to Pompey written against the letter of Stephen, in which he wants only the scriptures to be heard and by the example of the channel teaches at the end of the letter how the bishops of the Christian republic should act.</p>
      <p>Augustine, not the least doctor of the church, plainly does not want to be believed unless he brings the scriptures; he does not want to assent to the fathers, however learned and holy, unless they bring the scriptures. His open testimonies are to D. Jerome, Casulanus, Fortunatus, and Vincentius, as also the author of the decree Gratian recounts some traces, Dist. 9. Jerome, both most eloquent and (so to speak) most talkative, excellently learned in Greek, Hebrew, and Roman, asserts almost nothing in his excellent work Commentary. He writes commentaries, but who does not know what a commentary sounds like? Hilary, bishop of Poitiers, wants to refer the sense from the scriptures, not to the scriptures. John Gerson, chancellor of Paris: "With the same ease it is despised, as it is approved, what does not have authority from the scriptures." And time would fail me before I could bring forth Chrysostom, Cyril, Gregory of Nazianzus, Athanasius, and Origen among the Greeks, Ambrose and Tertullian among the Latins. These, I say, contradictions, this treatment of the scriptures by them, their example and imitation moved me to turn my sails from them also to the source of the sacred letters; for they also referred me to them, do they not also confirm all their things by the scriptures and refute them by the scriptures? How much better, according to the voice of our Bernard, to drink from the sources themselves than from the streams? - I think I have defended myself in this cause so far, that you have not found much impiety in my undertaking. I proceed.</p>
      <p>As I proceeded to the scriptures, it is amazing how much delight occupied my mind, everything was sweet, everything smelled of ambrosia, no tedium against it, so that I thought the voice of Christ in John 4 and 7 was completely fulfilled in me, and without delay I find things conforming to my business and the fathers: false prophets are plainly not to be received, namely those who do not bring the word of the Lord, Deutero. 13 1-5. For a false prophet is one who does not bring the word of the Lord - John 10 1: "He who does not enter by the door is a thief and a robber"; Jeremiah 23 21: "I did not send them, yet they ran" - just as those are prophets, sent and apostles, who brought the word. Matthew 10 41: "He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet" etc.; Romans 10 15: "And how shall they preach, except they be sent?" - Again, nothing of human dreams is to be added to the word of God, Deutero. 4 2 and 12 32, Proverbs 30 6, in the words of the Lord alone must one stand, Joshua 1 7-8 and Psalm 1 2; only the word is to be heard, Jeremiah 7 23 and 23 16ff; this itself is sufficient and plainly nothing is to be changed, Ezekiel 34 11 ff. - Why many words? I proceed, I come to the New Testament. Here Christ proves everything by the ancient scriptures, wants to be known from the scriptures alone, John 5 39ff; they recognize him from the scriptures, John 12 16. The apostles confirm their things by the scriptures, as is clear in Acts; everything is regulated according to the scriptures Acts 15 14-21. Paul, "the chosen vessel" Acts 9,15, always brings forth the scriptures. - Here I patch together: if the Son of God, who is the wisdom of the Father 1Cor 1, 24, does nothing without the scriptures, why do we still doubt to regulate everything by the scriptures?</p>
      <p>In short: I find the New Testament to be nothing other than the interpretation of the Old, except that it promises, this teaches what is exhibited; that is more hidden, this more open, that acts with coverings and figures, this with manifest signs and its own reality. According to what the Lord says in John 19,30: "It is finished," and D. Paul in Romans 11-2: "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, which he had promised afore by his prophets" etc. And Christ himself, raised from the dead, expounds nothing but the scriptures to the disciples going to Emmaus, Luke 24 27. Is it obscure that the apostles spoke only from the scriptures, after they were also illuminated by the Holy Spirit? Take Paul's letter to the Romans, the method of the whole scripture, and you will find it compressed into a handful, yet if you find anything alien to the scriptures, I would be lying. The same Paul, putting an end to this dispute, wants everything to be tested in Thessalonians 5,21, what is good, to be held; forbids that human doctrines be received, 1.Timothy 6 3-5.11, Titus I13-14; forbids that anything be added beyond his preaching, Galatians 18. He states this about the scriptures 2. Timothy 3 16-17: "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" etc. Thus there he wants Timothy to remain with the scripture alone a little before 3,14-15, which indeed could make one truly learned and which he had imbibed from the cradle.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, here I was thinking: perhaps not everything is committed to writing. However, this false opinion was extorted by the letter dedicated to the Romans, in which our salvation is comprehensively included: law, gospel, sin, punishment, grace, faith, righteousness, Christ, God, good works, charity, hope, affliction, the just, sinners, the strong, the weak, how friends are to be treated, how enemies. It was extorted by the sufficiency of the Old Testament, whose end and interpreter is Christ, Romans 10 4, and when I saw that the New Testament is nothing other than the interpretation of the Old. How then could it be that some doctrines of our times were orally handed down by Paul and passed on to us as if by hand, when Paul is consistent with himself, yet these things contradict his writings? - Now I too required nothing more, when I saw the ecclesiastical leaders content with the books of the Bible we have, and if anything different from these were commanded, it would be adulterated. See Athanasius the Greek on the books of both testaments, also the Symbol of Rufinus the Latin writer and Jerome's helmeted or Prologue to the books of Kings. The canonical books were received, that is, they began to be believed, not approved, and although some fathers cut off apocrypha from the natives, yet from this no other genuine scripture books were approved, but partly already approved by the books of the old instrument, partly by the Holy Spirit and God himself. What are the books of the old instrument like? Examine, by what judgment even Jerome may be judged, not from the dream of his own head. Tertullian also supported my opinion, discussing in this way in De praescriptionibus haereticorum: "For us, it is not allowed to indulge anything from our own judgment, nor to choose what anyone has introduced from his own judgment, we have the apostles of the Lord as authors, who themselves chose nothing from their own judgment to introduce, but faithfully assigned the discipline received from Christ to the nations. 'Therefore, even if an angel from heaven should preach otherwise, he shall be accursed by us' Gal 1,8. And again: 'They are accustomed to say that the apostles did not know everything, agitated by the same madness, by which they are again turned, that the apostles indeed knew everything, but did not hand everything down to everyone, in both cases they cast reproach on Christ, as if he sent apostles either insufficiently instructed or too simple. For who of sound mind can believe that they were ignorant of anything, whom the Lord gave as teachers, held inseparable in company, in discipleship, in fellowship, to whom he explained obscure things separately, saying to them that it was given to them to know' etc. Mt 13,11? 'He had plainly said at one time: I have yet many things to say to you, yet adding: When the Spirit of truth comes etc. John 16,12f; and indeed he fulfilled the promise as the Acts of the Apostles prove' 2,1 ff. 'The Lord openly declared, without any indication of some hidden sacrament, and commanded that if they heard anything in darkness and in secret etc. Mt 10, 27. Did the apostles neglect these things, if they did not fulfill them, hiding something from the light, that is, the word of God' etc.</p>
      <p>Immediately I; here as if having found the fruit of palms, I rejoiced with joy, that having so easily overcome the labors (through the fathers) as if through some steps I had ascended to the summit of things, and I saw from the testimony of scripture and the fathers that scripture alone and uniquely is sufficient and does not need human ingenuity to be patched. Therefore, with a fixed foot, I held that scripture alone is to be followed, as sufficient, without any human addition. If now your spirit would want to be angry with me, come, let it be angry with scripture and the holy fathers, who also pushed me here as if unwilling. However, here too I was stuck between a rock and a sacred place. Immediately it occurred: faith to you alone? Scripture is veiled with many mysteries, you will receive the sense of scripture from the fathers. And again from the opposite side, this stronger ram strikes me with this noise: indeed, scripture has the same spirit that it had from its beginning, therefore it is permitted to us also to apply ourselves to it alone. For it is known that the primitive church did not read Thomas, not Scotus, not Anthoninus, not Augustine. Augustine indeed proved his understanding from the scriptures according to his word: There is no place in scripture so obscure that it is not explained in another place. And as often as the fathers fight among themselves, they run to the scriptures, certainly as to the light; for the more unknown things must be demonstrated by the more known. If indeed scripture were so obscure that it could not be understood without Augustine, it would be more hidden than Augustine's writings. 'But this being admitted, it must be conceded that the holy fathers did nothing else with their commentaries than, while they prove their things by the scriptures, they proved the more known by the more unknown'; but 'who is so insane'? Did the Holy Spirit not want to be understood and to descend only upon those who are wise and rabbis? But here Christ cries out: 'I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.' And Tertullian says: 'This is the matter of secular wisdom, rash interpretation of the divine nature's disposition. Indeed, heresies are suborned by philosophy.' 'The apostle had been at Athens' Acts 17,16ff and so on. And would that I could ascribe all these things to you! Therefore, the prophet's sentence is most true: 'The entrance of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple' Ps 119,130. Read here the alphabetic Psalm 118 and you will find wonderful things about this matter. Again, 1 John 2 27 is written: 'And you do not need that anyone teach you, but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in it.' Where you hear that understanding is given to the spirit, which is also promised in Jeremiah 31 33-34, to which Christ assents in John 6 43: 'They will all be taught by God.' So also Paul: 'But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by Christ. These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual' 1Cor 2,12-13 etc. But who dares to detract the spirit from believers? For that would be to accuse Christ of lying: Matthew 77ff, Mark 1124ff. Therefore, scripture is to be interpreted by its own sense, that is, by the sense in which it was written, also agreeing with your decrees. For if this is not allowed, why was it allowed to Augustine in the meantime endowed with no other privilege and baptized with us in one baptism and drunk with us in one spirit? If indeed it was allowed to Augustine, who is so bold as not to want us each to prophesy, in the meantime when Paul wants all to speak, so that among those sitting there is judgment 1Cor 14,29? You yourself know that no one interprets the scriptures more correctly than the spirit itself, which produced them. Do you therefore distrust God promising the spirit? But what is this distrust? Where is the Christian spirit, where are the promises, where is the washing of regeneration? - I with Augustine say in John tractate 16, as often as a more difficult place occurs: 'Receive, beloved, what I feel here without prejudice, if you feel something better. For we all have one teacher and are fellow students in one school.' And again tractate 18: 'According to my measure I take what I set before you; where it is opened, I am fed with you, where it is closed, I knock with you.' Relying on these, I trust nothing to myself, I do not trust the fathers, as they did not want to be believed beyond the scriptures. I add nothing, I take away nothing; I handle scripture alone, interpreting scripture by scripture. Go now, and do not be angry with me, but with Christ or Augustine!</p>
      <p>But hey you, I know what you are pondering in your mind. If - you say - the ancients handled the scriptures with such diligence, why then do you impiously protest? Why do you not believe? Why do you constantly strive against them? You deny Augustine, you reject Jerome, you do not want to hear Ambrose? - I confess, they handled the scriptures diligently, and would that their study had lasted to our times, truly now we would not be agitated by such storms. We believe them, as far as they propose the scriptures, we prudently decline and by their command, when they do not propose. Augustine admits he erred and, to say nothing of the rest, is he not a most eloquent witness of himself in the books of Retractions 98? How often do the schools receive the fathers without selection, Augustine sometimes spoke excessively to them, Jerome is harsher, Origen is to be read cautiously. How often do the jurists call the opinions of the fathers chaff! Then Augustine himself: 'Do not,' he says, 'serve my writings as canonical.' The saints understood the scriptures, yet they erred very often. Indeed, if the interpretation of Augustine, Jerome, and others satisfies and if we are devoted to them, why do we embrace Thomas, Bernard, Durandus, and Scotus, who sometimes refute the sayings of the ancient fathers? Why then would it not be allowed to us, what was allowed to them? Moreover, if it was not allowed, why did they do it? Was not the spirit also promised to us? Do we not also have the scriptures?</p>
      <p>What shall I say about councils? They erred very often. Did not the Council of Mileve on free will, grace, sin, and merit agree with the new (as they call it) doctrine of our times? Did not the African synod on the primacy of Peter support the Lutheran (as they say) doctrine? What shall we say here? Do these contradict the rest? If they contradict, it is necessary that one erred; if they agree, where is our dissension? Or how will this question be ended? Where will error be discerned? From bishops? From doctors? But could they not also be deceived? Anastasius and Liberius, Roman pontiffs, were Arians. See also what Cyprian of Carthage with his bishops decided about rebaptizing heretics. Indeed, if we depend entirely on them, do we reject the sacred letters? But what then is more uncertain than Christianity? But the bishops of the ancient councils fought against the scriptures. Consider also the Nicene synod where the spirit was, when it was about the celibacy of priests with one Paphnutius protesting (Distinction 31. canon. Nicene.), where, when Caesar was burning the books! Nor is this last among the first councils, so what shall I say about the others? - Now what is more vain than custom, likewise and multitude? By custom idolatry could again be erected among us, by multitude Christ could be accused of lying, Elijah and Micaiah could be defeated 1Kings 19,10; 22,13ff, the apostles could be despised Acts 2,13. Therefore, since the decrees almost relied on the fathers, but the fathers disagreed among themselves, referred to the scriptures, and did not want their interpretations or those of their own to be believed, 'immediately' I with Paul: 'I did not confer with flesh and blood' Gal 1,16, I sought the spirit from the Lord, I changed my mind and approached the scriptures. I now turn them, I publish them to the people, in the meantime with great hatred from some, although I say with Paul: 'If I still pleased men, I would not be a servant of Christ' Gal 1,10. You in the meantime have me not wanting to confer with flesh and blood, not wanting to sow heresies, that is, sects, not wanting to introduce new doctrines, but to believe in the spirit, to strive for concord, to recall the old evangelical and apostolic doctrine; you have what attracted me to this business, you have the most holy fathers as guides of my undertaking, you have my spirit thirsting for nothing but Christ and the good of the people, and here I call Jesus Christ the just as a witness to my conscience.</p>
      <p>Now you in the name of Christ gird yourself, pronounce judgment for us. The same age, the same study once held us both, do you now think it wiser to act; you adhere to the decrees, I indeed cite the scriptures. Not that I have completely abjured the decrees, except as far as they do not agree with the scriptures. This, which I have not proposed so pertinaciously at present, that I would not want to change my undertaking if taught better by you or another; old friendship can do everything! Command, order, instruct, exhort, refute, overturn; you are a friend, you will remain a friend. At least, if I think wrongly, indicate it to us and do not extend further into hatreds; moreover, if this variety or change of my mind causes dissension, consider yourself how much space there is between divine and human, see and weigh yourself what is being done by our bishops. And would that you would visit our house, we would then discuss these and many other matters more fully, where you could do nothing more pleasing. Perhaps it would then be restored about restoring our friendship, if indeed it is broken, which I cannot be led to believe; although a venomous tongue can do everything, and therefore we have explained our mind worthy of a Christian (as we hope) man in longer words, lest the most filthy lips of anyone heap envy upon you. It remains now, as you depart, that not my voice, but the voice of Christ addresses you, sounding: 'He who believes in me, does not believe in me, but in him who sent me, and he who sees me, sees him who sent me. I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me should not abide in darkness. And if anyone hears my words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. He who rejects me and does not receive my words, has that which judges him; the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day, because I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me gave me a command, what I should say and what I should speak, and I know that his command is everlasting life. Therefore, whatever I speak, just as the Father has told me, so I speak.' Farewell in Christ Jesus and let us pray with common prayers to that peaceful king, may he inspire charity in us, grant true peace, and be the protector of a just cause. From our monastery in Kappel, the day before the calends of December in the year 1523 from the redemption of the world.</p>
