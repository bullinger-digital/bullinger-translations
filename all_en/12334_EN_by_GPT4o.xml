    <p xml:id="regest1">The Johannes Haller sent by the [Zürchers] to [Augsburg] delivered Bullinger's letter [not received] and letters from others. Musculus’ silence after Bullinger's last letter [not received] was not because he felt offended or could not tolerate someone with a different opinion, but rather due to the renewed dispute over the Lord's Supper between the [Zürchers] and Luther, which, according to [Ecclesiastes 3:7], prompted him to remain silent. Bullinger should understand this correctly and grant Musculus what he himself demands, namely, to tolerate someone with a different opinion. However, Musculus’ opinion will hardly differ from Bullinger's, especially since he does not believe in a physical presence [of Christ] and fully adheres to Augustine's statements about the [resurrected] body of Christ, as shown by the comparisons he [cites in his commentary on Matthew]. The accusation that Musculus does not express himself consistently should have been discussed by Bullinger with [specific] references. However, Musculus knows that he shares the same opinion as Bullinger, even if he expresses it differently. - Musculus knew almost nothing about Haller's appointment until his arrival in [Augsburg]. He likes Haller. He was honorably received due to his many letters of recommendation. The authorities will decide on his future place of work. Musculus will respect him as a colleague if he does not disturb the [Augsburg] church with innovations. However, if he introduces foreign customs, Musculus would do what Bullinger would do to maintain the peace of the church. - Musculus has seen Zwingli's son [Huldrych the Younger], but he cannot judge whether he resembles his father in appearance and character, as others claim. May the Lord preserve him for the church. - The outcome of the war [of the Schmalkaldic League against Duke Henry of Brunswick] is still unclear, as [Landgrave Philip of Hesse] is said to still be armed. At the meeting of the [Protestant] estates in Frankfurt next month, the [Schmalkaldic] alliance will either be dissolved or extended. The opponents are trying to split it with their cunning, and there are [Protestants] who give them the opportunity to do so. The religious discussion scheduled for Regensburg seems to be seriously prepared, but in reality, it is about something else. The [Protestants] plan to participate. Whether, and if so, whom the opponents will send is unknown. May the Lord destroy the efforts of the devil, who seeks to prevent the spread of the Gospel of Christ with antichristian decrees, articles, and bulls, through the pretense of a council and a colloquium, as well as through wars. - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Johannes Haller, whom you, most kind sir, sent here to serve our church, delivered your letters and those of some others to me. The reason I did not reply after your last letters is not because I was offended by your letters or because I cannot tolerate someone with a different opinion (since I myself sincerely detest that stubbornness in the church, where such great dissensions are stirred up over the disagreement of one or two, and it is thought that peace cannot exist unless it is among those who agree in everything), but solely because I wanted to remain silent, seeing that the most unfortunate fire of the sacramentarian controversy between you and Luther, stirred up by Satan to the great harm of the church and the offense of many good people, was rekindled; which not only to me but also to many others recalls the saying: There is a time to be silent and a time to speak. Therefore, it will be your duty to take this in good part and interpret it no other way than the truth itself holds, and then, what you ask of me, not to deny me either, namely, that you also tolerate me, who differ from you a little, although, if you rightly consider my opinion, it would be strange if you could disagree, since it has nothing of carnal thoughts and does not detract at all from that opinion which Augustine says: "He gave immortality; he did not take away nature," and that: "Christ must be in one place in heaven and not diffused everywhere according to the body"; which the added comparisons, I think, sufficiently declare. As for what you added about me using different expressions, I wish you had written more clearly and pointed out the places. In this, I am conscious that the mind is the same, I would have seen about the words if you had pointed out where I have spoken differently, although it is not uncommon to express the same thing with different expressions; which cannot be unknown to you. For things that are expressed differently are not immediately contrary, especially in a case where different respects and considerations spontaneously give rise to various expressions.</p>
      <p>Concerning Haller's vocation, about which I knew almost nothing until the very day of his arrival, I can only reply at present: I am pleased with the man's manners and, as they seem, his ingenuousness and modesty. He was honorably received, commended by so many letters. I cannot yet indicate what position he will hold, as it is in the hands of the authorities. As far as I am concerned, if he accommodates himself to our church in such a way that no innovation (Neuerung) disturbs it, he will be in the place of a beloved brother and colleague to me, and there is hope that he may emerge here to the great benefit of the church. But if he wishes to introduce something foreign, I will do what you yourself would do in a similar case for the good of your church, so that peace among the brothers is maintained and the church is not disturbed.</p>
      <p>I eagerly saw Zwingli's son. Whether he resembles his father of blessed memory in appearance and character, I cannot judge. However, I hear that he resembles him in all respects, as far as his age permits. May the Lord grant him the grace necessary for this youth, so that he does not degenerate from piety either through the fertility of his genius and precocious exuberance or through the malice of the present age, being drawn to serve the world more than Christ.</p>
      <p>There is nothing to write about the matters currently being conducted. The outcome of our war is not yet clear. For I hear that the Cat is still in arms. Next month, there will be a meeting of our estates, namely the Protestants, in Frankfurt, where the evangelical alliance will either be dissolved or extended. The adversaries are trying with amazing tricks to split it, and there are those among us who have given them the opportunity. The colloquium destined for Regensburg seems indeed to be conducted seriously; but in reality, something else is being done and something else is being pretended.</p>
      <p>Our people will appear, as I hear, at the appointed time. Nothing is known about the adversaries, whether any and who will come. May the Lord confound this spirit of Satan, which turns itself into all forms, and which now condemns the doctrine of the Gospel of Christ with public edicts, now with published articles, now with antichristian bulls, now tries to corrupt or at least halt it with the pretense of a council and the appearance of a colloquium, now attempts to utterly uproot it with the machinations of wars.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest Bullinger. Greet all the brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, November 19, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most celebrated Antistes of the church of Zurich, my most dear lord and brother.</p>
