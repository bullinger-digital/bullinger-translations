      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I am expecting your letters, and I wish to know what was proposed by the papal legate at the Baths of Baden.</p>
      <p>King Ferdinand has abolished the magistracy collected from the three tribes in Freiburg im Breisgau and has given all power of proclamation and governance to the nobles, which greatly displeases the citizens because of that monarchy restored against the privileges granted by the House of Austria. Where do you think the king's advisors or the king himself are looking? Thus, step by step, he will also take away all the freedom that they have had until now. A miserable age, in which we see everything changing into another state. Breisach, my homeland, he has pledged to a certain baron, a free and imperial city. Finally, if he wishes to proceed in this way, he will overturn and consume everything that he received from his parents and ancestors. This is not the act of a king; but I do not wish to speak of trifles. He resides in the fortress of Breisach and will harass the entire Breisgau and Alsace. They have oppressed Hagenbach, a proud and cruel man; let this baron see to it that he does not attempt anything new that might have any appearance of tyranny.</p>
      <p>I could not take your Zwinglian youth around because of the very rainy weather, which you will hear from him.</p>
      <p>I am expecting letters from Strasbourg about Saxon affairs; if I receive anything, I will not hide it from you. The imperial captains are gathering in Augsburg; an army is being enlisted. A certain cloud is placed in the sky; to which region it will discharge itself, we do not yet know. If the Turk is not present with an army in Hungary, I fear for the people of Magdeburg; for the Emperor is trying to bring the rebels, whom I should rather call the faithful of Christ, under the yoke, lest anything detracts from his reputation. But without a doubt, Christ will conquer and will cast down the abominable beast, by which he is instigated, to the depths of hell. The rest from our Frisian. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 27, 1551.</p>
      <p>Give many greetings to Mr. Theodor, to whom I will write a long letter by the next courier. Also, greet your son-in-law in my name along with Gwalther, who has not responded to three letters.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor. Zurich.</p>
