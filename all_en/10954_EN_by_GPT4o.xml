      <p>Greetings. I do not have much leisure time, most honorable man, to write in detail about my affairs. For I have also painted these things late at night by the lamp. However, you will be able to understand my circumstances well enough from Mr. Pellikan and Ammann, as well as from those who have already come to you in Zurich. I do not think you doubt that I will bind my faith to no one else in such a way that I will not always keep it intact for you. Oh, if only I could, at the earliest opportunity, either by talent or by divine gift, reach a point where I could be of some use to my country and to all of you!</p>
      <p>This is what I ask of you at present: If anyone, in my name, either on St. Martin's Day or in the days following, requests grain in my name, ensure that it is not refused. Six Mütt will be owed to me, and Frisius has ordered that five of his own be lent, so there will be 11. There is no reason to doubt Frisius's will, nor do I think it necessary for him to write himself, unless I am not trustworthy. I will write more frequently and at greater length about the rest soon.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most gracious patron.</p>
      <p>Your Con. Gessnerus.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron. Zurich.</p>
