      <p>My friendly, willing service beforehand, dear cousin, I want to let you know that I am fresh and healthy, praise be to God. I would have liked to write to you about how things are now regarding my wife, although not out of dishonor, but out of misunderstanding, God; yet the circumstances of this time do not allow it. However, I intend to come to you and my dear cousin, whom you should greet very kindly for me, shortly after I return home from Vienna.</p>
      <p>Secondly, the bearer of this letter has asked me to request your assistance, which he will demonstrate to you with his own hands. If possible, it is my friendly request to you, wherever it may be, to promote his cause and to be helpful to him for my sake, so that he may find himself benefited by this my handwriting. With this, I leave you entrusted and greet my dear cousin warmly.</p>
      <p>Dated the 14th day of October in the year 1548. Hans Jakob Adlischwyler wrote this.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Minster in Zurich, my friendly, dear cousin.</p>
