      <p>S. Although I have not received any letters from you this time, most reverend lord, I did not want to send away that learned and elegant man, whom you had commended to me in a fatherly manner, without my letters. He spent most of the days since he was here with the lord legate, and I consumed the rest with poor health, so that I could not offer him even a crumb of duties or benefits, although I would have very much liked to. I have continued the labors of my function until now, but how painfully, how difficultly, how without any assistant, he knows, who can be concealed from nothing. I have absolutely nothing certain about Italian affairs. I do not find it likely that peace has been made in France, especially while such great preparations are being made on both sides, although our legate seems to assert it; may it be established sincerely and stably! - I bought from your lord Leonardo, sweetest lord father, 8 bushels of flour and packed them in a barrel at Altdorf as precisely as possible. Brother Leonard was more than dutiful, and whatever it was of furniture (which, however, was pure flour, mixed with no other material), he took care to have it transported to Rapperswil. There, by the work of a certain good man, it was scarcely and hardly at all received by the sailors, the most wicked kind of men, on the ships. The sailors, having rolled the barrel over several times, thought that it was not only filled with flour but with some heavier material, such as iron or tin instruments and intestines, otherwise it would not be of such weight from the transport of flour alone.</p>
      <p>Therefore, with the captain from Glarus, Jakob Gallati, deciding thus, they decreed that my packages, packed as well as possible in the barrel, should not be carried beyond the Brick Bridge, where they would break open the barrel and search it, so that if any trickery lay hidden in the barrel, they would discover it to my great disgrace and loss. Immortal God, that the audacity of these Glarus people is such that they even spoil, alienate, and throw away a good man's merchandise with zeal, as if they had ever caught me in deceit in this decade, during which I have used such journeys, so that they now begin to trust me so poorly! Thus I am forced to suffer shipwreck without merit and without the malice of water, knowing what danger lies if they wish to use force in this way. I write this so that, if lord Erni ever arrives, he can testify to my integrity - for we have added no deceit - and then, if it happens by chance, you can also testify to lord consul, to whom I will write the whole business, from the mouth of lord Erni.</p>
      <p>Last year, with no less danger and loss, they wanted to completely spoil a grain barrel in the station and port of Duggendorf, which I could barely bring home torn and soaked by long-lasting storms, even after paying double freight and wages. I can hardly bear such injury and such loss any longer; for it happens by deliberate effort and zeal, not by chance or some fortune. Forgive me, most reverend lord, for not being ashamed to burden and trouble you, who are occupied with such great labors, with my personal affairs. Remigius von Schouwenstein died the day before yesterday of apoplexy. This quickly.</p>
      <p>Chur, April 24, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>Lord Karl again asks to be informed by you whether doctors are also created in Basel. I wrote to the Italian brothers these days and daily now expect something to share. Lord consul, lord Pontisella, Gantner, lord Karl, and others greet your humanity.</p>
      <p>From the letters of a certain papist canon, Karl informed me that a marriage will soon be contracted between the son of the Queen of Navarre and the daughter of the Palatine, or vice versa, and that among the papists, Duke August will accept the filth of the mass, so that he may be crowned sooner, etc.</p>
