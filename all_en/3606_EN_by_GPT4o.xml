      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt that you have understood about the task assigned to me, which I neither took upon myself voluntarily nor sought after, but was entrusted and imposed upon me by the one who has the authority to command. I know how heavy a burden it is and how it is beyond my capabilities, and that I must frequently endure concerns and storms. But I hope that he who has imposed such a role on me and who prepares the works in which we must walk, and uses his instruments, will give strength and wisdom, with which I may extricate myself from such labyrinths and obstacles. I pray to him to always be with me and guide me with his spirit.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you would do me a great favor if you would often write to me about those things which you consider worthy of knowing, promising you all my thoughts and goodwill towards you. Please convey my greetings to Martyr and Walter and our mutual friends.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you and increase you with blessings. Baden, May 25.</p>
      <p>Yours, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
