      <p>Ludwig, Count of Wittgenstein, to Heinrich Bullinger, greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Froschauer excused himself at the last fair due to the multitude of business, for not bringing any letters from you. However, since he affirmed that you are in good health, I was glad that you use this freedom rather than binding yourself to that servitude of writing, from which age itself and the duties, as well as the cares and occupations that accompany it, easily absolve you. I suspected that these were perhaps even more burdensome at that time, because it was reported that your neighbors, the Swiss confederates of the adverse religion, were somewhat tumultuous. But there is no reason for you to burden yourself with this trouble; for I have enough certain testimonies of your goodwill towards me, that I would rightly be considered uncivil and ungrateful if I added even the slightest burden, and truly ungrateful unless I honor you with the zeal of deserving. Therefore, so that you may have at least some indication of my gratitude and reverence, I wished to add this small gift, which may serve as a symbol of constant friendship.</p>
      <p>If you will not disdain to receive it with your usual kindness and humanity and to grant it a place among the other tokens of friends, it will be something for me to rejoice and congratulate myself; for I wish it to be known to many and to posterity as well that I am counted among Bullinger's friends. May God, in His mercy, lead you to the age of Moses with equal vigor. Amen. March 11, in the year 1573.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
