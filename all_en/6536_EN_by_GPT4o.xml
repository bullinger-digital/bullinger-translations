      <p>Greetings. The matter of the bishopric greatly troubles me; for I fear civil war; however, I pray to the Lord that He Himself may thwart the plans of the adversaries. As for you, I can imagine from my own experience how much distress you are in... - Our matter has been well resolved by the grace of God, solely based on my submitted supplication before the councilors.</p>
      <p>Fifteen measures of grain have been willingly granted to you; it will be given to Mayor KÃ¶chli, so that he may deliver it to your father-in-law, and thus provide it to you.</p>
      <p>With great eagerness, I wish to know what has been decreed in the assembly. I presented to the councilors the writings of the bishop, which you sent last.</p>
      <p>I could otherwise really use the money. September 21, 1565.</p>
