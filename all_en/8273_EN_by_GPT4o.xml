      <p>S. D. I received letters from you, my brother, the first indeed brief, but the latter somewhat more lengthy. Froschauer thanks you for your diligence and said he would write something today; I do not know whether to you or to the bookseller, his debtor.</p>
      <p>I am expecting his letters and will attach them to mine if he sends them. You will steadfastly continue in the business of the bookseller once begun. These men know how to feign and dissemble everything, and even to swear and break faith, and those who do not want to swear, do not want to swear because they do not want to fulfill what is required of them. But the holy magistrate should not only not tolerate, but not even ignore this rebellion and malicious fraud. Even if he promises much amendment, you will still find him acting in his usual manner. They are venomous men who breathe their poison on many. The magistrate will eventually be forced to take action against more if he spares a few now and does not want to restrain them severely for justice.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you do well to press and urge the magistrate. It is strange, however, that a public minister of the word favors these seducers and renounces his function for this reason, because the innocent and good Anabaptists and Schwenckfeldians are being brought into order. He must also be an accomplice and corrupted by false doctrines. No doubt you will deal with him in your synod; for these things must not be ignored. If he completely renounces both his office and the synod and wants to live privately, he must be carefully watched, lest he also lead more into error. But if there is still hope and he can be conveniently healed, I do not think any efforts should be spared. May the Lord give you wisdom and graciously deign to bring peace to these matters!</p>
      <p>So far I have heard nothing about the legion conscripted in the Trentino region nor about the death of the Turkish pasha. Perhaps this is fabricated to encourage the Venetian fleet, which we hear has set out against the Turks. If you have any certain information about these things, you will inform me. Much talk is spread about peace being concluded in France. I cannot yet believe it, because the war in Dauphin√© is flaring up more and more and the admiral has so far proceeded successfully. May the Lord bless him! The people of Avignon fear miserably for themselves, seeking aid from their pope; he is said to be sending 2000 soldiers. If the admiral's forces are wise and able, they will intercept them, etc. I first hear from you about the emperor's and the Protestants' delegation to the pope and wonder what it is, whether for the sake of religion or for the sake of the exalted Florentine. Time will tell.</p>
      <p>I am sending you at present what has been done in Bern, from where it is written to me; he who described it painted poorly, but you will easily understand. Pardon me; I cannot describe everything alone, I do what I can, nor am I very strong again, being broken by daily labors and cares and sorrows, etc.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you. Greet the friends you know in order, especially the honorable consuls, Mr. Karl, Mr. Pontisella. May 26, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
