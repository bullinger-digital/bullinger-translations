      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I have received everything you sent, dearest brother, and I desire nothing more.</p>
      <p>In brief, I tell you that the Navarrese is the very one through whom the cause of Christ is hindered and dissensions have arisen at court. The Pope and Philip entice him with the hope of obtaining the county of Avignon and the kingdom of Navarre, which is in Spain. He is from the Bourbon family, Anthony of Bourbon, but he married the daughter of the King of Navarre, a most holy and beautiful lady, a most faithful worshiper of Christ. From her, he received several hundred thousand in present money, royal dignity, etc.; but how grateful he is to her, you will understand from the letters. I have long heard that he pursues the most disgraceful harlots.</p>
      <p>May the Lord God have mercy on him and turn him to Himself. See to it that you send back these letters as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>You will understand that they are to be returned to me; however, I hope to have a messenger within four days; in the meantime, you will find someone you can safely trust. Also, see that you do not share this with everyone and keep to yourself what I wrote about the Navarrese. I have long thought this would happen, and I have long known him from the description of good men.</p>
      <p>We are taught by such cases what it means: "Do not put your trust in princes, in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation" [Ps 146, 3 (145, 2f Vulg.)]. Salvation is from God alone; let us pray to Him diligently, etc.</p>
      <p>If you have anything else, share it.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 27 February 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours truly.</p>
      <p>Greet our Matthias and the councilors, etc. To the beloved lord and brother, Master Ambrosius Blarer in Winterthur.</p>
