      <p>S. I give you immortal thanks for the books sent to me, most distinguished Bullinger. I will make an effort to repay you, if ever the opportunity is given to me and the means are not lacking. I would have sent the money long ago, if it had been possible due to the lack of couriers; for I did not want to entrust money to strangers rashly. Schenckhius, a good, pious, and learned man, went to Konstanz, to whom I entrusted this task, that he might send this to you through the merchants of Konstanz as soon as possible. Many reports of new events come to us, but such that, due to military preparations, rightly terrify all good men. The Frenchman harmed himself by delaying, for if he had proceeded a little more successfully, he would easily have gained control of Milan. Siena is said to be struggling, not only from the enemy's attack but also from a shortage of supplies.</p>
      <p>The whole of Lower Saxony is said to be in arms; but to what end all these things tend, it is more a matter of conjecture than of certain knowledge. They think that Heinrich of Brunswick is in danger above others, and for this reason, when he was on his way to the assembly, he was warned by his people and turned back.</p>
      <p>Our assembly is neither numerous nor celebrated; perhaps it will not be more celebrated; only two princes were present, namely the Bavarian, who could not be absent due to proximity and kinship, and then the W체rttembergian, who acted privately in receiving feudal solemnities. Each, after hearing the proposal, as they call it, returned to his own; both are said to return after the Sunday of Invocavit. The Bishop of Augsburg, as the Emperor's commissioner, has lingered here for a long time; the Bishop of Eichst채tt was also present, but by the king's indulgence, he went home.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of W체rzburg also arrived.</p>
      <p>Few envoys of the secular princes, as the papists falsely call them, are present, namely ten councilors of five princes.</p>
      <p>The king, therefore, lingers here not without detriment to his name and authority. The Austrian courtiers have brought us nothing but poverty, but it is splendidly dressed in silk, gold chains, and other things that contribute to pomp, seeking a remedy far from the states of the empire against this incurable evil, though it is difficult to obtain.</p>
      <p>The proposal contains two main points, the reformation of religion and the promotion of public peace. The states, as they call them secular, do not want to deviate a nail's breadth from what was concluded at Padua in the past Mauritian war. I predict that in the matter of religion nothing else can be decided than that interlocutors be chosen. The Saxons do not want to hear about councils, whether universal or national. For they have openly protested that councils achieve nothing else than to obscure the truth with deceits and lies. Therefore, they have met twice, not more often, to consult. The king defers all councils to the Sunday of Invocavit, perhaps waiting for the presence of other princes; but I fear he will be waiting for a swallow in winter. Here indulgences are to be granted to those who give thanks for the happy and plausible conversion of England to a healthier mind.</p>
      <p>The adversaries of the word are very encouraged, but the pious are terrified by the Swiss tumult, which could not be settled otherwise. The good would yield to the bad, and truth to lies.</p>
      <p>A certain monk from Flanders in Munich, a Dominican, ensnared a somewhat doubting prince about the sacrifice of the mass with new inventions and especially with the authority of Malachi about the perpetual and pure sacrifice. It would be beneficial to refute the foundations of lies and the arguments of truth through antithesis, but concisely and in German. For the princes do not read what is more verbose. There would be hope of a not inconsiderable fruit to follow.</p>
      <p>Marschalkhus Pangracius of Freiberg, an excellent man, is very concerned about this matter, but does not dare to ask for such a thing, lest he be condemned as suspect of heresy.</p>
      <p>When the letters were about to be sealed, the Saxon envoys tell me that the margrave is very busy in raising an army... some spread that it has been conquered by the Emperor. Farewell, my Bullinger, and I ask that you reply through this messenger. Feienthoi lives... he has married, but I have received nothing yet at the assembly.</p>
      <p>Maximilian's diligence is approved by me; for he has continually kept himself within private walls and read many books, but without order, whether you consider theology or literature, he has excellent ones in my library. Therefore, he could profit greatly. He is not harsh or severe towards his godson, but somewhat lacking in humanity; for he scarcely deigns to address him with a single word except for the lessons he reads to the boy. The boy, however, is very courteous and very fond of his teacher, whom he could treat kindly either by praising or reproving as he pleases. Therefore, I would wish for more humanity towards the very compliant boy, and more civility towards others; for in this way I could promote him more easily, which I indeed do diligently, and will do so most diligently in the future. Again, farewell. In Augsburg, most swiftly, February 16, in the year etc. 55.</p>
      <p>G[ereon] y[ours].</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, an eminent theologian and most worthy bishop of the church of Z체rich.</p>
