      <p>S. D. We received the form of peace last submitted, as I mentioned before, from Bern; but I consider it to be doubtful and entirely spurious; for in the past days, a close friend of mine returned to Germany, who was with the prince throughout the war and left Orl√©ans in April. He sent me a letter, a German copy of which I am sending to you here; I place more trust in this than in any others. Furthermore, there is a certain royal guard who wrote almost the same to our most honorable consul Mr. von Cham from Paris in April, except that he adds in his letter that the king will pay the German cavalry and has made a good peace, with only the Guises continually plotting new things. May the Lord restrain them! I wrote this hastily; I pray you consider this favorably.</p>
      <p>I received your letters through this most honorable doctor, an excellent man. Would that the fire of God's word burns in the kingdom of the pope and consumes the antichrist! If I receive anything else and more, I will inform you promptly. What, I pray, is happening with the Schwenckfeldians, etc.?</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently with your wife, children, and all friends, the honorable consuls, Ganthner, Pontisella, and the others.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 10, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The guard also writes to my lord von Cham that the king has occupied Metz, Toul, Verdun, etc., and that there is a concern that a great war will arise in the Netherlands against the Duke of Alba, whom the Netherlanders call "Duck you to the gallows." This is not added by the guard, but I have it from letters brought from Belgium. To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
