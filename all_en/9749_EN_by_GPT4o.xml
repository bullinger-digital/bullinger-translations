      <p>Richard Cox to Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>From the letters, which I received in June, written last spring, I understood that mine, which I had sent to you in 1573, were not delivered to you. This matter could have given you cause to suspect that I neglected to write. Certainly, that negligence, dearest brother in Christ, would not be without fault if I had allowed such a mark of ingratitude to be branded upon me, that I would neglect the letters of friends, both pious and learned and most kindly written, and refuse to respond to them dutifully.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I wrote to you letters (I hope not ungrateful) in 1573, which I arranged to be delivered with a small gift, albeit modest, to a certain Richard Hill, so that they might be conveyed to you through his efforts. If this was not done, I will not cease to investigate whose fault it was that this matter did not succeed.</p>
      <p>From your letters, I understand that you do not suffer from such a failing old age that you cannot quite comfortably fulfill the duty entrusted to you: which, in my judgment, you have achieved partly through experience, the master of all things, and partly through pious affection, by which, greatly stirred, you have never ceased to incessantly propagate the business of the gospel and piety; most of all, because, inflamed by the spirit of Christ, you have never failed to follow its impulses. However it may be, I sincerely congratulate you and the church of Christ, after so many labors endured for the glory of God, on having happily reached a vigorous old age, which does not cease to care for all the churches. And this indeed is evident from your writings, in which you teach, admonish, and console not only the church of Zürich but also the truly catholic church of Christ. Your little book on the persecutions in these recent wicked and dangerous times is exceedingly useful for strengthening the pious in the patience of Christ and the sincerity of religion.</p>
      <p>You are mistaken if you think I understand German: it has been about fifteen years, more or less, since I have even tasted that language with the slightest touch.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I will take care to have your Swiss sermons translated into Latin, so that I may read them with greater delight and benefit.</p>
      <p>I grieve that your churches are agitated by unfortunate controversies; as Christ truly said, the enemy sows weeds. Oh, may we all finally become good soil! Some of our pure brothers, partly terrified by the rod of our queen, hide away, partly silenced by the most learned book of a certain learned man.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, what monster they secretly nurture is unknown. Certain noble countrymen of ours, alumni of the Roman pontiff, weary of their happiness, or unable to endure the long course of the gospel, have defected, some to France, others to Spain, others elsewhere, to plot some evil against the professors of piety. It is such a great task to keep the church of Christ safe and sound against the ministers of Satan. But the strength of the Lord and his most mighty tower have defended us thus far; and until the end, the Lord will protect his own, while those two antichrists gnash their teeth and rage. Meanwhile, the Lord must be prayed to night and day, that he may arise and his enemies be scattered, etc.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus make your old age long for the church! As for me, now reaching the age of 75, by the grace of God, I am well, except that the trembling of my hands delays the duty of writing. Farewell, dearest brother in Christ. From the Isle of Ely in England, July 20, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted brother in Christ, Richard, first minister of the church of Ely.</p>
      <p>To the man of outstanding piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, and dearest brother in Christ.</p>
