    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends the bearer of the letter [Laurentius Montanus?], who was a schoolmaster under [Count] Georg of Württemberg a few years ago; the former monk is not very educated, but upright, and has practiced as a printer's assistant; perhaps Bullinger can help the unstable man, who has a family, to a school position in Glarus or another post. According to rumors, the army of the Emperor [Charles V] is suffering from disease and hunger; the princes do not heed God, who will soon pour out his wrath upon them. The famine is increasing, yet the Basel council is commendably countering usury with wine and grain. Greetings. Gast intends to send a list of the works of Oecolampadius shortly.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter asked me to recommend him to your church. A few years ago, he served as a schoolmaster under Duke Georg of Württemberg. He was a monk, quite uneducated, but upright. He has worked in printing workshops for nearly a decade. If you can assist him with your advice or help, I know you will not neglect to do so. He has the unstable nature typical of monks. He has a wife and children. I have heard that there are vacant school positions in Glarus.</p>
      <p>If you have any information, inform him, or if you know others who have greater knowledge of these matters, speak to them, so that this man may find some position.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing at all about the Emperor except vague rumors. Some say his army is afflicted with dysentery due to the hunger they are already suffering.</p>
      <p>What then, when they have no food at all, will God do with them? But the princes are not wise, they scorn the counsels of God, they mock the admonitions of the pious prophets. The Lord will soon pour out His wrath upon this nation, which does not know God.</p>
      <p>The price of all things is rising daily. I cannot praise enough the generosity of our council towards the citizens, which also grieves our usurers. They do not dare to sell wine to foreigners, nor do they dare to sell a measure of wine for more than 7 Rappen, but they can sell it for less. Likewise, the council provides a som of wine for 2 florins, while others sell it for 4 or 5 florins. They do the same with grain.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. In my name, you will greet Theodor and our Frisian.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 15, 1544.</p>
      <p>Soon I will also send you a catalog of the works of Oecolampadius.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>To the Christian and excellent man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
