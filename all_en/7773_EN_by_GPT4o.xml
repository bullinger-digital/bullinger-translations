      <p>God with us. Dear son, I cannot write anything certain to you; for there is much talk, but little truth. So I am also not inclined to write much. Duke Wolfgang is supposedly still in the field; one might wonder what will be the outcome. The Prince of Orange is said to have sent a regiment of soldiers and 2000 horses to Zabern, to join Duke Wolfgang; the rest of the Orange forces are lying in Lorraine, to guard the pass for Duke Wolfgang's arrival.</p>
      <p>Many people are said to have deserted from Orange (I fear Stoffel has had a bad war; I wish he had followed my advice); for he has no money and pays nothing. In France, the four marshals are said to be negotiating peace, everything is expensive and miserable, and people are dying rapidly. Down near Toulouse, a new uproar is beginning. In summary, the plague is very present. That is the most important thing I know. I do not have time to write more.</p>
      <p>God be with you, Susanna, and Lisenbethli, and also with all your household. May God grant you good times.</p>
      <p>Friday, 4th of February 1569.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
