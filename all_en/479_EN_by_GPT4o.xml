      <p>Greetings and Peace. For the book which you sent to me and for the one you gave a little earlier, I am grateful to you, and I would already be repaying this gratitude if my little commentary on the affairs of Zürich had been completed; but I am still working on it whenever I have time, and I do not see how it can be completed so soon. However, I will fulfill my promise in due time and ensure that it (whatever its quality may be) is delivered to you. You will do me a favor if you write to us from time to time, and a great favor if you share any news you have that is either pleasant to know or necessary for us to learn. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Basel, on the third day before the Kalends of April 1548 in the French manner, in your manner 1549. Yours sincerely, Christophorus Richer.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished and venerable man, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zürich, his dear friend from the heart. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>Christophorus Richer.</p>
