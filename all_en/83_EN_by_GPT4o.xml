      <p>Pious, honorable, prudent and wise, kind, beloved lord and brother, our friendly greetings, willing service, friendship, love, and whatever we know to be honorable and pleasing to you, are prepared for you beforehand. It has happily reached us through your trustworthy people's writing that you, for legitimate reasons and for the good and advancement of truth and lasting peace, would like to know about Mr. Batten Gerung, your preacher, how he departed from Münster in the Aargau, and also how he came from us in Zurich. Since we are very inclined to serve you in this and much greater matters, we want to inform you of what we know about this; it is as follows: Who his father and mother are and what they were called, we do not know; but from his mouth, we have heard that he is a native of Münster and Lucerne, not Bern; and when his mother once came to Zurich, we understood well that he was born out of wedlock, etc. You might have more detailed information and knowledge from Münster about all this.</p>
      <p>In Münster in the Aargau, he was a pastor for some time. There, he vehemently promoted the article of the real presence of flesh and blood in the bread of the Lord with the Pope and Luther against our teaching and faith, of which one can still find knowledge in Münster; he was also not in agreement here in Zurich, though he claimed he was not yet informed otherwise and better, etc. However, how he departed from Münster, we have no oral knowledge, but we think that in Münster one would find it thoroughly according to this opinion, as the community's report reached us, namely that he, with shameful adultery, which he practiced with a poor honest man's wife, and (if we understood correctly) during Holy Week, when devotion in the papacy is at its peak, practiced, he got himself into trouble, was caught, punished from the benefice, and sent to Einsiedeln to the Dark Forest to do penance, which journey he also completed.</p>
      <p>Since he no longer had a place among his own because of his misdeeds, he came to Wettingen and Dietikon, then was appointed by Mr. Martin Bucer to Schaffhausen as a preacher. And when he complained and lamented about the place, good lords and friends in Zurich helped him. There he preached for a while and taught in all ways in conformity with us, especially regarding the sacrament; now he is vehemently his own, etc. How he is now, we do not know. Lastly, however, a shameful, entirely scandalous affair occurred, namely that he kept a maid or servant in the house, with whom he committed adultery and broke the marriage; he carried on with this until the maid became pregnant. Meanwhile, he treated his pious wife very shamefully and wickedly, kept the maid next to her in the house, beat her, threatened her, and now treated her wickedly, etc. When all this was brought before our court and his wife persistently demanded a divorce because of so many acts of willfulness suffered from him, they were divorced, Mr. Batten was placed in the tower and removed from the benefice and preaching office, etc. His wife still lives in Aarau or Suhr, otherwise, we do not know, her name is Sabinella Buchserin, she might give information herself. When he came out of the tower, he asked us for information, since he could no longer stay with us, so that he might find a place elsewhere. We gave him that, as long as he behaved well with teaching and life until the adultery, for which he came from us. Then we heard how his maid, the adulteress, let it be known that the priest must keep what he promised her, and he had promised her marriage, etc. Therefore, we seriously addressed him, if he had done that and promised her something before and while he was still married to his wife, it would be even more shameful, etc.; he vehemently denied it. However, we liked the matter that if we did not give him a letter of recommendation, we would not give him anything more. When he felt the displeasure and the aforementioned speech went vehemently, he made himself ready to leave for Basel, asked to speak with all the brothers at his departure and to be in our grace. When it was after the last and in the lecture hall with 30 or 40 people, young and old, gathered, he asked for grace, begged that one would forgive him his great scandal, with which he had scandalized the pious church of Zurich. He then began to excuse himself for the aforementioned speech, to protest, and said he had not taken her, and God would never let him experience the shame that he would ever take her again, etc.</p>
      <p>After that, he went away and went no further than to Brugg, in your city, to the Sternen, took the adulteress with him as his wife, against your and our reformation; he also later brought her to the church in the foreign land, but against your and our reformation, and acted very scandalously in it.</p>
      <p>As much as is briefly known to us about Mr. Batten, whom we might well wish, his praise would be greater, for we never opposed him except in his evil conduct. It is indeed true, as is said, that he was to become a preacher in Bern, we complained to the honorable city of Bern, also wrote to Bern as true and said, we could not recommend to the honorable city that they find no other preacher than just such a one, of whom the offensive Lucerners and others would speak, the church in Bern would take up as a preacher, who could not remain with the Lucerners or Zurichers because of shameful adultery, etc., so that the gospel would be hated and an honorable city of Bern would be defiled. We are sorry for that and still wish you and your church well, desiring your welfare. May God grant you that, and understand our writing in the best way.</p>
