      <p>Greetings. I do not know whether you have received the letters I recently sent with Mr. Zuleger's correspondence or not; since I had no other messenger, I sent them to the ministers who are in Aarau, so that they could forward them to you from there. Now he himself returns and will explain to you what he has done here and also in Geneva. The response given to him here is as follows: that my lords can make some arrangements with his electoral grace, especially at this time, they cannot for many reasons; they also do not consider it necessary or beneficial. However, if they should agree to something, they want to have a faithful regard for him, and whatever they can show and prove to be beneficial to him at any time with honor and propriety, they are willing to do; they also desire that the same be done by his electoral grace towards them. I think it will not be much different with you. He himself will report everything about the situation in Geneva and in France. He left the third in Geneva. Here we have nothing else, except that our people are again being secretly and very much urged to enter into an alliance with the French. I would like them to leave us in peace; I was therefore not unhappy that they made peace with the Duke, as I hoped that once the danger was over, there would be no reason to get involved with France. But it is still going strong, although quietly and secretly. And I have written this to you; I do not want anyone to know about it.</p>
      <p>I hope that something will soon arise in France to deter our people from getting involved. Diesbach returned from Cambrai yesterday, and I have not yet spoken with him. I am sending back to you the Landgrave's letters and your response. Mr. Zuleger will show you what the people of Geneva have responded. Beza also communicated your response to him; I write this so that you do not think I have used it incautiously.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you. I also pray for greetings to yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 8, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your always, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, a lord and compatriot to be honored with the highest respect by me. Zurich.</p>
