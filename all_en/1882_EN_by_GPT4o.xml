      <p>The late remembrance of duty should not be blamed, especially if no negligence has been omitted, most learned man. For I am far away, there are few messengers, and I hear late; but now that I have a γραμματοφόρον (letter carrier), by whose work both my letters are delivered to you and yours to me, I should not fail in my duty, but by writing to you, I wish in words and have in reality the gratitude as diligently as possible. For such is your authority among all, such is the gravity in preaching, as I hear, and such, as those who know you are accustomed to report, is the integrity of life, that not only your words but also the morals of your life incite both foreign and external nations as well as the country you inhabit to live well and happily; for you are not only, as James has it, a diligent herald and preacher of the gospel and the sacred commandments of God, but you are also a true doer and operator of it, and you live the life you command with words, not deceiving yourself in the least. Nor indeed are you like those who consider their external appearance in a mirror and, as soon as they have departed, consign to oblivion what its form was; but you preach both truly and sincerely and are an example and παραδείγματι (paradigm) to others in the manner of living, so that they follow what you both command and do.</p>
      <p>But why do I write these things to your gravity, when my barbarism is so great that it can neither worthily praise your piety nor sufficiently celebrate the integrity of life with encomiums nor, as is fitting, narrate the doctrine to be revered and admired? For it would be necessary, if I were to praise you as truth demands, to have either the eloquence of Demosthenes or the eloquence of Cicero; for your merits are so great that both a sufficiently long time and the acumen of genius and the elegance of speech more than childish are desired to explain them. For God, as it appears, has so pleased himself in you that he has adapted you both to his kingdom and to this world; for in this earthly prison of life, you pass the course of your age as if you were dead, although you live, and that not only first to Christ, without whom no life can exist, and then to yourself, but also to countless others, whom you strive and diligently endeavor to lead to that immortality, which you yourself are about to attain after you have departed from this life, with the gods willing: and that your piety may bring about what it desires, I will not cease to pray to God παντοκράτορα (Almighty), the giver of all good things; and I will not cease to knock on his divine ears, that you may survive in this life for a very long time.</p>
      <p>I have written these things to you more boldly than prudently; but your benefits to me have been so great, who deigned to write to me, unknown to you, and to supply what was necessary for adorning the mind and polishing the intellect, that I might justly be accused of negligence and seem to have forgotten my duty if I did not in every way show myself mindful of you and your merits.</p>
      <p>And furthermore, I have great hope that you will forgive this more than womanly audacity of mine, who, a virgin, dare to write to a man and to the father of erudition, and that you will be willing to grant pardon to my barbarism, which does not hesitate to disturb you, occupied with more serious matters, with my trifles, trifles, and childish letters; if I shall have obtained this from you, I will consider myself to owe very much to your piety in many respects. For if anything has been sinned in this part, it is rather to be attributed to the abundance of my love towards you and your virtues than either to audacity, which in no way should fall into our sex, or to rashness, which is very accustomed to oppose the power of judgment; for the splendor of your gifts so dazzles the acumen of my mind, whether when I read your works or when I think of you, that not what is fitting for my condition, but what is due to your dignity, comes into the cognition of my mind. Moreover, the mind is accustomed to fluctuate in this way and to be distracted into different parts, while I consider with myself what my age, sex, and mediocrity in letters, or rather infancy, demand; which, both individually and collectively, deter much more from the duty of writing: but on the other hand, when I consider the excellence of your virtues, the celebrity of your fame, and the greatness of your merits towards me, the superior thought yields to the inferior, τὸ πρέπον μοι (what is fitting for me) to your dignity; and what your merits demand is accustomed to prevail with me more than what all other things advise. The rest, most illustrious man, is that I earnestly ask you to say from the heart, in my name, greetings to that renowned man, the leader in erudition, piety, and gravity, Bibliander, although unknown to me.</p>
      <p>For I hear such a great fame of his erudition in our country, and I receive that his name is so illustrious among all for the singular gifts of the mind granted to him by God, that I am compelled, willingly or unwillingly, to embrace the piety and sincerity of such a man, sent to us from heaven (unless I am mistaken), which I myself have attained a little knowledge of, and I pray to God that such pillars of the church, as you are, may be in prosperous health for a long time. And I will not cease to wish well to your gravity, to give thanks for the humanity shown to me, and to bid you farewell, as long as it is allowed to breathe. Farewell, most learned man.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety, Jane Gray.</p>
