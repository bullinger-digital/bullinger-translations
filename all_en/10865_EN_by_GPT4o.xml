    <p xml:id="regest1">Wrote to Stuttgart regarding the matter of [Johannes] Haab. Received Bullinger's desired changes to the [Württemberg] church order, but believes that much has already been achieved with the removal of certain sections; the attached catechism corresponds to the one published by Brenz. Sends Bullinger the alms ordinance. Is overwhelmed with work; asks for intercession. Greetings. Will deliver Bullinger's dispatch to [Melchior] Volmar, who is staying in Wildbad in the Black Forest.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I wrote a long letter to Stuttgart on behalf of your cause, Habii, to see if I could assist in any way with this matter, but I am unable to write more to you at this time.</p>
      <p>I received with a grateful heart your desires for changes in the rites of the Württemberg churches and what you wish to be altered; however, if you consider more carefully my current position, you will easily understand by whose counsel and authority all these things have been done. I seemed to have achieved a great deal, as certain things, far more superstitious, which some had attributed even beyond Schnepf, were removed at my suggestion. We hope, by the Lord's grace, that the princes will eventually provide more solid reforms. The minor catechism is exactly the one published by Brenz, not a word has been changed, except that some prayers have been added at the end so that the pages would not be empty. Otherwise, I knew how much the old ones varied here.</p>
      <p>I am sending the ordinance of alms.</p>
      <p>Beyond this, I can do nothing and am very angry with these excessive occupations of mine, which bind me to them so much that they unwillingly pull me away from even a brief greeting to friends. You, my venerable brother, diligently commend me and my ministry to Christ the Savior.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers, especially your wife, Pellican, Leo, Theodor, etc. Farewell again and forgive the brevity through Christ.</p>
      <p>May 21st.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>Volmar is staying at the Wildbad in the Black Forest. When he returns, I will deliver what you sent.</p>
