      <p>The grace of the Lord through Jesus Christ be with us, etc.</p>
      <p>Highly learned and honorable sir, most gracious friend, your honor's willing servant at all times. I am hopeful that your honor has received my letters through Lord Waltharten of Ulm, along with a promissory note for one hundred florins from the aforementioned Lord Waltharten. And although I have imposed a great burden on your honor in that letter, I do not doubt that your honor will consider it kindly and not take it amiss, but turn it to the best, etc.</p>
      <p>On the 16th of December, I received a letter from my son Conrad, dated in T端bingen, in which he wrote to me that he had to leave Zurich because of some young fellows who bore him no goodwill. I heard this with great heartfelt sorrow, that he has thus interrupted his studies, although the matters were not so severe and childish as your honor will understand from the enclosed note.</p>
      <p>I cannot sufficiently wonder that the good gentlemen (according to his letter) gave him such advice and did not direct him to your honor and other gentlemen, who could have settled and laid to rest such quarrels and disputes among the young people, and also punished the guilty. I fear, however, that there must be another reason than the one he indicates to me: the innocent should not have to leave. Your honor will now be able to learn more than I from those who started and ended the quarrel.</p>
      <p>I am in this case like Thomas, I cannot entirely believe the son's letter until I finally learn from your honor how the matter stands; for he has written to me several times that he would like to leave Zurich; he also writes now that he would rather die than return to Zurich, believing that his life is not safe there. Therefore, my very friendly request and desire to your honor is that you would kindly undertake a work of charity for me and the boy, and find out how things have gone, and if possible, settle the matters and call the boy back to Zurich, where he might otherwise stay safely and in good peace, so that his begun studies might have a continuation. If it is as he writes, then these are very minor matters that could be settled quietly and are not worth the trouble that he should have had to leave. I would certainly wish that it had not happened, even if it had to be paid with money, etc.</p>
      <p>But if the matters were so severe that he could not stay in Zurich with God and honor, then my very humble request and desire (since your honor undoubtedly knows what is necessary for him and is knowledgeable of his studies) is that your honor would consider and reflect on it and send him from T端bingen to another place, where he might continue his studies and not lose time, whether it be Lausanne or elsewhere, wherever it would be pleasing to your honor and you would consider it good, and thereafter he might also be provided for, so that he does not act according to his own pleasure and will and might be in strict and severe hands and not follow his own will, etc. Although I would prefer to have him in Zurich for a while longer.</p>
      <p>However, if it cannot be, (I must commend it to God the Lord), then let it be elsewhere, Lausanne (I am informed) where he might learn the French language somewhat. Yet I leave it to your honor.</p>
      <p>Your honor will deal with him and treat him as if he were your own son.</p>
      <p>God the Lord will be the rewarder and repay the effort. I would not like to have him in T端bingen, because he chose the place himself; for I like to do what such young people distrust, so that they do not think it goes according to their will, and in these years one must break their will the most, so that they do not become stubborn, which Conrad also needs. Yet whether it be in Zurich, T端bingen, or elsewhere, as your honor recognizes as best, I will not be disturbed, but will accept it from your honor with great thanks.</p>
      <p>I commend it to God the Lord and your honor.</p>
      <p>Where I will be able to repay such effort for your honor, may your honor deal with me as with a willing servant; you will find me willing and ready in all things.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God graciously preserve your honor in long-lasting health and in His blessing through the power of His Spirit and comfort me joyfully; for together with my wife, I bear great sorrow for the boy, that he wants to be so willful. May God the Lord graciously turn it from him and grant him His Holy Spirit to the fear of God. Given at Przeslawicz on the day of Thomas in the year 1558.</p>
      <p>Your honor's willing servant Conrad Krupek of Przeslawicz subscribes.</p>
      <p>To the reverend, learned, and pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, most esteemed lord, are given.</p>
