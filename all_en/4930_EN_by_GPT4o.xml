      <p>Greetings. I received the letter you wrote through the most honorable man, Mr. Tscharner.</p>
      <p>He will return to us from Certiaco; then we will see how we can best welcome the well-deserving man. In these matters, I was very pleased with what he explained, as he did not hope in vain.</p>
      <p>I see what I always said would happen: those dictators will someday prescribe laws for all of us. But the sword is given into the hands of our treacherous men by the furious ones.</p>
      <p>They are strong with the strength of others; but God will also set an end to this. I anxiously await what has been decided in the assembly.</p>
      <p>Hopefully something good! I sent the letters to Mr. Coignet by post at the hour I received them from you; for it seems worthwhile to hurry. We have fast horses arranged from here to France, that is, the post; therefore, if there is anything that seems worth mentioning, send it to me promptly. Whatever the Spaniards plan, be strong and trust in God, do not give in. They will not devour everyone. On August 26th, the most distinguished man, Mr. Martyr, left here for France; he will be accompanied by the envoy of the King of Navarre, equipped with the public faith of the King and Queen of France, and Mr. Coignet, who awaits him in Neuch√¢tel. Pray to the Lord that he may turn such a great matter to good.</p>
      <p>He departed happy and cheerful.</p>
      <p>Please, pray to the Lord to bless us.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, August 29th, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
