    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer has nothing to add to yesterday's letter [from the Council of Konstanz] to the Council of Zurich. [Georg] Frölich wrote to Blarer, instructing him to send the enclosed letter(s) to Bullinger in Zurich immediately with his own messenger if necessary, which he hereby does.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He was partially informed about the negotiations [at the Diet] in Baden. Should Bullinger learn anything new, he should share it, especially how the Grisons were answered regarding the passage [of foreign mercenaries].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- It is pitiful how people are blinded by the Judas kisses of the Burgundian [Charles V.]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The [Schmalkaldic War] has begun successfully [with the capture of Füssen], may God grant it a good continuation! From Ulm, it is written that many people are joining the [Schmalkaldic League]. Care should be taken not to have too many [soldiers] and too little trust [in God]. Blarer had hoped that the Confederates would seize the opportunity to spread the honor and power [of God], but this does not seem to be the case.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger and Blarer should pray for Christ's Church. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger has or will learn the content of the letter sent the previous day from the Council of Konstanz to the Council of Zurich. In haste: He still has several letters from Augsburg to answer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [P.S.:] The Council of Konstanz intends to continue informing the Council of Zurich about the war events, so Blarer will only write about it if he has additional information.</p>

      <p>Beloved lord and brother. I have nothing to write, except what you will learn from the letter that you and your lords are to receive herewith. Laetus wrote to me, instructing that the letters, if there is no certain gratuitous (costless) message available, should be sent to Zurich immediately by a personal messenger, which I have done herewith. We have partially learned what was negotiated in Baden regarding this matter. We will soon be informed of the rest. If you know anything, let me know, especially what response is given to the Grisons regarding the passage.</p>

      <p>The Burgundian carries Judas' kiss everywhere, and it is pitiful how people allow themselves to be so blinded.</p>

      <p>The war has begun well with God. May God will that it proceeds without bloodshed and that the Lord's terror drives away the enemies! Our people write from Ulm that so many people are joining our side from everywhere, it is incredible. But there is concern that there will be more people than is good, and less trust than is necessary. But the Lord does not want to look upon us, but upon the praise of His name, to save the honor of His Christ and to extend His kingdom. If only your Swiss would be wise in time, to whom now the greatest opportunity for increasing glory and dominion shines wonderfully! And oh, three and four times happy, if they understand! But I worry, there will not be so much luck with it.</p>

      <p>Let us love one another, my Bullinger, and diligently and earnestly intercede with Christ the peacemaker for His church! Greetings to the brothers and friends.</p>

      <p>My lords have written to yours about all matters, as you will learn or have already learned. Given in haste. I must also write again to Augsburg, from where I have received several letters.</p>

      <p>Am. Bl.</p>
      <p>My lords are willing to inform yours at any time about what happens in this war exercise, from which you can always learn. It is not necessary for me to write about it all the time. If I have something special that they do not write, I will be diligent and not neglect anything.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
