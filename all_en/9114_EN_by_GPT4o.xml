      <p>S. D. For quite some time now, dear brother, I have not received any letters from you, except that I recently received a brief note along with Mr. Lentulus's report on Turkish affairs, for which I thank you. I was glad to learn the truth about the expedition of the Holy League, as they call it, about which many have spread many astonishing lies. Now it appears from these reports that they have achieved nothing worth mentioning despite great expenses; they were finally forced to return home with their affairs unfinished, while the Turks remained in Methone. It is written from Augsburg that no Turkish emperor before this one has prepared himself more strongly by land and sea, etc. Therefore, those who live to see the coming year will hear of wonders and, I fear, experience horrors.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us. In the Netherlands, things are as I last wrote; since then, I have heard nothing else, except that the Duke of Holstein, who joined with Albano, wants to be paid or is waiting for it. It is written, though I do not know how true it is, that the king is advancing on La Rochelle with 20,000 strong and heavy artillery, intending to destroy the city completely. It is also said (though I do not believe it) that Count Montgomery has led 6,000 Englishmen there. However, it is certain that those inside, not a few of whom are French, have resolved that since they must die, they wish to die by the sword. The king has offered them mercy.</p>
      <p>They have replied that they cannot expect any mercy, as the king acts so cruelly as he does. Therefore, they have committed themselves to God.</p>
      <p>They would gladly show themselves obedient if peace, loyalty, and faith were upheld; but since this is lacking everywhere, they cannot hope that it will be upheld with them either. The king has issued a document in which he justifies and excuses his murder; it is crafted with all diligence and skill, because a sickly speech requires embellishments, while the speech of truth is simple, etc. He cites everything that has happened over the past ten years, saying how the admiral conspired against him, and therefore he and his followers had to be punished, which is contrary to everything he previously wrote to the governor in Lyon and also presented in open council in Zurich and Bern. The document is in French and printed, and made so impressive that anyone who does not know the rogue behind it can easily be misled.</p>
      <p>On December 7th, a general Swiss diet is scheduled in Baden. There, I hear, the seven places want to find out what they should expect from the cities, and I suspect the Frenchman will come there and with the aforementioned document or response will blind many eyes and then demand soldiers with whom he will at once destroy what still lives. May God come to the aid of His own and silence the lying tongues and destroy the plans of the bloodthirsty. Praying to God that He may promote the good and hinder all evil. The people of Glarus held a land assembly last Monday (November 24th) because the king approached them, asking if they would provide him with soldiers according to the agreement or not, and they have decided to write to him and answer: they will uphold the agreement against foreign people, but not against their own and the faithful; if this does not please him, they will consider it a service if he releases them from the agreement, etc.</p>
      <p>Such an answer will cause unrest and burn in the eyes of other places. May God grant steadfastness; for they have forbidden going to the king under penalty of life, honor, and property, and it will be announced in all churches. Many poor people have fled from France to Geneva and into the newly acquired Bernese lands. If there are rich people among you in the Grisons who would like to support them, who are naked and bare, poor and needy, they would be doing a good work, and if you send me anything, I would faithfully deliver it through Bern. The people of Bern have held a collection for them, which turned out quite well, etc. And do not doubt, if it is initiated here, it will also be done according to ability; for otherwise, my lords are currently heavily burdened with the new order of the poor, and a great good is being done. May the Lord remember us! Our Lord and God has inflicted a great loss on us here at this time, which we are not worthy of better; for He has taken from us through death my friendly, dear brother-in-law, Mr. Johannes Wolff, pastor at the Fraum√ºnster. He was a wise, prudent, modest, pious, very learned, peaceful, and very friendly man.</p>
      <p>We were very fond of each other; yet it must be separated, and God deals with me so that I must outlive all my dear, faithful people and remain forever in the cart, yes, stuck in the thorn bush. May the Lord deliver me according to His most holy and best will! For I do not resist, if I can still be useful to Him in the church. At least may He preserve me and bless my labors.</p>
      <p>How many glorious people have I outlived: Leo, Pellican, Bibliander, Megander, Otto, Gessner, Martyr, and several others; indeed, no one who lived and served the church when I was called by the Lord 50 years ago is still alive. I therefore hope that my calling to the heavenly kingdom is near. Yet may the Lord do what is good in His eyes, etc.</p>
      <p>God be with you! Greet all good gentlemen and brothers for me, whom you know well, Carolus, the councilors, Pontisella, Campell, etc. November 28th, in great haste, 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my dear lord and brother.</p>
