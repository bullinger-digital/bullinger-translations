      <p>S. Since Mr. Consul and our highest tribune remind me that they will set out for the assembly through Z체rich early tomorrow morning, I must quickly prepare any letters I intend to send to you. Most esteemed father, I have nothing to write at present except that merchants returning directly from Milan report that the same rumor about the captured admiral and his defeated army has been spread there for several days, but it quickly cooled down, and no sign of victory was ever given, which for many is evidence that it is either a complete fabrication or something entirely different from what our people are eager to disseminate. Our royal representatives also report from the mouth of Mr. Legate that Pfifer and H채ss, leaders from the camp, affirm that a battle indeed took place, with great numbers slain on both sides, and that fortune, the mistress of the field, remained with the king, but nothing at all about the admiral being captured or wounded.</p>
      <p>Two industrious painters have come to us from Italy in recent days, who report that they heard letters being read in Milan, which stated that the city of Poitiers was forcibly captured by the admiral, and that 12,000 of the king's men perished there; hence the king ordered that no one should divulge the capture of Poitiers under the penalty of hanging from the nearest branch. Perhaps the adversaries released those dreadful rumors to taint and silence the incredible defeat of their own and the captivity of the city of Poitiers with their lies. We await daily the matter as it truly happened, so that we may silence the malevolent and those congratulatory voices. May Lord Jesus graciously protect us all. I write this to you quickly at night, knowing you will kindly interpret it as you always do.</p>
      <p>Quickly, October 21, 1569, Chur.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in every kind of virtue and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Church of Z체rich, his most esteemed lord, with perpetual reverence.</p>
      <p>To the pastor at the Great Minster in Z체rich.</p>
