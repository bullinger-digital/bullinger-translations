      <p>Greetings. I received, most illustrious sir and honorable compater, your most welcome letters along with those new matters that were sent to you from various places. For which both I and all those whom you kindly instructed me to greet in your name and to share those matters with, give the greatest thanks and are exceedingly glad that they have finally perceived something which they believe will be for the salvation of the Church of Christ. May God grant that henceforth we may always perceive such and even more fortunate things, and we pray to Him that He may deign to kindly rescue and liberate all those who groan under the cross and are surrounded by the most severe sieges. For we see that the Lord wages war more through His own virtue and divine power than through human strength, and we hope that He will finally confound and overthrow the greatest armies through a certain small band, so that whatever excellent things are accomplished, we may learn to ascribe them not to our own strength, but entirely to divine power.</p>
      <p>What I recently wrote to you about the rejection of Lord Tobias in Chur, I think is false; for we had received this from Mr. Samuel Schwizer of Bern, who wanders here and there and is most troublesome to churches and church ministers everywhere; for we have also found him to be vain and most deceitful in other matters, etc.</p>
      <p>My dear compater, we ask you to continue to be towards us as you have been up to now, and that you will not cease to communicate to us those things which we cannot perceive from elsewhere. All those whom you greeted send their most dutiful regards to you and all yours, especially our fellow ministers and brothers Mr. Jacob Franck in Schwanden and Mr. Johannes Jacob RÃ¼ger in Mollis and the rest. My wife also wishes you well, etc.</p>
      <p>In haste. In Glarus, February 25, 1573. Your most loving Johannes Hugo.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich, my most esteemed and dear lord and compater.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
