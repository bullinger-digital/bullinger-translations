    <p xml:id="regest1">Everyone greatly regrets that the [imperial troops from Salem] were able to escape. The [Schmalkaldic League] did not deserve this, for [Emperor Charles V] is deceitful and more cunning than the devil. He avoids battle, thereby creating a deceptive sense of security among the [Schmalkaldic League] and forces them into great expenses. Only through repentance and prayer can faith and both inner and outer freedom be preserved.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] set out with an army from Kassel on the 16th [of July]. On the Sunday before [11th of July], he participated in the Lord's Supper with the congregation. He is said to have reached beyond Würzburg by the 26th [of July]. Now he is near the Schmalkaldic League's encampments. After joining them, he will advance against the Emperor; unless the allies prevent him from doing so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- King [Christian III] of Denmark and the [Hanseatic cities] are arming against the [southern Netherlands]. Duke Maurice [of Saxony] guards the borders to the territories of [King] Ferdinand, namely to Lusatia, Silesia, and Bohemia. Charles V has been pursuing his goal for 25 years. Bullinger can well imagine the intrigues he has plotted against the princes and cities since then. But the Lord will punish him for his lies!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- During the capture of Weißenhorn, a rather large treasure is said to have been confiscated. Abbeys are repeatedly occupied, the localities of the Augsburg Bishop [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] were besieged, and more cities were set on fire. Furthermore, an attack by enemy troops against the [Grisons] is said to have been attempted in vain.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The Schmalkaldic League needs money; the enemies have it in abundance. Hopefully, however, they will not resort to dishonest means! For if God wants to grant victory, He will also provide the necessary money for the maintenance of the mercenaries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Despite the ban imposed by the [Catholic cantons], large numbers of mercenaries from various Swiss cantons are passing through Basel, some of them heading to Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Bullinger has certainly heard of the terrible lightning strike in Solothurn. Some people were killed in the incident.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings, among others, to Rudolf [Gwalther].</p>

      <p>Greetings. No one can sufficiently marvel that the morsel was snatched from the jaws of our people. Everyone laments because they think they have taken security - which is not fitting for us against such a deceitful enemy. For he is more cunning than even Satan himself and will draw from this source. The Ghent man will not engage in battle unless forced: First, to make them more secure, then to wear them out, and finally, to impoverish them. Therefore, we must confront the trickster in the Lord, who knows and can break all the wiles of evil, and besides Him, no one else can. We must therefore consider to what end the people should be driven, namely to repentance and prayers, so that we may retain religion and freedom, that is, double freedom, internal and external. For these alone are sought.</p>

      <p>On the sixteenth of this month, the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] set out from Kassel with an army, after having communicated with his church on the preceding Sunday and committed himself to their prayers. On the twenty-sixth, he is thought to have advanced beyond Würzburg and is now not far from our camps; when he joins them, he will seek the source of evil directly, unless prevented by allies.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The King of Denmark and the Saxon cities are well preparing against the Belgians. Duke Maurice guards the common borders from the neighboring territories of Ferdinand, such as Lusatia, Silesia, and Bohemia. The Ghent man has been rolling this stone for 25 years. With what deceptions, with what lies he has meanwhile used against the princes and cities, you yourself will consider. But the Lord will destroy all who speak lies. Do you think, therefore, that he will bear his lies with impunity?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is reported here that the town of Weißenhorn was captured and a rather large treasure was found, abbeys are also being occupied everywhere, and all the cities of the Bishop of Augsburg have been taken. Some cities are fined for arson. The soldiers (cavalry of the adversaries) attempted something against the Grisons, I do not know in which jaws, but unsuccessfully. Tell me if you have anything certain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Our people complain about the lack of money, which the enemies, however, have in abundance. They fear, therefore, that something may be done against what is fitting. This pains me greatly. However, I am of the opinion that if the Lord is going to give victory, He will also give money, from which the soldiers can be sustained. From the Swiss cantons, I do not know which, a great force is passing through, whatever they may prohibit - certainly men of war. And it is known that some number is now in Strasbourg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>You have surely heard about the lightning that struck Solothurn. It is cruel, what is said. Several people perished. The rest were so terrified that they almost despaired.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell in Christ, in whom you are strong with Rudolf and other brothers. Basel, July 30, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>O. M. yours.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, his brother in the Lord, to be respected.</p>
