      <p> Greetings. The things you shared for reading were very pleasing to me; I now return them to you. With us, no less uncertain news about the French war is being spread than with you; indeed, now everything has fallen silent, and no one brings forth any new matters, because it is established that almost everything that has been reported so far has been false or at least uncertain. Therefore, I have absolutely nothing to write to you about now. Your judgment about the French war is not at all absurd, and similar outcomes are well deduced from similar causes. As I consider the old age of the world, the various sermons I have read through many times, I hope rather than assert that a great downfall, if not the destruction, of papal tyranny is imminent. I have delivered what you entrusted to Schenck. Farewell. </p>
      <p> Given at Bocksberg, February 10, in the year 68. Your most observant Georg von Stetten. </p>
      <p> To the venerable, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zurich. </p>
