    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes only briefly, as a messenger with a letter from Leipzig is currently traveling to Zurich. Forgot to mention that the schoolmaster being sought [for Basel] must possess or acquire the title of Magister; [Sebastian] Münster cannot become Karlstadt's successor as Professor of Theology due to his refusal of the doctoral promotion; this should also be communicated to Pellikan and Theodor [Bibliander]. The meetings in Swabia, Franconia, and along the Rhine to prepare for the Diet of Speyer remained inconclusive due to the disproportionate demands of the princes on the cities. The Turkish conquerors of a town not far from Vienna are said to have killed everyone they encountered there; King Ferdinand had shortly before replaced 800 German mercenaries, among whom was also a Basler, with Italians. The princes hesitate to travel to Speyer after Hans Wurst [Duke Heinrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel] has once again published [a defamatory pamphlet] against [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse.</p>

      <p>Greetings. A short time allows for a short letter. The letters from Leipzig arrived in the midst of my affairs, and it was convenient for a messenger to go to you. Therefore, be content with these few words.</p>
      <p>While I was seeking a schoolmaster, I forgot that he must either already be a master or become one. Therefore, before you send someone like that, it is necessary to inquire about the title, whether he has it or is willing to receive it if he does not. May they have a good year with the titles! Münster cannot succeed the late Karlstadt in the theological lecture unless he becomes a doctor. Therefore, he is compelled to remain a grammarian for his entire life because he refuses the title. I ask you to explain this matter to Pellikan and Theodor.</p>
      <p>The nobility of Swabia is said to have consulted with the cities on what should be entrusted to the delegates for the Diet of Speyer. Similarly, this happened in Franconia and along the Rhine. However, the princes stood so firmly with their cities that the delegates departed with matters unresolved. They imposed money and soldiers on the cities in a manner that is not at all tolerable. For example, the people of Strasbourg must give slightly less than any one elector, but more than their bishop, all the Margraves of Baden, and three powerful counts.</p>
      <p>Regarding the city and fortress that the Turks have occupied by force not far from Vienna, I believe you have already heard. It is said they killed everyone they found. In that city was a citizen of Basel along with eight hundred German soldiers. After dismissing them, Ferdinand placed Italians there. Soon after, such a cruel crime occurred. What else could the young prince do?</p>
      <p>They are said to be gathering slowly in Speyer. Hans Wurst has written anew against Hesse. That beast prevents the princes from willingly leaving their domains. And he does everything with impunity. The Lord's anger against us is manifesting itself more than clearly enough.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours and the brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 3, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
