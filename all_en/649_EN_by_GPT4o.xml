      <p>S. I have waited until now to see if there was anything to respond to my last letter; but you remain silent. Indeed, I could not remain silent any longer after Laelius indicated that he was going to visit you, even though I have no leisure, having a dinner and two sermons to prepare for the next day. What should I write then? First about Laelius, then whatever else comes to mind. Laelius seems to me to be a truly good young man, learned, pious, and understanding of Christ, and also very fond of you; for he has so devoted himself to you that he venerates you as a father; he wants you to freely criticize whatever you see in him that needs correction, aiming for good and salutary things in a fatherly manner. I also ask you to do this, not because it is necessary; for you already perform your duty towards him abundantly, and he conducts himself in such a way, even of his own accord, that he does not need any reproach. Therefore, let him be most commendable to you in the Lord. The rest is: Heydeggius was called by the cities, that is, by a certain margrave on behalf of the cities, and left secretly, whatever the cause may be. The men who called him are strong in the Lord and eager against the tyrant, the servant of the Antichrist; however, they do not have the prudence needed against the devil's deceits. Therefore, they summoned him as a good, pious, and prudent man, who can oppose the devil through piety and diabolical men through pious and strong prudence.</p>
      <p>He left in such a way that for at least four days no one should know, so that rumors (since today nothing is safe) do not cause harm on the journey. On the day he left, he reported to me through a certain trusted person: "Indeed, I am leaving, called by this and that person, and I commend myself to your and the church's prayers, so that I may safely reach where I have been called and do what pertains to the glory of God and the salvation of the German church; for I have proposed nothing else to myself and will devote both my life and whatever the Lord has granted to this purpose." So he left; may the Lord be with the man successfully. It seems to me that those who requested the man are planning something great. Everyone must pray that the Lord provides them assistance; for only the cities remain, which Caesar still desires to devour to satisfy his ambitious appetite; and then there is us, whom he constantly covets; as was written to me from Leipzig yesterday. Meanwhile, we sleep securely, neither trusting ourselves nor the good advisors who are outside; yet it is certain that the Lord will protect His church. I will tell you everything about Heydeggius in your ear.</p>
      <p>What Captain LÄ™tus is planning here, as I can guess, I cannot know for certain. I never saw the man except yesterday; he had his flock with him, and they were going to dine together with Count Georg, who recently became my neighbor. He has been in our city for several days now, I believe not without reason; what he intends to accomplish, if it is what I guess, I do not know. I commit the matter to the Lord; for we do not dare to mutter anything against it, I tell you, through Veltius, about whom you did not say a word, even though you could. But why did you say nothing about the shipwreck that some people from Chur had on that lake?</p>
      <p>From Pellicanus' letters to Munster, I understood a little. I immediately informed the consul of the matter, in case anything might be stirred against the alliance, about which almost no good person speaks well. We are the lords.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with the whole family; greet Theodor, Pellicanus, Gualther, and Otto, to whom you should say, if you happen to meet him, that I sent eight of his booklets to Lord Peter Scher; only four remain. What should have been written first, I thank you for my Jacob, whom you received, nurtured, and met so kindly; he cannot commend your humanity to me enough, he will remember your kindness someday, which I understood well when you consigned it to oblivion.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, in the month of August, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most excellent man, the most faithful minister of the Lord, his venerable lord in Christ.</p>
