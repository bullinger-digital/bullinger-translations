      <p>S. Although I do not have anything particularly necessary to write to you, most esteemed and dearest lord and godfather, I cannot refrain from writing at least a few words to you, lest the duty of writing to you falls into some disuse by writing nothing. The primary matter is that I commend to you these young men of ours, who are being sent to you for the sake of their studies in place of Andreas and Herlin. One of them is related to Master Bibliander by some kinship, while the other, the younger one, is a boy of very keen intellect, and of whom we all have great hope; therefore, I especially commend him to you, so that you may use his service if you ever need it. Perhaps they will stay with Master Bibliander, if he wishes to receive them, or they will go to my brother.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, everything is silent with us; we only fear that something bad will arise from Geneva. There is no longer any mention of the alliance; they are silent, and our people pretend not to notice. Meanwhile, uncertain rumors spread that the king will invade this city and is plotting many things now with treachery and betrayal; for the cardinals and bishops are particularly hostile to this city. The Genevans themselves fear this, they prepare for a siege, buy weapons, grain, and other such things, fortify the walls with wickerwork and cannons, keep the gates almost perpetually closed and guarded by armed citizens. What the outcome will be, I do not know. There is no one who urges the renewal of the alliance, neither among them nor among our people, and even if there are, they preach only to the deaf. The magnitude of the danger has not yet been able to compel them to change anything about their proposals; they publicly commend themselves to God, as they are deserted by all men, they hope for divine help to begin when human aid ceases.</p>
      <p>Would that this were not due to some fault of theirs! I pray to the Lord for them, that He may powerfully defend them for the glory of His name and the church they have there; yet I wish they could have accommodated themselves more to our people.</p>
      <p>We have nothing from Germany now. Among the Valaisans, the truth is being strongly contended for, not without fruit. I must tell you a ridiculous story: Perhaps you know the abbot of St. Maurice in the Valais region; he is a drunkard and yet cunning, an author of evil counsels, who even promoted the burning of the Zurich Bible to a great extent. He had a guest who came to him with several horses and pretended to be a Florentine from the Medici family and boasted much about his influence with the pope and all the Italians. Meanwhile, he complained that he was deprived of money and was hurrying to Italy to carry out great affairs. He asked the abbot to lend him 400 crowns; in return, he promised him an abbey not far from Milan, as well as a cardinal's hat, which he intended to obtain for him in this way; for he could not obtain this unless he was endowed with two benefices. He asked the abbot to follow him soon; he would wait for him in Milan and hand over the promised abbey to him along with the 400 crowns. The abbot prepared himself immediately and came to Milan with a large retinue; he found the impostor, who ordered him to stay in the inn for several days; meanwhile, he would arrange everything to receive him honorably in the abbey; for it was customary for new possessors of this kind to be introduced solemnly with a procession. He waited a full eight days; meanwhile, the impostor fled to who knows where. The abbot had to pay the costs, became the laughingstock of everyone, and had to borrow money to return home, also missing his 400 crowns. Now all of Valais mocks him, and everyone mocks the Valaisans with their new cardinal. Some captains from Valais told us this story here. I wanted to write this to you, so that I would not write nothing. May the Lord preserve you perpetually along with all yours, whom you will greet in my name and in the name of mine.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 13, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his most esteemed and dearest lord and godfather.</p>
