      <p>S. D. Finally having the opportunity, dearest godfather in the Lord, I send the offspring of my Psalter; I pray that you may consider this token of my gratitude, however modest, favorably for your kindness.</p>
      <p>My household has been troubled with considerable inconvenience since the 18th of April. My wife, having fallen from some steps, miscarried; she had been pregnant for five months, and the child was male.</p>
      <p>After the miscarriage, she began to bleed so excessively that she almost lost her life along with the blood. Now, by the grace of the Lord, she is somewhat restored. Meanwhile, the benevolence of the lords, by which they increased the annual stipend, has brought some solace. Thanks be to the Lord, and then to friends, to you and others.</p>
      <p>I will send my Abraham to Tübingen around Pentecost, God willing; for there he will be supported by the stipend of a certain citizen of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>If you know any of those learned men who are well-disposed towards you and our common cause, I beseech you to recommend my son to them. I will send my nephew Nikolaus, from my brother, to Augsburg, so that he may learn some mechanical skill there. I have decided to somewhat relieve the household expenses, so that I may live more comfortably with the rest of the family.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor here that the Council of Trent has been postponed until the first of September. Would that it were on the gallows, never to be released. There is complete silence about the Magdeburgers; but perhaps Zurzach will bring something, hopefully nothing bad. If you have anything, share it. Farewell very well, dearest godfather in the Lord. Greetings to all yours in the name of myself and all mine, likewise to the remaining brothers, lords, and friends, Mr. Pellican, Bibliander, Rudolf. Bern, 13th of May, 1551. Wolfgang Musculus, your godfather in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have heard nothing about Mr. Butler for a long time; if he is still with you, give him my best regards in my name.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his dearest godfather in Christ. In Zürich.</p>
