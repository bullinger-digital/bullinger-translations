    <p xml:id="regest1">From Bullinger's last two letters [not received and above No. 2199], Erb could see what Bullinger hoped for from him. As soon as Bullinger heard from a reliable source that Erb no longer wanted to stay with [Count Georg of Württemberg], he wished for a new position for Erb. It was quite convenient that the city clerk Georg Frölich from Augsburg was looking for a good scholar for the local church, who was neither a Lutheran nor a Buceran. Bullinger immediately recommended Erb! - After that, he received a letter from the Augsburg council [No. 2204], of which he sends a copy enclosed. Likewise, he encloses an excerpt from Frölich's letter [No. 2203]. - Now he sends the young [Markus Wüst] solely for this matter to obtain Erb's response. However Erb decides, he should consider Bullinger's call to the Augsburgers in his response. Erb should not disdain this God-given opportunity! In his response, he should also, if applicable, share news from Strasbourg or Worms. - [P.S.:] Greetings to [Nikolaus] König, the [city] clerk [Oswald Fürstenlob], and especially to Gerold [Meyer von Knonau the Younger]. [Kaspar] Megander, who is informed about this matter, also sends his regards. - [1st Enclosure: No. 2204, 1-24]. - [2nd Enclosure: No. 2203, 31-43]. - Erb should not abandon the [Zurichers].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt, my dearest Erb, that you have long since received two letters from me, from which you understood what I earnestly desire to obtain from you. I have heard, and learned from trustworthy people, that you no longer wish to remain with your prince; not because you do not love him and the church there, but because for many reasons it is no longer suitable for you to stay in Rychenville. From that moment, I have sincerely wished for you to be provided with another most honorable position, because of your remarkable zeal for the piety and truth of Christ, and because I love you and wish you well from the heart. At that time, my singular friend Georg Frölich, the city clerk of Augsburg, wrote to me, asking if I knew of any good and learned man, who was neither a Lutheran nor a Buceran, to inform him, as such a person was to be called by the church of Augsburg. I immediately recommended my dear Erb in my letters.</p>
      <p>However, I have already communicated all this in previous letters to you. Now, you will understand what has happened since. The most honorable senators of Augsburg, moved by my testimony and recommendation of Erb, today send me these letters inscribed on parchment, a copy of which I send here. I have also included some excerpts from Frölich's letters sent to me the day before. From these, you will see what needs to be done.</p>
      <p>I have sent this eager young man at my own expense to you solely for this matter, and I request a response from you through him by the rights of friendship.</p>
      <p>I would like you to compose this response in such a way that, whichever way you lean, you also consider my reputation with the people of Augsburg, so that when I send them your response, there is nothing in it of which I would be ashamed, as if I had not acted diligently enough, etc.</p>
      <p>You understand what I mean. I hope your faith will not fail me in any way, indeed I urge you in our Lord Jesus, our Savior, not to disdain this very excellent calling. You cannot doubt God's will; therefore, neither can you doubt His help and the strength necessary for this function. You will have faithful and humane colleagues. You will have most generous patrons and lords. The labor will not be as great as you are compelled to endure. Therefore, do not fail Christ, your friends, and yourself. You understand the rest.</p>
      <p>Farewell and embrace the one who wishes you well; write back, and if you have anything worth knowing from Strasbourg or Worms, please share it.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 6th. Greet König, the scribe, and the remaining brothers. In the year 1545. I especially send my greetings to my dear Gerold. Megander, who is aware of this matter, sends his regards to you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Copy of the letter, which is written on parchment and sealed with the secret of the city of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>[...]</p>
      <p>From the letter of Georg Frölich, the city clerk of Augsburg, to Bullinger, July 28, 1545: "As for Matthias Erb, you wisely write that the prince will be reluctant to let him go; therefore, it is quite possible that he will be greatly displeased with our magistrate for calling him. Therefore, first of all, receive Erb's response to your letters, and if he can prepare his departure with good grace, let him first come to you. Then he will be summoned to us with a most honorable calling.</p>
      <p>This will be his condition: He will preach freely for a time in the church of Augsburg. As soon as Michael Cellarius, who, alas, will not last long due to poor health, or another of our parish priests can no longer preside over his church, Erb will immediately be appointed, etc. Our magistrate will also set for him an annual salary of 250 or 300 gold coins and a house, so that he can live most honorably." Just do not fail us, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Matthias Erb, his lord and singular friend.</p>
