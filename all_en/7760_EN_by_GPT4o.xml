      <p>Greetings. I have nothing, most reverend father, that is worthy of a response to your last letter. For everything at the Ilanz assembly was so corrupt that I scarcely dare to commit it to writing with shame. The entire matter of the Cellarius was referred to the commissioners; it was fully entrusted and decreed to them to diligently inquire at Morbegno whether the monks of that place are also guilty, as if the wolves closest to the shepherd of the sheep were forgiven above all others who are far away. Certainly an excellent observation! What do I say about observation, when it is mere extortion of gifts. For the purpose of this commission is that they leave the monks more greased. The ministers openly interceding for the most afflicted churches of Italy were answered by the lord of Rezzonico himself: "You come here and far with your churches. We cannot always deal with your churches; we have other matters to attend to," etc. They were repelled like troublesome dogs. They took very badly our opinion about the extermination of the monks and said this would be the ruin of the whole country. But what wonder, when the power of papal money is so great? - It is said here that the legate is writing to convene new assemblies at his own expense and in them will request abundant soldiers, and thus it is written to us from the royal camps that a new army is to be led out; I do not know who has won or lost.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man.</p>
      <p>Chur, swiftly, January 24, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished and renowned man, Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich and most celebrated doctor, his lord to be honored with perpetual reverence.</p>
