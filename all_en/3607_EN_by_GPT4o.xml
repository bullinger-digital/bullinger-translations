      <p>Most excellent lord, there would be something for me to discuss with you in more lengthy letters, if the honorable man, Lord de la Murette, who will deliver these to you, did not relieve me of the duty of writing on this occasion. For he will discuss with you in great detail about our affairs and about those things which are happening here.</p>
      <p>This one thing I ask of you, that sometime, when the opportunity and leisure present themselves to you, you write to me and add (if it seems appropriate) your letters to both ministers of this city with such mention as seems necessary to you for our friendship and for our affairs, and I will gladly deliver them to them myself.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>From Chur, 5 days before the calends of June 1558.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient friend, Jean Jacques de Cambray.</p>
      <p>To the most renowned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>First of Cambray.</p>
