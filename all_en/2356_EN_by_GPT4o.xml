      <p>Greetings in the Son of God. Although I know well, most humane sir and revered father, that you are more occupied with other more honorable matters and those that contribute more to the church than to have leisure to read my letters, yet a necessity, almost like that of Diomedes, has compelled and forced me to divert you from your learned letters with my unlettered ones. For on the last day of July, letters were delivered to me by my fellow student, which Mr. Karl Eggell had given him to read and had also instructed him to share with me. With what intention he did this is easy to understand.</p>
      <p>May God cause their faces to be covered with shame because they did not seek counsel from the Lord. However, it seemed right, my father, to also send you copies of these, so that you yourself may see whom our church has as its pupils. That Karl acts otherwise than is fitting for him. I have often humbly begged him not to plan anything that could harm the already afflicted church of God... and I especially begged this anxiously, if he found anything lacking in my sermons, to inform me by letter, if he disdained to speak with me, before he published it elsewhere through messengers. This he did once and again; for I received two letters from the man, in which he complained much about my sophistic and philosophical argumentation and entreated me to explain my opinion on the Eucharist as simply and candidly as possible. He obtained what he asked for. With what candor he read and interpreted it can be seen from the response of that mendicant counselor, etc.</p>
      <p>So much for this. You, beloved and revered father in Christ, with your usual kindness towards me and your singular prudence, give counsel on what should be done in this matter. The ministers of the Strasbourg church threaten dire things, especially Mr. Ludwig Rabus of Memmingen, who emerges as a new opponent of true doctrine. What remains now, most excellent man, is that you may be well. May your entire family also be well, along with the whole ecclesiastical assembly.</p>
      <p>May your church fare well and prosper in all things, which may Almighty God always protect with His care and guardianship. You will learn the state of our church at another and more convenient time; that French messenger has some information. Our Karl sends you his regards, as does Mr. Sebastian Scheler, doctor of both laws, and other pious and learned men. Pray for me and the church of God. May God keep you safe and healthy for a long time through His Son for the benefit of the church of Christ. Amen. Forgive, I pray, my father, my lack of refinement. Ravensburg, August 3, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Willing.</p>
