      <p> Greetings. I am very eager to know how your affairs are, as much as I can from your letters, honorable lord and most esteemed brother. I am sure you have received our judgment against Servetus, and the approval of our assertion. At the same time, our most esteemed council has written to yours, urging strongly to restrain this pestilence. What other cities and ministers of the churches have responded, I do not yet know. </p>
      <p> Meanwhile, we pray to the Lord to preserve and protect your church. </p>
      <p> How things stand in England, you will understand from these enclosed letters of mine, sent to me not many days ago from the London prison by the most pious Bishop of Worcester and Gloucester, whom I suspect has already been taken from the living. He writes to me that all divine things are trampled upon, human things prevail. The Duke of Northumberland has been executed, the Duke of Suffolk imprisoned, but soon released because he was innocent, but soon after he was seized by illness and is reported to have passed to the Lord. The excellent man, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has been deposed, and Pole has been appointed in his place. The kingdom's parliament is now being held after the queen's coronation, which began today. Concerning John a Lasco, Martyr, Cox, Sydall, Ochino, and the other most holy servants of God and dearest brothers, I have nothing certain yet. If you have learned either better or worse from friends, do not let me remain ignorant. The Lord visits our sins, and may He soon cast out the Antichrist. He permits many things so that those who are tested may be proven. Let us pray to the Lord that He may preserve His own in such great troubles and overthrow Satan. Farewell eternally with all the ministers and brothers, our fellow workers. </p>
      <p> Most hastily. ZÃ¼rich, October 15, 1553. Yours, Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious John Calvin, pious pastor of the church of Geneva, honorable lord and dearest brother. </p>
      <p> Geneva. </p>
