    <p xml:id="regest1">To fill the gaps [caused by the plague], there is a lack of leaders who are truly evangelical-minded, therefore there is a threat that secular interests will prevail among the authorities, and nothing better can be expected from the younger generation given their upbringing; it is to be feared that God will punish this ingratitude. The occasion for these thoughts is the death of [Simon] Grynaeus, Mayor [Jakob Meyer], [Wolfgang] Capito, Wilhelm Zwingli, Eusebius Oecolampadius, and other promising young people - 18 in Strasbourg -; with Capito, Strasbourg has lost a precious treasure; it is hoped that Bucer will remain with the church, but his wife [Elisabeth Silbereisen] and two daughters [Anastasia and Sara] have also already died, as has the wife of Beat Gering [Agathe]. He recommends his godson [Joswald?], the son of the letter bearer Barbara [...].</p>

      <p>Greetings. The Lord afflicts us enough by taking the best among us and leaving scarcely any to rightly replace them. The situation is dire if you look closely. And unless He knows how to make children of Abraham from stones, which gives us some hope, we would be very worried about those who remain and seem to be able to be substituted. So rare is a pious leader among the foremost. The Gospel is indeed pleasing, and the papacy displeasing, but both for reasons other than what is proper. For the Gospel is sweet, pleasant, delightful, if you exclude repentance. The papacy is devoid of all pleasantness with the removal of carnal license. Therefore, those who wish to walk the right path, that is, to accept the Gospel with repentance and to despise the papacy for Christ alone, are very few. What do you think will happen if you place such minds at the helm? They will undoubtedly take the right to command that you teach the Gospel according to their taste. If they find those who comply, the sound doctrine of the Lord is done for, and so is salvation. And I certainly fear that they will find those who comply; for I could name some among the old governors of the churches who even today subtly influence the magistrates to seize ecclesiastical rights for themselves. Among the young, however, there are few who even come close to learning letters, let alone Christ, by which they could resist reckless men and lay down their lives for piety. Meanwhile, they are indeed being raised more petulantly than to be able to imbibe anything other than what is happening.</p>
      <p>The food and drink given do not easily admit Christ or discipline, and yet they are almost accustomed from a young age, so that when they become adults, they can do nothing but what they have learned. I have sketched the situation as best as I could.</p>
      <p>I am very afraid, therefore, that something will happen to teach us how ungrateful our ingratitude is to the Lord. He gave us the word of the Gospel so mercifully and opened its secrets to us, that our tongues should never cease from giving thanks, and our lives should never be empty of good works. But we scarcely acknowledge the gift given to us, and we live our lives so disgracefully that even the most disgraceful fornicating priests reproach us.</p>
      <p>Hence, I seem to have sufficient grave reasons to fear, although in these matters (thanks be to God) I am not entirely without hope. I know that God knows His own; yet, whenever I think this way, I cannot help but shudder, and indeed very much so.</p>
      <p>To speak with you in this manner, the death of Mr. Grynaeus, then the mayor and Capito, and finally Wilhelm Zwingli, Eusebius Oecolampadius, and certainly many other young people (eighteen are counted by the people of Strasbourg, from whom much was expected) moved me. For I can scarcely think otherwise than I have written. Strasbourg has lost a very great and precious treasure. Capito continually cared for the church, even when others were absent. In establishing ecclesiastical discipline, without which the word is almost preached in vain, no one was more diligent than he. He was great in many ways, to put it briefly.</p>
      <p>Bucer still remains healthy, wonderfully experienced in ecclesiastical matters. Let us pray to the Lord that he at least remains safe. He lost his wife and two daughters in these days; therefore, he needs the Lord's protection, lest he himself becomes infected. And the wife of Beat Gering - the third, I believe - was buried with Capito. Let us pray to the Lord to defend us from evil, not from the plague, unless it benefits the church. Basel, November 12, 1541, after supper, unusually.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with yours.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Please commend Joswald, the son of Barbara, who delivers this, my godson, in my name.</p>
      <p>To the most venerable brothers in the Lord, Heinrich Bullinger and Theodor Bibliander.</p>
