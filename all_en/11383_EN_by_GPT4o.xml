    <p xml:id="regest1">Refers to a recently sent letter [No. 1336], in which he reported on his situation; perhaps it remained for some time with Eberhard [von Rümlang]. The bearer of this letter, a Zürcher, has started a family in Lausanne - without his father's consent - and has changed his once liberal lifestyle; now he wishes to return, but fears his father's wrath; Gwalther and Konrad Geßner ask Bullinger to intercede for him. Since the transcript of a lecture by Theodor [Bibliander] on the dialectic of Philipp [Melanchthon] requested by Bullinger is still with Heinrich Billing in Basel, Gwalther must first write to him. Requests that his scholarship be paid out in crowns. Greetings and New Year's wishes.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, most kind father, I entrusted letters to merchants to be delivered to Bern, addressed to Eberhard, the questor's scribe. I am still uncertain whether you have received them or not; however, as far as I can conjecture, you have either already received them or will receive them now with this messenger. For I instructed him to receive them from Eberhard in Bern. In these, I wrote more extensively about the state of my affairs, so that it is now unnecessary to repeat the same story.</p>
      <p>However, this messenger, who is from Zurich but has been away from Zurich for a long time, now returns to his homeland, having been called back by his brother. He spent some time in Lausanne, where he married a poor but honest woman, with integrity and good reputation, from whom he has a daughter, whom our Conrad Gessner lifted from the sacred font.</p>
      <p>He lived in this city in such a way that he earned a testimony of an upright life from all good people. The same is testified by our Conrad, who affirms that he finds no lack of good manners in him. Perhaps he was, as you know, of a more licentious life while he was at home; but now, having been exercised and tamed by various labors and hardships, I have no doubt that he has come to his senses, as he has not shown any sign of a dissolute life for such a long time. Perhaps his parent will be indignant about the marriage, which he himself especially wishes to be forgiven, promising to be a frugal son and, as far as can be gathered, he will prove it.</p>
      <p>For he has realized what his past life has brought him, and now he feels that the salutary admonitions, which he once did not consider of great importance, were indeed valuable. He himself has complained to me about this with true regret. Furthermore, since he is unskilled in the French language, it is very inconvenient for him to be among the French. For they, abusing his ignorance, drag the poor man here and there, denying him the reward of his labor, forcing him to undergo judicial disputes, often repeating the same actions, so that he can rarely enjoy the fruits of his due reward; which, being true, could be proven by the testimonies of many. Thus, tossed here and there by the storms of fortune, he longs only for his homeland, intending to commit himself to its command, order, and will.</p>
      <p>He asked me to intercede with you on his behalf, if perhaps your authority could be so great with his parent, that he might receive his son, once detested, now bearing the hope of better conduct, into his home, grace, and protection. Therefore, most esteemed father, I earnestly ask you, and our most observant Conrad also asks, not to abandon this poor man with your counsel and help. We will not hesitate to promise a better life, upright manners, and a strong tolerance of labor and hardships from the life he has led here.</p>
      <p>You requested in other letters that I send you the annotations on Philipp's dialectic collected by Theodor; however, I left these in Basel with Heinrich Billing. I will write to him to send them to you.</p>
      <p>Give my scholarship to him to bring to me, if it seems appropriate; for he will soon return to me. However, it is necessary that they be sent in crowns; for we have no use for any other currency here.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and mother most kindly in my name, along with your children, to whom I wish a happy course of this year in our name. I also wish well to Theodor, Pellican, my most esteemed teachers, and also to Wernher Lithonius, my venerable friend. Conrad Gessner and his wife greet you in return with all their family. Farewell, dearest father, and may you complete this new year, begun with happy auspices, in the most fortunate manner.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, December 20, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
