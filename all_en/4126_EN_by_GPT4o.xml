      <p>My willing service, friendly greetings, along with all the honor and good I can offer, dear friend Herr Bullinger, if you knew my and my family's well-being; I hope to God to hear the same from you and yours. However, it has been quite a long time since I last wrote to you, which I have neglected because I have been expecting letters from your son Christoph, which I have not yet received, nor have those come through whom I thought he would write to me.</p>
      <p>But if I receive anything, I will promptly send it to you. There is recent news that it is said King Philip has died; however, it is true that in some reliable places in the Duchy of Milan, additional measures have been taken, especially in Lecco and other borders towards the Venetian territories. But what this means, I cannot easily assess, etc.</p>
      <p>The Pope has not yet been reformed, but many articles are said to have been accepted by the consistory for the reformation of the church, but all according to old customs, so that no improvement is to be expected. For what good can be hoped from the Antichrist and his followers? Here with us, there is great scarcity; may God the Lord show better. I intended to come to Chur for this fair, from where I would have written to you some recent news, if anything had happened there. But I am so entirely occupied in this my office, that I do not dare to leave even a little, and indeed this very importunity of the business that presses me is an obstacle to writing to you more often. I will, however, be more diligent in the future, especially if anything new arises that is worth your knowing. The illustrious Lady Isabella is still with us, but she is not in very good health.</p>
      <p>Her sons came a few days ago to visit her and left no stone unturned to persuade her to return to Italy; but she remained steadfast in her decision.</p>
      <p>May the Lord God continually strengthen her.</p>
      <p>My son and all of mine send their very best wishes to you and all of yours.</p>
      <p>If you have any news and it is possible amidst your business turmoil, I ask you, by your usual kindness, not to disdain to inform me. I will also do so more diligently in the future.</p>
      <p>Greet the assembly of pious men and my distinguished friends there. Given in Chiavenna on the night of November 17, 1559.</p>
      <p>Postscript: I want to remind you, most esteemed lord, that Herr Lavater once wrote to me that a small amount of money is still owed to him by Dussio Stupa, the boy whom I had placed with him. I have indeed reminded the boy's mother to send it; if this has not yet been done, I would like you to write back to me and let me know how much money is owed to him (for I have forgotten how much he requested), and I will certainly ensure that he is satisfied and rightly so. Please greet him, especially Herr Lavater, in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, most esteemed lord, and keep me recommended to you. The same as above, your most devoted Federicus von Salis, commissioner of Chiavenna.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned Herr Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher in Zurich, my gracious dear lord. In Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and illustrious man, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord. In Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
