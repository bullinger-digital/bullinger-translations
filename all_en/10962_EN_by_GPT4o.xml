      <p>Greetings. The person who has received these letters to deliver is now a citizen of Strasbourg, a man who holds you in high regard. He says that at the beginning of Zwingli's preaching, if I remember correctly, or certainly during the first national war, he was exiled from Lucerne for the common cause. I beg you to assist him. You will understand the whole matter from Myconius.</p>
      <p>Indeed, my dear Bullinger, how greatly some among us praise your diligence and effort in restoring the concord of the churches! Bucer acknowledges the same. We still hold good hope. For we will strive to make the Wittenbergers and the princes understand how fully you recognize the truth and how the fear of accepting the articles should not be underestimated as it deters you. We will undertake everything sincerely and as if in the eyes of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily. I wish Leo, Bibliander, our Pellican, and all friends the very best.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, November 30, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your V. Capito.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, to be respected in the Lord.</p>
