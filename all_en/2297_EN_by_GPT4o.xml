      <p>Greetings, my dear Bullinger. I know that you have heard and understood from your magistrate what I recently wrote. This has delayed me from writing; for I could add nothing to those matters. However, I now add that the King of England, our friend and relative, with the greatest sorrow of all of France, has been ill unto death for fifteen days and lay as if dead for two days.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Emperor sent his agents to intercept the two daughters, heirs to the kingdom, after the death of their brother, by art or force, if it could not be done otherwise, so that he might give one in marriage to his son, namely the Prince of Spain, and thus obtain the kingdom. Behold, by the will of God, unexpectedly, and with the help of doctors, among whom the chief is a Frenchman, he expelled an infinite amount of poison through his mouth and now begins, indeed is well, nor are there lacking those who affirm that such things were perpetrated with the help and aid of the Emperor. May God grant him a better mind and you health; for I have nothing else, except that today I received letters from Vergerius from Schaffhausen, and he writes that he is hastening to the Duchy of Württemberg, which is pleasing to me. I greatly desire that at the next meeting in Baden your magistrate, according to the tenor of the peace treaties, does not receive the enemy, the Duke of Florence, or at least the legate, who is sent by the Emperor, the Pope, and other such men, to disturb our concord and friendship through their practices.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent and unique. Given in Solothurn, May 29.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassefontaine.</p>
      <p>It is unbelievable how that marquis rages against all without distinction, the enemy of all, and believe me, he has now become powerful; for he has nearly twenty thousand good soldiers and three thousand horsemen, and because the soldier under him roams with impunity, everyone enlists with him in the hope of plunder. His aim is not to linger long near Nuremberg, where he is now; but we feel and know that he is being called elsewhere by the Emperor, as I recently wrote to you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Bullinger, in Zürich.</p>
