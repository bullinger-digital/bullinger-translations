      <p>S. You will understand who this student is from the letters of Mr. Beza, which he wrote to me through him. He could not find a place here; therefore, he decided to also see Zurich. Thus, I am sending Beza's letters through the same person, from which you will also learn whatever news I could write about. We have nothing else. Recently, some rumors were brought up when your Knöulius was here, about three battles that took place: one near Angoulême, another in Champagne, in which Prince Lord Aumale had fallen, and a third in the Netherlands, in all of which our side was superior; but nothing certain has followed since that time, except what you see Mr. Beza has already written; but he himself still doubts many things. I will not write about them yet, as he was leaving, but shortly after, our consul from Mühlhausen told me that he had written about these to Mr. Consul of Cham. I hear nothing more about Toulouse.</p>
      <p>As I feared, I still see that the rumor was false. I am surprised that during our Martinmas fair, I received no letters at all from you or from my brother; perhaps I will still receive them today. If I learn anything more today or tomorrow, I will write subsequently through others.</p>
      <p>Now, farewell; he is in a hurry to leave. Our people greet you, as does Vinsler from Biel, who is with me while I write this.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 12, 1568.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>The other letters, which you wrote to Mr. Erastus and to Mr. Oporinus of blessed memory, were recently found here near the gate of our city. I infer from this, since Oporinus has meanwhile passed away, that they were written a long time ago. But to whom you gave them or how they came here, I cannot know. They were brought to me by those who found them; I wanted to return them to you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
