      <p>Greetings. I have not written to you, dear brother, for several weeks for no other reason than that I had nothing worth writing about, as I do not have now, and because I assumed that the letters written to Mr. Campello would also be shared with you; for I wrote to him in the meantime, while I had nothing specific to write to you. However, I have received all your letters in order, which you sent in the meantime, as well as the letters from our Lentulus and the court records or judgments you sent to our Haller regarding the cases of those who are considered condemned before being heard.</p>
      <p>For your efforts and letters, I thank you, ready to reciprocate if I can. Everything has been silent for some time now; friends send no letters neither from France nor from Germany, Poland, or the Netherlands. What I had last, I wrote to you.</p>
      <p>Now I will not hesitate to report rumors, but obscure ones, and with the condition that I do not present them as certain, but as I received them from fame and rumors, which you know are often false.</p>
      <p>However, I report to you as certain that the King of Poland, having sent a delegation to the Palatinate, has received safe conduct; for the king is to come and pass through to Poland. The rumor is spreading that the Guise family, hated by God and good men, and the unfortunate flock of priests do not want Andius to leave the kingdom, hence soon the king himself and the king's brother, whom they prefer to the king, will be at arms, and these will be set against each other, which I would not wish. I do not wish to recount what is added about Paris and Orléans, etc. There are others who report about Mr. a.</p>
      <p>Monbrun, the leader of the Huguenot army in Dauphiné, advancing bravely and capturing fortresses and cities, and in some places even somewhat afflicting the remnants of the Swiss.</p>
      <p>If this were true, these rumors would be confirmed; however, they are not confirmed, so I completely doubt that narrative, etc. However, know for certain that 15 wagons loaded with gunpowder hurried to the Rhine, so that this quantity of gunpowder could be transported by ships to the Albanians in Belgium, where they are completely lacking that powder. But not far from the Rhine, some black horsemen intercepted those wagons and blew up the powder into the air, etc.</p>
      <p>Greet both consuls, both Pontisellas, Charles, Campello, Victor, Bonet, my John from Salices, the commissioner, and other brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 6, 1573.</p>
      <p>How did it go with my lord's letter concerning your honorable wife?</p>
      <p>I think it was well advised; may she be safe.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my kind lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
