    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports on the unfavorable reception of Bullinger's advice in Bern; there is a strong attachment to the old alliances and a fear of the defection of Oberland and Aargau as soon as the Five Places would make political promises to them. The people of Bern are trying to prevent Zurich from having to submit to a federal arbitration court in the mandate dispute. Behind the machinations of the Five Places, there are suspicions of intrigues by the papal legate Ennio Filonardi with the aim of concluding a new alliance directed against the Reformers. Many are encouraged by the hope that Bullinger will publish commentaries on the entire New Testament.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We have received your advice, which you think can guard against the tyranny of the Five Places. Although everyone must admit that it is true and well-considered, there will be few who agree with it. Such is the attachment to those carnal alliances, and there is great fear in our region, as it cannot be suggested without its consent, that our people of the valleys, or even Aargau, would rather submit to the alliances of the Five Places and deny our city, than follow this advice. And this under the condition where the people of the mountains would promise from both sides, as they commonly say, to make a place from Thun along with the entire Oberland and Aargau. You know how the populace is swayed by various emotions, how inconstant it is, how easily it is deceived by flattery, and how quickly it can be deluded by vain hope. Nevertheless, what you have indicated will often be pondered in the mouths and hearts of the pious. Sepianus met with me and six others for dinner. There we discussed everything at length. Finally, it came to this.</p>
      <p>The proceedings of the Baden assembly have not yet been heard by the magistrate. For it is usually postponed, not without danger, until the day when it is already time to ride to another assembly. As soon as they are heard, they will write, if the pious can obtain this by vote, to you, so that you do not respond to this assembly, but defer the response with any excuse. Our envoy will be instructed to approach the Five Places with pleas, so that they do not insist, but abandon this plan. Since that unfortunate peace requires that they remain in their faith, unchallenged (unangefochten), the same should be our condition and right, that they let us remain in our faith unchallenged. For neither can nor will the people of Bern tolerate this. Thus, they will not be able to conclude anything: everyone must bring this home. In the meantime, either our people or your cities will convene the Christian cities at Brugg, and there, meeting soon, they will consult, so that while the people of the mountains absolutely want to demand justice from yours, afterwards those cities would summon other Swiss, the people of Glarus, Appenzell, Solothurn, and Fribourg, and complain loudly and clearly before them, and let it be known, before they want to do anything, before they take another course of action, and then immediately the counsel; otherwise (sonst, otherwise) it cannot be enforced by ours.</p>
      <p>At this moment, someone has informed me where the intrigue comes from. The people of the mountains have sent someone from Rapperswil to the King of France, to absolutely pay what he owes, and that in counted money. If the king does not do this, they want to immediately demand the dissolution of the alliance or announce it (k√ºndigen) and ally themselves with the Confederates, the people of Valais, the Duke of Milan, and the Pope to the ruin of our faith, and against the French and us, and so that this can happen, your people are now being influenced by this plan of the legate Ennio Filonardi. For the Pope hopes that as soon as Zurich has returned to his faith, it will be over for us. So the people of the mountains want to think, the king does not value them much anymore. Thus, they want to ring the bells together. Furthermore, do not doubt that we are threatened by the Spaniards, who, when they return from the Turkish expedition, will attack the confessors of our faith. May the Lord be our protector.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the one you commend to me, I commend him back to you. He will show the way which you should follow.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue to love me as you have begun, and do not cease to pray to the Lord for our church. Many give me hope that you will publish annotations on the entire New Testament. Continue and live.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>October 2nd.</p>
      <p>You know me.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zurich, his always dearest brother.</p>
