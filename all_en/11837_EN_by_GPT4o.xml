    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not report anything new so far; the unjust conditions of the treaty between [Duke Wilhelm of Jülich-]Gelderland and Emperor [Charles V.] may perhaps be alleviated by the planned marriage [of the Duke] with a daughter of [King] Ferdinand or the Dowager Queen of Denmark; Duke [Henry] of Brunswick shows himself extremely obliging towards the Emperor, as does the Lord of Musso [Gian Giacomo de' Medici]; the Emperor listens to them and expresses threats against Germany; Bullinger will be aware of the harsh mandate against Hildesheim that has been published; has no news from Frankfurt, where the war councils are still assembled; Strasbourg is accused by the Emperor of friendliness towards the French; in view of the forthcoming [Imperial] Diet at Speyer, God's assistance is to be sought. Refers to Myconius’ letter [No. 1792] and anticipates a list of new books from Frankfurt. Greetings. Cellarius [Martin Borrhaus] wants to clear himself in writing from the suspicion of heresy, but has expressed questionable views in earlier books; his pursuit of a theological professorship is viewed unfavorably by [Wolfgang Wissenburg], and his justification could unintentionally become self-incrimination. The Emperor directs part of his mighty army against France, another against Denmark.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not written anything new is that I have not been able to ascertain anything certain from that merchant. Gelderland has been received into the favor of the Emperor under the most unjust conditions, which perhaps will be mitigated by the future marriage with Ferdinand's daughter, as rumor has it, or with the Dowager Queen of the deceased King of Denmark. Duke of Brunswick, a fierce enemy of the Gospel and murderer of many pious people, is held in high esteem at the Emperor's court. He serves with the utmost diligence, stands by the Emperor when he mounts his horse, holds the stirrups; when he dismounts, he performs the same duty, so that there is no place for nobles to offer such service to the Emperor. Early in the morning, he waits vigilantly before the Emperor's chamber, awaiting his arrival. The Lord of Musso shows the same courtesy to the Emperor; nothing is done without their counsel, but not in all matters, only in those against the evangelicals and the cities. The Emperor is a man of few words, full of threats and anger towards Germany. He sent a rather harsh edict to the people of Hildesheim, which has been printed; I believe you have already seen it. He has taken the whole of Gelderland into his trust with hostages given. I do not know what has been done in Frankfurt, for the councils are still being held by the principal ones who are appointed for military affairs.</p>
      <p>Fear has indeed seized all the cities. The people of Strasbourg are accused by the Emperor of favoring the French; he accuses them of sending reinforcements and sharing plans; whether this is true, I do not know. There will soon be a Diet at Speyer; for this, let us pray to the Lord, that He does not abandon His own, and that He grants us a life worthy of the Christian people. Farewell in the Lord. Perhaps Myconius will write more, which is unknown to me. When the books come to us from the Frankfurt market, you will have the list.</p>
      <p>Greet D. Vadianus, a pious and excellent man, in my name, if you are going to write to him; likewise, extend many greetings to Theodor, a divine man. October 1, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Our Cellarius will publicly clear himself in writing, as he is falsely accused of heresy and does not want to be called a sectarian, even if he is full of opinions; he has given a sample with published books. He seeks a theological lecture, which our Wolfius, the first evangelical doctor in our academy, bears with difficulty. You will soon see his justification; I fear he may accuse himself more than excuse himself if he wants to speak or write the truth.</p>
      <p>The Emperor sends part of his army against France, part against Denmark; he has a huge army and foreign soldiers, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the true theologian D. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
