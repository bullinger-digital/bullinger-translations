      <p>Greetings. Recently, I did not write through my brother because he himself was a living letter. Meanwhile, I received yours, in which you express your opinion on what should be done with the German princes. When Farellus and Beza were returning here, I had gone to Bienne with my brother, so I did not hear them: but Musculus told me everything. Vergerius also returned from Geneva and discussed this matter with us and the senate at length. Your advice would be approved by all of us if there were hope that the princes would take care of these matters.</p>
      <p>There are many documents of the teachings of our churches everywhere: but how much they are valued, either by the princes or by their theologians, is quite apparent. Certainly, I do not promise any peace (although I am exceedingly eager and devoted to it) with those people. For I have experienced in Augsburg and elsewhere what kind of feelings they have towards us. Therefore, these two of ours seem too easy to me, who, from the fact that they were once received kindly, conclude that universal concord can be obtained. And I fear that something may happen so that by this method of concord, we are again led away from the simplicity of truth, as was also done before. For I know that many of ours aspire greatly to this concord: but I fear that under this name, they may obtain formulas which they themselves wish to speak. For there will never be concord unless the most dangerous formulas are granted, with which, since we will use them in one sense and another, we will have the old contention. Your church will be safer in this part, which by the grace of the Lord has not felt any of this dissension before. But these thoughts arise in me while I consider our churches. And there are also not foolish men here from the senatorial number, who suspect and fear this, especially if the French were the authors of this concord, who were also too much entangled in the previous one. Moreover, the Basel Confession itself, about which I think you are writing, has certain words imposed by Bucer and Capito, which later had to be clarified, lest anyone abuse them or turn them into another sense than was granted by ours. Nor do I doubt that the Basel people still defend their opinion under these words. You also know that Bucer and the people of Strasbourg wanted your students to communicate with them under that confession, and what was answered by us to those things. In summary: I always fear that we are being led behind the light. Moreover, we have in that Swiss academy someone who conspires with the Lutherans, colludes, sends ministers to them, orders their confessions to be received and approved, preaches among them, is entirely theirs, and yet meanwhile also wants to appear to be ours: from whom I greatly fear in this matter. Therefore, I could not, in my judgment, involve myself more deeply in this method of concord. If a confession along with a declaration seemed to be sent, I would not refuse. But who will do this? This should first be decided jointly. As for the judgment of other churches, I do not know. Therefore, if anything seems to be done here, let us know and we will respond in time. Without the knowledge of our senate, I would not want nor dare to presume anything here. If only this one thing could be obtained, that those harsh and hateful writings and those most bitter declarations would cease, with which removed, I would not despair of some concord. I would indeed wish that Philip's plan would proceed and that he would finally give glory to God and publicly profess his faith, and not keep the minds of many in suspense until the end. I hear he is coming to Heidelberg. These are my thoughts on that concord which greatly oppresses me, while I desire to obtain it and yet cannot help but fear it as a seedbed of greater discord.</p>
      <p>As for the English, Lever has not yet returned to me, but he wrote hoping that they could be received in Aarau. We dissuaded them from Küngsfelden; it might easily step on the foot of an official or become unworthy; their matter would be all out here. There is no reason for this matter, but the people of Basel write that they have forbidden their citizens to receive any Englishman henceforth.</p>
      <p>It is strange what this hardness means; I wish it does not also involve a matter of religion.</p>
      <p>The people of Geneva had their envoys here again, but without any power to act as always; therefore, nothing was done.</p>
      <p>My lords wrote to all places a few weeks ago about the agitators, to warn them; for if they are caught, they will be judged according to the law, upon which the king's name was demanded, which was refused with good reason.</p>
      <p>Consider what he seeks and meditates. In France, young lord Glade Meij has been greeted from here.</p>
      <p>Vergerius was in Geneva for three days before he could be admitted to a meeting with Calvin, which brings great envy to Calvin's name among all. A certain marchioness from France came here these days, who has a lawsuit with another prince about the county of Neuchâtel, which will be decided here, and unless it is handled properly, there is a danger that the county will fall into foreign hands and all the churches of that dominion will be overthrown, in which the people of Solothurn are diligently working.</p>
      <p>As for how things stand with Biel, you undoubtedly have it from Blaurer. The bishop has sent them a mayor; they do not want to allow him into the council nor swear him in, then the bishop holds them to what he has promised. Therefore, we fear some tragedy from this side as well.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new from Italy, except that they say the soldiers of Piedmont are suffering from hunger, and the Neapolitans from some plague. Around Strasbourg, soldiers are giving their names partly to the French king, partly to the English king; some think the matter will be conducted in the Netherlands, others that Frankfurt will be besieged; but these are uncertain. They say Schertlin is heading to Rome.</p>
      <p>Wooden furnaces are now being erected here under the direction of Funck. Otherwise, I know nothing to write, except that I commend my mother, who is returning to you, and also my son, whom I am sending with her. Haller the treasurer greets you, who sends you cheese through my mother, Mr. Diesbach, Hagius, Musculus, and others. Bern, June 9.</p>
      <p>May Mr. Martyr, Gualther, Bibliander, Lavater, and others of your family be well.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed and dear lord and compatriot.</p>
