      <p>Greetings. Recently, I wrote to you about matters I deemed worthy of your attention.</p>
      <p>I forgot to mention that the Duke of Savoy was compelled to make peace with the subjects of the Val d'Angrogne; they are allowed to practice their religion freely. The French princes spent eight or ten days in the Paris Parliament with those who are advisors to the king, to deliberate on the matter of religion, and there were free discussions. I do not yet know what has been decided.</p>
      <p>In the houses of the King of Navarre and Prince of Condé in Paris, public sermons are held. From the most prudent consul, you could understand how indignantly I have been harassed by those who demand interest.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Savoy requests that the Diet in Basel be continued on the 14th of the next month; the controversy is of utmost importance. I am sending you a letter from Bishop Ivo.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, July 8.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>If it is burdensome for the council to send someone to request generosity in the name of peace, I will ensure that it is delivered to them with gold or silver coins when it pleases.</p>
      <p>This can be announced to Consul Rhaan.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church. In Zürich.</p>
