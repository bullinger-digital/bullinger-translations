      <p>Greetings. The reason we have not written to you for a while, most kind sir, is that we have had nothing unheard of or that could be believed for certain to report to you. For the news from Germany and France reaches you there first and more reliably; from Italy, however, nothing has been reported so far that seems credible. Now, however, those who come from Italy, and specifically from Naples, affirm that the Prince of Salerno, surrounded and strengthened by the Turks, is a burden to the Calabrians and Neapolitans, even if he has not yet done anything particularly notable there on the mainland.</p>
      <p>Indeed, those who come directly from Naples consistently affirm that a certain town (the name of which our citizens do not retain) that the Turk had begun to besiege was forced to be abandoned by the townspeople who defended themselves vigorously. He was then seen heading towards the Neapolitan region, but the Neapolitan citizens are not very alarmed. For it is said that the city itself is very well supplied with everything necessary to repel force and has twenty-four cannons, which were once cast for Emperor Charles by his enemy John, Duke of Saxony, and others standing by him at that time. The Viceroy has died there. A certain Spaniard has been appointed by the Emperor to govern the kingdom, much to the nausea of the citizens. For the Neapolitans pursue the Spaniards with such great hatred that there is a constant rumor that the Neapolitans would not at all unwillingly surrender themselves to the Prince of Salerno, unless he brought the Turks with him. The hope sustains the Neapolitans that the Turk cannot remain at sea for long, as autumn is now approaching and the time is not suitable for ships. The Imperial soldiers, who were at Siena, are now heading to Naples; but that army, infected with a certain plague, is perishing along the way, with soldiers dying in droves. Lord Matrucius, the Bishop of Trento and Cardinal, in that army, out of ten companies he commands, scarcely has three still healthy; the rest have been wiped out by that plague. It had been said here in the Piedmont region that our forces, who serve the king, had succumbed in battle with the Imperial forces; but those who come from Italy affirm that nothing is heard in Italy about any battle. This is what we have up to this day, which we hold to be true; when we hear more certain or probable things, we will write.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the evangelical cause in our Confederation is becoming colder everywhere, partly due to our negligence and carelessness, we who are the teachers of the people and the salt of the earth, and partly due to the noble ingratitude of mortals, who almost starve the ministers of the gospel. Certainly, I can hardly bear it here for long, wherever the Lord may call me. Perhaps these are now the times in which love grows cold, iniquity abounds, and men are lovers of themselves and greedy. May the Lord preserve you. Father Comander and the friends you know greet you, awaiting what you will write back to us. Given at Chur, on the 7th day of August, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your integrity, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good men, his lord preaching the divine word in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
