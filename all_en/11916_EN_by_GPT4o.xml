    <p xml:id="regest1">Was surprised that Cochläus did not send him the writing addressed to him [„De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae autoritate“], but upon reading it, he found that Cochläus attacks him in it and expects a response; the counter-writing [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“], which he delivers to him with this letter, is composed contrary to Cochläus’ fear, as befits a servant of Christ; commends him to the grace of Christ.</p>

      <p>G[reetings] I [say]. I received not from you, Cochläus, but from friends, the booklet which you nevertheless wrote to me. I was indeed surprised by your decision, that you deemed it worthy to write to me, but refrained from sending the same. However, when I began to read the booklet, I soon discovered that after the friendly address, everything else was hostile, and that you desired nothing as much as a response from me, at least some kind of response. Therefore, I have obliged and in my spare hours, I have responded to your writings, which you see, and which I am sending, so that the response does not wander through everyone's hands before it reaches you, to whom it most pertains. The glory of the Savior Jesus, the purity of religion, and the salvation of souls is what I seek, as He who knows everything knows. I did not respond to your writings and receive you as you feared, but as I thought it proper, as one who serves Christ and wishes to bring all to Him. May the saving grace of Christ grant that, with the sincere knowledge of the Son of God, you may live eternally in Him.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, Switzerland, March 14, in the year of our Lord and Savior 1544. H. Bullinger, Minister of the Church of Zürich.</p>
