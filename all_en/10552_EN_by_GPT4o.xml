      <p>Greetings. There is no reason, most learned Bullinger, for you to thank me so much for the very small gift I sent, as if you had not already bestowed far greater benefits upon me. I have reciprocated as best as I could, otherwise I would be considered most ungrateful if I ignored your merits towards me as if with a deaf ear. I would consider it a good thing if I could do the same for you, but that is beyond my ability to provide.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have a certain work that needs to be completed, but since I cannot accomplish it without your help, I have decided to implore you as my greatest friend. It is a concise introduction to Greek grammar. It is now in progress; I will have it completed shortly. I believe it can be of considerable benefit to myself and others who wish to learn Greek. Melanchthon's grammar is too lengthy to be read so often and for students to grasp. You alone seem to be the one capable of accomplishing this task. I know that your recommendations hold much influence and weight with book publishers. Therefore, I ask that this epitome be printed with you, whenever it is convenient. At the end of February, I will send the brief Greek grammar by messenger, if I have first received your response and advice. Therefore, if you have any time to write, please do write to me a little. For now, so as not to trouble your mind any longer, I will add nothing further, except that I have also written a little about this to Bibliander, whom I do not think will fail me.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellikan and all who love me, especially your most praiseworthy family.</p>
      <p>24th of January, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Ludwig Lopadius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
