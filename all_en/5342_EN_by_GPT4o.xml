      <p>Greetings. Today our synod, reverend father in Christ, has been held as usual, which has now lasted for a full three days. The case of Leo had flared up again and detained us for several hours; after a long debate, we finally extracted from him what I am sending. All of which our dearest brother, Mr. Huldrych Campell, can explain to you in more detail, if you ask, with his usual candor, from whom you will also hear who has handled Mr. Leo's case.</p>
      <p>More next time.</p>
      <p>What could be known about the council, you have learned from Mr. Julius.</p>
      <p>Mr. Traversius writes and Mr. Friedrich promises that they will have certain information in the future; for he has a relative who is at the court of the Duke of Mantua. The coronation of Maximilian (the Bohemian coronation) has been abolished again; it is certain. The Count of Sulz and others have already prepared for it, and as they intended to betray it these days, the matter was announced by post; I do not know the reason. Sforza is said to have been captured by the Venetians, others think he has been removed; it is said he treated some great Venetian with indignity. But more on all this next time in more detail; for now, this.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I am so exhausted from preaching (but not yet finished) that I can no longer continue. Forgive me and inform us about the French affairs; for we are all anxiously waiting.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Chur, May 29, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>I wrote this letter the day before yesterday.</p>
      <p>Now they are leaving so suddenly that I cannot write more; but I will write tomorrow and I think some of ours will depart. A certain man from Trento passed through here by post, who seems to be a spy and cannot deny that the Marquis of Peschiera has returned home; others, however, affirm for certain (but I affirm nothing) that the Marquis, who was sent there in the name of King Philip, protested with the bishops that they should not proceed until the Pope submits to the council. I cannot write more now.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man with singular learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and patron, etc.</p>
