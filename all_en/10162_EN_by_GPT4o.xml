      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>You have here a living letter, most learned Heinrich, our Ludwig Oechsli, who will explain everything to you, with whom you can speak freely and safely about what you consider to be in our interest, or rather not ours, but Christ's. For he will be a reliable messenger.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Schaffhausen, 10th of September, 1532.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, proclaiming the Gospel of Christ in Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
