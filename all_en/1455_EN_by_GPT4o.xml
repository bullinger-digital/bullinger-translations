      <p>S. D. Today, at last, I received your letters, most esteemed and dearest lord and brother, through the guest of the Stork, and they were indeed most welcome, as they came from you, whom I truly revere and love from the heart, hence everything that comes from you cannot but be most welcome. However, the sad news about the French churches and brothers has deeply affected me. If I hoped for any relief or assistance from our people, I would neither spare my efforts nor allow myself to be stirred; believe me, I would run willingly. But you are not unaware of the contemptuous response the king gave not so long ago before he departed from here; which offended all our people so much that it could not be more grievous. And since the son has almost the same advisors and surpasses the father in ferocity, they will not expect a more considered response from the son. Moreover, only the people of Zürich and Bern are not in the alliance, hence I hear that what comes from them is less welcome.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, when in September it was said that the persecution, never completely interrupted, was being renewed, I prepared this brief booklet for the king, if by this means I might perhaps render him more placable to Christians; Mr. Vergerius will make it into French. When it has been printed, I will ensure by all means that it is placed in the king's hands. Meanwhile, it would seem most advisable if you write to the Duke of Somerset and especially to the King of England. I too, as soon as I can, will write to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Mr. Grey, and other leading figures, that they may take up the cause of the wretched. I fear lest the king should expose himself to the sword of the cruel Emperor and lay himself open to be trampled upon. For the blood of Christians does not contribute to achieving victories, and although the Emperor too is drenched in Christian blood, God nevertheless uses his power to cast down pride until he too is crushed. Let us pray for the afflicted.</p>
      <p>The antithesis of the Gospel and Papism is now being printed with us, through 52 propositions signed by me in Latin and German. I wish to present the conflicting doctrines of both religions to the eyes of all the faithful, so that they may hate Papism more gravely and love the Gospel more ardently. The council proceeds: there is no doubt that good men will soon be imperiously summoned by them, and magistrates everywhere urged to send public enemies of religion, I mean evangelical preachers, to that solemn disputation.</p>
      <p>The Emperor, having left Augsburg on October 19, has set out for Innsbruck to be closer to the council, as well as to Italy and Austria. May the Lord break the arm of the wicked and strengthen the saints who call upon His name. There are many things that burn me, but since I cannot remedy them at present, I am forced to bear them patiently.</p>
      <p>I too fear lest some unforeseen evil should fall upon us, as charity appears colder in all things.</p>
      <p>I would have many things to complain about to you: but since I understand that you are otherwise overwhelmed with not inconsiderable sorrows, let us pray to our Lord God that He Himself may correct what cannot be corrected by our counsels, and that He may have mercy on us and His church. Farewell eternally, together with all good people, especially with your fellow ministers, with Mr. Galasius, Mr. von Burgund, and others.</p>
      <p>I have nothing unfortunate from England. He who was said by all to be dead, the man of notable piety and learning, Mr. Peter Martyr, is alive. For two months ago he sent me letters. Our people, Mr. a Lasco, Mr. Hooper, and many other holy men, also labored heavily, but the Lord restored them to His church. The Duke of Suffolk has died with his brother. But perhaps you know these things better. Farewell again eternally. Zürich, November 3, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
