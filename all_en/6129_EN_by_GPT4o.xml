      <p>Greetings. I write more (reverend father in Christ) to maintain my custom than because I have matters to inform you about. The envoy of Philipp has not yet returned; I wish he would not return, lest he be the author of disturbances! You have understood what the envoy of the French seeks from those I sent. I have not yet spoken with the envoy myself, although in the meantime he has invited me to a banquet for the second time.</p>
      <p>For two days I have not been quite well; but by the grace of God, I am now recovering. As far as I can conjecture, this alliance with the French will be renewed.</p>
      <p>On occasion, you will jot down on a sheet, since it must be renewed entirely, by which means it can be done most conveniently. For after much deliberation, I have finally decided: I will not be the author to make that alliance, but I will advise, after I have understood that they are inclined towards it, that they establish it with those terms which can be beneficial to both the country and the church.</p>
      <p>If you think otherwise, inform me about it. - Since I could not come to the envoy, he wrote quite courteous letters, from which I also perceived that he is not uneducated; otherwise, I will judge from the meeting. Recently, certainly, great men have affirmed that he is of the Guise faction, to whom, although I give some credence, I do not wish to judge rashly until I have known the matter more precisely. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, as happily and as long as possible. Chur, May 8, 1564.</p>
      <p>The plague is raging most fiercely in Chiavenna and is becoming more and more severe; here with us, all is well, and I wish the same for you. Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
