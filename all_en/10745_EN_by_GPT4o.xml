    <p xml:id="regest1">Dedicates this commentary to them precisely because, like the Thessalonians praised by the Apostle, they have held firm to the Gospel despite tribulation and contributed to its acceptance in Bern. This is not their merit, but God's work in them, which should be crowned by their persistent commitment to the spread of the Kingdom of Christ. Looking to the example of their father Jakob von Wattenwyl and under the guidance of the church leaders, they may complete the work that has been started.</p>

      <p>To the most distinguished men, renowned for their images and piety, Mr. Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl, Bernese consul, Mr. Nikolaus and Reinhard, brothers, Heinrich Bullinger sends grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>For certain reasons, I have dedicated my commentaries on the remaining epistles of Paul to other certainly very religious men, but I have decided to dedicate the commentaries on both epistles to the Thessalonians to you, most distinguished men who have deserved well of me. Divine munificence has indeed made you very great, and you were worthy of a great subject, but I am very humble, and what I offer is meager. Nevertheless, with these, since it was not permitted to give more august things, I wished to attest to my readiness of spirit towards you. And although our things are barren, the subject of the present matter, splendidly handled by the apostle, wonderfully suited you. For the Thessalonians are praised by the apostle for having stood firm in the evangelical truth once received, and that amidst great disturbances and tumults, not without loss of wealth and risk to life. And they not only stood firm, but by their constancy, they were the cause that all of Macedonia received the gospel. "For from you," says the apostle, "the word of the Lord has sounded forth not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith has gone forth" [1 Thessalonians 1:8]. And how many disturbances Germany, and especially our Switzerland, has felt from the preached gospel for almost 16 years, with the greatest danger and loss of all things, no one is unaware. But you, in these tumults, not without the risk of your head and all your possessions, followed the cause of Christ with some other religious and brave men, and by your constancy and religion, you also encouraged others, so that all of Bern finally swore allegiance to Christ. This noble deed should not inflate your minds, which you have in common with others. Recognize the gift of God in you, and I proclaim the gift of God in you. And the apostle Paul: "What do you have," he says, "that you did not receive? And if you received it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?" [1 Corinthians 4:7]. And to the Thessalonians: "God," he says, "works in you who believe." Moreover, the gifts we receive from God, we receive in order to continually surpass ourselves in piety and to benefit as many as possible. Therefore, you will most gloriously complete the work of the Lord begun, if you add an excellent conclusion, that is, if you persevere to the end in the truth received and strive to propagate the kingdom of Christ the Lord as widely as possible. To this, the apostle urges with the greatest ardor in these two epistles to the Thessalonians, so that for this reason also they should be dedicated to you. For it is the part of a grateful man and a true friend to promote and help the just praise and glory of those from whom he has felt benefits and to whom he wishes well from the heart.</p>
      <p>Besides these, there are also other arguments that invite you not commonly to perseverance in the truth, to the zeal of propagating the kingdom of Christ, and to deserving well of all the pious, especially the example of the venerable old man and Bernese consul Mr. Jakob von Wattenwyl of blessed memory, your father, indeed the father of the fatherland. For he administered the republic with the greatest faith and prudence and favored the reborn truth excellently and promoted it as much as the times permitted. From this, you can indeed conjecture, most pious men, what and how much you owe to Christ and his truth, to whom the happiness of the time and the consensus of the people, finally the truth itself revealed and the fidelity of the learned favor. For you have faithful, eloquent, learned, and constant leaders of religion, who can rightly advise and lead from the oracular scripture to true virtue and happiness. And indeed, your church loves the truth from the heart and desires it to be promoted with all prayers. What then remains, except that with perseverance and tireless zeal for doing good, you put the final touches on the well-begun work? I have said nothing feigned so far, nothing through flattery. For all the pious know what I have proclaimed about you among your fellow citizens. You only continue and go where the apostle has led, live and farewell together with your holy family.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in the month of January, in the year 1536.</p>
