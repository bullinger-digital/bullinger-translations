      <p>My friendly greetings, and whatever I can offer in honor, love, and goodness, be yours beforehand, honorable lord and friend. Since the faithful Lord Jacob, pastor at Sax, is attending the synod, I cannot refrain from informing you about the well-being of both pastors. Therefore, I would like to write you some news; however, there are so many rumors going around that I cannot write anything definite. You will undoubtedly have such information better than I do here, although some mercenaries are passing around Feldkirch, claiming their muster place is in Trento. The Count of Embs is very quiet. I ask you, if you have any certainty, to share it with me. As for how things stand here otherwise, the aforementioned pastor will inform you well. My dear wife and our beloved children also send you friendly greetings, etc. I hereby commend you to the protection of God.</p>
      <p>Dated at Forstegg, the 29th of April, in the year 1573. Your Grace's faithful, Ulrich Philipp, Baron of Hohensax, Lord of Sax and Forstegg.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned Lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the Church of Zurich, my dear friend, to be delivered.</p>
