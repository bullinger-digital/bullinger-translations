      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, shortly after 3 in the evening, the most illustrious man and half of my soul, Mr. Peter Martyr, departed from this world.</p>
      <p>He lay ill for barely 8 full days; on the same day that the illness, which now almost everyone suffers from, seized him, he returned his soul to God on the 7th day thereafter. He died sitting in a chair, and I stood by him as he was dying.</p>
      <p>His faith in God was most firm.</p>
      <p>From the time he returned from France, he always suffered from nausea at food; ulcers also appeared on his shins. He would have preferred to respond to Brentius; but since God willed otherwise, he willingly surrendered himself to God.</p>
      <p>How much grief and sorrow I have conceived from the death of this most friendly man, in whom the school and church have suffered an irreparable loss, I can hardly say, and unless I knew that Christ lives and holds the wounds and sores of the church and the seven stars in his hand, I would wish myself dead. But let what is seen by my Savior be done.</p>
      <p>Pray for us, for our school and church, that the Lord may provide for us in such a scarcity of learned and experienced men and true theologians. Calvin is also ill, who wrote to me from his bed, etc.</p>
      <p>As I was returning home and had just closed the eyes of my friend and sewn his dear body in a linen cloth with tears, behold, your letters are offered to me, wounding my soul with a new wound. But what shall I say, my Fabricius? I see that your complaint is not unjust, nor can I entirely prevent you from leaving. I will only say that your piety should consider whether your departure can heal all those wounds or not make them worse. I sincerely pray to the Lord that he himself may heal your wounds and ours, which are not dissimilar to yours.</p>
      <p>The already very grave pain is increased by a persistent rumor, which today has spread here from I know not where, that Rouen was twice attacked in vain with great loss to the Guise's forces, 5 English banners entered, which, when another 5 wanted to follow, were cut down; the Guises, encouraged by the slaughter, attacked the city again for the third time and suffered a huge defeat, but finally, with wicked perseverance, they captured it and slaughtered everyone in the city without distinction. Whether this is true or false, I cannot say; I certainly fear greatly.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord to have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Now SÃ¼lerus returns what he received from you to be returned.</p>
      <p>I give you immortal thanks and pray that you continue thus. I will inspect if I have anything earlier, I will send it back to you and will also think about how to repay you. I give thanks to Mr. Belinchetto, your brother, whom you will greet, and note that on January 3rd, a common Swiss day will be held in Baden, mainly because of the Glarus people. Aman Tschudi travels from Glarus to Rapperswil, Saela.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and pray to the Lord for us, from whom comes all good, all wisdom, all strength. November 13, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
