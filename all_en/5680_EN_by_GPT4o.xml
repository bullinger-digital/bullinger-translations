      <p>Greetings. Therefore, we have now been wickedly betrayed by another brother as well.</p>
      <p>He had promised by oath, which he wanted to be printed, that he would do nothing without the consent of his associates.</p>
      <p>While secretly negotiating with the queen mother, he wrote to the prefect of Lyon that he was keeping the matter in suspense until the admiral's return; meanwhile, he advises his mother-in-law to dismiss all troops and affirms that the matter is settled.</p>
      <p>This woman, not astute enough, confessed this to me in her letters while trying to appease me with her flattery.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you will understand from Beza's letters how he overturned such successful proceedings in a single moment, although he did not dare to write everything, such as the fact that he disarmed us before the wicked pact became known to the public.</p>
      <p>The lust for power has completely blinded the man.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he imagines he is achieving something great while ensuring that six from his retinue are co-opted among the knights of the royal order and exults in these childish trifles.</p>
      <p>But as God usually works wonderfully, he will exalt his power under this weakness.</p>
      <p>These are the terms of peace: 1. All nobles who are barons and have capital jurisdiction, or who possess noble fiefs, will remain at home with a free conscience and the exercise of the religion they call reformed with their families, and also with subjects who willingly and not coerced wish to attend.</p>
      <p>Nobles who have no jurisdiction will enjoy the same freedom for themselves and their families only, provided they do not reside in cities, towns, and villages under the dominion of others: in which case they will not be able to exercise their religion unless with the permission of their lords.</p>
      <p>The king, however, grants the same freedom to everyone in his immediate dominion. 2. In each prefecture from which there is an appeal to the parliamentary courts, one city will be designated in whose suburbs religion will be exercised by all of the same prefecture who wish to attend, and not otherwise.</p>
      <p>However, everyone will be able to remain privately at home freely, and no one will be harassed or investigated, nor compelled against their conscience. 3. In all cities where religion had its exercises up to the seventh day of this month, besides other cities already designated, the same religion will be exercised within the walls, in one or two places, provided that those who profess that religion cannot apply temples for their use.</p>
      <p>For all things will be restored to the clergy so that they may perform divine worship as before the disturbances arose: if anything has been demolished, the clergy themselves will not initiate a lawsuit. 4. The city of Paris with its provostship will be exempt from the exercise of the same religion.</p>
      <p>Those who remain there will peacefully enjoy their goods, nor can they be disturbed, or violently compelled, or fatigued by any inquiry, neither for past time nor for the future, on account of conscience. 5. All cities will return to their former state, commerce will be free, all foreign soldiers will be dismissed as quickly as possible, and all subjects will strive with all their might for this purpose. 6. Everyone will be restored to their rights, properties, status, honors, and offices, of whatever quality they may be, and will be preserved and protected in them, notwithstanding decrees, lawsuits, judgments, and arrests that followed the death of King Henry, both on account of religion and on account of arms taken up on the occasion of religion.</p>
      <p>Such judgments will be null and void, of no effect or value, so that heirs are not hindered in their peaceful possession by their pretext. 7. And so that Lord Prince of Cond√©, the general lieutenant and governor of Picardy, may be free from all care, and may not sustain any reproach or envy in the future, he will be declared and considered a good kinsman, relative, and faithful subject of the king, as he deserves by the blood from which he is descended, and therefore all lords, knights, nobles, citizens, communities, both of cities and villages, and whoever followed his party in this war, wherever they fought among these disturbances, will be pronounced and considered faithful subjects of the king, because it is believed that whatever they have done so far, they have done with good intention and under the king's obedience, wherefore they are exonerated from all envy. 8. The said lord prince will remain free from all burdens of money, and whatever has been spent by his command from royal revenues, however large the sum, the king will accept.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he will remain free and beyond all litigation and annoyance, regarding taxes imposed on cities or towns, silver vessels taken from temples, ecclesiastical revenues and incomes, and whatever has been expended in the present war, so that neither he nor his, nor his commissioners, can be called to account either in the past or in the future.</p>
      <p>No lawsuit will be initiated for the excused coinage, for the melted war machines, for the powder made, for the fortifications of cities built, for the ruins and demolitions of buildings, so that no damage may be demanded either from the prince himself or from communities or from private individuals. 9. All captives, both by the right of war and on account of religion, will be released on both sides, without any price, although in this number the king does not want robbers, thieves, and murderers to be counted, for whom the benefit of this peace will not be common. 10. All injuries and harms perpetrated in the present war will remain extinguished, dead, and buried, and everyone, of whatever quality they may be, will be forbidden, under the penalty of death, to injure each other voluntarily, or provoke to quarrels, or litigate or dispute over the cause of religion. 11. Those who profess religion will abstain from all alliances they have both in the kingdom and outside the borders, and in the future, they will not levy taxes, nor enroll names, nor impose contributions of money, nor will they have any congregations or consistories or assemblies except for religion.</p>
      <p>Amboise, March 19, 1562.</p>
      <p>Thus signed by the hand of Charles himself.</p>
      <p>And below by the king in his council, Robertet.</p>
      <p>Sealed with a double tail.</p>
      <p>You see, dearest brother, to what we have been reduced by the fickleness of one man.</p>
      <p>For he could have easily achieved that the queen would descend to any conditions.</p>
      <p>But he voluntarily prostituted himself servilely to any services.</p>
      <p>Now we anxiously await what will happen.</p>
      <p>For the movements are very much to be feared, in calming which, as far as I can, I will not cease to labor.</p>
      <p>As soon as Beza returns, you will understand what is more hidden.</p>
      <p>Nemours is suffering gravely from a continuous fever, so that the doctors despair of his life.</p>
      <p>The secretary of the royal legate, who was at Innsbruck when the cardinal came there, says that during the solemn feasts a very ancient and wide chalice was produced, on which were engraved verses that confirm our doctrine of the sacred supper, and that the cardinal, as if astonished by that spectacle, hesitated for a long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and my honored brother. In haste, I had forgotten that two letters from you were delivered to me in the last two days, to which were attached books for which I thank you.</p>
      <p>I wish much health to all the fellow ministers, sons, and sons-in-law.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you all safe.</p>
      <p>Geneva, April 8, 1563. My colleagues and all friends, among whom especially Jonvill, greet you.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, brother and fellow minister, much to be respected by me.</p>
