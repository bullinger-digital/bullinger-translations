      <p>Greetings. A few days ago, I wrote to your council about the capture of the town of Valfiniera, which is undoubtedly of great importance to our affairs. Now our army, which is there, is setting out to besiege another town (called Chieraseum). I hope for a successful outcome of that siege as well; whatever happens, I will inform you. It was recently written to me that the princes of Saxony have protested against the Ratisbon (Regensburg) recess (as they call it) and do not wish to ratify what was done there by their envoys against their mandates, as they say. If you hear anything certain about this matter, I ask you to inform me as soon as possible. Our army, which is in Italy, has done nothing yet; however, I hope that we will soon have some news from there; if it is of any importance, you will know immediately. Farewell. May 3rd.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sanlaurentius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
