    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's two letters to him and to the Bernese council; good effect on the councilors. It has deeply impressed many Bernese that the people of Zurich have acknowledged that the Five Places possess the true faith. Elections: Jakob von Wattenwyl became Schultheiß, Wolfgang von Wingarten Venner. Whether Bern will participate in the upcoming Tagsatzung is uncertain. Response to Bullinger's critical remarks on the "Berner Synodus": Haller is skeptical of theological discussions; Capito's view that only repentance and forgiveness in Christ should be preached, he could only agree with at the Synod, especially in view of the predominance of the "political gospel" in Bern. Invitation to Bullinger for the next Bernese Synod. Recommendation for the letter bearer and his companion.</p>

      <p>I received letters from you through my messenger, dearest Heinrich, one for the council and the rest for me, which were most welcome. Not that the council heard everything you advised with holy zeal, but what pertained to the Heremitan assembly. Nor did the council know that they were written by you. The treasurer knew this with the secretary. However, you have so successfully silenced the mouths of many that you should never regret that effort. It was impressed upon many that the people of Zurich have confessed with their own mouths that the people of the Five Places have the "true and undoubted faith." While the pious contradicted this, it was believed by the pious, less so by the impious.</p>
      <p>Moreover, you have labored for the Lord with expenses added to the messenger (for he could not sufficiently commend your generosity). He will refund everything.</p>
      <p>In these days, our magistrate was created under the most auspicious, as everyone hopes, circumstances.</p>
      <p>Jakob von Wattenwyl was elected as Schultheiß - this honor was expected by the Schultheiß von Diesbach -, Wolfgang von Wingarten as Venner. Another was also added to the council, all men of the best hope. Such were added to the deacons, while the papists and butchers were dismissed, and never before in many years has it succeeded according to the wishes of the pious as it did this Easter. Whether our people will send a messenger to the upcoming Tagsatzung or not is still uncertain.</p>
      <p>I received Megander's commentaries as a gift from him. As for what you write about the Capito Synod, I do not know what to respond. I perpetually confess my ignorance, and when I have turned to the learned for the sake of education, I find such diversity of opinions among you, along with such varied translations of languages, that I am often drawn into the common proverb: "The learned are the confused." It seemed strange when Capito judged that repentance should be preached in Christ. He supported this with the sermons of the apostles, who acted differently with the Jews and differently with the Gentiles. However, because of this new method of teaching, since it neither detracted from faith nor charity, I did not want to disagree with the man. There was a need for a prescribed method of correction and teaching among us. For indeed, these times, morals, and the necessity of the churches teach this. But with us, the political gospel had become so satirical and tyrannical that it was not allowed to teach the apostolic message of John 3:16 without ignominy: "For God so loved the world." This was openly asserted by some from the pulpit, so addicted to mockery, jests, and insults, from which not repentance, but hatred arose towards the gospel and its ministers, who were considered pseudo-brothers for proclaiming Christ and not joining in their insults. But why say more? It is not possible for me to write about the church and pastors, my and others' shortcomings, unless I were present at your mouth. Would that you would come to our synod. A date has not yet been set, but I will announce it as soon as I can.</p>
      <p>Finally, that messenger is the scribe of the consistory, a man most worthy of your familiarity. He will tell you if you wish to know anything else. I commend him to you with the parish priest as a companion, just as I commend myself. He is a musician and seeks his homeland. I beseech you not to deny him your company. For he greatly rejoices in the company of the learned. He knows you in Bremgarten.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and may you happily digest what I write quickly.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>April 16.</p>
      <p>Yours always, B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, at Zurich, pastor, his dearest brother.</p>
