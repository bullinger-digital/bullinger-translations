      <p>Greetings. These two bearers of the present letter, very skilled and pious men, are coming to you, from whom you will learn much, and there is no need for me to commend them to you, as you are accustomed to kindly embrace the learned of your own accord. From France, we receive no good news regarding the governors of the kingdom, some of whom are bloodthirsty persecutors, others are slow and themselves captives at their own discretion. However, as far as the churches are concerned, the work of God is powerful, and it grows with marvelous increases and, watered by the blood of martyrs, it brings forth illustrious fruits. What Bern will respond to the Genevans regarding their demands, we will soon learn from Neuchâtel, where a day has been set for deliberation on the first of November. Matters are being conducted in a way that could easily be disrupted if there were faith among those who ought to have the highest authority. The Scots are said to have reached an agreement with the French, but on the condition that their customary rights and freedoms remain intact, then that the viceroy appointed to the kingdom be a Scot by nationality, and finally that the younger Earl of Arran, hitherto captive, be released. There are also those who assert that the Scots are in this matter, so that the widowed queen may marry a man under whose auspices Scottish affairs may be restored. The people of Trier are in turmoil due to sedition, as a significant part of the populace demands a free church; they are very anxious about the outcome, and it is fitting for us to support the zeal and will of the pious with our prayers. The people of Aachen are attempting the same, but in vain, because the Emperor opposes and the Duke of Jülich offers no favor, let alone support. We have received nothing from Rome for a long time; if you have anything, please share it.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 20, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed and dear brother.</p>
