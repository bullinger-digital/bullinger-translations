      <p>S. D. I have absolutely nothing to write at the moment; I have received nothing either from France or from Augsburg in Germany, except that soldiers are being gathered in Germany by Count Archio, Ladron Albert, Empseo, etc., to be led into Italy. Others say that Maximilian does not want Germany to be emptied of soldiers and led (to be led to Hungary) into Italy. What is happening, I do not know; when I have something certain, I will write. I am sending 12 copies prepared at the expense of the magistrate to you, distribute them as you think will be beneficial for the cause. You will understand the rest from the public letters.</p>
      <p>While I was about to fold and seal the letters, behold, yours are sent to me from Glarus through Beldius; I read them not without sorrow. As for the address or subscription, I hope you have nothing to complain about; for I wrote as you instructed in your letters. If you wish for any changes, let me know in time; for it will be reprinted in a few days. As for the unfortunate episcopal dispute, I do not know what advice to give. If the adversaries would accept the means proposed in the consultation, the matter would be tolerable; but I fear they will accept nothing of the sort. Wenn ir sy in den banden hättend, möchtend ir inen schier nitt me zuͦmuͦten. As I am familiar with the character of these people, I fear they will stubbornly adhere to their proposed law und das sy äben mitt rächt wöllind die sach ußgemacht haben. A plausible cause: for whoever does not want to stand by the law will have everyone against him as enemies. I know what happened to the most honorable Republic of Zurich once and again. It will be difficult to obtain from our people or other evangelical cities to write to the Two Confederations and ask them not to proceed by law, etc. Again, if it proceeds by law, I fear the privileges on which you rely will be rejected as void. I also know this now: not only is a bridle being imposed on you, but a halter is also being prepared for us. Therefore, I had warned early, and indeed, you know from whose instigation, if you remember correctly: it would be most beneficial if the House of God would take care to bind the other Two Confederations to itself in this cause. But this could not be obtained; you know the reasons. Therefore, what I should advise now, I do not know. I will pray to the Lord to intervene. In the meantime, if the matter could be settled by a tolerable transaction, which would safeguard both religion and liberty, I think it would not be to be rejected. I sent the consultation to Beldius. I have previously warned and now repeat: if the House of God wants something to be done by our people, this should not be indicated through your private letters and my explanation. It does not benefit the cause if these things are attempted through you or me. Let one or two in the magistrate write to the consul and privately advise what needs to be done. - And now I return from Consul Müller, to whom I handed your letters, and I recommended your cause to him; at the same time, I explained or recited what you wrote to me, etc. He would prefer a tolerable transaction, and in this, he would rather have you work entirely than experience war. Regarding writing letters to the Two Confederations, so that this matter is not settled by law, he also said, as I warned before, that there is no hope. - I sent the letters with the Italian papers to Ziegler. Farewell now. May the Lord bless you and keep you from evil. Greet the consuls and brothers. March 15, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>I am already tired of writing to Augsburg, Heidelberg, Marburg, Bern, Geneva, etc. To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
