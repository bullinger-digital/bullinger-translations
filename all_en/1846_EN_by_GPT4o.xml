      <p>Philipp, by the grace of God Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc.</p>
      <p>Worthy and highly learned, dear special one, Theobald Thamer has written to us, to which we have replied, and he has written back to us, to which we have replied a second time, as our servant will read to you. We do not want to withhold from you that we have delivered all such writings to our present servant and sent them along with Theobald to Philipp Melanchthon, Erhard Schnepf in Jena, and Daniel Greiser in Dresden, and graciously requested them to converse with him, to see if he might be brought back from his error to the truth. They have done so; however, Theobald has persisted in his error and has not allowed himself to be dissuaded. Since we have read your writings, booklets, and sermons, we have found and noted that you are experienced in the Holy Scriptures and have a true judgment and understanding of them, and are particularly learned in them. Therefore, we have deemed it good to send Theobald to you as well.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is our gracious request to you, that you, with God's help, make every possible effort to see if Almighty God will grant his grace and he might be brought back from his error to the right recognition of the truth; for he is a learned man and moderate in his life.</p>
      <p>God will reward this, and we will graciously acknowledge it towards you, commending you to the Lord hereby. Given at Marburg on the 14th of April in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, etc. signed.</p>
      <p>To Mr. H. Bullinger.</p>
