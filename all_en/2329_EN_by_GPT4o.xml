      <p>Greetings, most excellent man. I received your last letter along with the Saxon ones; they were pleasing, but I wish they were not so raw, indeed more extensive.</p>
      <p>Vergerius was in Stra√üburg, from where he wrote to me and to you, as you will see from those I send. You expect news from me from Italy; you received from Lord Consul Hab what came during the time of the assemblies. Now you will also hear what comes from Picardy; for I write everything to the lords. That tyrant, if he has any sense, ought to be suffocated and yet he lives to the ruin of the Christian republic. The son, whatever is boasted, is not yet in England.</p>
      <p>As for your republic, you will have heard from your envoys in what state are those matters about which we wrote before. I see everything peaceful. May the Lord be with your states. Now those Burgundians, many Germans, and the Emperor's men were laughing and writing, now they will publicly proclaim that the Swiss are fighting and are agitated by civil wars and there is hope that the Emperor would want to bring aid to one side. Good gods, what monsters. Your consul will be able to communicate more about these. I greet him and you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man, etc. Solothurn, hastily, July 5th. Yours always, Basse-Fontaine.</p>
