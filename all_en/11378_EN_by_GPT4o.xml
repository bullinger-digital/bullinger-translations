    <p xml:id="regest1">Has learned that Bucer is angry with him because of his preface [No. 1283] to Vadian's [“Orthodoxa et erudita... epistola”], as he believes the criticism of the inconsistency of certain people is aimed at him and the Strasbourg church. Bullinger published this writing at the suggestion of Grynäus and Myconius, as it seemed useful to them in view of Schwenckfeld's heresy; his preface is directed primarily against Schwenckfeld and his followers, but also against some fickle preachers in Swabia - namely Simprecht [Schenck] in Kempten - whom he had in mind when writing in July. He asks to be excused to Bucer; since he is irritable, he does not want to write to him himself. Bibliander has already written to Johannes Sturm on the same occasion. Encloses the booklet in case Grynäus has not yet received it.</p>

      <p>I understand that Bucer is seriously and gravely angry with me, and that is because of the published letter of Vadian, especially because of my preface to Vadian's letter. He suspects that what I wrote about inconsistent people is said against him and the most holy church of Strasbourg. For he will not prove with a single word that my words apply to the church of Strasbourg, unless he has made it such as I do not think it to be. He makes specifics out of generalities. You know, my dear Grynaeus, that you and Myconius were the main authors of my decision to publish it. For when I understood from your letters that you highly approved of Vadian's letter, and that it would be beneficial if it were shared with more people, especially now when Schwenckfeld's perverse doctrine is misleading many of the simpler ones, I, wishing to do a favor for all good people, published it, and prefixed a letter which, if I am not mistaken, is not unrelated to the booklet, and which I directed as much as possible against the Schwenckfeldians and similar puffed-up spirits, as the context of the work itself will testify. Furthermore, I also wrote against papists, pseudo-evangelicals, and certain turncoats. But who will say that I wrote falsehoods, when today there are so many examples everywhere of inconsistent people who fulfill exactly what I noted? And when I wrote those things in July, there were certain preachers in Swabia to whom it seemed excellent to now lean this way, soon that way, among whom Simprecht of Kempten was the most immodest of all, etc. Therefore, since these things are so, and you know that the letter was published for no other reason, I beg you to excuse me to the people of Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>I did not want to write to Bucer. Not because I hate the man, or because I am angry with him for this reason, but, since he is otherwise quite irritable, I did not want to offend him more seriously. For it is not pleasant for me to quarrel with brothers. It would be much more bitter to sting and provoke them with a hidden speech. Bibliander, my dearest godfather, also wrote to Johannes Sturm on this matter, excusing me. Therefore, you too, my dear Grynaeus, do the duty of a friend. I will not remember this matter anymore in the future, nor will I complain about it to anyone further. I love and honor the brothers of Strasbourg and that most holy church. I have enclosed the booklet, in case you have not yet received it. But I think you have already received a copy from us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, December 12, 1539.</p>
