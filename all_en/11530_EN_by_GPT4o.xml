    <p xml:id="regest1">The news about the siege of Pest by the Turks and the behavior of the Emperor and bishops makes him expect the worst; due to the disregard of the Gospel - even by those who claim to be evangelical - God's judgment is imminent, and only faithful service and repentance can bring salvation. He defends himself against criticism for being too lenient with the Zurich students; Froschauer was supposed to deliver letters and money to them and take Christoph [Rotacher] with him - Bullinger has already sent a recommendation for Rotacher to the students remaining in Marburg after Gwalther's recall -, but probably did not manage to do so and will pay out the money on the return journey from Frankfurt; a decision is still pending regarding [Konrad] Suter; Christian [Wirth] is to go to Tübingen, while Rotacher might be better off staying in Basel.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>If it is true, as they write, that the town of Pest, located opposite Buda, is besieged by the Turks, and the Emperor, however, is promising himself some kind of happiness and therefore indulging in feasting and hunting, leading and escorting the holy fathers, the bishops, what should I think, my dear Myconius? I greatly fear that the fate of Belshazzar, the king of Babylon, is looming over our princes and bishops. The Gospel of Christ has been preached for a long time and much, the cross and forgiveness of Christ have been preached, repentance has been preached. Yet some here have blasphemed Christ and His truth, trampled on the cross of Christ, turned their backs on repentance, expelled the innocent and faithful friends of God, stripped them of their seats, and finally killed them most cruelly; and what they have shamelessly done so far, they either do even more shamelessly today or plan to do, anxiously grasping at tyrannical plans. Others have heard the Gospel and pretended to believe in Christ, but denied it with their lives. For if whoring, getting drunk, committing adultery, corrupting virgins, dancing, indulging in lust, adorning oneself more than Persian, dressing and walking, usury, lying, acting treacherously, setting and resetting all laws according to lust, affixing a wax nose to Christ the Lord and His eternal word, perverting the words of God and interpreting them kindly, washing hands in the goods of the poor, despising and rejecting the poor, defiling and tearing down studies, mixing sacred with profane, committing sacrilege, and finally, after all that, mocking, harassing, despising, burdening with insults, injuries, and reproaches the miserable preachers is to cultivate piety and be evangelical, then indeed we are great worshippers of God and very evangelical. What then shall I say, my brother? I grieve from the heart and waste away with sorrow. I see the judgments of the Lord, and what hangs over us because of a life that knows not repentance. We are of no use in all parts. Nor do I see where we can flee except to the mercy of God. Meanwhile, I think we must all insist on our duty, incessantly cry out to God, exhort and urge the people to repentance, if perhaps the Lord may have mercy on us. For our sins throughout the Christian world are most grievous and cry out to heaven. Woe to us, woe to us, if we are found here to be mute dogs, who cannot bark, who say with that treacherous evangelical minister: "My Lord delays His coming" and begin to beat our fellow servants, indeed to eat and drink with the drunkards; for the Lord will come to us on a day we do not expect, and will cut us in pieces and assign our inheritance with the hypocrites. Let us therefore watch and pray.</p>
      <p>For the time of visitation is at hand. What you write, my dearest Myconius, that we anxiously favor those two, you are indeed mistaken. They know, if they wish to know, how much they are commended to us; for the schoolmaster has gravely expostulated with them in a letter written in the name of all the heads of the college. Bibliander was also ordered to deal with them severely, again to praise Christoph's diligence and obedience. I think he has done everything according to duty. What, that new reproachful letters have been given to Froschauer along with 44 crowns, which he was ordered to give to Christoph, Wick, Christian, and Suter, and to count part of Christoph's and the other two's in Basel? Furthermore, he was ordered to take Christoph with him to Frankfurt, and from there to send him to Marburg. And I have very kindly recommended Christoph to the three young men staying in Marburg; for the fourth, Gwalther, has been recalled home. Now I hear and understand from your letters that Froschauer, perhaps overwhelmed by the burden of business, left without greeting them and took their money to Frankfurt. Perhaps the Lord willed it so. For as we know, Christoph is not neglected by you. A decision regarding Suter will be made after Easter. Christian is called to Tübingen by his brother, a learned and honest man, and the heads of the college have ordered him to go. Therefore, you will greet Christoph and console him. When Froschauer returns, he will undoubtedly count the loaned money. And perhaps it is more advisable for him to stay with you.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the heads of the college have granted them the freedom to either stay in Basel or go to Marburg, as the schoolmaster wrote to them.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my esteemed Myconius.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 4, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
