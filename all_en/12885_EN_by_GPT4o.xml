    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Curione recently wrote a letter [No. 2802] to Bullinger together with Francesco Stancaro, who is living with him, in which they responded to Bullinger's previous letter [not received]. Now they are eagerly awaiting Bullinger's reply [not received]. Stancaro (who sends his regards) would like to know if Bullinger has found a position for him. Bullinger should inform them about this as soon as possible. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] He should also forward the enclosed letter destined for Italy to Johannes Comander or someone else in Chur, so that it can be sent from there to the evangelical preacher in Poschiavo, the Milanese Giulio [della Rovere]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] So many different things are being reported (typical for wartime!) that one no longer knows what to believe. Some report of mass celebrations in two churches in Ulm; of clashes between imperial and local mercenaries in Augsburg; of enormous monetary demands by the Augsburg Cardinal Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, King Ferdinand I, and Emperor Charles V; as well as of a massive troop gathering by Ferdinand for Duke Maurice of Saxony. Others claim, however, that Ferdinand wants to flee because of the approaching Turkish Sultan Suleiman, or that the Emperor is in Flanders because he fears the worst from the French King Francis I and Landgrave Philip of Hesse. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] Bullinger will have heard that Strasbourg has sent a delegation to the Emperor to negotiate peace, but they have not yet been heard because Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, is absent and Johann von Naves has died. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Bullinger should, when possible, convey news and also share his opinion on Curione's book ["Pro vera et antiqua ecclesiae Christi autoritate oratio"]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Greetings, also to the family and colleagues. </p>

      <p>Caelius Secundus Curio sends greetings through Christ Jesus. Both I and Francesco Stancaro, who is with me, recently sent you letters in which we both responded to yours. We are eagerly awaiting your reply, especially since Stancaro is very anxious about the matter, as you have kindly taken up his cause. However, because he is very busy, he could not write to you today. He asked me, as I was already writing to you, to greet you on his behalf and to ask if you have any hope, to let us know as soon as possible, so that he may understand what he should do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As for the rest, since I have letters to send to Italy but no messenger, my dear Bullinger, I thought to send them to you, so that, if you can in any way, you might ensure they are carried to Chur to someone of yours, to Johannes Comander or another, so that from there they may reach our Giulio in Milan, who teaches the gospel in Poschiavo. I earnestly and repeatedly ask you to do this as soon as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Many new things are reported daily, indeed every hour (as is usual in great calamities), and they are so varied that you can hardly know what to believe. Some say that masses are already being celebrated in two churches in Ulm, that a tumult has arisen in Augsburg between the imperial and local mercenaries; that the Augsburg Cardinal Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, King Ferdinand I, and Emperor Charles V are demanding an enormous sum of money; that Ferdinand is gathering a large army to assist Duke Maurice of Saxony; and finally, that everything is miserable! Others say that the Emperor is thinking of Flanders, fearing something from both the French King Francis I and Landgrave Philip of Hesse in Lower Germany; that Ferdinand is preparing to flee because of the approaching Turkish Sultan Suleiman; and many other things of this kind, which may the Lord turn to good!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>This, however, is certain, and I do not doubt you have heard it: the people of Strasbourg have sent delegates to the Emperor to negotiate peace. They have not yet been heard because of the absence of Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, and the death of Johann von Naves, who died on the way while setting out for Augsburg with troops.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>But if you have more certain information, I ask you to write something to us, and I am very eager to hear your judgment on our book, my dear and most learned Heinrich, always most loving and esteemed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell and greet your family in my name and also those most learned brothers. In Basel, on the 4th of March, 1547. Caelius, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most renowned man in doctrine and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zurich church, most esteemed friend and brother. In Zurich.</p>
