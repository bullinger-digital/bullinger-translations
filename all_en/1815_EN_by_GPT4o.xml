      <p>Greetings from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>These good brothers, who bear the letters, will tell you, Heinrich Bullinger, where they found me. In short: there is great effort and the situation is somewhat precarious. But I am not afraid; for the Lord is with me. Within two days, the commissioners, about whom I wrote, will arrive. But the devil opposes me and our gospel with money, and that openly. Pray with the whole church for me, which I earnestly ask of you. The small vessel with the books, which you received from Basel, has not yet been delivered; I beg you, ensure that it does not remain stuck on any rocks any longer; all those books would have already been distributed if they had been delivered. In Zürich, with Mr. Gotthard the merchant, there resides a young man named Peter Paul, the son of a very dear friend of mine. I implore you by your faith, make sure that the father understands that I have sincerely recommended him to you. Farewell and be well with your whole family, school, and church. Given at Chiavenna, February 26, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, honorable lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
