      <p>Camillo Renato to Heinrich Bullinger, sends greetings in Christ. Indeed, I have always thought, most excellent Bullinger, that our friendship had reached such a level through this correspondence that no calamity could ever occur. But the situation is far different (unless I am mistaken). Francesco Stancaro told me something about you that could clearly offend both our relationship and my dignity. I do not wish you to think that he did this with the intention of causing a rift between us, for he seems to be very fond of both of us, but rather so that, if this were concealed from us for too long, it might eventually cause a rift. He asserts that I have been called and regarded by you as most heretical. You yourself can imagine how much trouble this causes me. I am completely unaware of why you have smeared me with this insult.</p>
      <p>I am certain that those like you would never say such a thing for any reason. Therefore, I ask and beseech you to inform me who persuaded you and for what reason you deemed it appropriate to call me by that name. If you deny it, I certainly do not see how you can defend having regard for the dignity and well-being of both a friend and a brother.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter of the Chiavenna church, although I prefer you to learn about it from others, I will say this for now, which all good and peace-loving people also believe: whoever wanted to ensure tranquility, even if perhaps not lacking in goodwill, was entirely lacking in counsel and reason. Know this one thing: never have the churches been more offended and more disturbed, both this one and the neighboring ones. By what fate, whose fault, for what reason, you will learn from others or even from myself. I await your letters. Farewell and love me as a Christian. Greet Theodor Bibliander and other colleagues and brothers in my name and in the name of all, in the Lord.</p>
      <p>On the 21st day of September 1548, Chiavenna.</p>
      <p>Yours, as above</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man and dearest brother in Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
