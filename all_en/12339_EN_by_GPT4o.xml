    <p xml:id="regest1">The [Aarauers] struggled for a while to find such a pious, learned [successor for the schoolmaster position] as Bullinger had advised them; but in vain, for the [Bernese] prevailed, who did not relent in their efforts. The [Aarau] council accepted [Ulrich Trog], who was proposed by the [Bernese]. He is from Aarau; his grandfather [Heinrich Trog?] is a councilman, and [Ulrich] is said to be very much like his [Bernese] teachers. - What Bullinger wrote about [the victory of] Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] greatly pleased Hochholzer, especially since he had heard contradictory reports and did not know which side to believe. - Greetings from Hochholzer's wife [Agathe, née Näf].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. We have labored for some time, venerable father, for a pious, faithful, and learned schoolmaster, such as you advised us to receive (and whom you promised to send us if you could; for which all good people rightly thank you). But all in vain! For the relentless zeal and tireless diligence of those people prevailed in accomplishing what they had once decided.</p>
      <p>Our council accepted the one whom the ministers of the Bernese church wanted to promote. I would be greatly disturbed by this matter, if I did not know for certain that it was done not without the will of the divine. Therefore, there is no need for you to be concerned about our school in this regard, to either send someone or labor in recommending anyone. He has been accepted. We now await his arrival.</p>
      <p>He is a citizen of Aarau. His grandfather is a councilman. However, I cannot judge for certain what kind of person he will be; yet I judge and hear from some that he will be like those who are their disciples. For an egg is not more similar to another egg than all these are to their teachers. May the Lord turn everything to the glory of His name and the safety of the church, and thwart the plans and efforts of all enemies of the truth.</p>
      <p>What you wrote about the Landgrave was very pleasing; for an uncertain rumor had brought some things to us, yet so diverse that it remained in doubt which side should be believed.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me and our church commended to you. Aarau, November 21, 1545. My wife greets you.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, his lord to be greatly honored as a father. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
