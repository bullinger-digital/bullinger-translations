    <p xml:id="regest1">The criticism expressed in Bullinger's commentary on Matthew towards those who consider a double marriage permissible under certain circumstances has disappointed him, because the Bullinger he previously esteemed contradicts what he otherwise advocates when he demands a justification from God's law and the institution of marriage and claims that Christ and the apostles have revoked a dispensation granted to the [Old Testament] fathers; Lening feels compelled to explain the opposing view in a friendly letter and to demonstrate to Bullinger the untenability of his arguments. The proponents of digamy assume that the unchangeable law of God demands perfection from us as it did from the fathers. In view of this, even the good works of the saints are sinful in God's judgment. What is to be considered a transgression and what a good work is measured solely by Moses and the Decalogue. Christ and the apostles did not impose new commandments on us but referred to Moses. The fathers and we are equally part of God's people and church; what was allowed to them cannot be forbidden to us without God's explicit command. God instituted marriage in paradise for the sake of companionship and offspring, and we should align ourselves with this ideal. However, the account of this is not a command; after the fall and the onset of concupiscence, marriage also serves to avoid fornication and is to be judged solely based on Mosaic law. Digamy is not only not forbidden there but, for example, presupposed in Deuteronomy 21 [10-17]; neither the prophets nor the apostles reproach it, and Paul also commands monogamy only to bishops and deacons. Christ and the apostles urged perfection in everything but never wanted to deprive the weak of a means granted by God. Many cannot meet the demands [of the Sermon on the Mount] and are still Christians if they believe and strive for improvement; how could we question this at this one point? Christ and the apostles did not presume this, yet some of their statements were wrongly related to digamy, and the ignorant have made the gospel a new law. Both the apostles and Pope Gregory [III] tolerated double marriages among new converts without declaring it a temporary exception. Even among the ancients, human weakness was at play alongside other reasons, and later, polygamy could often have avoided more disgraceful things; should it not also help the weak today? It is only intended for individual cases that can be regulated by an orderly dispensation without risk of abuse. The otherwise strict Ambrose did not reproach the actions of Valentinian [I], and chroniclers like [Burchard of] Ursberg report on kings and emperors who were considered Christians despite digamy and divorce; without the tyranny of the papacy and tradition, this means would probably have been used more often. All these arguments are in line with what Bullinger himself teaches in "De testamento," in his dialogues against the Anabaptists, and [in the preface to the commentary on Matthew]; he rightly criticizes the Anabaptists when they recognize only those as Christians who perfectly fulfill God's commandments. Regarding Bullinger's arguments: Like the Anabaptists he criticizes, he disregards the context when he relates Mt 19 [8] to digamy; Lening, on the other hand, approves of Zwingli's interpretation, who denied that God forbade it; Bullinger also cannot provide a prohibition. Although God gave Adam only one wife, he gave others several; the biblical statements about marriage apply to them all. Whether someone is a Christian is not measured by the law, as Bullinger rightly opposes the Anabaptists, yet here he argues like them. He will never be able to prove that digamy was only temporarily granted to the fathers. There is also no reason why this means should no longer be granted to the weak, as Christ also justified the transgression of the Sabbath commandment. How could double marriages have been unthinkable for Paul if he prescribed monogamy [only] to bishops and deacons? Although Christ restored marriage to its original meaning, what Bullinger writes against the rigorism of the Anabaptists also applies here. Why does he assume that we could live more moderately and perfectly at this point than the fathers? Although Christians should strive for perfection, no one may take away the remedies granted by God for their weaknesses. Paul does not speak of digamy in 1 Corinthians 7 [2], and what he orders for women in Romans 7 [1-3], Bullinger arbitrarily applies to men. Unlike Paul, Bullinger attributes a carnal mindset to digamists. He refers to the justification for the multiple marriages of the fathers cited by Ambrose and Augustine but fails to recognize that there were other legitimate reasons for it and mistakenly relates Malachi 2 [10-16] to this question. The zealous reproach with which he concludes cannot conceal the weakness of his arguments. It would have been better if he, like others, had remained silent on this topic; Lening wants to encourage him through this private letter to reconsider his stance and also to recognize those as Christians who do not reach the highest degree of perfection. Hopes for a candid response. Regards.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Recently, dearest Bullinger, some brothers presented me with your commentaries on Matthew, earnestly requesting that I read your opinion in chapter 19 against the proponents and defenders of digamy; for they knew that I have always held you in high regard. I read and carefully considered your arguments, but not without stomachache and pain, as I noticed that you (whom I have loved, respected, and esteemed greatly until now) were not quite like yourself in that place, even contrary, and not responding as you were accustomed to with your great name. And if anything is achieved by such wishes, I would have wished that you had either not touched such an ulcer at all or had approached it with stronger and more proven remedies. The same is wished by many learned brothers who are well-disposed towards you and judge you to be quite weak in this argument and not very favorable to digamy. You think that the proponents of digamy have no stronger argument than some examples of the fathers, which prove nothing in this matter. You demand arguments derived from the law of God and the original institution of marriage, etc. You claim that the old fathers had divine dispensation in their polygamy, but that this has been completely abolished and abrogated among Christians through Christ and the apostles, etc., which you elaborate on more extensively in this argument. To which I am compelled to write to you partly out of my respect for you, partly out of love for truth and conscience, and to briefly indicate, as much as can be done in a familiar letter, the foundations, arguments, and scriptures on which the proponents of digamy rely and which they want to be permissible today in certain necessary cases, and then to point out to you the weakness of your arguments with which you have attacked digamy, in the good hope that you, as a learned and Christian man, will take it well, whatever it is, and after you have read and understood everything, will not be entirely unfavorable to digamy, if not entirely favorable, but not so unjust either. I therefore pray through Christ that you will read and consider with mature judgment, setting aside emotions, what I will submit here.</p>
      <p>The proponents of digamy rely primarily on these foundations: First, that there is one unique, eternal, immutable God from the beginning to the end of the world, of the fathers as well as ours, ours no less than the fathers.</p>
      <p>This eternal and immutable God also has only one unique, eternal, immutable, and irrevocable law from the beginning to the end of the world. This law (as far as substance and core are concerned) always demands the same from humans, namely complete perfection and full reformation to the image of God.</p>
      <p>According to this law, not only manifest transgressions but also all the good works of the saints, however good, are considered sins before God and His tribunal. For they are all unprofitable servants, as Christ commanded them to confess; all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God [Romans 3:23].</p>
      <p>As far as human and church judgment is concerned, nothing should be considered a sin and transgression of the law and illicit, which God has not expressly forbidden and condemned in Moses and the Decalogue, and nothing should be approved and considered a good work, which is not expressly approved and admitted there.</p>
      <p>Christ and His apostles are not new legislators and have taught or commanded nothing that was not previously included in Moses and the Decalogue.</p>
      <p>And so we are always referred back to Moses, the law, and the Decalogue by them. The law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Christ.</p>
      <p>Paul, as he did not have a new commandment or prohibition of the Lord concerning virgins, so neither did he have concerning others not expressly included in the law.</p>
      <p>And although he gives faithful advice and everywhere exhorts all to perfection, he nevertheless does not impose a snare on anyone, since everyone has their own gift.</p>
      <p>We are, together with the ancients, and they with us, the same people of God, the same church, have the same Christ, one faith, one baptism, one unique eternal testament, one and the same law, the same promises, and the same way of salvation. And whatever did not defraud the ancients of their faith in Christ, this cannot take away our faith either. Likewise, whatever was granted to the ancients for their faith in Christ and not imputed as sin (as far as human and church judgment is concerned), this is also permitted to us, and no authority of any angel or human can take it away without an express command of God and impute it as a manifest transgression of the divine law.</p>
      <p>Marriage was indeed instituted by God in paradise most excellently between male and female for the sake of companionship and offspring, and he does best who (all else being equal) lives according to this institution, his marriage being most pleasing to God, praised by all, and all married people are to be directed and encouraged to the same goal.</p>
      <p>However, it should not be allowed that anyone, according to their own pleasure, makes a divine law out of the words of Adam and a mere recitation, from an indicative speech an imperative. Nor should it be permitted that the human race, after Adam's fall, after disordered concupiscence has crept in, be judged according to the first institution of marriage in a state of complete innocence, but rather according to the written law of Moses and the Decalogue; otherwise, not only digamists but also all monogamists who know their wives - besides the cause of companionship and offspring - also for the sake of avoiding fornication, would be condemned. For this cause of marriage was not yet in paradise, since disordered concupiscence had not yet crept in.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, digamy after Adam's fall is nowhere prohibited or condemned, but has always been granted by God as a remedy for human weakness, as is infallibly evidenced not only by the examples of the fathers but also by the Mosaic laws Deuteronomy 21 [10-17] and elsewhere. These laws indiscriminately, without any exception, sanction all Jews on how they should behave towards a virgin they have defiled, towards a captive, and towards the children of two wives in dividing the inheritance. There were also digamists and polygamists both before the law in the time of the patriarchs, under the law, and under the budding gospel, and they were never reproached or condemned by God, the prophets, or the apostles for their actions. Yet the prophets and apostles are accustomed to leaving no sin, even hidden vices and crimes to be retained by pious ears, untouched. And how could so much forgetfulness have crept upon Paul that, although he so often remembers every crime and offense that deprives us of the kingdom of heaven, he did not also strike down digamy, which was already before his eyes?</p>
      <p>Surely the apostles are not to be considered so negligent and careless that, if they had considered digamy henceforth as illicit, harmful, and condemned like other public and hidden crimes, they would not have mentioned it as expressly as the others. Paul would at least have said just as easily: "Let every Christian henceforth be the husband of one wife," as he said, and not just once: "Let a bishop be the husband of one wife." And this peculiar command to bishops and deacons would have been superfluous and unnecessary if digamy had already been abolished and prohibited and condemned among all Christians in general by Christ and the apostles without any exception.</p>
      <p>Christ and Paul certainly not only in Matthew 19 and 1 Corinthians 7, but also in Matthew 5, 6, 7, Luke 6, and elsewhere, elevate and transmit us to the highest degree of perfection not only in one article of divorce or digamy but in all the articles that are included in the already cited chapters.</p>
      <p>To which goal we should always both look up and aim, and all others should be encouraged and referred. However, it does not follow from this that they have enacted new laws for us, abolished or removed or changed the paternal law, so far from it that they would have wanted to deny and take away from weak Christians (who cannot reach such a sublime goal of perfection) the remedies granted to the ancients by the heavenly Father. For this was not their function. Since Christ was not a new legislator, not a severe exactor, but a conciliator of grace, indeed full of grace, and the apostles were ministers not of the letter but of the spirit.</p>
      <p>There have always been and are still found many who cannot attain the perfection of paradise and the divine law expressed by Christ in Matthew 5, 6, 7, Luke 6, etc., being weak and imperfect Christians, subject to self-love, anger, and concupiscence, having their own servants and goods, receiving pensions, not leaving everything, claiming their own in judgment, knowing their wives besides the cause of offspring for the sake of avoiding fornication, etc. In these and similar cases and blemishes of human weakness, we can well dispense, recognize divine indulgence and connivance, leave them as Christians, provided they believe in Christ, recognize their vices, always set themselves to strive for better things, and strive for it incessantly according to their ability. Now, since digamy is nowhere expressly prohibited and was in use before the law, under the law, and under the rise of the gospel, the fathers allowed it, it did not take away their faith, why should we not acknowledge and confess that it is also permissible and allowed to a weak Christian today in certain and necessary cases? By what authority will we deny that a digamist can be and remain a Christian, provided he believes in Christ and continues to progress in the Christian life? Why should we not also acknowledge divine dispensation here as in other cases? Why should we not allow similar remedies for similar diseases?</p>
      <p>Whatever God has not expressly commanded or prohibited, commended or reproved in His law and the Decalogue, this is not within the authority of any human (as far as conscience and salvation are concerned) to command or prohibit, approve or condemn, much less than it was allowed to Christ and the apostles, who, as they recognized that this was not their office, so they did not arrogate it to themselves.</p>
      <p>As for why digamy has been so condemned, prohibited, and considered illicit among Christians until now, it has partly arisen and happened from the words of Christ in Matthew 19 [4-6, 8f] and Paul in 1 Corinthians 7 [2] being understood without sobriety and twisted against their nature into digamy, of which, however, not a single iota is mentioned there, partly from the ignorance and hallucination of those who have made Christ a new legislator, the gospel a law of perfection, us and the ancients two different peoples, two churches, and two testaments, when it is as clear as day without any controversy that Christ came with the fullness of paternal grace as a savior, as a physician, as a helper and forgiver, not as a tyrant and more severe exactor than the Father was in His law, but who would not extinguish the smoking flax nor break the bruised reed further nor burden His church, but liberate, relieve, and lighten it.</p>
      <p>It is clear and cannot be denied that not only did the apostles baptize digamists from the Gentiles and Jews in their time and inaugurate them into Christianity, but also Pope Gregory in the time of Boniface dispensed with the Germans converted to faith who were digamists. Since no human dispensation is valid without the divine word, both must have had the word of God according to which they acted, or they dispensed against the law and word of God, which is far from the truth, and seduced men. Since they preached solid and true repentance and the remission of sins through the name of Jesus (to which doctrine is indissolubly attached to turn away from evil and do good), they would not have granted or permitted digamy to the newly converted any more than they tolerated, forgave, and permitted adultery, murder, sorcery, fornication, effeminacy, etc., if they had considered it illicit, prohibited, and condemned henceforth like these crimes. Or at least they would have said (which, however, is found nowhere) that digamists converted at that time should be tolerated because of the present condition and necessity, but digamy should not be permitted to any Christians henceforth.</p>
      <p>There were not one and the same, but various causes of digamy among the ancients, Abraham joined more wives because of Sarah's barrenness, Jacob because of Laban's deceit, love for Rachel, the sisters' emulation, Gideon, Elkanah, David, and others undoubtedly had other causes of polygamy, and none of them were entirely free and immune from concupiscence and human weakness in their actions. However, among Christians, there have always been some subject to the same weakness and imperfection, to whom digamy could have been a remedy and cure to prevent and cut off many adulteries, fornications, and other such vices, if the same light of the gospel had shone as clearly then as it does for us today. Since there is no less weakness in Christianity today as there was in the past, why should it not be permissible to remedy and assist it in inevitable cases through digamy, especially in those men in whom we can otherwise perceive faith in Christ and amendment of life in other articles?</p>
      <p>The proponents of digamy have never even thought of introducing it as a common law and permitting it indiscriminately to everyone, but they would be greatly displeased to see it condemned and abolished in general without the express word of God out of human ignorance, presumption, and rashness, so that it cannot be granted to anyone through an orderly dispensation in certain necessary cases, since it can be a remedy for many Christians who are otherwise allowed to fall into other prohibited vices by its denial, not to say are driven into them. Nor should the common abuse of it be so anxiously feared, since it was not so common among the ancients either, nor is it everyone's food. Nor should the abuse of the wicked be so highly regarded that we want to deny and take away from the good the remedies granted to them by God. Those who are concerned with dispensing in this matter will also take good care and caution not to loosen the reins for abusers and wicked people.</p>
      <p>I have never read about Ambrose, such a severe bishop and great admirer of celibacy and virginity, that he ever reproached and excommunicated Emperor Valentinian for his digamy and law, although he did not hesitate to rebuke and anathematize Theodosius for the crime committed against the Thessalonians. In the Chronicle of Urspergensis and other chronographs, examples of some kings and emperors are found who partly used digamy, partly divorce, and yet were not stripped of the Christian name or struck with anathema. From which it can be inferred that many more would have consulted human weakness with the remedy of digamy if they had perceived the matter and truth more clearly and had not been so excessively subject to the tyranny, superstition, and traditions of the popes.</p>
      <p>You have, dearest Bullinger, the foundations, causes, and main arguments on which the defenders of digamy rely and want it to be admitted today in certain cases. However, you have not touched on any of these foundations in your refutation, let alone been able to overthrow them; for a good part of them is taken from your own books. Which you yourself will acknowledge and be forced to admit if you remember your little book "On the Unique Eternal Testament," as well as your dialogues against the Anabaptists, where you treat this place: "Lend, hoping for nothing again" [Luke 6:35], what distinction you make between law and sin, how you make three degrees of divine commandments and do not allow a Christian to be judged according to the law (for according to this, all are convicted of sin), but according to grace and faith. Likewise, if you remember this your opinion: Christ did not burden His church, etc. All of which have as much weight and force with me for digamy as they have with you and me as a foundation against the error of the Anabaptists.</p>
      <p>And indeed, these are such solid and strong arguments with me that, even if I wanted to subvert them in favor of monogamy (which I highly cherish), I doubt I would do so with a good conscience. For we can do nothing against conscience and truth. For if I want to judge a man according to the law in the state of innocence inscribed in our minds and declared by Christ in Matthew 5, 6, 7, 19, Luke 6, I will have to, like the Anabaptists, soon consider all men as non-Christians and condemn them who have not yet reached such a high degree of perfection. I am forced to make Christ a more severe legislator than the heavenly Father and Moses were. But where are the scriptures, where is the word of God, where are the infallible foundations on which I can safely rely? But if I establish (which indeed, being conquered by truth, I cannot refuse) that Christ and the apostles are not to be deprived of their function, that they are ministers of grace and spirit, not of the letter, if I contend that a Christian is not to be judged according to the law (which, having been given long ago, constitutes everyone guilty of sin), but according to the gospel, grace, spirit, and faith, I am now compelled, whether I want to or not, to allow a faithful digamist to be a Christian, even if somewhat imperfect in this part, just as you and I and all the pious consider and defend as Christians those who, according to their faith in Christ, are still quite subject to self-love, concupiscence, anger, and similar diseases, who do not give all their possessions to the needy, who lend with the hope of repayment, possess their own, claim their own in judgment, etc.</p>
      <p>But I will stop, lest I be excessive, now intending to weigh your weapons against digamy and indicate their weakness. First, you make a general canon from the words of Christ in Matthew 19 [4-6, 8f] to trample down digamy. Here you achieve as much as the Anabaptists with this saying: "Lend, hoping for nothing again," not rightly understood. Take your own words: "It is an error," you say, "indeed a certain heresy, to stubbornly adhere to words not understood or not rightly understood, not compared with other places of scripture nor considered in circumstances." These are your own words. If you want to observe them, you will stop twisting the words of Christ spoken against the undeserved and perverse divorce of the Jews into undeserved and permissible digamy, you will stop judging Christian digamists from these words ("from the beginning it was not so"). Our most perceptive Zwingli could not elicit anything like this from Christ's words. To whose annotations on the same place I do not hesitate to subscribe. Whom it is also known, while he lived, denied that digamy was prohibited and condemned by divine law. You want us to establish digamy from God's law and the first institution of marriage. This has been done above, and the laws have been indicated, by which it is proven that digamy, like divorce, was granted and allowed by the Lord through Moses, not commanded or prescribed. It will be your task to produce the law that has abrogated and condemned it. Words of Christ thus twisted, but not restored to their genuine sense according to Zwingli's interpretation, will not achieve this.</p>
      <p>You say that God confirmed His primeval law also by deed and practice when He created and joined one wife to one man. And that there should be two, not more, in one flesh, and for the sake of avoiding fornication, each should have his own wife, not his own, etc. I ask, did not God equally join and give many wives to Abraham, Jacob, David, Joash, Elkanah, etc., as He gave one Eve to Adam? Were not the same fathers, indeed, and recently converted to Christianity, digamists with each second wife the same flesh as with the first? Do not Paul's words concern everyone equally? If they were not joined by God and one flesh, they were not true marriages. But scripture teaches otherwise and says that God gave David the wives of his lord. To these words in Genesis 2, Matthew 19, 1 Corinthians 7 apply equally to all.</p>
      <p>As for the first institution of marriage and Christ's words in Matthew 19, I answer you with your own words: "Since the words of Christ, which are written in Matthew 5 and Luke 6, indeed also in Matthew 19 and elsewhere, pertain to the law, we will not allow you Anabaptists to judge Christians from these" (recognize your words). "For if anyone wants to measure us by the law, we will all be found equally sinners and condemned, Romans 3 [23]: 'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.' What is this glory that God desires in us? Namely, that we be holy, pure, and without any blemish, just as God is, who created us in His image. Since we are nothing but flesh and subject to infinite sins, God desires this glory in us. Therefore, a Christian will not be judged according to the law, but according to faith and grace," etc. If you compare all these things, which are more extensively treated in your dialogues, with your declamation against digamy, you will be forced, whether you want to or not, to admit that they are diametrically opposed to each other. Now I would like to hear with which scriptures you can prove and demonstrate to the eye (for we do not admit uncertain and twisted places) that digamy was permitted to certain and particularly named fathers by a special dispensation from God in their age, but among Christians, it is completely and universally abrogated and condemned. You will achieve this at the Greek calends, unless you first make Christ a new legislator and severe exactor, attack the scriptures cited above, and even retract and revoke your own words.</p>
      <p>What reasons can you bring forward as to why digamy, granted to the ancients as a remedy in necessity by God, should not be equally permitted to Christians today who are constrained by similar necessity and suffering from the same weakness?</p>
      <p>If you boast of a more abundant spirit of continence, experience will prove the contrary. Who, without impudence and rashness, would ascribe to Christ that He abolished the remedy of digamy among Christians without any exception of necessity, when it is known that He dispensed with His disciples in necessity even in the violation of the Sabbath and excused David for eating the showbread because of necessity? Where will that saying of His remain: the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath? Where will that: the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath (undoubtedly also of marriage)?</p>
      <p>You want to believe that it never came to the mind of the holy apostle Paul that there would ever be those who would join many wives to one man. What then caused Paul to particularly enjoin bishops and deacons that they should be the husbands of one wife?</p>
      <p>You contend that Christ, the true Messiah, by His coming into the world, restored everything, recalled and renewed the first institution of marriage in His kingdom and doctrine, and proposed it to all His worshippers to be uniquely followed, which we certainly do not hesitate to concede and confess with you; but we add that this was done by Him not in one case of marriage only, but also in all other articles demanding the highest perfection from us, and we admit it in that understanding which you yourself hand over to us in your dialogues against the Anabaptists.</p>
      <p>You think that the companionship of one little wife can suffice for a Christian, that is, a temperate husband. How is it that you make Christians so temperate in this one article and not equally in other articles as well? I ask, does the mere renunciation of digamy make one a Christian and temperate? Were not David, Abraham, Jacob, Elkanah, etc., Christians and temperate? The Anabaptists certainly want us to be such Christians and temperate not only in monogamy but also in all other articles demanding the highest perfection, but they cannot confer the spirit on us by which this is accomplished in us. Moreover, how temperate we are as Christians in this and other cases, experience itself loudly proclaims.</p>
      <p>We certainly confess with you that every Christian is to be elevated in every way to the highest degree of perfection and to the state of innocence. We do not want privileges to be common to all, nor do we abrogate the first law of marriage through them. Conversely, we will not allow privileges and remedies always granted to human weakness to be taken away from us and condemned as illicit through human presumption, superstition, rashness, and constitution.</p>
      <p>You bring against digamy the place of Paul in 1 Corinthians 7 [2]: "Let each have his own wife," and make from an indefinite speech a singular exclusive.</p>
      <p>As for you and others who err in the same chord, you may see to it; I certainly would not dare to permit myself so much. Paul certainly does not mention digamy with a single iota in that place; therefore, it is unjustly twisted here. You equally transgress when you twist his words in Romans 7 [1-3], which he infers through a parable (gleichnishaft) about a woman bound to the law and under the dominion of her husband, into the husband, as if the woman had equal right and dominion over the husband as the husband has over the wife.</p>
      <p>You consider digamists to be people who began in the spirit and now want to be consummated in the flesh. Would that your Swiss, together with ours and us, were such carnal Christians as David, Abraham, Jacob, Elkanah, etc., were! Paul would certainly permit us to be Christians and spiritual and would not so boldly consider us carnal.</p>
      <p>You indicate from Ambrose and Augustine the reasons why many wives were permitted to the ancients, which, as far as the tribe of Judah is concerned, to whom the promises of the coming Messiah were made, may be solid and true, but they do not equally apply to other tribes, to whom we must allow other causes of digamy, those that are legitimate and honest, if they are not to be accused of transgression. For you want Malachi chapter 2 [10-16] to have spoken most properly and simply about this, which you will easily persuade to the deaf and blind who have neither read nor heard that place of Malachi.</p>
      <p>Finally, about to conclude your declamation, you become embittered, angry, and almost threaten, exhorting all the pious to beware of this unfortunate dogma and monstrous abortions. All of which I indeed willingly ascribe to your Christian zeal and love for purity and take it well, although it seems that something human has also happened to you. You have come out in public with your opinion; it is not easy to retreat rashly, nor will you be able to easily conceal the weakness and inconsistency of your arguments from readers with a keen sense of smell.</p>
      <p>You see how much more prudent it would have been for this Camarina not to have been stirred by you, just as many other men, both learned and pious, have abstained from it until now, not without prudent counsel and most weighty reasons, even if they were most hostile to digamy. Indeed, although the deed cannot be undone, I could not omit to write these things privately, friend to friend, not with the intention of contending or publicly stirring up dissension in the churches, but to give you an occasion to think, deliberate, and treat this matter a little more accurately and soberly, lest oil be added to the fire, lest the innocent be rashly condemned, lest a matter almost settled be improperly stirred up again. I do not love logomachies, nor could I, thus provoked by you, keep silent about my and my friends' opinion, of which I have not yet been ashamed nor will be ashamed, unless I am led away from it by better arguments and scriptures than have been heard so far. I can err, I do not want to be a heretic. Therefore, if you have something better, share it candidly, if not, use these with me. Not that we both become digamists, but that we do not rashly condemn it in other Christians without more solid foundations, but rather accept the weak in faith and, even if he is a digamist, consider him no less a Christian and brother because of his faith in Christ than those who, believing in Christ, can never yet ascend to the highest degree of perfection shown in Matthew 5, 6, 7, Luke 6, etc.</p>
      <p>You have, dearest Bullinger, from your friend Lening a friendly letter, but candid without flattery, free without a bite. You, I hope, will take everything equitably and well and will not hesitate to respond with equal candor and freedom and indicate how much it has benefited you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ and diligently greet in my name all your fellow students known and unknown to me.</p>
      <p>Given in Melsungen, a small town in Hesse, on January 16, 1543. Yours most devotedly,</p>
      <p>Johannes Lening, minister of the divine word in Hesse.</p>
      <p>To the man of distinguished learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church in Zurich, his dearest brother in Christ. To be delivered by hand.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God, the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I happened to come across your commentaries on Matthew, my dear Bullinger, where some brothers pointed out to me and presented for reading your opinion and refutation against digamy or polygamy in chapter 19. Which, after I read and considered it diligently, brought me no small discontent and alienation, since I found you (whom I have always highly esteemed, held dear and valuable) so unlike yourself in that place. I wish you had either not touched this sore at all or had undertaken to heal it with stronger, better, and more enduring remedies. For many learned people, who are very favorable and inclined towards you, but unfavorable to digamy, consider you not only too weak in this matter but also contrary to yourself. You think that there are no stronger arguments to approve and defend digamy than the examples of the ancients, which cannot prove anything without clear (unambiguous) divine laws being present. The patriarchs had divine dispensation for their digamy, which is now abolished through Christ and Paul, etc. Hereupon, partly love and high regard for your dignity, partly my conscience and love for truth compel me to answer you, as much as can be done in a friendly letter, and first to show the true foundations and arguments on which those who approve digamy in unavoidable cases through an orderly dispensation build, and then to refute your weapons with which you intend to overthrow such a building, in the good hope that after this my friendly report you will henceforth, if not entirely favorable, be somewhat more inclined to this matter (which you, like other learned people, should have let rest, since it is quite settled) and will not further engage in dealing with it to the detriment and division of the churches.</p>
      <p>Foundations, arguments, and scripture on which those who approve digamy today as well as among the ancients in certain unavoidable cases build and allow through orderly dispensation.</p>
      <p>There is one unique, eternal, immutable God from the beginning of the world, of the ancients as well as ours, ours as well as the ancients. This same unique, immutable God also has only one unique, eternal, immutable, irrevocable law from the beginning to the end of the world, which always and everywhere demands the same from humans, namely all perfection.</p>
      <p>According to such a law, not only public transgressions but also all the good works of the saints are found (considered, judged) as sins and shortcomings before God and His judgment. For they are all unprofitable servants, have all sinned and fall short of the glory that God should have in them [Romans 3:23].</p>
      <p>As far as human and church judgment is concerned, nothing should be considered a sin that God has not expressly forbidden and disapproved through Moses, nothing should be approved and praised that is not also expressly approved and allowed there.</p>
      <p>Christ and His apostles are not new legislators, have never commanded anything that was not previously included in the law of nature and in Moses. They also refer us everywhere to Moses and the ten commandments. The law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Christ. Paul had no command or prohibition of the Lord concerning virginity (undoubtedly also concerning digamy), but he gave his faithful advice. He did not want to put a snare on anyone, since everyone has their own gift, one this, the other that.</p>
      <p>We are with the ancients and the ancients with us one people of God, one community and church, have one Christ, one faith, one baptism, one unique, eternal testament, one law, the same promises and ways to salvation. And what did not take away the faith of the ancients in Christ, that will not be able to take away ours either. What was allowed to the ancients for their faith and not imputed as sin, that is also allowed to us and has no human or angelic power to abolish and impute as sin.</p>
      <p>The state of marriage is rightly and well ordained in paradise between two for the sake of companionship and offspring alone, and whoever can keep himself closest to such an institution and order does best, his marriage is also most pleasing and praiseworthy to God, to which all people should be directed with the utmost diligence.</p>
      <p>However, one must not make a divine command out of the words of Adam and a mere speech and recitation, judge the human race after Adam's fall and after the intrusion of disordered fleshly desires not according to the first institution of marriage in the state of innocence, but according to the law of Moses and the Decalogue, otherwise not only digamists but also all monogamists who know their wives to avoid unchastity and fornication would be condemned. For such a cause was not in paradise, since disordered desire had not yet crept in.</p>
      <p>But that digamy is not prohibited or condemned in the law of Moses, but allowed by God as a remedy for human weakness and frailty, is clear to prove and conclude from the laws of Moses Deuteronomy 21 [10-17] concerning one who wants to take a captive in war as a wife, likewise when one has two wives, how he should behave towards the children in the division of inheritance, etc. So there were digamists before the law in the time of the patriarchs, under the law, and later under the gospel, never reproved or condemned by God, the prophets, or the apostles. They are not accustomed to overlook any sin and transgression of God's law.</p>
      <p>One reads of David that he was a man after God's heart, did right in the eyes of the Lord, never departed from God's commandments, except in the matter with Uriah's wife. Likewise of Joash, that he did right before God during the life of Jehoiada the priest, who himself had given him two wives.</p>
      <p>One should not consider the apostles so negligent and simple that they should not have prohibited and condemned digamy as expressly (since it was in use before their eyes at that time among Jews and Gentiles) as other public and hidden vices. At least Paul would have said: "Let every Christian henceforth be the husband of one wife," as he said more than once: "Let a bishop be the husband of one wife," which particular command was indeed unnecessary for him if digamy had already been abolished and prohibited among all Christians without any exception by Christ and the apostles.</p>
      <p>Christ and Paul not only point us to the highest perfection in Matthew 19 and 1 Corinthians 7, but also in Matthew 5, 6, 7, and elsewhere, not only in one but also in all the articles mentioned in the aforementioned chapters, according to which we are also always obliged to strive and encourage everyone to do so. However, they do not make new laws, nor do they change or abolish divine laws. Moreover, they do not take away from the poor weak Christians (who cannot reach perfection) the remedies and medicines that the heavenly Father has left to the ancients, for this was not their office. For equal diseases always require equal remedies.</p>
      <p>There have always been and will always be many found (found, encountered) who cannot reach the perfection of paradise and the divine law, Matthew 5, 6, 7, 19, Luke 6, and elsewhere indicated, but remain and are weak, imperfect Christians, are burdened with self-love, with desire, with anger, possess their own goods, have their own servants, lend for gain, do not give to everyone who asks them, do not let the cloak go for the coat, demand their own in court, know their only wives not only for the sake of offspring, which alone was an essential cause of marriage in paradise, but also to remedy unchastity. In these and many similar human failings, one can well dispense, see divine indulgence and grace, leave many Christians to be and remain, provided they believe in Christ, recognize their shortcomings, consider themselves obliged to strive for perfection, and strive for it according to the grace and ability granted. Now, since digamy is nowhere expressly prohibited, was in use before the law, under the law, under the gospel, among believers as well as unbelievers, did not take away anyone's faith, why then should a believer not also use it in cases of necessity and still remain a Christian? Why should we not also see divine dispensation, indulgence, and grace here as in the aforementioned failings?</p>
      <p>What God has not commanded or prohibited with clear, bright words in His law and ten commandments, praised or condemned (as far as salvation and conscience are concerned), no human has the power to command, prohibit, or condemn, much less than Christ and His apostles, who never undertook it.</p>
      <p>But that digamy has been so completely abolished, considered unworthy and unchristian among Christians, has come from misunderstanding the words of Christ in Matthew 19 [4-6, 8f] and Paul in 1 Corinthians 7 [2], which have been drawn against digamy, although they do not mention it at the mentioned places.</p>
      <p>It has also flowed from the misunderstanding that one has made a new legislator out of Christ, a new law out of the gospel, two peoples, two churches, two testaments out of us and the ancients.</p>
      <p>Christ came with the fullness of divine grace as a savior, physician, and helper, not as a tyrant who would be stricter than His Father, but as one who would not extinguish the smoldering wick and would not want to burden His church, but rather lighten and redeem it.</p>
      <p>Not only did the apostles baptize digamists in their time and let them remain so, but also in the time of Boniface, Pope Gregory dispensed with the Germans. Now, against God's command, no human dispensation is valid. Just as the apostles and Boniface did not tolerate and forgive adultery, fornication, sodomy, etc., among those whom they converted to faith and baptized through the true preaching of repentance and forgiveness of sins in the name of Christ, so they would not have tolerated and forgiven digamy if it were to be considered as equal, disapproved, and equally abolished and condemned henceforth as the aforementioned and similar vices. Or they would have at least said that the same digamists should be granted it at that time because of the present situation and necessity, but henceforth it should not be allowed to anyone among Christians.</p>
      <p>There have always been such cases and causes of digamy among Christians as among the ancients, to whom one could have helped and advised with digamy, to prevent much adultery, fornication, vice, and disorder. There were also not the same causes of digamy among the ancients: with Abraham the barrenness of Sarah, with Jacob the deceit of Laban, the love for Rachel, the emulation of both sisters, with David, Gideon, Elkanah, Joash, etc., many others.</p>
      <p>Now that the clear light of divine truth has come to light, digamy can still be allowed today in cases of necessity (of which many occur daily as among the ancients) through an orderly dispensation to those in whom one can perceive a truly godly life and improvement in other articles.</p>
      <p>One should not make a common law and permission out of digamy; it is also not to be tolerated that it should be so completely abolished among all Christians without any divine command, without any exception, by humans, since one can help and advise many good-hearted people with it, who are otherwise caused to many sins and vices by its abolition and denial. The common intrusion and abuse are also not to be feared so much, as it did not happen so much in the past, for it is not everyone's food. And although some may behave willfully in this, they will receive their judgment and reward. This cannot take away from the good-hearted their remedy and freedom granted by God. Those who have to dispense in this matter will take good care and caution that willfulness and fleshly intent are restrained and prevented.</p>
      <p>In the abbot of Urspergensis and other chronicles, examples of some Christian emperors and kings are found who were digamists and were not reproved by any righteous bishop. One also reads nowhere that the serious and zealous Ambrose ever reproved Valentinian for his digamy, who nevertheless rebuked and excommunicated Theodosius so vehemently for his outrage.</p>
      <p>These are, my dear Bullinger, the scriptures (biblical references), foundations, arguments, and causes on which those who consider digamy permissible in unavoidable cases through an orderly dispensation at this time build.</p>
      <p>Now you have not touched on any of these foundations in your refutation, let alone should you have overturned them; for the greater part of them are taken from your own books. Which you yourself must confess if you remember your little book "On the Unique Eternal Testament," likewise your dialogues against the Anabaptists, how you treat there the place: "Lend, hoping for nothing again" [Luke 6:35], what distinction you make between the law and sin, and how you make three degrees of divine commandments and do not want Christians to be judged according to the law (for according to the law we are all sinners), but according to grace and faith. All these your foundations and arguments have just as much force with me for digamy as they have against the opinion of the Anabaptists. And indeed, all the aforementioned foundations and arguments are invincible with me; although I would like to break something off for the benefit of monogamy and against digamy, I do not know how to do it with a good conscience. For if I want to judge a man according to the law, as it is inscribed in the state of innocence, declared by Christ in Matthew 5, 6, 7, Luke 6, etc., I must, like the Anabaptists, condemn all men who do not reach such perfection and judge them as non-Christians. I must make Christ a stricter legislator than the Father and Moses were. But where do I have scripture, where are the foundations?</p>
      <p>But if I let Christ and the apostles have their office, make them ministers of the spirit and not of the letter, if I do not want to judge and judge the Christian according to the law (which has long been given, has closed everyone under sin), but according to grace and spirit, then I must indeed let the faithful digamist remain a Christian (although this is somewhat imperfect), just as you and I certainly also defend and defend against the Anabaptists those who, besides their faith in Christ, are still burdened with desire and anger, lend for gain, possess their own goods, demand their own in court, etc.</p>
      <p>Now, so that I do not make it too long, I want to take your refutation, to show you your weak foundations.</p>
      <p>You take the saying of Christ in Matthew 19 [8]: "From the beginning it was not so," to abolish and condemn digamy among Christians, regardless of what Christ is dealing with in that place, on what kind of question He answers. And if you only look at our master's Zwingli's annotations in that place, you will achieve as much with these extracted, forced words against digamy as some learned people in our time have been able to achieve with the mere extracted words "this is my body" [Mt 26, 26 par.] against all other scripture, that the true body of Christ is bodily in the bread. As if I could still show you living people who have heard from Zwingli's mouth that one cannot condemn digamy with God's word.</p>
      <p>You do not want to have enough of the examples of the fathers, you insist on divine laws; you have heard that above. But that you want to make an imperative out of the words of Adam in paradise, from an oration indicativa, and reject digamy through it, will fail you.</p>
      <p>But tell me, did not God equally join and give many wives to Abraham, Jacob, David, Joash, Elkanah, Gideon, etc., as He gave one Eve to Adam? Or were these holy fathers not equally one flesh with their second wife as with their first? If they are not one flesh, then it was not marriage, but fornication. But the scripture says that God gave David the wives of his lord into his bosom. So it also admits that they were wives and not concubines.</p>
      <p>Tell me, do the words in paradise Gen. 2, Matt. 19, 1 Cor. 7 not apply equally to the ancients as to us, not equally to the digamists in the time of the apostles as to us.</p>
      <p>With what will you prove that the ancients had a special divine dispensation for their digamy, which is abolished among Christians? It can be said, but in proving it, you will fail far, unless you not only make Christ a new legislator, a strict exactor, and attack the above-cited scripture, but also revoke your own words, where you say that Christ did not want to burden the church.</p>
      <p>Why should the ancients have had divine dispensation for their weakness and necessity, and we not also have it in the same case? How should Christ have abolished digamy (which is nowhere previously condemned or prohibited with express words), who nevertheless dispensed with His disciples in necessity concerning the Sabbath and with David concerning the showbread against public prohibitions and commands and excused them, saying that the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath?</p>
      <p>You want to believe that Paul never thought that there would ever arise those who would give many wives to one man. What then caused Paul to particularly prohibit this to bishops and deacons?</p>
      <p>You want to believe that Christ, the true Messiah, restored everything to its origin by His coming into the world; we also confess that, but not of digamy alone, but also in all other articles mentioned in Matthew 5, 6, 7, Luke 6, and in the understanding that you yourself present in your dialogues against the Anabaptists.</p>
      <p>You think that the companionship of one wife can be enough for a Christian, that is, a temperate man. Why do you not make Christians equally temperate in other articles? Were not Abraham, David, etc., also Christians, that is, temperate men? Why do you not see that experience teaches the opposite? The Anabaptists want us to be such temperate Christians not only in digamy but also in all other commandments and articles, but they cannot give us the spirit for it. So experience teaches how temperate Christians we are.</p>
      <p>We say with you that everyone should be directed to perfection and the first institution in all articles, do not want to assign privileges to everyone in common, nor do we abolish the divine, written laws given through Moses through the privileges. But we also do not want to let the privileges, always granted by God, be taken away from us through human presumption and own command.</p>
      <p>You cite Paul 1 Corinthians 7 [2] against digamy: "Let each have his own wife," make from an indefinite speech an exclusive or singular speech, which is not fitting for a learned man. It is well known what Paul is dealing with in that place; read your Zwingli. You also cite Paul Romans 7 [1-3] against the man, although he only says there about the woman that she is bound to the law as long as the man lives, et non econverso (and not vice versa).</p>
      <p>You consider digamists as those who began in the spirit and now want to be consummated in the flesh. We would gladly grant you, you should also wish yourself that your Swiss were such fleshly people as Abraham, Jacob, David, and other kings and judges were. And oh that God would, there were many such digamists as these were; Paul would certainly let them remain spiritual and not consider them carnal as you do.</p>
      <p>You indicate from Ambrose and Augustine the reason why many wives were permitted to the ancients. I now let that apply to the tribe of Judah, to whom the promise of the coming Messiah was made. But in other tribes, the reasons will not have a place; otherwise, one cannot excuse Gideon, Elkanah, etc., in their digamy. You also cite Malachi 2 [10-16] against digamy. That may apply to the blind and deaf who have never read or heard Malachi.</p>
      <p>At the end of your refutation, you almost become embittered against the defenders of digamy, threaten and rage, warn everyone against the "unfortunate dogma" and "monstrous abortions," all of which I indeed ascribe to your Christian zeal and love for decency and take it well, but I cannot help but think that you have mixed something human into it.</p>
      <p>You have come out in print, cannot easily turn back, and will hardly be able to conceal your own inconsistency and awkwardness from the sharp-sighted readers of your writings. You should have rightly held back and let the dog sleep, as many other highly learned people have done at this time for very important reasons, who are as opposed to digamy as you can ever be. You could also have written to me or some others who are well known to you and involved in this matter beforehand, asked for a good report, and not come out in print so untimely, from which the division of the churches could well result.</p>
      <p>For I certainly have no fear of this opinion, nor do I know how to deviate from it, unless I am shown better scriptures, foundations, and arguments. If you now have better foundations and love me, write them to me; if not, follow me, not that we become digamists, but that we do not reject or condemn them, we have better foundations than have been heard so far, and let the weak digamists remain Christians, just as we let those remain Christians who have not yet reached the high degree of divine law Matthew 5, 6, 7, Luke 6, etc.</p>
