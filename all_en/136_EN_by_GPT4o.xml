      <p>Friendly dear lord and old, faithful dear brother and friend, I must not withhold from you in my pressing need the common concern of mine and the church entrusted to me. Firstly, the Emperor, at the insistent and malicious urging of the priests, has sent a document to the estates of the empire, which is called the Interim, on how peace should be maintained in the empire here between the council, which document has been delivered to me along with my brothers, so that we should examine it and then report our opinion to an honorable council.</p>
      <p>Now I have spent an entire day reading it with my dear brothers and want to show you, as much as possible, the summary. Firstly, the Emperor in this document admonishes and requests all priests and their followers to remain steadfast in their religion and not to deviate from it, note. Secondly, that we, the evangelicals (thus the Emperor earnestly demands), should return to the general church. But if not, that we should adhere to the proposed Interim and we preachers should not teach, speak, or preach against it, but uphold it. Then the Emperor has set in this Interim the article on the fall of man, on free will, on justification, good works, could not be better, on the church, its authority, he begins to limp to the devil, sets seven sacraments, in the sacrament of the altar the transubstantiation with expressed words, the adoration, the setting up of the little house, he wants to have carried around, the imperial pope and papal emperor, the intercession of the saints, vigils, the soul masses, banners, candles, idols, fasting, eating meat, invocation of the saints, the prayer for the dead, and says freely with... the words in the article on the memory of the dead, in the mass we remember the dead saints, whom the church believes have died in the Christian faith, but it is not yet certain whether they are completely purified or not. In summary: you have never read anything more shameless. This Interim has been accepted by Margrave Joachim, Elector of Brandenburg, and the Count Palatine, the Elector, but Duke Maurice, Elector of Saxony, ubi diis placuerit, Margrave Hans of Brandenburg, Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, and the Duke of Zweibrücken have protested against it, the honorable free and imperial cities have not wanted to accept the Interim, but have asked their superiors and communities to bring it behind them, which the Emperor has reluctantly granted, giving them 12 days. Upon this, the matter rests. You have hereby the true basis of the whole transaction, upon which you may confidently rely. Now I am waiting to see how my lords of Memmingen and an honorable community will hold; if they were to accept this godless writing, I could not in good conscience remain with them (since the Interim requires that at least six masses be held daily in Memmingen).</p>
      <p>Therefore, my whole friendly request to you is, for Christ's sake and out of common love, if the matter cannot be improved with us by God's counsel, that I might have a refuge with you, considering that I have been with you in your tribulation and have truly risked it, and would gladly remain with you further, and that I have shown all loyalty and love to the dear Confederates who have been in our vicinity in Memmingen, which I then hoped to enjoy. I thank God I owe no one anything, I might still be able to support myself for a year or two from my own, over my honorable household goods, bedding, silverware, clothes, and small items and other household goods and books, which God has granted me, to this God has given me a pious, friendly, and peaceful housewife, who would not do anyone the slightest wrong. I have, in summary, lived according to your liking. Therefore, I desire nothing more than that I might have a Christian place with yours, in the city or in the country, but if I could not have a refuge with you in the city or country, which I do not hope, you would consider giving me a recommendation to Basel, or whatever your Christian counsel may befit me, I would gladly be with no one more than with my lords of Zurich to spend my remaining old age. Now you should know this about me, that I will not leave my church in Memmingen without unavoidable reasons. But to defend, confirm, and praise the shameful Interim with my preaching, as the papal emperor demands in his interim, I know before God, my conscience, and all the pious not to answer for. Therefore, do not withhold your help and counsel from me, as I trust you in all Christian love, and write to me as soon as you can. May the dear God protect your dear church, city, country, and you from such an Interim and the papal emperor. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet your dear wife and children along with all dear lords and brothers who fight with us in the vineyard of God.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, 26th of May, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Scholasticus in the Lord, your true friend.</p>
      <p>To the pious, Christian, well-learned lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the church in Zurich, my dear lord and especially good friend, to be delivered. Zurich.</p>
