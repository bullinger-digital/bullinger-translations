      <p>S. I wrote through the wife of a certain citizen, who, having set out for Zurzach, promised to take care of the letters to the house of Mr. Heinrich Lochmann. If you have received them, I ask you to let me know. For I would not want them or those attached to them to be lost.</p>
      <p>From Bern and elsewhere, I hear that the most serious discord is clashing between the republics of Geneva and Bern, and indeed it is all the more pernicious because the term set for the alliance is in February of the next year, so it is to be feared that it will not be renewed with the spirits on both sides so embittered. This has resulted in the recent visit of Bernese envoys to Geneva on some business, where they were received with less favor than ever before, to the extent that they were not even greeted by most. I conjecture that this happens because the exiled Genevans, due to the tumult, have filled the minds of many with suspicions through complaints in Bern, which are reciprocated from the other side. Calvin is excessively burdened, as the blame for almost all the evils is attributed to him. Such is the power of Satan, distinguishing his enemy with his usual artifice and stratagem. Therefore, all good men must seriously be vigilant, so that they may contribute all their efforts to calm the indignation conceived on both sides, and in my judgment, the Bernese brothers have acted rightly if they seriously advise their magistrate to bear the weakness of others, to foster civil and Christian union, to notice and beware of the devil's cunning: for if he succeeds in dissolving the confederation of these two most famous cities, he will certainly have accomplished not a little in causing horrible scandals and inflicting incurable wounds on the church of God. Meanwhile, let us pray to the Lord. Farewell, as the messenger is in haste. Basel, September 3, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and fellow minister.</p>
