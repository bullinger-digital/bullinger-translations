    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius likes Bullinger's [„Brevis ἀντιβολή“] as much as the previous book [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“]; he had never seen a writing by Cochläus against Bullinger, but recently received a copy of the [„Replica brevis“], which belongs to the Englishman [John] Butler, for forwarding to Konstanz, and found it full of nonsense; the old [Cochläus] should join the [deceased] Eck, Fabri, and their ilk! - Myconius has not yet seen Luther's [„Kurtz bekentnis“]; in Basel, there were three copies: one with [Johannes] Gast, who forwarded it but will demand it back; another with a citizen [...], whose son [Johann Jakob Wecker or Philipp Bächi] sent it from Wittenberg; the third with the [council]men, who made it disappear after reading it. Myconius also wrote to Strasbourg and received [from Simon Steiner] the reply that there was only one copy there. No one likes the book. In Swabia, Luther is said to have even lost followers. Luther's condemnation of good and learned men is particularly offensive. - Myconius once again presented his view of the Lord's Supper based on the [Basel] Confession [of 1534] in the Christmas sermon [of 1544]. - He does not know what Bullinger says about the Basel delegation; everything outside the church's domain was secretly discussed by the Basel council: Disobedient [mercenaries] are to be punished with imprisonment and fines; to be allowed to participate in the Lord's Supper again, they must make a confession of guilt before the church congregation; if they refuse, they are to be reported to the authorities. - [Charles V.] plagues [the Baselers] with his summons [to the Reichstag], against which they have so far defended themselves based on the [Swiss] Confederation, and particularly threatens the Baselers with war. The Emperor would prefer to achieve a victory over the Confederates than over [Sultan Suleiman I.]. Only the latter and the convening of a council could delay Charles's actions against the Confederation. From Konstanz and Alsace, he demands the accommodation of part of his Spanish troops. A Confederate heard councilmen from Schlettstadt express that the Emperor does not like to march against the Turks while leaving the undefeated Confederates behind him. - If Gast had not preceded him, Myconius would have informed Bullinger about the Reichstag. - The furrier [Josua], son of Bullinger's brother [Johannes Reinhart], was with Myconius looking for a master; someone [...] promised him an income if he went to Strasbourg. Myconius warned him against rashness, offered him a place to stay overnight, which was declined, and has heard nothing from him since. - Regards to the family, to [Konrad] Pellikan, and Theodor [Bibliander].</p>

      <p>S. The book you sent me as a gift pleases me as much as the previous one you gave. I offer you eternal thanks; this is all I can do, as I lack the means to repay you, although my spirit is ready to serve you in every way possible. I have never seen anything by Cochläus against you. About ten days ago, I was dining with some good men, among whom was one who said: "There is a booklet by Cochläus against Bullinger in my house, which belongs to the Englishman Butler; if only there were a messenger going to Konstanz, so I could return to the Englishman what is his!" I immediately said: "You will entrust the booklet to me; I know a messenger." However, I said this only to see what he had against you. The booklet was given to me; I looked into it and saw an opponent raving excessively; for I found him still clinging to the intercession of saints; such people I am compelled to judge as miserable. A learned theologian, old, and experienced even in writing, still clings to the smallest elements of Christian wisdom. Let him soon go to Eck, Fabri, and the other learned and holy men of the same ilk.</p>
      <p>I have not yet even seen the outside of Luther's booklet, about which the whole world clamors. There were three copies here; one was with Gastius, who, in this matter, is not a faithful deacon, but soon let it go. Similarly, a certain citizen, whose son is in Wittenberg, said he did the same, having sent it. The third came into the hands of the councilmen, who, after it was read, cast it into darkness, and ensured that any future copies that arrive here are brought to the senate. I sent to the people of Strasbourg and asked for the booklet for the third time, but in vain; for they wrote back and solemnly swore that there was only one copy in the entire city. I thought to myself: "Perhaps it is fated that this booklet does not come to you." Similarly, I complained three or four days ago to Gastius. He said he would demand his back. Then, if the Lord wills, and it seems right to me. Therefore, I can only judge that writing as I hear. I have not yet heard anyone who likes it; they say there are some in Swabia who, while they have stood by Luther until now, have now completely defected from him. Everyone I know exclaims: "Oh, cruelty, oh recklessness, oh madness!"; they refer to the audacity of judging and condemning good, learned, and holy men, who have labored equally in restoring Christianity as Luther himself. Regarding the argument of the Eucharist, all those I have heard so far have remained silent; therefore, I cannot say what they think.</p>
      <p>I publicly presented my opinion again on the day of the Lord's Nativity from the printed Confession of our church; the opinion stands by the Lord to remain, as it seems to plainly express the mind of the Lord Jesus; if I err, I pray the Lord pardons the errant, not the obstinate; for from the words of the Lord, to the best of my ability, I cannot do otherwise. However, I know that if there is an error, I will find pardon, since, while I err, let it be, I err from the words of Christ received with simple faith.</p>
      <p>I do not know what you say about the Basel delegation; everything outside the church is conducted secretly from us. However, it is certain: Our magistrate has punished all his disobedient subjects with imprisonment and fines; and the lowest, besides custody, was forced to give 3 florins; if he did not have them, he was compelled in captivity to pay by using only bread and water for certain days. Furthermore, because they also abandoned the church, excommunicating themselves, it was imposed that if they wish to use the sacred communion of the Lord's Supper, they must first reconcile with the church, freely confessing their sin, and proving their sorrow of mind and promising just obedience to the lords and the church in the future.</p>
      <p>But if they prefer to despise the supper, so as to evade reconciliation, we will commend them to the authorities, who will treat them according to their law; for it does not touch what is not its own.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Emperor gravely vexes us with his summons, against which we have so far resisted because of the confederation, and threats fly through the empire, especially through the whole neighborhood of the Baselers, to be compelled to obedience by war. I judge the mind of this man as I have learned for almost thirty years: He desires to subdue Switzerland, which has been untamed by him until now. Indeed, I am persuaded he desires that praise more than victory over the Turk. He has an opportunity today, such as he will hardly find again, no matter how much the savagery of the Turk and the institution of a council, true or fictitious, may delay him. Therefore, unless the Lord hinders, he will try to satisfy his purpose. He asked the people of Konstanz (as you know) to receive part of the Spanish troops into their city; he asks the same of our neighbors in Alsace, or at least they fear it will soon be asked (for so they complain). For what purpose, unless to satisfy the aforementioned plan? Setting out against the Turks, it does not please him to leave the Swiss Turks behind him.</p>
      <p>With these words, the leaders of Sélestat spoke before a Swiss man, whom they did not know to be Swiss. Thus, everything is full of disturbances, dissensions, and threats. Come, our sins deserve even graver things. May the Lord mercifully look upon his own.</p>
      <p>If Gastius had not preceded me, I would have informed you about the Reichstag. Your brother's son, the furrier, was with me, looking for a master; when he could not find one in the whole city, someone unknown promised him expenses if he would go with him to Strasbourg. After I warned him not to do anything rashly, he left with the intention of entrusting me with letters to you. But what happened, I do not know; I have not seen him since. He certainly did a favor by visiting me. I invited him to stay with me for the night; but he refused because of his companion. May the Lord protect him and grant us all his Holy Spirit, so that, understanding what is his, we may diligently follow to the glory of God.</p>
      <p>Amen. Farewell with your household, to Lord Pellican and Lord Theodor in Christ always.</p>
      <p>Basel, January, in the year 1545. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zurich, his most venerable lord. Zurich.</p>
