      <p>Greetings. I have only received your letters and I am responding to our Vergerio. However, regarding what he writes about the fifty crowns, I have indeed heard nothing of it before; but I will take care of it immediately after my arrival in Solothurn and will do it by another means than through your efforts, for this is hardly appropriate nor reasonable due to your office. Your lord consul will tell you in order, in what state our affairs and yours have been here. It has almost come to quarrels; therefore, I ask and beseech you to look after the public peace and to forgive the ignorance of others. Believe me, you will accomplish more in this way in a short time. As for the rest, which I hardly dare to commit to writing, the lord consul will tell you; for I have dealt with him and the lord secretary on many matters. You will hear our news from them. Farewell, most excellent man. Baden, the tenth of September.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassafontaneus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
