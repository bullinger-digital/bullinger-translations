    <p xml:id="regest1">Thank God, Bullinger and his family are doing well, as are Frey and his own!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Firstly, there is a man, secondly his mother, thirdly the mother's brother, and fourthly the daughter of the brother. According to Leviticus 18, the man is allowed to marry that daughter [his cousin], but not the daughter of his [deceased] wife's sister, even though the man seems to be in the same degree of kinship with his wife as with his mother, and the wife's sister does not seem to be more closely related to the man than he is to his uncle. So, we have 1. the man, 2. the man's mother, 3. the maternal uncle, 4. the uncle's daughter. In contrast, 1. the man, 2. the man's wife, 3. the wife's sister, 4. the daughter of this sister.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Given the same degree of kinship between cousin and niece, Frey wondered why it is not allowed to marry a sister-in-law's daughter. For this is allowed with an uncle's daughter despite their blood relationship.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">In the course of diligent research, Frey realized that a man is not as closely related to his mother as to his wife. For while in the first case mother and son are separated by a degree of kinship, this is not the case between husband and wife. Through a schematic representation, it became clear to him that contrary to his previous opinion, the niece is more closely related to the man, as he forms one body with his wife. Consequently, Frey does not want to bother Bullinger with this matter any longer, unless he believes that Frey is wrong in his explanation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings, also from Frey's wife [N.N.]. They both send their regards to Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler] and the children, as well as to Rudolf Gwalther, Johannes Haller, Johannes Fries, and Theodor Bibliander. Bullinger should remain favorably disposed towards Frey.</p>

      <p>S.D.P. I greatly rejoice that you and yours are well, dearest father. I and mine are also very well, by the grace of God.</p>

      <p>What troubled me was this: A man (in whom I placed the first rank or person) can have the daughter of his mother's brother, that is, his uncle's daughter (who was the third person to me), as his wife, who seemed to be the fourth person from the man. However, he cannot marry the daughter of his wife's sister (whom I considered as distant from the man as the uncle), that is, the sister-in-law's daughter. And, to make clearer what I thought, I arranged it thus: 1. the man, 2. his mother, 3. the mother's brother or uncle, 4. the uncle's daughter. Again, 1. the man, 2. the man's wife, 3. the wife's sister, 4. the sister's daughter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Now, because the uncle's daughter and the sister-in-law's daughter seemed to me to be separated from the man by equal distances, I wondered how it was that the uncle's daughter was permitted, but the sister-in-law's daughter was prohibited, especially since the latter was only related to the man by affinity, while the former was related by blood.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Now, after diligent inquiry, I saw that the wife is not removed from the man by the same distance as the man's mother, and that the mother is indeed counted a degree from the man, but not the man's wife. Therefore, when I depict it thus: I see that the wife, being part of the same body, is closer in degree to the man than I had believed. If you think I have understood the matter correctly, I will cease to trouble you. If not, I wish to be taught again.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>All of ours greet you. You will convey greetings from me and my wife to your wife and children and the whole family, as well as to Rudolf Gwalther, Johannes Haller, Johannes Fries, Theodor Bibliander, and others. Farewell and love me, as you are accustomed. Biel/Bienne, 13th day before the Kalends of February 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. Zürich.</p>
