    <p xml:id="regest1">He expected a more detailed response from Bullinger to his letters. What is suspected in Zurich about the visit of the Schultheiß Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl to France is not true. The Schultheiß was not supposed to seek help there, but merely to secure the guarantee of the previously promised peace. Jean Jacques Farel is imprisoned. He has already reported to Bullinger about the conditions in Bern, especially about the case of the treasurer Bernhard Tillmann. Hans von Erlach, Anthoni Spillmann, Niklaus von Graffenried, and Sebastian von Diesbach are involved in a bribery affair: Some Savoyards had, with partial success, tried to bribe these politicians with money to prevent the naturalization of a compatriot, Philibert de Compois, Lord of Thorens, who sought to litigate against them with Bern's help over lost property. There is also talk of treason in the Second Kappel War. A total of six councilors are now missing; and those who follow are either aged papal supporters or young hotheads. They hear from the printer about Bullinger's commentary on the Peter letters. Bullinger has not sent the promised lectures of Bibliander on the prophets. In Geneva, Guillaume Farel preaches publicly. A Bernese delegation is there because of Geneva's war debt. The Bernese students performed the "Acolastus" by Gnaphaeus. Haller, on behalf of Anton Noll, asks Bullinger to admonish his son Sebastian, who is staying in Zurich, to change his way of life.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Beloved Heinrich, I had expected other letters in which you would write me a response to mine. Since this has not happened, perhaps due to your business - I do not attribute it to forgetfulness - I will nevertheless respond to your very brief writing.</p>
      <p>The talk about the Frenchman and our Schultheiß is not true. I have informed you about this matter long ago, if you have not forgotten the letters. We seek help from no one who does not acknowledge our faith. But we desire that the peace, which was promised to us long ago, be maintained; this has been promised to us again. The burning is entirely fabricated. Farell's brother is imprisoned by the king, and our lords have sent a letter to the king, which was received and answered by his chancellor. However, the consul was received and dispatched with high honors, completing his journey in 18 days.</p>
      <p>I have also written to you in part about the situation here, especially the case of the treasurer. A Savoyard lord wanted to become a citizen here so that he could seek justice against some nobles, also Savoyards, who had taken his castles. These nobles, with gifts, tried to prevent the citizenship and bribed the consul of Erlach. He rejected the offer so firmly that the offerer barely escaped from his house. Then he approached the pandaret Ludion with 10 crowns. When he also refused, the scoundrel left 10 crowns in the house's courtyard. When Ludion found them, he immediately offered four pandarets to protect his honor. They decided that he should immediately return the gifts with his own messenger, which he did. Thus, he redeemed his reputation. Through his integrity, the magistrate discovered the fraud.</p>
      <p>The third in order was the pandaret Graffenried, who also, although attentive to the matter, refused. However, when the offer was made to his wife and she accepted, he remained silent. Thus, he became infamous for the rest of his life. The fourth consul was Diesbach, a man otherwise not badly inclined. When his servant offered him 10 crowns as he was entering his bed and did not state the reason, but said his master would explain the next day, the consul accepted, even though he was on a mission to Freiburg the next morning. However, upon returning and meeting the master, he inquired about the reason for sending the money. When he explained, he offered to return it, even though he did not have it with him, and since he did not do so immediately nor reveal it, but entrusted it to his wife to return, he also became infamous. This is our tragedy, about which many say much.</p>
      <p>There are also other things said about some treason in our calamitous war. Since they have not yet come to light, I cannot write to you about them. We are now missing 5 senators. The sixth is entirely infirm, the rest are young, and we do not have anyone who can safely succeed them. For they are either old but papal supporters, or young hotheads and less prudent. You should pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>What our institution is, the envoys will report. I know nothing of these things. How they are doing, I do not know. But I suspect that your people often deceive you.</p>
      <p>You have carnival and good cheer with you, and the peace that the world gives, many embrace. In the meantime, I do not despair of you, as long as through you and your colleagues and the word of the Lord and studies have so much place and authority. With us, it is as the parable in Matthew 13 [3-8, 18-23] about the sower shows.</p>
      <p>The printer writes to us (not received) about your annotations on Peter's letters, but you say nothing, only about the Corinthians once. You send nothing about Theodor's judgment on the prophets, although you promised much. In short, I am disappointed. You write a short letter, where I expected much else with such a message.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, Farel preaches publicly, but in the houses. Our lords' envoys, 4 from the council and citizens, have been there since the first of January until this day because of the pay for the Geneva war, and they are still not paid. There is great unrest there.</p>
      <p>Our youth performed the comedy Acolastus before the Swiss envoys. Your people will report on this. Thus, I write a long chatter, wishing that you knew all things. But you settle it with 4 lines.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I wonder if Pelican and Leo are alive. I greet them through you so often, but they offer no greetings. Meanwhile, Leo writes here often and sends booklets, but does not deem me worthy of a single jot.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>26th of February around 2 in the night.</p>
      <p>Just a little after I wrote to you, only so that you understand me.</p>
      <p>Farewell again with your wife and children and always love me as your most devoted.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>Anthony Noll, a pious man, has with you a son, a locksmith's apprentice, named Sebastian Noll. As it is said, he squanders everything disgracefully and burdens himself with debt. The father asks you to admonish him with your words and secretly, so that he may conduct himself differently and repent, not relying on his father's purse. If he does not do so, he will deny him all help in the future. The son is not born of a legitimate marriage. He has urged me to impose this on you, whom he believes can do everything. Therefore, inquire and act, so that you respond to the father's letters, lest that man believes I have neglected what he so earnestly requested.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>We expected Röst and Ran from you. They would have been most welcome to us and, in our judgment, most suitable for reconciling the cities. But we were disappointed in our hope. The Christian cities go around each other like a cat around the hot porridge; they grieve and say nothing to each other about what is on their hearts.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned ecclesiastic among the Zurichers, his uniquely esteemed brother.</p>
