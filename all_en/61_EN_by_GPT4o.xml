    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger should take up the cause of the bearer of the letter, Pastor Itelhans Bertz from Romanshorn, who is being treated very poorly by Antronius [Abbot Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee of St. Gallen]. The reason for this could not be discovered by the [responsible] Thurgau governor Leonhard Holzhalb up to this day. When Bertz was recently with Vadian in St. Gallen, the abbot ordered his arrest, set up armed guards for this purpose, and blocked the roads so that he could not escape! When Vadian and Bertz learned of this, they thwarted the abbot's plan and his henchmen with a clever ruse. While the posted men kept watch late into the night, Pastor Bertz safely returned to his own the next day via a detour. Since then, he is nowhere safe in the abbot's territory! It would probably be best if Bertz, with the help of Governor Holzhalb, summoned the abbot to settle the case at one of the next Baden Diets. For the abbot seems to want to delay the whole matter until the inauguration of the next Thurgau governor [Niklaus Cloos from Lucerne]. Bullinger should therefore ensure that the righteous man is helped in Zurich so that he does not have to go into exile due to the slanders. Vadian does not esteem him for his sociability, but because he stands so firmly for the evangelical doctrine.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Vadian is very grateful for the sending of [the first] sections of Bullinger's writing [«Series et digestio temporum»] and wishes to receive the remaining ones as well. His high opinion of the writing is already established. But [other] scholars will also regard the work as a valuable handbook for all those interested in the Acts of the Apostles. The St. Gallen Johannes Kessler should also receive a copy, as he is a quite capable reviewer!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Bullinger should ask Theodor Bibliander to send Vadian his [latest] work [«De ratione communi omnium linguarum et literarum commentarius»] as well.</p>

      <p>S.P.D. I sincerely commend to you, most excellent and learned man, the cause of the pastor from Romanshorn, who bears this letter of mine. Antronius treats him miserably and with great contempt. Up to this day, the governor of Thurgau, Leonhard Holzhalb, has not been able to extract the reasons for such indignation. Not long ago, when this excellent man was with me in St. Gallen, Antronius decided to capture him by placing armed guards everywhere and blocking the roads in a remarkable way, so that he could not escape by any means. When we learned of this, we thwarted Antronius's plan and his henchmen with a ridiculous but clever stratagem, so that while they kept watch until late at night, the pastor, in the meantime (though by a longer route), safely reached his own the next day. Therefore, no place within that jurisdiction is safe for him. In my judgment, it would be most advisable for our Itelianus, aided by the patronage of Mr. Holzhalb, to summon Antronius to the Baths or the next assembly or soon thereafter. For it seems that he intends to delay the whole matter until the arrival of another governor. Therefore, you will ensure that he is assisted by your people to the best of their ability, so that he is not eventually forced to go into exile due to slanders, not without serious offense to his own. I love the man not so much for his sociability, but for his exceptional steadfastness, by which he is most devoted to our sound religion.</p>

      <p>I am very grateful for the papers sent to me of your epitome and I ask that you also take care to send the remaining ones to me. There is no need for my judgment, which indeed marvelously rests in it. But the most learned will judge it worthy that all who delight in the reading of the apostles should handle it. I would also wish for a copy to be sent to our Kessler. For he himself is by no means an ordinary judge.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I pray, however, that you will call upon Mr. Bibliander in my name, so that he does not allow me to be deprived of his work.</p>

      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, the day after the calends of March, in the year of our Lord 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most renowned bishop of the city of Zurich, most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
