      <p>Greetings. Musculus was elected by us; but the matter turned out differently before the deacons than we had hoped, since our deacon was elected by them against our will.</p>
      <p>The number of votes was so nearly equal that the hands of the voters had to be counted twice, and almost the entire council supported Musculus; but the crowd of common people prevailed, to the great sorrow of all good men. As for us, we warned them very freely about everything, so that I am very glad we have freed our consciences. Therefore, I bear everything more equitably and will conduct everything more courageously from now on than I have so far, so that everyone understands how much depends on them for the peace of the church. And although Musculus's rejection pains me greatly, because I see that this church is not worthy of such a great good, I am nevertheless driven with even greater spirit to do everything manfully. I will indeed make an effort not to do anything imprudently or thoughtlessly; I will bind this man to me as much as I can with gentleness, yet in such a way that I keep him in fear and duty at the same time; for his authority is not so great that I should fear it. Meanwhile, however, because Satan's wiles are varied, I ask that, whatever happens to me, you always recognize me as your own. This in haste.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter of predestination, which is spreading greatly, I will write soon; now there is no time for more. Farewell. November 27, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the ZÃ¼rich church, his dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
