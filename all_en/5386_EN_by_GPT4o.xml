      <p>Greetings. It is most certain that the Pope will send a large sum of money and request 4000 Swiss soldiers. He pretends it is for the defense of his person and seat, but it is known that he will use those soldiers for Guise. It is most certain that several hundred cavalry from Brunswick have been enlisted, and that Count Palatine, Rhinegrave, is enlisting 2 legions of landsknechts for Guise. If our people are unaware of this, they should be warned in time about everything.</p>
      <p>Again, I urge: Be vigilant that Lyon does not fall into the hands of the enemy. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Most hastily.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 3, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, his esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Geneva.</p>
