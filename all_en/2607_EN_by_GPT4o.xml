      <p>Greetings. The powerful and merciful Lord, in His customary goodness, comes to the aid of the afflicted. It seemed that everything in Augsburg was about to collapse; so inflamed were the plans of some for the destruction of piety. But they have been broken or at least hindered, partly by the agreement and steadfastness of the princes who convened in Neuburg, concerning religion, in which they have professed to stand firm and are pressing the Passau agreements to be ratified, and partly due to the unexpected merit of the supreme pontiff and the Archbishop of Mainz, about which I have been informed both by others from elsewhere and from Strasbourg. May the Lord Jesus be present as the defender and guardian of His church. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all your people in Basel, April 9, 1555.</p>
      <p>We are striving to obtain a place here for the English exiles from our senate. Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most excellent and vigilant Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
