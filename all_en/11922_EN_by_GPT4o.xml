    <p xml:id="regest1">He has skimmed Bullinger's writing against Cochläus [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“] and found that he refutes the slander of the truth so skillfully and moderately that even Cochläus, if he is of sound mind, will have to acknowledge this; a translation of the writing into German seems Bullinger does not trust this information; Vadian wants to help him find the true whereabouts, but would like to be informed as soon as further investigations are unnecessary. Greetings; requests news from Speyer [from the Imperial Diet] as well as the return of documents; it is said that the Swiss are threatened with the ban of Emperor [Charles V] if they do not renounce the French [King Francis I].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have briefly read your response, most illustrious man, and I have nothing else to say except that you have addressed and defended all the points contaminated by Cochläus's slander with the faith and sincerity with which they ought and can be handled by anyone who is very knowledgeable in the scriptures and the ancient orthodox doctrine. In sprinkling salt, you not only excel with a certain remarkable moderation of spirit but also with skill; indeed, in my opinion, nothing has been omitted that could assert the truth dragged into judgment by slander, defend it even before Cochläus himself as judge, and achieve that it be acquitted by the votes of all. And if only there were those who, with your good grace, would translate it into the German language, so that it could be read everywhere and by everyone! I will indeed declare Cochläus insane if, after reading it, he does not regain a better and sounder mind. You ask, however, where Cochläus is located? I thought he was in Breslau; for from there he measured the distance between himself and you, that is, to Zurich. But I see you suspect the man is trifling. I will therefore make an effort to drag him out of his hiding place, like some Cerberus from his den. If you find out first, let me know too, so I do not act in vain. In the meantime, I will not cease to inquire, so that if I have any certainty, I will immediately write to you. Farewell and love me, and if there is anything rare or worth knowing from Speyer, let me know, I beg you, and return the recently sent copies. Various rumors are spread by our people about some imperial ban, in which Switzerland is to be implicated unless it renounces the French. May the gods grant better things! St. Gallen, 19th day of March, in the year 1544. Hastily. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the city of Zurich, a man by far the most illustrious and learned.</p>
