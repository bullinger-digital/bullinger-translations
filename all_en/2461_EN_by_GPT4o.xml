      <p>François Hotman sends greetings.</p>
      <p>You rightly advise me about Julius, for which I am very grateful to you for this benefit to me. I think other things have escaped notice, which, however, no one has yet pointed out nor have I observed. The Lord has our booklet in his hands, and if he wishes, he will expose it to the desire of critics; nevertheless, I wrote it with the intention of helping the church and... I was defending the cause of our Molineus. If the Lord would give me many such correctors as you, my father, whom I have found, it would be both a great honor and a pleasure to me. But if Ruffus or some other mercenary patron of Roman tyranny responds, I fear that many things, neither unwisely nor wrongly said, will be most shamefully slandered.</p>
      <p>However, there is still no word about Ruffus, except that they say he has incurred the hatred of many among our people, especially those who have learned their slanders from our booklet.</p>
      <p>I am very surprised that Lord Molineus is leaving Tübingen so quickly. On the same day I received your letter, Lord Calvin also sent me a letter from him, in which he said he could not bear the ubiquity of the Tübingen people, a word I had never heard before. May the Lord extinguish these monstrous opinions of men, which indeed sow very pernicious discord in the church of God. I wrote to the same Molineus, and, hoping it will not be troublesome to you, if I freely use your kindness, I sent my letters to you, so that, if possible, you may entrust them to someone safely; for there is no abundance of anyone here, nor do I know for certain where the letters should be sent. Farewell, my father and most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus increase his holy spirit in you more and more every day and preserve you unharmed in his church for as long as possible. Geneva, the day before the Ides of November.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich, my esteemed parent.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
