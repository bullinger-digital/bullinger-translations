      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>We have received, most excellent Lord Bullinger, your letters, in which we easily perceive how much you value us and how you are not forgetful of us. Nor would we have doubted this, even if you had not sent us any letters at all; but now, having read those most delightful ones you sent to us, we have the clearest evidence that you not only care for us but also for our entire homeland, with fear and anxiety, which incite you to make even more fervent prayers to God for the reformation of our church. We certainly have better hopes for this, as you and men of God like you are more intent on this very thing with your prayers, whose invocations, for Jesus Christ, our only mediator, cannot be in vain, but are accepted by God, sprinkled with the blood of Christ and inspired by the sighs of the Holy Spirit. We acknowledge your studies, labors, and endeavors, and we pray to the Lord to direct, establish, and confirm all things for the benefit of the church, the honor of God, and your own consolation.</p>
      <p>The honorable Lord a Lasco (Jan Łaski) still remains in Frankfurt; he daily expects messengers to lead him back to his homeland. We have shared your letters with him. As for the Brentius (Johannes Brenz) matter, we only pray that the Lord may settle the church's discord and multiply its peace; for there are not lacking daily those who, as new men, attack the truth with new errors. It is indeed astonishing with what verbosity, with what proud philosophical bombast, not with scientific demonstrations (as he himself says), but with the swelling gusts of Pelagius and the empty conceptions of human wisdom, a certain Justus Velsius has filled our schools, granted to us by the kindness of the highest lords who preside over this city, against God's eternal predestination.</p>
      <p>We send you his conceptions: we preferred to remain silent about the blasphemies against God, the barking and insults against Lord Calvin, which are indeed quite harsh, rather than defile our paper with such foul outcries.</p>
      <p>We expect nothing good from England: everything continues to deteriorate. The number of martyrs, who have eagerly professed the word of God and are cruelly dragged to fires and torments, is so great that pious men, who otherwise diligently investigate this very thing, cannot ascertain either their number or their names. Neither the ferocity of the queen nor of Bonner, the pseudo-bishop of London, nor of the other papists can be satisfied with domestic bloodshed, unless it also runs across the sea and rages to such an extent that now in Antwerp no pious person can remain safe and without danger. Lord Cheke and Lord Carrou, both captured by treachery, have been deported to the queen, thrown into prison, but now, as they say, are either released or soon to be released.</p>
      <p>However (alas), the rumor is false, yet (as we hope), unjust conditions have been proposed and accepted for both to enjoy and obtain freedom. Whatever the case, we learn that it is vain to hope in man. Charles, not yet sufficiently broken by illness, and his sister with Philip, the son, are about to set out for England (we do not know for what necessity) but are recalled in the very journey. Neither the nobles nor the common people bear the entrance of these princes patiently, nor do they meanwhile conceal their impatience in this matter; although nonetheless, the queen and certain nobles who stand by her side are carried here with all zeal and industry to ennoble Philip with the hereditary right of the kingdom, the royal diadem, and other insignia, and that with the consent of the parliament (as they call it).</p>
      <p>In Sudovolgia (Sudovian region), they proclaim Lady Elizabeth as queen and join Lord Courtenay as her champion; by this audacity, at least sixty or eighty have met an ignominious death in the name of treason. But indeed, nothing certain is known about the number. It is rather known that not only Lady Elizabeth but also Lord Courtenay, Earl of Devon, are drawn into suspicion of treason and not a little danger to their lives. But may God turn all things for the better. And these are the matters of our homeland. Yet, not content with these, we do not restrain ourselves: the matter, though more desired than hoped for indeed, we will nonetheless communicate to you. We indeed desire a colloquium on matters of religion.</p>
      <p>But whether this will happen, we cannot affirm with certainty. If such a thing should happen by chance, there is hope that Lord Calvin will return in person, and that you and others learned in this matter will have companions not only in the journey but also in the labor. May the eternal Lord God grant this through Christ, that at some time, gathered in the true fear of God (with Christ presiding over the council), you may finally issue a pure confession without any stain of error to the confusion of adversaries, the concord of the church, and the glory of God, to whose protection we commend you, your wife, your family, and all yours. Farewell, in the year of our Lord, September 19, 1556.</p>
      <p>Most observant of your paternity, Robert Horne, and Richard Chamber.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, these are delivered. In Zürich.</p>
