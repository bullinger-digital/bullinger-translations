      <p>Greetings. We are still expecting your letters, reverend father in Christ; for our men have not yet returned to us due to the rather unfavorable weather. However, my son is preparing for the journey.</p>
      <p>He has been in fairly mediocre health with me; I hope he will become stronger day by day. The horse, contrary to what we thought, could not be fully cured in these eight days; therefore, we were forced to change our plan; we will look around for a buyer, although we do not see where we might find one; for the horse is very lean and worn out by this difficult journey.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, we will make an effort to sell it as soon as possible at whatever price. In the meantime, Mr. Pontisella or even Mr. Philippus will keep it at their home.</p>
      <p>As for my son, I see that he is very worried; he fears that the excessive expenses might offend you; but as far as I understand, he spent most of it on his health, and therefore it seems he can be completely excused. But in addition to this, it was not fitting for the son of such a great man to behave so sordidly towards those whose services he needed, like some obscure little man from the middle of the common people. He also realizes that these things somehow pertain to your dignity, and certainly, since your name is illustrious among all, he should not have cast any shadow of avarice upon it. I hope you will find him obedient in other matters.</p>
      <p>The cold has subsided, so I hope he will have a more comfortable journey. There is nothing new with us.</p>
      <p>However, my son can recount the great vigils and labors we need here. I am comforted by that passage from Jeremiah: "Do not be afraid of their faces; for I am with you; do not be dismayed at their presence, lest I make you dismayed at their presence."</p>
      <p>Perjury, lying, murder, adultery have broken out, and blood touches blood. Yet there is no one who either complains or reproves. But we poor priests must hang the bell on the cat.</p>
      <p>But these things do not happen in the town, but in the bishop's castle, and to let you know, the Ambrosian marriage has caused great harm to our church. But thanks to God, he repents greatly; the daughter is more worthless than a dog. Now it begins to be fulfilled: "Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves" and what follows. Soon it will also be fulfilled: "For the spirit of whoredom has led them astray, and they have played the harlot against their God, therefore your daughters commit whoredom and your daughters-in-law commit adultery." You understand the rest. Everyone murmurs. It is a scandal.</p>
      <p>Ask my son; but be his advisor, not to speak of such things elsewhere, for it will come out soon enough; it would be a shame if someone spared him. We are still expecting your letters, and indeed in vain.</p>
      <p>We are very much wondering about the reason for your silence; however, I am sealing mine. I am adding two notes from Mr. Orator, from one of which you will learn of his goodwill towards you and your son, and from the other some news. Return the note in which there is news.</p>
      <p>May your piety and fatherhood be well; may all yours be safe. Chur, January 15, 1560.</p>
      <p>I gave my son two crowns for the journey.</p>
      <p>You know my hand.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
      <p>J. F. wrote from Chur, but wanted to indicate that the letter should be burned.</p>
