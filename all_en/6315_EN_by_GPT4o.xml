      <p>Greetings. I inform you, venerable man, that on the 23rd of November, a meeting was held with us, in which the French alliance was deliberated, and you receive the outcome of the consultation as follows: our community promised to establish an alliance with the King of the French under the following conditions, namely if the money, which has so far been given to private pensioners (which amounts to 12,000 francs), is given to the public treasury and the greater part of the Swiss enter into the alliance, the hope of the alliance remains; but if these conditions are intolerable to the king, he affirmed that all hope of the alliance is excluded. And although Phrygians are wise too late, our community has finally learned to be wise to its own harm, since it has already experienced the tyranny of the oligarchs in the republic and the business of Christ with pain and great ruin more than enough. They have arisen by no other way than by the king's gifts and generosity.</p>
      <p>Hence their elaborate houses, splendid furnishings, Sybaritic luxury, lavish and sumptuous tables, wealth, pleasures, and the Lerna of all crimes.</p>
      <p>And this is little, unless the word of God and justice are endangered together. But the good among us hope that the French will not accept these conditions of peace, which we greatly desire. If this happens, the oligarchs threaten to stir up a tragedy for us, and it is to be feared that some of ours will defect from the gospel when they feel this golden fountain drying up.</p>
      <p>But let them go to the ravens, and where they are worthy. We have hitherto had a strenuous and hard war with our enemies, but this will be more bitter, which the pensioners will stir up. Believe safely what I have said.</p>
      <p>I am indeed mindful of the words of our Zwingli, who openly proclaimed in the pulpit that it would not be advisable for the republic unless the oligarchs are first expelled from the Swiss borders and ejected from their seats. Let it be done as it pleases the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have well understood your advice and that of Haller and your judgment on the alliance; I hold the same mind with you. May the Lord direct our ways into the way of peace.</p>
      <p>All the pious wish that you allow the judgment and advice on the alliance, which we read, to be brought to light, hoping much fruit will come from it, but the hatred of the Vatidians towards the pensioners.</p>
      <p>Schuler is not at home; he has gone to Freiburg together with the attached envoy, to there present the opinion and mind of our community to the king's envoy.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily together with your family, and I pray to the Lord that he may keep you safe for a long time for the benefit of his church. You will greet in my name Ludwig Lavater, Rudolf Walther, Zwingli, and all the brothers. Given on the 28th of November, 1564.</p>
      <p>Fridolin Fonteius, minister of the word of the church of Glarus, always most observant of you.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and venerable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
