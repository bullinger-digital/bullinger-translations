      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. That I, an insignificant man, am well-disposed towards you, a man of God and the unique glory and ornament of Christ and the Church of Zurich, the day of the Lord will declare, etc. I first received the fourth decade of your sermons with the letters on October 6th through the noble Schauenfuss of our prince.</p>
      <p>For which I give you immense thanks, and perhaps it will be given someday that, if not equally, it will be returned in some small measure. You once asked for the blessing of our vineyards; but carriers are lacking, etc. In autumn, I revived somewhat, freed from the chains of the cruel tyrant erysipelas, which had almost killed my old and dried-up body with its frequent inflammations.</p>
      <p>At that time, when your letters were delivered, Bartholomeus Westhemerus from Mulhouse (as you may know) was with me, a man in my judgment both pious and of uncommon learning, and my old compatriot.</p>
      <p>He might have joined me if eloquence were pleasing to the people from the podium.</p>
      <p>As for us here, concerning religion, by the blessing of the gracious deity, we are in the same state as always, and the more the adversaries threaten great things, the more we firmly plant our foot with a hardened resolve. The prince wanted to impose some moderation on us, so that we would not publicly denounce the adiaphoristic and interimistic doctrine; but retaining our freedom, we did not want to bind the word of God to satanic modesty. I hope, however, that our modesty is known to all men. Therefore, some adversaries gnash their teeth, especially those who hold power among us and whose interest it is to protect the sole glory of God, accusing the constancy of the ministers of the church, which they call recklessness, which they say will not only cause trouble for the prince but much more likely overthrow the state of the republic.</p>
      <p>In turn, we vigorously teach against them that the kingdom of God and His righteousness must be sought first, and then they will have little gain if they gain the whole world and lose their soul, that no one can serve two masters. But they, with their sophistic and carnal prudence, mock this solid doctrine among the simple and those ill-disposed towards the purer doctrine of Christ.</p>
      <p>Hence, the license of vices in the church leads the greater part to ruin; for they sin with impunity while the magistrate looks the other way. I have now somewhat depicted for you what is happening here, outlining the marvelous schemes of Satan; yet we hope for God's help, which the good imitators of Christ incessantly implore, amen, etc.</p>
      <p>Duke Ulrich, tossed about by land and sea, having suffered much also in war, laid down his life and soul with a Christian confession. His son, Duke Christoph, now occupies the kingdom, which may he also retain and protect from the Spanish harpies. Our garrisons are placed in the more fortified locations. Our man will return to Montbéliard; what the future holds, the day will declare. We pray incessantly to the gracious God, that for the sake of mammon and the tumult of war, the glory of Christ may not perish in this our little field. Some think, which may it remain a mere opinion, that our man, finally wearied, will subscribe to the religion of the Emperor, which God forbid. But I hope for better things.</p>
      <p>The magistrate of Strasbourg acts in its usual unstable and fluctuating manner, conniving at the schemes of the bishop. They have on both sides the worst rascals and factious wicked men, who certainly, if not deterred, will overthrow the state of the Christian republic, which God forbid, etc. The Duke of Zweibrücken has with difficulty obtained from the Emperor a delay of the Interim institution until the council. Maurice of Saxony has some nobles and robbers who devastate his land with fire and plunder.</p>
      <p>The people of Magdeburg, after the defeat they suffered, which you know from the published booklet, are more spirited and vigorously attack the younger Duke of Mecklenburg with his accomplices. This is from a citizen of Colmar, who returned from Wittenberg within three months. Johannes Negelinus, who accompanied Bucer to England, a learned and pious young man, was in Augsburg in October and writes how wonderfully God, in His usual goodness, preserves the church there among so many wolves. For they have free preaching of the word and the true sacraments, baptism and the Lord's Supper, both instituted and practiced. He testifies that he saw this on October 5th in all the parishes. They have expanded the preaching houses because of the great attendance and number, which increases daily.</p>
      <p>The adversaries indeed bear this with an unjust mind; but the Emperor strives to establish peace as much as he can, etc.</p>
      <p>You write that you delight in my writings and for this reason, you urge me to write. Therefore, you have the elegances of a sixty-year-old grammarian (if they delight you). Farewell in Christ Jesus with your family and children and all your brothers-in-law, whom you will greet on behalf of all of us, especially my contemporary Pellicanus, Gwalther, Bibliander, and the others.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, November 18, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Erbius.</p>
      <p>Pray for us privately and publicly, that our faith may not fail.</p>
      <p>To the man of exceptional piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, theologian and ecclesiastic of Zurich, my esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>"Duke Ulrich was born in the year 1487 in the month of February; his mother, the Countess of Zweibrücken and Bitsch, died in childbirth on the 17th day of February. He was born in Riquewihr in a small hypocaust, which still exists in the hall, etc."</p>
