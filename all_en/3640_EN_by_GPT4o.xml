      <p>Greetings. As I was sending something through my mule driver to the envoy of the Rhaetians, I did not want him to leave without a letter from me to you, so that when he returns, I can learn about your health. An island called Doreigni, which had been captured by the English fifteen years ago, where they had built two castles, was recently recaptured by the Normans under the leadership of Langey, and about 500 English were slain. Our people are making Theodonis Villa more fortified and stronger than before, and Guise is making use of his victory. Farewell and continue to love us, as you do.</p>
      <p>Baden, July 7.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most deserving pastor of the church and friend. Zurich.</p>
