      <p>Greetings. You, indeed (reverend father in Christ), are too generous in writing amidst your many occupations; therefore, there was clearly no need for an apology to me. I give you immortal thanks, for you share everything; however, I could not return your writings now, because the messenger brought them at an inopportune time, but I will send them at the next market or more timely, if there are those to whom I can conveniently give them. I have nothing with which to reward you, except that I send the history of Gr√ºnbach, just as it was written to our consuls as certain through merchants, do not [re]send it." I have no doubt about its authenticity. I will remember your teachings, and I would have been briefer otherwise; but I have not read anything in Latin authors for a long time and I see now how unprepared I am, and I am displeased with myself; yet I pray to the Lord, who is present with me. One thing troubles me, where it might be printed, and now I do not have time to write to Mr. Oporinus. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Chur, most hastily, in the year 1563, on the calends of November.</p>
      <p>Your observant Fabricius.</p>
      <p>It is possible to gather many absurd interpretations of scripture from the decrees themselves and all papal law, such as that concerning holy water (for the consequences are also included here); therefore, I will not mention anything except what is confessed, do not doubt, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father in Christ, to be eternally honored. In Zurich.</p>
