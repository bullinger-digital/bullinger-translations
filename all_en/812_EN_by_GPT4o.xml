      <p>Year 1550, on the 18th of January from Köln.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I received your lordship's letter written on the 10th of December on the 12th of January. I have not doubted nor will I doubt the complete loyalty of Florian; however, it concerns me that he secretly left Frankfurt without saying goodbye to all his friends and has not indicated where he is staying to this day. I do not understand from your letters where he resides.</p>
      <p>He bought some books from me, whether for you or someone else, I do not know. I believe he did not entrust his servant with the money for safekeeping.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await your and Mr. Calvin's agreement, and it is awaited here by sincere people.</p>
      <p>A month ago, a pious and studious priest fled here to the sacred anchor from Leuven, who, at my suggestion, decided to write to you, asking whether he can attend our ceremonies here or elsewhere with a clear conscience; Mr. Musculus does not satisfy him. Mr. Calvin's book "On Avoiding Superstitions" is no longer available with me.</p>
      <p>The elder Count von Wied, having left all prebends, is honored with this innate title: "To the illustrious and noble Friedrich, elder Count von Wied, Lord in Ronkel and Isenburg," etc., with the same title as Hermann von Wied, the elder, Archbishop of Köln.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cesarius is expected to return to us shortly. We hope for better things from England daily.</p>
      <p>We would wish for the service of that good nobleman who is with you; he could greatly benefit us and all the pious with his reading until I send a young man who could assist as a corrector with his reading. I wrote to Mr. Montius to send you the disputations of Mr. Peter Martyr on the sacrament of the Eucharist; I know he has one copy.</p>
      <p>We have various reports here about the election of the pope; some claim an Englishman, others a cardinal from Lorraine has been elected. It does not concern us; for there is no hope of true reformation.</p>
      <p>I received some new books from Florence, Thomas Aquinas on the Apocalypse; I will send one copy of each as soon as possible. If anything new has been printed with you, I ask that Mr. Froschauer send it to us; I do not doubt his diligence in printing the English Bibles, in which your lordship promises us your assistance; we accept it not without a sign of a grateful heart.</p>
      <p>We have no certain news about the arrival of the Emperor; he is suffering from gout, always contemplating and aspiring to greater things. Please greet Mr. Gesner in the name of Mr. Echt and Mr. Bernhard; both are amazed at Mr. Gesner's silence; they offer him all their effort and diligence in depicting animals. I have received nothing about Mr. Pellican's debtors.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dear Mr. Bullinger, and continue to love Birckmann. Yours most obediently, Johann Birckmann.</p>
