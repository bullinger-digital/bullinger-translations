      <p>Johannes Blasius to his Heinrich, Greetings.</p>
      <p>The man whom you see here in person, most esteemed sir, is the consul of our republic, a man sincere in the judgment of all good people and most steadfast in the evangelical cause. I wanted him to be known to you, so that you may add your spur to him, even though he is already running, so that he may persist in the good work he has begun. Then, if you have anything intended for our Travers, let us receive it through him, etc., and if there is anything with you that contributes to promoting the truth of the Lord, make us participants as well. Farewell through the Lord, who may deign to preserve you for us for a long time, amen. Hastily, Chur, August 23, in the year 39.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and equally most courteous lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich.</p>
