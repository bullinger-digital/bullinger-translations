    <p xml:id="regest1">Expresses his joy over the salvation of the Grossm√ºnster Abbey: Bullinger is indeed more necessary in Zurich than in Bern. Reports on the appointment of assistants for the region of Bern and about Rhellikan, requests the sending of the commentary on the Epistle to the Romans and other writings by Bullinger as well as Pellican's commentaries, and sends Bullinger the printed Bern Synod for review.</p>

      <p>Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ, who has spoken to your people through you as an instrument and has persuaded them not to let the strength of religion, namely the studies that are as flourishing among you as they are celebrated throughout the world, fail. What will Satan leave untried to make true piety foreign and idolatry return?</p>
      <p>Now I see that what Capito could not persuade with many attempts, namely that you are more necessary to the people of Zurich than to those of Bern, is indeed true, although my spirit is so devoted to you that I would consider all things, even the hardest, very light with you as my brother and fellow minister. I have informed our brothers of that remarkable victory, who hear with sorrow that you have come to Zurich because they wanted to convert the substance of the college to the use of war or the treasury.</p>
      <p>Our people have appointed 10 deacons in the countryside after the synod, each with 60 guilders, who will minister to the infirm pastors and succeed the deceased. We also have two in the city, so that there are always twelve who can be appointed to the churches. However, I must confess that our people are hasty in appointing and inclined to dismiss. I have no eloquence at all, no skill in speaking, and none at all in persuading either before the senate or in private. I know my limited resources. Megander excels in this, although his authority has greatly diminished due to the past tragedy.</p>
      <p>Rellicanus will come to you. Do not share with him what is written between us, namely you and me. I will return what you sent through him. A good and studious man, he has otherwise imagined a rivalry with me, as if I had arranged for him to be sent away. The senate worked for Melchior Volmar, a very learned man lecturing in Greek at Bourges. He himself has borne it with difficulty but has so far concealed it. He certainly has a condition that is fair in price to us, but very different in labor, which I certainly favor for him, provided he also makes himself a participant in other church matters, which he has so far refused. For the senate had requested that he sometimes take on the duty of preaching when one of ours was ill, which he refused. But enough of this. You will write to me through him.</p>
      <p>There are murmurs from the senate and the people that they want to admit again dances, games, and I don't know what, gatherings of peasants at dedications that have been prohibited until now. I beg you, indicate what should be done and by what means we can effectively dissuade them. For it would open the door to all evils and licentiousness. Therefore, do not neglect this and ensure that I have it before Palm Sunday.</p>
      <p>I had written through Walther Schwiger. I do not know if the letters have been delivered. If they have, you should respond to them; if not, I will write again, as Capito indicated in two letters.</p>
      <p>Things are going well with us, and I wish as steadily as they are well. For this is always desired from us, namely constancy and diligent execution of matters. For excessive business easily hinders the diligence of those who are otherwise negligent.</p>
      <p>I beg you for the third time, if you have compiled anything on the Epistle to the Romans, send it to me through Rellicanus. I have never treated it for a sermon so far, but I will soon take it up. The judgments and spirit of many assist me; I do not easily trust my own. I expect the method of study and predestination. Thus I am an importunate demander. Moreover, I give immortal thanks for your most welcome little gifts, and I expect the Epistle to the Hebrews you promised.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest little soul, and do not cease to love me, placed in the list of your dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 2, 1532.</p>
      <p>I send to you the synodal acts. When you have read them, if you desire anything, let me know. A young man of great promise, Simon Sultzer from Bern, has translated them into Latin, and they will be printed by Cratander, if I am not mistaken.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellican, and urge him that as Froschauer sent the first pages of the commentary, he should continue to send whatever has been printed.</p>
      <p>Your very small coin.</p>
      <p>To Huldrych Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his brother, by far the dearest of all.</p>
