      <p> I have just learned through experience, most honorable Mr. Bullinger, that Christ's saying is very true: "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." For a year and a half now, I have been entirely occupied with building, not in the collection of treasure, but in its expenditure. However, I have been careful not to make useless expenses and thus deplete my small treasury. Not only have all my thoughts been fixed on this action, but I have also frequently put my own hands to the work, so that by my example I might spur others on. But slow-moving donkeys, when spurred, move backward more quickly than they advance. Entangled in these troubles, unworthy of a free man, I have neglected all my friends and have not repaid the duties and services owed according to the laws of friendship. However, because I have been struck by the heavy weapon of necessity, not by negligence or laziness, I have not abandoned the designated station. I hope that your lordship and other friends will be more equitable judges, as I have resolved to repay the remaining debts with interest henceforth, etc. </p>
      <p> From our England, I know nothing that I suspect is unknown to you, and thus we depend on the outcome. If only the whole kingdom would come together with happy and favorable fortune in our Alsace, a thousand knights are now gathering; sent by those princes and states who are in the Rhine Circle. Albert, the Margrave, is indeed put forward, as he is about to make incursions into the Bishopric of Strasbourg. But these are not true, the rumors of marriage that are being spread. </p>
      <p> A knight stationed along the border of France is to prevent both the transition of Germans into France and the accession of the royal forces into Germany. And since war plans and preparations are mostly made in winter, the knight has been designated for these watches, to be supported not by the Margrave's stipends, but by the contributions of the entire circle. Then this knight, as it seems convenient, will proceed further; thus, one's own walls are whitewashed with another's lime. Saxony at this time has nothing new; Augustus, Maurice's brother, is in poor health and is considered useless for foot service, and thus the children of Johann Friedrich are hoped to succeed to the entire Duchy of Saxony. It would be surprising if this winter does not bring forth the long-gestated diets, so that the empire may be drawn into the society of war. Commend me to your sons-in-law. If I can gratify your lordship in any way, I will do so diligently. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Strasbourg, September 26, 1554. C[hristopher] Mont. </p>
