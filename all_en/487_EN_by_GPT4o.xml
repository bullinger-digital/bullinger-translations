      <p>Greetings from the Lord. You wonder about the reasons for my silence, esteemed lord, which you partly guess by divination. For several weeks now, contrary to my usual practice, I have written nothing to you; but you will cease to wonder when you understand the reasons for my silence, among which I will no longer count your occupations, which it would not be proper for me to disturb, but rather the greater reason that I had no matter of such importance to write about that it would be appropriate to burden you and interrupt your serious affairs.</p>
      <p>The present state of my affairs compelled me to act at this time; you know what burden rests on my shoulders; since the first of January, I have preached every single day until now. This labor was not a little increased by my wife's poor health; for she has not yet recovered from her recent childbirth and is greatly tormented by pains.</p>
      <p>All these things together have caused me, having nothing that particularly concerned you, to consume less of both your time and mine.</p>
      <p>I was with Dr. Musculus, and did what I could. I would have liked to have my very sick wife at home, so she could be better cared for than in a public inn; but they did not want that.</p>
      <p>We hope for good from him; may our hope not deceive us. As soon as I receive your writing against the Interim from Peter, I will send it to you. I saw with joy the publication of your sermons in decades; as I understand from the title of two decades that there will be several volumes, I hope we will have an excellent treasure from you, which will be useful to many ministers of the word. May the Lord be with you with His grace, so that you may bring it to a happy conclusion and someday recognize that it has been published with great profit, so that you cannot regret your labor.</p>
      <p>What you wrote to me about Gervasius for the second time, I will not forget; but I have not yet responded because I had nothing to promise except my efforts, which I can certainly affirm will not be lacking to Dr. Gervasius when the situation allows. However, nothing can be done now, nor would it be fair to discuss calling another while he is still alive. The dean is still bedridden and very ill, and I do not hope he will ever be strong enough to perform his duties. His arms are so weak that he lies almost like a log without the help of others and cannot bring food or drink to his mouth. If he should pass away, I will gladly do what I can, if you indeed advise it; but now I do not want anyone to hear from me that another should be called, lest I afflict that good old man more while he is sick and provoke others who are already quite inclined to reject him.</p>
      <p>We will wait to see what the Lord will ultimately do; if He wishes him to recover, I will gladly endure so much labor and trouble, as brotherly love requires, so that he may later perform his duties again; but if He wishes him to depart from the living, may the Lord's will be done, then I will ensure, if possible, that you know you did not commend Dr. Gervasius to me in vain. Therefore, he himself should be at ease; there is no need for him to come until he is called, let him entrust the matter to the Lord, nor is our province such that much effort is required to obtain such a position; for if he has not previously gathered something to live on, he will not have it in Aarau.</p>
      <p>Although few believe this now, in due time I will be forced to prove it to my great detriment; but because the Lord wanted me to serve Him in such poverty and want, I will do so, certain that the Lord will someday regard my poverty, and although I am left far behind my peers on earth, He will bestow upon me a far more excellent treasure in heaven.</p>
      <p>I have nothing certain about the Solothurn Diet. Our consul or mayor from Luternow was in Solothurn these days, but he denies being able to learn anything certain from his brother, who is the chief of the senators in Solothurn. It is about the treaty, which the French want to make, then it was said to be written in letters, doubtful whether the Swiss would enter into such a treaty. Besides, there is absolutely nothing new except what you recently wrote, that the emperor is suspected by everyone of harboring some monster, as he wants to make a truce with the French.</p>
      <p>Everyone sees the man as cunning and deceitful, yet they do not want to guard against his traps. May the Lord open our eyes so that we may walk in the light. You will have more certain information sooner than we do. My wife sends her greetings to you. I wish your entire household well. I received two bundles of letters from Bern yesterday to be forwarded to you; I send them through this messenger.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me in your thoughts.</p>
      <p>Aarau, April 10, 1549.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the Church of Christ, his lord as to a most esteemed father. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
