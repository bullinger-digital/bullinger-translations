      <p>S. P. D. My wife received your letters filled with much piety along with your sermons in my absence, most honorable man, for which I give you and the most illustrious Gwalter great thanks, who have already bound me with new accumulated benefits. The messenger returned to you with such haste that I was not only unable to write letters, but I did not even see him, being so occupied with visiting the sick that there was scarcely time to scratch my ears at that time. I have carefully managed the packet with letters to the Count of Württemberg and Erb, an excellent man, and I will also do my utmost to ensure that you receive most of your letters to the late Myconius, even if not all (which is scarcely possible), at the next opportunity. From Austria, we have heard nothing for a long time except that Ferdinand is indulging his desires in Vienna and living in luxury as usual, despite the great danger to his people. We hear nothing certain about the Frenchman; we fear that the Margrave of Brandenburg, who has already exhausted almost all the bishoprics, may settle his winter quarters in Burgundy, while the Emperor may settle in Alsace and Sundgau due to the abundance of resources, to our great inconvenience and danger, and that of all Switzerland.</p>
      <p>The church of Basel lacks a pastor since the death of the late Myconius; therefore, God must be prayed to and entreated by the prayers of the pious, that He may appoint a bishop to His church in these great tumults of Germany and the assaults of the vigilant Antichrist, who may preside over His sheep no less by the example of life than by doctrine, beyond all contention, by which many churches today are tossed to great scandal. I am expecting a packet of books from Peter Mechlin of Strasbourg, which you have long desired to receive.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily with your wife and whole family. Please greet in my name Pellican, my most esteemed uncle, to whom I do not have time to write now. Our Marcus Bersius and Oporinus also greet you. Farewell again. On the first of November in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Conrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable friend.</p>
      <p>To Zürich.</p>
