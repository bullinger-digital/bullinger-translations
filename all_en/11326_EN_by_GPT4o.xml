    <p xml:id="regest1">Self-love and blind zeal prevent us from getting to the bottom of the causes of the much-lamented divisions. The papist bishops and priests despise the Word of God and, through their unrepentance, prevent peace in the Church. On the evangelical side, there are some who, although they hear the Word of God, do not want to be corrected by the preachers. Others cause disputes because they are unstable in their teaching due to anxious consideration. Yet others pride themselves on their special insights and teachings and despise all who do not follow them in this. Driven by such arrogance are also those Pneumatics who confuse their followers with a new doctrine about the flesh of Christ. Especially the latter cause new divisions because the less educated do not know the history and writings of the Fathers and do not realize that it is the well-known deception of the devil; to remedy this, Bullinger publishes Vadian's letter on the relationship of the two natures of Christ and on the properties of his body before and after the resurrection, as well as Vigilius' writing against Eutyches. The two authors are well known; Vadian wrote the letter at Bullinger's request, while Vigilius composed his brilliant refutation of the heresies of Eutyches and Nestorius, against which Leo the Great, Gelasius, Fulgentius, Cyril of Alexandria, and John Maxentius also wrote, a thousand years ago; Bullinger has improved and supplemented the edition published in Tübingen. He dedicates the work to Travers to increase his fame as a God-fearing guardian of justice and patron of education among posterity, and reminds the leaders of Graubünden of their duty: Upholding the laws and promoting schools are essential for the continuation of the work begun by faithful preachers. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To Lord Johannes Travers, the most distinguished senator of the first Rhaetia, most esteemed lord, Heinrich Bullinger wishes grace and innocence of life from God the Father through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Many today complain about the errors and disputes growing more and more each day; very few are concerned with removing the causes of these errors and conflicts, although once the causes of evil are removed or at least properly understood, the evil spreads less and involves fewer people. But self-love and blind and burning zeal, which almost universally rule in the hearts of men, hardly allow us to reach the true causes of evil and to examine and scrutinize them more deeply. Hence, it is that the minds of men are in conflict with each other without end or measure.</p>
      <p>It is entirely evident that those who today occupy the first place in the church, bishops and pastors of the people, rule according to their own opinion and desire, having avarice, ambition, and luxury as their worst advisors.</p>
      <p>Deceived and blinded by these, they disdain to hear the word of God, the only rule for rightly governing and living, indeed they even hire certain Bosorides Balaamites for the wages of unrighteousness, who speak against the sincere truth and defend their most corrupt doctrines and morals against the proponents of evangelical doctrine. Therefore, since they are not turned away from their evil path, but even wish to defend their wickedness and surpass themselves in wrongdoing, the trumpet of the word of God sounds against them more and more, and the battle grows fiercer. If they would give glory to God, if they would hear the word of God and turn from their errors and wickedness to truth and sincerity, there would be less contention in the church and more sacred peace; but now through their impenitence, both the battle and scandals are renewed. Woe to those through whom offenses come!</p>
      <p>There are others who indeed hear the word of God, but meanwhile refuse to renounce their desires, not knowing that they are called by the preaching of the gospel to holiness, not to impurity. They impatiently endure the rebuke of the servants of God, accuse the ferocity of the churchmen, and complain about the petulance of their tongues. "We do not dislike the gospel of Christ," they say, "but we dislike that constancy and impropriety in rebuking; we seek evangelical leniency in them." But the sacred preachers thunder that word of the Lord from the mouth of Isaiah and say: "This is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear the law of the Lord. For they say to the seers, 'See not,' and to the prophets, 'Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits. Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us'" [Isaiah 30:9-11]. Therefore, the battle intensifies, which could easily be resolved if the wicked cohort understood this: first, that the Son of God came into the world to destroy the works of the devil, then, that it was prescribed to the prophets by the Lord in these words: "Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins" [Isaiah 58:1]. Because we all seek the world and the flesh, and no one bears it more equitably if you handle their sores more harshly, the preachers meanwhile neither wish nor ought to touch the scabby sores, therefore the contest grows daily through our wickedness, and the battle remains and will remain until the Lord either calls the faithful teachers to Himself, to soon cut us rebellious ones off entirely, or the wicked turn from their evil way, are ashamed of their evil, and do good.</p>
      <p>There are again among the most evangelical not a few who, by their levity and inconstancy, provide exceedingly rich and abundant material for conflicts, while they now think and speak about religion in one way, and then in another, not so much because they regret the confessed truth or because they seem to themselves to have held a wrong opinion before, but because by that versatility of theirs they seek to ingratiate themselves with those whom they either fear or too reverently and foolishly admire and adore. But if, laying aside fear and excessive regard for men, they would look to God Himself and pure truth, they would indeed cry out with the apostle: "We profess our faith, not to please men, but God, neither seeking glory or advantage from men, but to prove ourselves to God, who called us in sincerity and truth." And thus there would also be more peace in the church and fewer scandals.</p>
      <p>Some others want to appear as if they have discovered or seen something new, which no one before them has seen. Because they are vexed by vain glory, it is amazing how they despise all others before them, how much they sell their own things for, and how they speak calumniously about the things of others, but gloriously and boastfully about their own. They do not want to have anything in common with others, they want to impose their own things on everyone.</p>
      <p>Therefore, although others do not think badly or say the same thing as they do, using a different figure of speech in the meantime, they nevertheless rejoice to have something peculiar and to seem to follow something entirely different, men born to foster schisms. To these, if the apostle were to return, he would cry out with great spirit: "If there be therefore any consolation in Christ Jesus, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind, let nothing be done through strife or vainglory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves, look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others" [Philippians 2:1-4]. Therefore, peace could also be restored to these if they would renounce their bitter and ulcerous affections and be less obstinate, arrogant, and stiff-necked. In vain, however, is either complaint or speech about peace and concord instituted, in vain finally is there agreement, unless such wicked affections are restrained in the mind.</p>
      <p>From the same source of pride, envy, and vain and arrogant display also erupts that some today, forgetting apostolic simplicity, assume a philosophical or, if you prefer, pneumatic brow, and introduce a new kind of speaking or teaching about the Lord Christ. For they arrogate to themselves a principal spirit, polished, high, intense, and profound, and they seem to themselves to speak nothing but pure oracles. And indeed, the lid finds its pot, light and curious men, who are astonished at their metaphysical and pneumatic phantasms as if at a doctrine brought from the third heaven. If anyone preaches to them Jesus Christ, true God and man, as the apostles preached, incarnate, suffered, crucified, dead, and buried, raised on the third day and received into heaven after forty days, and there retains the deposit of our flesh to be raised again in glory, since He is our brother, our life and resurrection, our priest and intercessor with the Father in heaven, you will not seem to have spoken highly enough, intensely, subtly, and spiritually about the mystery of Christ. For they have more divine and convoluted secrets about the flesh of Christ, which meanwhile they do not explain to their foolish listeners, but entangle them, so that in the end, they do not know what Christ is or what our hope is, losing Christ in their vain subtleties.</p>
      <p>And from these and similar causes, not to pursue all, schisms and dissensions arise today in the church, nor is there hope that they will be composed unless those wicked and petulant affections are first put to rest. Above all, the simpler ones are disturbed, the truth and peace are hindered by the last of that pneumatic kind. For ignorance and foolish admiration of things deceive the simpler ones.</p>
      <p>They do not see that what these bring forth with such hypocrisy and testimony is the ancient deception of the devil, by which he also once fascinated the eyes of many.</p>
      <p>They are ignorant of histories, they do not read the writings of the ancients, who themselves not unsuccessfully handled the sacred letters, especially against heresies; but they contemptuously despise them, indeed they believe themselves to be more perfect the more constantly and obstinately they despise them. And although there are those who do not despise everything, they lack books and do not take enough leisure and time to know some things of the ancients even superficially; moreover, they do not know who among such a crowd are especially to be read. And there are indeed those whose reading has not been very beneficial. Therefore, so that the causes of dissensions and errors may be somewhat removed even in this matter and those who wish to be advised may judge more cautiously and rightly about these Sibylline leaves, which they foolishly admire without understanding, I have published that orthodox letter of Doctor Joachim Vadian, which explains this question, whether the body of Christ, because of its inseparable union with the Word, assumes conditions alien to the body. For in this he briefly treats whatever is worth knowing about the mystery of the Lord's incarnation.</p>
      <p>And first he discusses that union, which from the truth of the two natures constitutes the person of Christ. Then he disputes about the conditions which that assumption in Christ sustained before the resurrection. Finally, he writes about the conditions which the body of Christ assumed after the resurrection. He has interwoven with these what both the orthodox ancients and the heretics with evil opinions have produced on these topics. I have added to this letter the five books of Saint Vigilius, martyr and bishop of Trento, which he wrote against Eutyches first, then also against other heretics with impious opinions about the Lord Christ, and they wonderfully agree with the previous argument. I promise myself certainly that those who have hitherto woven I know not what subtleties will speak much more simply and purely about the Lord Christ and His glorified flesh, after they have known these of ours more diligently.</p>
      <p>However, there is no need for anyone here to expect encomiums and commendation of the authors. Both are very well known to the world. The piety and erudition of both are most well attested by their published books. Therefore, it seemed better to be silent about these very great men than to say little. He wrote at my request, for his incredible kindness and most dutiful zeal towards me, the letter which I present and which I alone did not wish to possess and occupy as a very great treasure. Vigilius, however, published his books against Eutyches a thousand years ago, explaining and overturning with wonderful brevity and clarity whatever was of this heresy. Leo, the Roman bishop, and Gelasius, bishop of the same church, also wrote against Eutyches, as well as Fulgentius of Africa, a man most learned in divine and human letters, in his third book to King Thrasamund; but no one, as it seems to me, wrote more succinctly and better than our Vigilius, who also frequently touches and refutes the erroneous doctrine of Nestorius, but only perfunctorily and in passing. More copious, not to mention Cyril, whom others believe to have been too harsh in this cause, was given by John Maxentius, servant of God, whose two books of Dialogues against Nestorius to Theophilus are extant and not unlearned. But the work of our Vigilius was printed in Tübingen ten years ago, but, not to dissemble anything, not very diligently and accurately. Greater diligence in this our edition will be commended by those who compare it with the first edition. I have also written the life of Vigilius and prefixed individual arguments to each book, with indexes and chapters of things noted everywhere, so that what the reader should aim at may be more easily apparent.</p>
      <p>To you, most illustrious Travers, I inscribe and dedicate this work in your name, because your virtue deserves to be celebrated and commended in some distinguished writing, not least by mine, among posterity, who are praised by all the best as most observant of divinity and religion, a fair and diligent cultivator of judgment and justice, and a unique and most faithful patron of letters and students. The Lord, the king of all peoples, has willed that you, together with other good, pious, and prudent men, should preside over a noble and most valiant people and through you, as through fathers of the fatherland, preserve that free, most ancient, and most powerful Rhaetia unharmed. Therefore, mindful of the calling and will of God, know that kingdoms and peoples are preserved in no other way than by diligent cultivation of religion and justice.</p>
      <p>Moreover, as justice is endangered without laws, so religion trembles without schools. Therefore, it will be your duty to both uphold the sacred laws and promote schools, so that the Lord may be with you. And indeed, the Lord has been with you so far, who has kindled the light of His word among you and extinguished and dissipated the papal torches and fumes of vanity. He has given you faithful teachers, who have taught Christ purely and sincerely. He has disturbed wicked counsels and delivered you from the hand of enemies. If you continue in piety, if you cultivate justice and promote sacred and good studies, as you have begun, the Lord will increase His gifts to you, and your Rhaetian posterity will be most happily and will praise the faith and diligence of their ancestors, that is, your faith and diligence, who with great labor and effort have given them a purified religion.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you for us, indeed all that Rhaetia always blessed and unharmed. My colleagues Leo, Megander, Erasmus Fabritius, Pellicanus, Bibliander, and the other brothers wish you well. You will greet for us Lord Anton Travers and all that most illustrious family, especially those most faithful ministers and brothers of the Lord's word, Lord Johannes Comander, Johannes Blasius, Nikolaus Baling, Rudolf Salis, Philipp Gallicius, and other good men.</p>
      <p>In Zurich, in the month of July, in the year 1539.</p>
