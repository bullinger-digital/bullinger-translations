      <p>Greetings. The severe headache, which has relentlessly afflicted me for two whole days, does not allow me to write to you at length now, esteemed brother. What you write about the neighbors, Stegner, the Bernese treasurer, had already recounted here.</p>
      <p>I find it likely that they are deliberately seizing the opportunity for war, and are driven here not so much by their own impulse as by the influence of others. May the Lord restrain or mitigate their ferocity and at the same time counteract their perverse plans. I had heard that the king was requesting money and soldiers from you, but trusting in your prudence, I did not think it necessary to warn you about what this might imply.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote about the movement in Lyon.</p>
      <p>Indeed, something was stirred up, but by a few; they wanted to provoke Navarre in this way, but in a misguided manner. I, who knew that this was not in accordance with his interests and understood his mind, had tried to break off the attempts; however, because they had progressed further, the conspiracy was partially uncovered. Nevertheless, nothing worse was found than their desire to open a free course for the gospel; nothing was attempted against the king or his authority. But what the Guise family aims at with this new demand is clear enough from the edict, where under the guise of the king they complain about being compelled everywhere and forbid capital punishment, lest anyone lend anything to princes or other great nobles, and much in this vein. The King of Navarre, having been summoned to the court, is now on his way; he brings his brother, about whose escape you will soon hear something, but be careful that no one finds out before the time. The French cavalry companies are so arranged that they surround Navarre on all sides. The outcome is in God's hands, who may soon scatter whatever they seem to be cunningly plotting; having suppressed one head, they promise themselves an easy victory over all. Whom they call rebels, he himself openly declared in the assembly of nobles, namely those who wish to have a different religion; for, when in the supplicatory petition, which the admiral had presented, they profess to be peaceful and quiet men and always loyal to the king: "Behold," he says, "good and loyal subjects, who are not content with the public religion, who dictate laws to their king," and much of that kind.</p>
      <p>Believe me, I assert for certain, there is no danger of tumult, because no one will move unless perhaps they have aggressively attacked Navarre, for whose defense, as I hope, many will stand up. He has decided to recover his rights in council, but without arms.</p>
      <p>Moreover, because I know him to be soft and flexible, I sent a man to strengthen him; for Beza has slipped away, and it is not publicly known which side he has taken. However, that brother knows where he is expected.</p>
      <p>A delegation has been sent from Spain to impede the national council. It is mere pretense and deception, since nothing else is permitted to the bishops except to consider what should be referred to the general council. You undoubtedly know, what we did not expect, that the Lucerne and Five Cantons, with the addition of Solothurn, have concluded a treaty with the Savoyard envoys, in which we will be poorly advised unless you are finally touched by some care and mercy for us. The haste of the messenger did not allow me to write to Mr. Peter Martyr; it will be done at the first opportunity. Meanwhile, you will greet him and the other colleagues in my name.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect, guide, and enrich you all with His gifts! Geneva, October 14, 1560.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man, dearest and esteemed brother. Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and faithful servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, esteemed and dearest brother and fellow minister.</p>
