    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices over the letter from Myconius No. 284 and is concerned about the situation of the Reformed in the Confederation. The situation in Zurich is not as hopeless as many think; although some councilors are wavering, the church congregation remains steadfast. There is fear of war in Zurich, concern about the suppression of the Reformation, and a readiness for defense, but no concrete steps have been taken yet, such as the election of a captain, as long as there is no immediate threat of war. Due to a statement by Johannes Haab mentioned by Myconius, Bullinger wants to take action. There are rumors of a Spanish attack on Rome and the departure of the Bishop of Veroli from Lucerne. Greetings from Heinrich Utinger.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>There is nothing, dearest brother of all, more comforting to me in all my trials than receiving letters from you and other pious men. The common new danger to our Swiss homeland torments me miserably. Truly, truly, everything threatens ruin. May the Lord deliver His saints from these greatest miseries, yet may the Lord's will be done.</p>
      <p>What you advise should be instilled in the people, we diligently do, and not entirely in vain, although not as much as we would like. For although many have despaired of the people of Zürich, I have not yet despaired. Indeed, we have more in the council who are limping on both knees than is beneficial for the Christian cause, but the mind of the church is sincere and steadfast. We also fear war, as this miserable and recent disaster has almost completely worn us down, and the heat of this wound has not yet subsided in the hearts of many. Moreover, the best men fear that the cause of faith will be utterly trampled if the enemies still scatter as many faithful centuries as they did before, to the great detriment of the church. And when I now warn that we must be more vigilant, as the danger will be greater if we are defeated, they respond that they are watching over matters to the best of their ability to preserve them. Our people have prepared themselves today both in the city and in the countryside, so that they can avert the incursions of the enemies, but as long as there is no hope of peace, they have not yet appointed a definite commander or war leaders.</p>
      <p>I have understood what you wrote about Johannes Haab, and I will ensure that your warning is not in vain.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor here that the Spaniards have invaded Rome and that for this reason the Bishop of Veroli has left Lucerne. I interpret this as treason. May my prediction be wrong.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, 16th of November, 1533.</p>
      <p>My Utinger wishes you well.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Basel, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
