      <p>Greetings. I have already written before, most esteemed father, about the state of my affairs. Whether you have received it, I do not know. For I have not received any letters from home since I left Basel. Therefore, I write again and earnestly beg you not to interpret my departure in any other way than I have done, as I am ready to comply with you and all those whom God has placed over me in all things. For what alone deterred me from this place, where I am now, I find in reality to be without danger. Otherwise, I live quite happily and earn my living by publicly lecturing. Therefore, I give thanks to the immortal God, who does not allow me to be forsaken anywhere.</p>
      <p>Please convey my greetings to Mr. Jakob Amman and the other teachers, who are to be honored forever. February 20, 1540. In Paris, near the Plessis College on Rue Saint-Jacques, where three fish hang.</p>
      <p>Otto Werdm√ºller, your most obedient son.</p>
      <p>To the renowned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father to be honored forever. Zurich.</p>
