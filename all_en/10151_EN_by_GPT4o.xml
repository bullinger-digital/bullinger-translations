      <p>My willing service of my small means at all times to offer.</p>
      <p>Dear Heinrich, this my good friend is accustomed to deal with you. He has often heard from me how I have a good friend there. Therefore, he has persuaded me to write something up there, he will gladly take it with him.</p>
      <p>Although I do not know anything special to write about other than our health (praise be to the Lord). As for other current affairs with us, such as the armament against the Turks, he will tell you better orally. I ask you to give him good guidance in his affairs, for his sake.</p>
      <p>Again, my request is that you work for peace, as much as possible through God, and let me know if you have received my last letter.</p>
      <p>Your annotations on the canonical epistle of John, please send them to me, as I have lent the last sent to an Augustinian monk in friendship, and cannot get them back, and whatever else you have completed. And offer me in return, what you would like from me. I will always be diligent in the same and more.</p>
      <p>Greet all good friends for me.</p>
      <p>Adolf [Bitter], my nephew, has studied in Wittenberg and Brunswick, was recently with us and has traveled again. He sends you many greetings and says that Martin, Philipp, Pomeranus, Otto Brunsfeldius, and several others are fiercely fighting against you in their sermons regarding the sacrament. May you send me a short written and sharp response. I will ensure that it is answered to Martin and Philipp, with an accompanying request to respond. I want to commend you to the Almighty with this short letter. Let me know about your dealings, plans, and the peace of the Confederates.</p>
      <p>Dated in Cologne, August 12, 1532.</p>
      <p>Dietrich Bitter von Wipperford, schoolmaster at St. Ursula.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my kind friend to handle. To Zurich.</p>
