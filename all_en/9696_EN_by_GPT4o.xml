      <p>Greetings. Three days ago, I wrote to you, beloved brother, a letter which I thought could be properly delivered. But I was mistaken; for the person I entrusted with its delivery, upon returning, affirmed that he found no one to whom he could safely entrust it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he returned it to me. Today, however, when a boy from the Gessner family came and offered me your letter, I was delighted and asked him to return in the evening; for I would give him my letter to you. Therefore, I am sending the enclosed letter and ask you to let me know if you have received it in good faith. After the previous letter, I have nothing to add except that it is strongly affirmed that the King of France is suffering from a bleeding flux from the nose and mouth; and that his entrails are being eaten away and his private parts are rotting, indeed, if the reports are true, from the Antiochian and Herodian disease, etc. But I agree with you and say with you: if those men scorn God's admonition and refuse to hear sound advice, let them go, let them go, in the name (as that Italian said) of a hundred devils and add the thirty-three to it. The wrath of God, no blessing of God will follow them. But for the obedient children of God, let us continue to proclaim the gospel and expect and observe the just judgments of God on those other incurables.</p>
      <p>At Germersheim on the Rhine, assemblies of the Palatine, Baden, WÃ¼rttemberg, and some other princes are being held. Around Speyer, it is said there is a French infantry; it is said to be waiting for an opportunity, but what kind, I cannot say. Everything is full of rumors of wars. Come, therefore, Lord Jesus, come; protect your own, restrain your enemies, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with our lords and friends, whom you will greet in order.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 7, 1574.</p>
      <p>The restless people would like to move; but there is no money available, and everywhere it is said that even if something is started, the first payment might be made, but afterwards nothing more. Oh, justice!</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in virtue and learning, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable lord and beloved brother.</p>
