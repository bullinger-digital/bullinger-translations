      <p>I send a copy of my letters to the people of Bern, as well as letters to our friends Haller and Musculus, which I found these days in a certain book while looking for anything but them. I wanted to include them in the letters sent to you recently; however, since the messenger had to be dispatched, I could not find them anywhere after searching for a long time, because I had inadvertently enclosed them in a book. Now, even if late, they will receive them, and they will feel my duty in whatever way. Ah, pray for us, my friend and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>It seems like an age since I have received any letters from you. Please remind us in a timely manner if there is anything against us exiles at your next assembly. If you wish to write at any time, send it to the innkeeper in Winterthur, whose sign is the Crown; for there, Hieronymus Emporus, our parish priest here, frequently travels.</p>
      <p>My brother and my dear sister, along with my wife, send their warmest greetings to you and your household in the Lord, commending themselves most diligently to your pious prayers.</p>
      <p>Greetings to all brothers and friends, especially your ministers, in the Lord, along with our Gervasius and both Englishmen, Butler and Hooper.</p>
      <p>Farewell. February 14, 1549.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
