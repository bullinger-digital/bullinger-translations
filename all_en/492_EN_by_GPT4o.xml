      <p>S. I am surprised that in such necessary and opportune matters, I encounter such inconvenience, that while at other times, when I have nothing worthy of writing, I have an abundance of couriers, for almost half a month none could come to me to deliver even a small letter to you. For what I wish you to know is indeed small in writing, but certainly great in itself and extremely necessary for our republics, namely.</p>
      <p>On the 15th of April, my lords, the council and citizens held a meeting regarding the mercenaries who had previously fled to the French and were punished with the gallows, to restore their honor and grant them pardon. It is suspected that this was done so that those who joined the empire might also be pardoned by the cantons; not everyone was pleased with this, yet it was done.</p>
      <p>On the following day, namely the 16th of April, the council and citizens met again and read the decision from Solothurn, as well as the letter with which Zürich excused itself from attending that day.</p>
      <p>Thereupon, a council was held regarding this entire French affair, and there were four opinions: 1. that the community in the city and country should be informed that nothing should be negotiated behind their backs with princes and lords; therefore, representatives should be sent everywhere to inform the communities of the matter, inquire about their opinions, and then have an open hand to act according to the situation; 2. that the current articles, which the king should completely reject as intolerable, and if he proposes others, to hear them and again have an open hand to act; 3. that negotiations should be held with the king about common rights, how to give and take rights against each other, but not to engage in any assistance against him at all; 4. we have a covenant with God and our countrymen, also sworn together, that no one should engage with princes and lords; this should be upheld and look to God and let the king's efforts be in vain; so God will grant us grace and preserve us as His people.</p>
      <p>This last council decision was unanimously accepted by the council and citizens by God's grace without any contradiction and resolved to have nothing to do with the affair.</p>
      <p>As far as the letter from Zürich is concerned, I hear that it is not entirely correct that they reject everything; for they desire that the articles be sent to them; then they will deliberate on them, also present the matter to their countrymen, and not separate from the common Confederates. This is what I have heard from some who have heard the letter read; I would have liked to have seen it myself, but it was not possible for me.</p>
      <p>I would have gladly informed you of this sooner; but I had no one through whom I could send letters. But I hope: soon enough, because well enough. I have nothing else to write now, except that I am already expecting your response to my previous letters.</p>
      <p>I am also sending you letters from D. Musculus and Butler, as well as from Farel, which were delivered to my house in my absence without any others addressed to me. Also, in these days, M. Benedict Martin, who was called by your judgment from Marburg, has arrived; I wish he would not bring a Lutheran and contentious spirit, which I greatly fear; for I already sense something like that. Let us pray to the Lord that He may long preserve the peace restored to this church.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All the brothers greet you, as well as my wife, who greets you, your wife, and all your children.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the very day of the Resurrection, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Johannes Haller.</p>
