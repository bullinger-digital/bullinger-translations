      <p>Resolution held in Chur on the 10th day of January in the year 1561.</p>
      <p>On this day, the following communities of God's House, namely Chur, Bergell, Fürstenau, Buseno, Obervaz, Vals, Münstertal, Stalla, and Avers, have deliberated and, following the advice and command of their lords and communities, decided to accept and firmly uphold the following articles: Firstly, it is the intention and final resolution of the aforementioned communities that the articles, which the Three Leagues established years ago for the praise, honor, and welfare of the common lands, shall be upheld in all points and articles, and that they shall be fully implemented. Any resolutions contrary to this shall be null, void, and invalid. However, if the Two Leagues do not wish to uphold such articles, they shall still be upheld by God's House, and nothing shall be undertaken against them.</p>
      <p>Secondly, by the power and authority of the aforementioned articles, no bishop of Chur, nor his officials or servants, shall sit in the councils and assemblies of the common God's House or the common Three Leagues. Thirdly, as the bishop of Chur previously summoned a God's House assembly without request and did not include some communities (and also acted contrary to the aforementioned articles), it is the earnest will and resolution of the mentioned communities that this God's House assembly shall not be considered an official assembly, and whatever was negotiated and resolved there shall have no power or validity, but shall be declared null, void, and useless. Fourthly, a bishop of Chur shall be obliged to give an account of the administration and matters of the diocese, as he has governed since his election, also annually in the future, and as often as the common God's House demands it. Fifthly, the offices, namely steward, captain of Fürstenburg and Ramosch, shall henceforth be appointed by the common God's House according to the rotation and every two years like other offices, and they shall also be obliged to swear to the common God's House and give an account of their administration, and such offices shall be appointed immediately on the coming first of April. This resolution is confirmed with the seal of the common God's House as stated above. With this, it is also the counsel and opinion of the aforementioned communities, if it pleases them, that those who are bound and obligated by oath to foreign princes and lords shall not sit in the councils and assemblies of the common Three Leagues in the future. Furthermore, it is resolved, to the satisfaction of the communities, that anyone who sells an office with money, rent, gifts, or sells his vote for money, rent, or gifts, shall have their offices and honors replaced, etc.</p>
