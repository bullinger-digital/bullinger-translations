Vadian is pleased with [Stumpf's description of] Thurgau and will provide a written opinion on it. Bullinger includes the catalog of the provosts of the Zürich church by the hand of the provost [Felix Frey]; the catalog of the abbesses will follow later. Leodegar Hirsgarter is already working on the list of Gothic and Frankish kings; Bullinger has not yet seen a catalog of the Burgundian kings. After his return, Froschauer will bring the tables to Stumpf; Bullinger is surprised why Münster changed his decision. Greetings. [Enclosure:] List of names of the Zürich provosts from Rudolf to Felix Frey.</p>

      <p>Heinrich Bullinger to Johannes Stumpf, greetings. Froschauer, when I was writing this, had not yet returned, dearest brother; when he returns, I will ensure that you have Münster's rhapsody. However, I will not hide what a certain friend from Basel has given me these days, that Münster is now preparing a new edition and will remove and add many things. For what reason or on what occasion, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Vadian is pleased with your Thurgau, although he has not yet fully written his judgment on it. However, he promises. For I have diligently discussed it with the man.</p>
      <p>After I receive something, I will give it in good faith. I am sending here the catalog of the provosts of the Zürich church, as much as we could have. The hand is that of the provost. I will send the catalog of the abbesses later. Now I am sending here what I could have. I can find very little of the heavenly whores, but I will continue to search further. I think God does not want them to have any memory on earth.</p>
      <p>Leodegar Hirsgarter is already writing the series of Gothic and Frankish kings. Tomorrow, I believe, it will be ready by 8 o'clock in the morning. I have never seen a catalog of the kings of Burgundy.</p>
      <p>Froschauer will ensure the tables are delivered to you as soon as he returns. I wonder why Münster is now changing his plan. If you have any certainty, let me know.</p>
      <p>Greet your beloved wife from me and my wife. Farewell. Zürich, September 26, very hastily, at the fourth hour in the afternoon, in the year 1544.</p>
