    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has received Blarer's letter [No. 2546] and believed that Blarer had taken this from his letter [No. 2556]. Now everything is fine, as Blarer confirms the receipt of Bullinger's [last] letter in his letter [No. 2558], and Bullinger has also received Blarer's letters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger gladly read the news [conveyed in Blarer's letter No. 2558] from [Hans] Welser. In the meantime, he has also received a writing about the devastating lightning strike in Mechelen. May this be a sign for the fate of the Emperor [Charles V] and the papist religion!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The Emperor is moving back and forth to avoid a battle. If only he could be captured! Bullinger has heard that a battle near Ingolstadt ended bloodlessly for the [Schmalkaldic League]. May God grant a better end to this good beginning!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- It would be good if it could be prevented that the army [under the leadership of Maximilian von Egmont] joins the imperial camp. Blarer will see that the Emperor's plans will fail and all enemies will meet a very [bad] end!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Allegedly, 12,000 Italians are on their way to Germany. Care must be taken that they do not occupy the passes and the Ehrenberg Klause, in order to attack the cities in the Alemannic region and cause a division of the [Schmalkaldic] army.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger has seen all the writings [mentioned by Blarer], except for the "Conversation of the German Land and the Hope" and the treatise "Causes".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- That [King] Ferdinand is hostile to the [Schmalkaldic League] is, of course, true! However, it is important to cleverly disguise this as long as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Blarer could not have read Bullinger's [Luke] commentary yet, so his praise is solely attributable to his affection! When he comes to read it, he should share any criticism. If not, he should know that he already earns merit through his reliable reports. As for [Hans] Schöner, Blarer need not thank him, as Bullinger can hardly take care of him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Little was accomplished at the Diet in Aarau. The Bernese proposed sending envoys to the [three Catholic places Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden] to inform them about the exact causes of the war. However, given their increasing aversion to the [Protestant] faith, it is questionable whether such a mission would be worthwhile. It was also decided not to honor the Pope [Paul III] and the Emperor with a pleasant response.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- If [the Schmalkaldic League] needed another 12,000 to 16,000 mercenaries from the city [cantons], they would certainly receive them if they offered an average of 50 to a captain, 40 to a lieutenant, 25 to 30 to an ensign, and five or six guilders to an ordinary mercenary. This represents a lower payment than would be demanded from France, especially since the matter also concerns the [Protestant Confederates]. It is clear that Bullinger is only expressing a conjecture here and promises nothing. However, it is certain that the [Protestant city cantons] are very well-disposed towards the [Schmalkaldic League]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Blarer should inform Bullinger of any news in any case. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- These days, Bullinger is sending Welser a copy [of his Luke commentary] with a letter [not received]. Blarer should then recommend him to Welser in writing. From the latter, Bullinger expects only steadfastness in faith.</p>

      <p>S. D. I received your letters from the surgeon, and I thought, dear friend and brother, that you had understood this from mine. But all is well; for at the end of your letter, you indicate that you have received all of mine, and I have likewise received all of yours.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I gladly read the news from our Welser. In the meantime, I also received a printed booklet about the lightning strike in Mechelen. Truly, the judgments of God are marvelous! If only the Lord would signify by some omen what He intends to do with the Emperor and the papist religion! For I read that no temple remained untouched!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Emperor, to avoid battle and conflict, moves now here, now there. If only he could be captured at last! I was pleased to hear that the battle near Ingolstadt was bloodless for our side. May the Lord grant that a better end corresponds to this good beginning! I see that our people are eager and vigilant. If the Belgian army can be prevented from joining the Emperor's camp, things will go well. You will see many of the Emperor's plans fail and all our adversaries meet a very bad end.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>There is again a rumor that 12,000 Italians are hastening to Germany. Be vigilant, I beseech you, lest they occupy the passes and, having recovered the Ehrenberg fortress, this new army passes through and invades the Alemannic cities, forcing the united army to divide. I have not yet seen the "Complaint of Germany," nor have I seen "Why our people have accepted this religion and do not wish to communicate with the Council of Trent." I have seen the rest.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There is no doubt about Ferdinand's enmity. He is indeed your enemy. However, you prudently conceal it; may it be allowed for a long time!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>You have not yet been able to inspect my commentaries. Therefore, I attribute the praise you give to your affection. Read them when you have time, and if you judge anything worthy of criticism, let me know. Do you not greatly gratify me, who writes so often and so diligently for a long time and especially now; it is a most pleasant matter for me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Continue thus, and you have abundantly repaid my services and gifts to you, which are indeed small. Nor do I offer anything of humanity to Schöner. I rarely see him. For my affairs prevent it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>In Aarau the other day, nothing special was handled, except that Bern wanted to send envoys to the communities in the lands to inform them how the war is developing, etc. However, as the lands are becoming more and more obstinate in their unbelief, etc., I do not know if anything will come of the sending. Otherwise, not much good advice will be given to the Pope and Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I believe, trust you in good, if you needed 12,000 or 16,000 men and offered them, giving a captain 50 guilders, a lieutenant 40, an ensign 30 or 25, a common soldier 5 or 6 guilders throughout, you would not find unwilling people, and perhaps the cities themselves would send them if necessary. And thus, not so high a salary as in France would be demanded, as the matter also concerns us and everyone would contribute their share. I write these things from conjectures and from what I hear; I promise nothing certain. But it is certain that our hearts are entirely and well disposed towards you, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I ask, if good news comes, you will inform me precisely as always. Likewise, if bad (God forbid) also comes. God be with you!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>These days I will send Mr. Welser a book and letters. Please, commend me to him when you write to him. I ask nothing from him but that he remains firm in the true religion.</p>
