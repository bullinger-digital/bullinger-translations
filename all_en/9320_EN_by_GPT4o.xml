      <p>Greetings. You will learn about the main events that took place here from the enclosed letters, most venerable father. The assembly was dissolved at the Pentecost festival; but today they have gathered again, and whether they will go to the Valtellina Valley this week will be revealed by the votes of the communities, which were collected everywhere yesterday. It is certain for them to establish some reformation in ecclesiastical matters and goods, so that monks and priests do not indulge in those goods, while ministers, who have barely had enough to live on until now, may live more easily and something may be added to them. I am also sending the points that, apart from the first, were discussed and confirmed by the communities. - On May 9th, a miserable murder took place here. You know what suffering we have had so far with our two Anabaptists, Frell and Darde, but God has granted that they were both expelled. However, Gantner helped both of them back in. Now Frell is out again - because his wife is pregnant - so that he does not have to ask for baptism. Darde, however, whom my lords allowed to move from Ilanz, where he was known to everyone, has been lurking around here for a while. And on May 9th, at 12 o'clock, in the market, he stabbed his own stepson, whose real mother he has as a wife, an honorable woman, with a dagger without any cause, hitting him directly in the heart, so that it was his death on the spot; but he fled in this panic. Everyone trusted him until now, believing he could not say a bad word to anyone. Now everyone shouts: [Anabaptist, Anabaptist].</p>
      <p>Indeed, the magistrate indulges and does not want to act otherwise, except to learn from the damage received.</p>
      <p>The rest from the writings. If possible, I ask, have Mr. Lentulus's book printed; the necessity and importance of the matter require it, so that the mouths of our babblers may be shut.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly. Chur, May 12, 1573.</p>
