      <p>I received your letter, most illustrious man, brief indeed, but no less pleasing to me for being brief, because it contained the very indication of your old benevolence towards me, more than sufficiently evident. And because you still recall some memory of me, I must not fail to do in return what is not unworthy of your remembrance of me, and at least mutually declare that I often make mention of you and those like you, especially you, among good men, with the highest honor, and not only do I delight or touch others with it, but most of all I somehow cheer myself and am affected with the sweetest pleasure, and I wish for an opportunity to see you again at least once. I congratulate you from the heart and also him that Peter Martyr, a man of the highest piety and learning, has succeeded our Pellicanus of blessed memory, the best old man indeed deceased in the Lord; for he will greatly increase the honor and glory of you and your church and school with his greatest reputation among all, and from the daily association with the most holy man, you will perceive both pleasure and the most delightful benefit, and Martyr himself will not disappoint the trust in your faith and virtue, with which he has come to you, and it will be rightly judged that he would have found scarcely anywhere more worthy of his company. Our school indeed is endowed with such goods, from which such a man ought and could be supported, but, as it is discovered, it is handed over as if to be plundered and pillaged by one who values no truly pious and good man besides his flatterers.</p>
      <p>But things cannot be otherwise, where princes place their private advantage before the public. Concerning your young men, I can give no testimony other than the best about their life spent with us; so much so that I have heard no complaint about them, that I have often been amazed. Therefore, I ask that they may feel some reward or comfort for their innocence and studies above others, or even to encourage them to some honest emulation, those whom you have now sent and will send in the future.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man, and please convey my greetings to the rest of my esteemed lords.</p>
      <p>Given at Marburg, September 21, 1556. Yours with all my heart, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious lord Heinrich Bullinger, truly most worthy bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his reverend lord.</p>
