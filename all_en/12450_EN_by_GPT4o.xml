    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich has taken note of Bullinger's "opinion" [not received] and made use of it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The Papists will probably not wage war against [the Protestants] this year, because [King Francis I of] France, who has to fight against [King Henry VIII of] England, is an enemy of the Emperor [Charles V], because the Emperor has no money, and because the Protestants, in the case of the clerical leader Duke Henry of Brunswick, have already proven twice that they can react quickly and are stronger. The Emperor and the Papacy will likely be completely ruined.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Frölich fears that Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] might be persuaded to meet with the Emperor [Charles V], who arrived in Speyer on the 24th [of March]. Dangerous intrigues are to be feared from the opponents, which could be fatal to the Landgrave, even if the Protestants would only lose one of their own with his death, and God will set everything right.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Hans Wilpert Zoller is already with the knight Sebastian Schertlin, who loves the Gospel and has it proclaimed in the midst of [Catholic] territory of King [Ferdinand I]. Schertlin is wealthy and educated, he masters the Latin language and reads the [Holy] Scriptures as well as historical books. He has taken a liking to Zoller. He is looking for a [Protestant] preacher for [his lordship] Burtenbach. Perhaps the [Zurichers] can send him one.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Regarding the book [“Sententiarum tomi tres”] sent by Konrad Gessner and dedicated to the [Augsburg] authorities, the young Markus [...] will report. He will also deliver a letter of thanks to Gessner as well as [two manuscripts]: the work "De situ orbis" by Dionysius [the Periegete] and the commentary [on the Octateuch] by Procopius. However, Gessner should ensure that the [manuscripts] return to Augsburg! It was not easy to obtain [this loan] because of [Wolfgang Musculus].</p>

      <p>I have taken note of your Christian and reasonable thoughts regarding the worrying state of the world, and have used them as is fitting and necessary.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I do not expect that the Papists and their followers will undertake anything significant against us this year. For the French king is not satisfied with the Emperor; he must wage war with England. The Emperor lacks money, and he and the entire Papacy are on the brink of complete ruin. We have already proven twice, with God's help, against the clerical leader, the Duke of Brunswick, that we can act quickly and unexpectedly, which does not embolden our adversaries.</p>

      <p>However, I am concerned that my gracious lord, the Landgrave, might be persuaded to ride to the Emperor, who arrived in Speyer on the 24th. Much is at stake there; the dealings are deceitful, swift, and significant. Nothing is left undone! Should the Landgrave be won over or even perish by any means, the Papists would think they have already gained the upper hand. Now, he is a singular man. But God in heaven lives forever; He will turn it to the best. Amen.</p>

      <p>Hans Wilpert Zoller is already with Sir Sebastian Schertlin, knight, etc., truly with an honorable, dear man, as he now lives among all soldiers; for he loves the truth of the Gospel entirely, has it preached in the midst of the Papacy and in the king's land, and hopes to maintain it there, that is in Burtenbach. He has great wealth, currently keeps 10 horses, is well-versed in the Latin language, knows and understands the Scriptures and histories, and has now taken a particular liking to Zoller, so that, if God wills, it will go well with both of them. Sir Sebastian lacks a Christian pious preacher. If you could help him with one, even if he is not exceptionally learned, you would be doing a Christian and very pleasing work for him.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Regarding what has happened with the book sent by the esteemed, highly learned, and pious man, Dr. Konrad Gessner, and dedicated to my lord, you will learn from his young Marcus. One writes to him again with thanks, sends him the "Dionysius on the Description of the World" and Procopius on Moses. He may use them to his liking; however, the books must return completely! It took effort to obtain these things, because of the mice, etc.</p>
      <p>Let this letter be delivered to Bullinger, the illustrious one, who will be my friend above all others. Zurich.</p>
