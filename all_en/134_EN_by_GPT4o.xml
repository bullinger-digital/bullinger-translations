      <p>S. I do not doubt, my venerable Bullinger, that you have received my last letters.</p>
      <p>However, I am very eager to know what progress that Claudius of Savoy has made in his business there and whether you have lent him some money, which I had asked you to do in the letters delivered to you by him; for if you have given it, you will receive it back from our Butler, truly an angelic Englishman. He will also inform you in person about the state of our affairs. I would commend him to you, if I did not already know that he has long been highly recommended for his excellent qualities. We are now expecting at any moment to hear what our envoys will write through the courier and one of the servants who will bring back the horses. I know that you, as you do, never cease to pray to the Lord for the welfare of our city, I implore you. Since my last letters, I have not received a single letter from Augsburg. Farewell, my heart and soul, in the Lord. May 26, 1548. Greetings to all yours in Christ.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>It is said confidently that Duke Ulrich must resign from the government and be given some bailiwicks, namely Tübingen, Herrenberg, Balingen, Tuttlingen, etc.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the young lord is supposed to take over the government; he is also supposed to pay the Roman king two hundred thousand guilders at a specified time. The old princess is also supposed to have Urach. But I am waiting at any moment for my dear brother-in-law, the young Peter Schären, who always sends you very friendly greetings on his behalf; he will be able to provide all the information; then I will write further.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable friend and brother. In Zürich.</p>
