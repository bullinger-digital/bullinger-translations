      <p>May Christ protect you.</p>
      <p>Just as in the gravest persecutions we must pray fervently to the Lord for the peace of the Church, so now, too, all efforts must be extended, lords, fathers, teachers, most beloved brothers of all, to invoke the highest name of Christ against the peace of the Church, which I fear Satan, disguised as an angel, is contemplating in such a way that we will see and feel the outcome with great disgrace to us and the destruction of the Church. My ears ring not only because of the advice given by some, which you know, but because I hear that some of not insignificant name are now acting, namely Cattus, to entrust the matter of ecclesiastical concord to Sturm of Strasbourg, Besserer, the consul of Ulm, Bucer, and Philipp. Thus we grow in the word of truth, so that what we condemned not so long ago with full mouths, we now embrace with hands and feet. Alas, how we contended about the presence of Christ in the supper! And where is the presence of Christ in the Church, has His spirit vanished so much? Have the shadows grown so strong that the judgment of men must be invoked and awaited, what each private person decides in the most open matter of Christ? I would not believe that even the most sensible should be deferred to so much, not to mention those in whom more spirit and prudence are to be desired. "I did not come to bring peace," says Christ [Mt 10, 34]. That is the concord of the Church! But I have poured this into your bosom, so that you may pray most fervently for fire and sword. For you know in what order the kingdom of Christ grows. Oh yes, we must be set back on cushions and prepare pillows under every elbow! But do not spread this, my brothers. Among yourselves, invoke the name of our most beloved Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Then, to entrust everything to you, I send you Luther's opinion on the matter of the Eucharist. But it must be returned; for there was not enough leisure to describe it, and the messenger is already waiting.</p>
      <p>In summary: Beware of all indignation. Do not publish such things, which I want to be written for the dead. It is expedient that such things do not come to light through us. But pray that they do not come to light and that the Lord, the Lord Himself, may prove Himself to be God to us and may resist the disgraceful concord.</p>
