    <p xml:id="regest1">The conditions [in Graub√ºnden] are full of difficulties: The pension recipients have been plotting revenge since their regulation two years ago, allying with the Papists, influencing the [Chur] Bishop [Lucius Iter], and striving for power; [the people of Chur] are being mistreated in various ways so that they may submit again to the bishop's rule - may God assist them; Johannes Blasius faced difficulties due to his dialogue, he should have refrained from writing! Comander has been suffering from a headache for over a year, which he, being medically unskilled, cannot further diagnose, so he can achieve little in these confusing times; in addition to all this, there is the poverty and lack that oppresses almost all of them, barely allowing them to live. There is no news from Italy; expecting news from Bullinger from Germany. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and mercy from the Lord. For a long time now, I have refrained from burdening you with my letters, most learned man; but I could no longer hold back from informing you about our affairs. Our situation is dire and full of calamities. The pension recipients, offended nearly two years ago and impatient with correction, seek revenge, conspire with the Papists, inflate the bishop and direct him towards worse actions, and promise support. We are harassed in various ways so that we may be brought back under his power. May the most good and great God deign to assist His own. Johannes Blasius, my colleague, suffered due to his dialogue. If only he had refrained from writing, which would have been very beneficial for him and for us! I have been suffering from a headache for over a year now, a condition which I, being unskilled in medicine, cannot diagnose. I have become almost useless to myself and others, especially in these times when everything is perplexed, intricate, and confused, so that I can hardly bear it. In addition to this, we are almost all oppressed by poverty and lack, so that we can barely breathe. We have no news from Italy worth knowing; as for what is happening in Germany, since it is better known to you, we expect to be informed by you. Furthermore, please commend us and our cause to the faithful brothers and your church, who may deign to assist us with their prayers to the Lord. Farewell, distinguished man. From the Court of Rhaetia, 19.</p>
      <p>November 1543. Yours entirely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and brother, to be especially revered.</p>
