      <p>S. D. For several weeks now, I have had no certain news from France except for what is contained in these letters, and what Mr. Coignet writes from the court on June 27th, that the papists are in great turmoil, but nonetheless, the gospel is spreading far and wide. He has recalled his wife and family, who were left in Strasbourg, back to the court; previously, Mr. Roya also returned to France, leaving Strasbourg. Wise men fear new disturbances because there is no limit to the tyranny of the papists, especially in Paris. The rumors about Condé, as if he follows the papists' religion, are unfounded. However, it is true that he hinders many things out of excessive fear, and he is not so neglected and despised at court, but among the foremost. Some are not ashamed to affirm this as certain, which they themselves would wish to have happened; you might be mistaken in the name; for it was Erich of Brunswick who invaded the Bishopric of Münster, not Würzburg, as you will understand from the letters. It would fight against the canons and the authority of the council if it were concluded anywhere other than Trent; I suspect, however, that there is something behind it, that they wonderfully arrange, lift, and lay the execution; but the lamb from the tribe of Judah has prevailed. Now the diets are being held in Baden between the Bernese and the legates of the Prince of Savoy, and the legates who were in Basel have returned to Baden. We will soon hear what will happen.</p>
      <p>The prince wants much; Bern wants little; they will hardly come together. The case of the Claronese is postponed to be resumed in Baden on September 12th by the sequestrators. They are waiting to see how things will turn out at Haveldegras. The Lutherans wanted to devour the Bremen people alive, but they have ceased to rage, and the Bremen people are safe. If the Palatine perseveres, they will let them remain well. This cause is governed by God; He inclines it where He wills, and even if all should become wild, the... master Brentz will also eventually come to the forefront. God laughs and is avenged.</p>
      <p>The letters I send you here, you will return faithfully, properly sealed; use them wisely and do not share them with just anyone. I expect letters from France daily. As for me, I have been ill for three weeks now; today I began to return to the sacred pulpit, but I seem to be broken in strength, and numbness has occupied my whole body; my head is oppressed by weakness. But, what seems good to the Lord, since it is certain that this is the best, let it be done.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I write this not without difficulty.</p>
      <p>How is it that you have so little from Württemberg? etc. July 30th.</p>
      <p>Greet the brother, sister, nephews, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours truly.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Leutmerken, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Ambrosius Blarer in Leutmerken in the Thurgau.</p>
