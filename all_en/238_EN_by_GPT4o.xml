      <p>Dear sir and brother, I am now being approached by a man I highly trust, who wants me to understand what has been discussed recently in Baden regarding the French and other matters, and since I do not know about it, I am reaching out to you with my friendly brotherly request to inform me of what you know and what is appropriate; I ask you to kindly oblige.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write to you; for I am full of discontent and sorrow. Nothing more calamitous could have happened to us than these evils, which have enveloped us by the just judgment of the Lord; all pious people lament this with heartfelt pain.</p>
      <p>The Confederates have done us very wrong. Today the soldiers are also leaving, who were under Captain Studer, at the insistent demand of their lords, who otherwise do not want to negotiate unless their own are released. They are waiting for the messenger and the response, whether the Emperor will grant them an audience or not. Oh my God, how miserable the situation is, that everyone can see their neighbor's house burning for so long until their own is also burned. One must still fear more attacks from the enemy, soon the soldiers will leave the city, and there will be more unrest among the citizens.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has changed the entire government in Ulm and appointed a new council; previously 70 attended the daily council, from which he has appointed 31, 20 from the nobility, 10 from the common people, and a great papist as a governor, Nithart.</p>
      <p>The preachers were imprisoned, but have been released again except for the good pious Frechtum; it is believed that he will not be released, as he is completely betrayed because of his preaching.</p>
      <p>I was in great danger; for it is said that the Emperor will reserve certain persons in the report and demand etc. The one from Arri√ü said to my dear brother in Augsburg, the Emperor knows that he and I are most guilty of everything, therefore we must also, if it comes to that, be held accountable and punished before others. I have been in the king's blood book for many years, I have seen his handwriting about it. Yet none of this would trouble me if one were to remain upright; but since they want to accept the Interim and the priests again, I intend to act according to my conscience; for I do not want to be part of such things.</p>
      <p>It is a severe temptation that has come over all good-hearted people, as the enemy has been so strong and relentless, and we have seen such a terrible spectacle, and have had no help or comfort from anywhere, and we are completely weak and ruined by ourselves, no gain or solution has been seen, and the arrogance has shown itself greatly among the malicious, that it is no wonder by all human reckoning, that weakness has prevailed.</p>
      <p>With Lindau it is also over. Many pious and wealthy are moving away, as many are also leaving here. Tomorrow they will want to appoint another mayor in place of the deceased Gaisberg. Oh, praying and begging with tears for us, that the remnants may be saved.</p>
      <p>Dated the 23rd of August</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich</p>
