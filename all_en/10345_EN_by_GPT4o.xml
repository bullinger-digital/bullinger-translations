    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius is in despair over the cool response from Zurich to a delegation from Basel that sought reconciliation between Bern and Zurich. As heard from someone from Solothurn, the Catholics already believe that Zurich has completely submitted to the Five Places, leaving only Bern and Basel as easy prey for them. The people of Zurich apparently prefer the friendship of the Five Places over reconciliation with their fellow believers in Bern. The mayor of Basel, Jakob Meyer, saw much that was unpleasant in Zurich, although he learned from Hans Rudolf Lavater that the "good seed" was still present, especially in the countryside. The Basel council was appalled when Hans Rudolf Frey conveyed Zurich's response, and the secret Catholics rejoiced: God is evidently helping the Five Places. Bullinger should therefore call upon God for help, should not trust anyone too easily, and should devote himself entirely to healing the "head" of leadership in Zurich. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Never before have I despaired of you as much as I do now, my dearest Bullinger, after such a response was given to those who asked so piously. A deceitful and proud spirit is at work in those from whom this response flowed. I see the cause: The number of impious people is increasing among those leading the people. I fear it is true, as someone from Solothurn recently said: It is near that this entire heresy will perish; only two cities remain, Bern and Basel - for Zurich has surrendered to the Five Places - which we will overcome without effort, etc. Can I be free from suspicion about these things when I hear what they have done recently? I will not weigh each word individually, but in general, I say: I see nothing good, nothing pious in the entire response. The pious should have acted differently. If there is nothing that offends you because of them, why do you refuse the diligence of reconciliation? I know, you fear the Five Places. You do not want them to say: They have returned to friendship with those who so cruelly abandoned them in their greatest needs. It suits you to deal with the Five Places, who killed your people, who took away your goods, who branded the name of Zurich with perpetual disgrace. What? Will it not suit to reconcile with brothers who, although they have harmed, now seek reconciliation?</p>
      <p>It is not what you wrote in previous letters, but that they wish the present situation to change. That father of ours testifies that there is still good seed among you in the city, better in the countryside, as Lavater has narrated. However, he has seen certain things that cause him grief. About which I will say nothing at present, but only about those things which I understand from your letters. These were reported to the senate by Rudolf, one of the envoys. For the consul, suffering from a foot ailment, does not leave his house. Good God, what despair has arisen about you! What hope also for the papists! They say, we will see what good that most excellent God will do and is about to do with his saints through the Five Places, the most excellent and Christian men. Whatever they attempt, they achieve - is it without God's help? If He assists here, they cannot but be His. Zurich lacks nothing except the opportunity to return to the church. They still somewhat fear the people, for the senate has been won over, but soon it will be given that they too will change.</p>
      <p>How it pains me to hear this, most pious Bullinger, about your people! Believe me, the pain hinders me from knowing how to write. You see the perplexity. What shall I say? Behold, the disease is in the head. Take care, as much as you can, to heal it. Call upon God for help without ceasing, seek counsel, and do not trust certain people, about whom you have been too candid until now. Day and night you will consider with others the remedy for healing the head. If you do not find it, I see it is over. Hastily, these things. When it is convenient, I will be with you in more detail.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your people, with Utinger, Leo, Pellican, Theodor, everyone.</p>
      <p>In Basel, on the eighth day of January in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the first pastor of the people of Zurich, his very dear brother.</p>
