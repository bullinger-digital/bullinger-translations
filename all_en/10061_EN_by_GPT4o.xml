      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, dearest Heinrich. This man you see here is Karlstadt, truly a man such as Luther believes himself to be, although he is none other than the one whom Karlstadt himself proclaims to be. Ensure that he is guided on his journey, which leads to Basel. He is exceedingly poor, therefore, help and assist him with whatever you can, not to deplete our resources, but so that something from our means may come to him for his sustenance.</p>
      <p>Farewell and convey our greetings to Gervasius in our name.</p>
      <p>Zurich, on the 22nd day of June, early morning, 1530.</p>
      <p>Your Huldrych Zwingli.</p>
      <p>Karlstadt will migrate to us until divine goodness provides for him. He leaves with his children, of whom he has three, and they are sons.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the evangelist of Bremgarten, his dearest brother.</p>
