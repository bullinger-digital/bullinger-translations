    <p xml:id="regest1">The question regarding the meeting in Konstanz has already been answered with [No. 506]; the people of Z端rich could not participate. He thanks for the efforts to appease the people of Bern, whose fears are incomprehensible to him. The fact that he could not send Bucer and [Johannes] Zwick a confession from the people of Bern, as promised, is hardly attributable to Berchtold [Haller], but rather to the obstinacy of certain other people. He discussed the issue of the theological doctorate with Leo [Jud], Pellikan, and Theodor [Bibliander]. The scripture testifies that the ancients knew of different degrees but rejected any pomp. In the church, the selection and appointment of teachers should occur in an apostolic manner; how this is done in Z端rich is evident from the appendix, [the Z端rich Preacher and Synodal Order]. Bullinger refers to a writing by [Juan] Luis Vives and requests the return of the appendix. Regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I had hoped to receive news long ago; therefore, I wrote another letter, which you see, in which I informed you about what was done at the meeting in Konstanz. We were often summoned, as I previously mentioned in letters sent to you; for certain reasons, we could not attend.</p>
      <p>We thank you greatly for your efforts in the matter concerning Bern. We sent our apologies on January 12th. We hope they will be appeased. I do not understand what they write or inquire about the manner of speaking. We wrote nothing else than what you see expressed in the confession. Nor do we follow any other manner of speaking in this matter than that which was customary in the scriptures and among the orthodox fathers. Our apologies are more extensive than what we were able to write back. But I also promised that we would soon send either to Bucer or Zwick the confession of the people of Bern. Showing how nicely I send it, how well I stand! I hardly believe Berchtold is at fault for the delay in the matter. I suspect some others are either plotting or suspecting something, who, if they were as humble and pious as they are fierce and arrogantly curious, our affairs would be better. This I want to be written to you alone. But the stubbornness of some must be endured, and care must be taken that no root of bitterness sprouts within us. This is the response to the first two questions about the meeting in Konstanz and the people of Bern.</p>
      <p>What should I say about the third? I discussed with Leo, Pellikan, and Theodor what you instructed to discuss about creating doctors of theology. We are all very glad that studies are being restored, but in the meantime, we cannot approve of the pompous vanity, which is unworthy of Christian seriousness. In Antioch, there were prophets and teachers, but among those who had the most piety and learning, there was the least pomp. And who created them? We must look at something else in the church of Christ than what gentile and papal vanity suggests. We are disciples of Christ and the apostles. We must imitate their examples. In the church, concerning theological matters, we have the calling, election, and laying on of hands, which must be done entirely with prayers and without any pride and pomp, with the church present, watching, and praying. Our teachers are those who are appointed to the churches to teach either through sacred sermons or readings of the holy scriptures. The ancients, therefore, had several degrees, but without expense, theatrical applause, and pomp. There were prophets, readers, teachers, bishops not instituted for disputing or quarreling, but for teaching and living piously. It is pleasing that no one is allowed to teach in the church of Christ unless they have been approved by the testimony of the ecclesiastical. But we want the apostolic manner, not the Parisian. In Z端rich, we have no university, we have a church. But how we create teachers in it, you see in this appendix we have attached here. It would be pleasing if a testimony were given to someone who had diligently worked in the holy scriptures and was judged by the college of doctors to be sound in the doctrine of piety. However, luxury and pomp are always displeasing here. The church has its own custom of inauguration. Let it use that when someone is called to a function. As for the arts, medicine, and jurisprudence, we do not object to the ingrained custom, but in all things, we want there to be moderation. We are not displeased here with what Lodovicus Vives once wrote in his book 1 on Corrupt Discipline. You will take care, my father and brother in the Lord, most revered, that you agree on the things of Christ in harmony. You will return the printed booklet.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell together with Carolostadt and the other brothers. Leo, Pellikan, Theodor, etc., wish you well.</p>
      <p>January 14, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
