      <p>Peace and grace from God.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, knowing my health and my willing service to you at all times. And I inform you that it is quite calm here with us now, but much intrigue is happening everywhere; for I have given my speech this past Sunday in Feldkirch, where it was noticed how many foreigners are coming there, and they have been receiving messages from that hour. I wish that it would be reported to Master Ulrich, my dear brother-in-law, by you, for the devil is restless.</p>
      <p>Dated on Friday after Peter and Paul in the year 31, in Rheineck.</p>
      <p>Working diligently on the crown.</p>
      <p>Greet for me Mr. Schultheiss Mutschli, your father, who is dear to you, and my lord abbot and preacher in Kappel, all dear brothers in God, amen etc. In ill, in ill.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Bremgarten, my especially dear lord and friend.</p>
