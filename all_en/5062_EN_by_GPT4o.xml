      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father, today, which is the 17th of this month, I finally receive your letters.</p>
      <p>I will send everything back in good faith, if I can.</p>
      <p>I wrote very hastily 8 days ago; but at that time there was no one to whom I could give it; nevertheless, I am sending that copy so that you can see that I wanted to satisfy you. Dr. Friedrich has not come; I will write everything to him, if I can, carefully.</p>
      <p>I have now met with Dr. Hercules von Salis; he denies the truth of what the very persistent rumor about Jurtz affirmed, and says that the Venetians are indeed provided for by Philipp, but he believes that Philipp will attempt nothing. (Thus, I will not believe everything in the future, although what I wrote about Jurtz, I received from the consuls themselves). The Venetians are vigilant. On the 3rd, a message was received here, requesting that Dr. Beccaria and the schoolmaster be granted leave. But their request was not granted; it was referred to the community at home.</p>
      <p>They should deliberate on it; the sea should be considered. Dr. Beccaria is now, as I hear, in Chiavenna; we hope he can have a place there.</p>
      <p>Dr. Vergerius has been here for several days. He claims to be on a mission from a prince; but few believe him.</p>
      <p>He thought that the assemblies would now be more frequent; he was unaware of the response given to the pope. He came to strengthen the Rhaetians; but by publishing a booklet on this, he greatly aggravated our papists. He complained a lot in person that you had left his friendship without cause; but when I was about to say something, he did not want to hear me. For he seems to have this fault, that he wants to appear to have said and done everything by himself.</p>
      <p>He said many things about the sacrament but is slippery and contradicts himself a lot.</p>
      <p>He himself is coming to you, as he promised, and says he wishes to return to your favor. About the Council of Trent, to which he says he is also going, many things (I believe, as much as I can); he will inform you himself. He says that 4 cardinals are there as legates, among them Cardinal Mantua and Hosius, and about 40 bishops. I would have sent Dr. Vergerius's booklet; but since he is coming to you, he will bring it with him. If he is going to the council, he will not speak alone, but will also be forced to listen to others.</p>
      <p>Now I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>If necessary, I will write more with the evangelist from Lucerne; now I am called elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father, with all your people, as happily as possible. Our people greet you, especially Hercules von Salis.</p>
      <p>Chur, October 17, 1561. In great haste; I did not reread. Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>I will send your things back with the evangelist.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his always honorable lord and patron. Zurich.</p>
