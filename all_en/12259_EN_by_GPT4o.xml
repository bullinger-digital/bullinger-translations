    <p xml:id="regest1">Renato had given Peter Finer, who planned a trip to [Zürich], a letter [No. 2163] for Bullinger. In it, he thanked him for the sent [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae... confessio”], with which the opponents are refuted with the greatest restraint. The opinion expressed therein largely corresponds to that of the Italian [Evangelicals]. May God now assist [the injured] Luther! - In the treatise of the [Zürcher], Renato is not entirely pleased with one thing. They claim that in the meal (coena), besides bread and wine, the body and blood of Christ are truly consumed in some way. But by what scriptural testimony is this substantiated? The words “Do this in remembrance of me” [Lk 22, 19f] show that Christ did not instruct posterity in a manner of eating his body and drinking his blood, but invited them to remembrance. There are differences between eating and remembrance. The “eating” [of the Lord] happens once, namely, when one agrees with the Gospel from the heart; the remembrance takes place as often as one pleases; the “eating” is done by each alone and secretly; the remembrance only when one gathers publicly [for] preaching. If one does not experience the [inner] “eating,” one is by no means accused of betrayal; but if one participates in the [remembrance] meal without faith, one makes oneself guilty of betrayal. In the first case, receiving the body and blood of Christ is the same as believing that Christ died for [humans]; in the second case, the giving of bread and wine means remembering the death of Christ suffered for [humans]. - Christ’s invitation “Do this...” is interpreted by Paul as follows: “For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes” [1Cor 11, 26]. Christ has thus prescribed us to eat and drink the bread, not the body, and the wine, not the blood, to remember his death and our redemption; so the scripture also speaks of the breaking of bread and not of the eating of the body. The remembrance is to be celebrated, not the present or future. - According to Renato’s opinion, the meal (coena) that the Corinthians had corrupted, according to Paul, contained two components, namely a meal (epulum) and a religious ceremony (libatio). The meal consisted of other foods besides bread and wine; the ceremonial component consisted only of bread and wine. Paul did not criticize the ceremony, but the meal, as is evident from [1Cor 11, 21] and [1Cor 11, 33f]. Those who were hungry began to eat immediately without waiting for the others, and in doing so, probably because they were hungry, forgot the ceremonial dimension of the meal: Thus they made themselves guilty of the body and blood of the Lord [cf. 1Cor 11, 27] and were no longer aware of belonging to one body in a spiritual way. May God also restore [the church] this meal, as he has already largely restored the ceremony, so that Christians may again partake of the whole meal and not just a part of it! The [Lutherans] therefore labor in vain when they hold these statements of Paul against the [Reformed]. - When the [Reformed] are confronted with the [last] meal that the Lord celebrated with the apostles, the response should be as follows: In this meal, Christ indeed offered not only bread and wine but also his body and blood; the bread was to be received with the hand, the body with the heart. He urged the participants to believe that he would deliver his body and shed his blood for them to atone for their sins. Today, this is different: In the meal, a remembrance is celebrated. In the former meal, those present, among whom there were also godless and hypocrites, were urged to believe. In today’s meal, those who already believe testify to what Christ has done for them. If one does not distinguish between these two, one will continue to argue about the meal. - Now to the presence of Christ in the meal. The [Reformed] do not doubt that Christ is among the table companions, not in the flesh, but in the spirit, namely, as he wanted to be present according to his promise among those who gather in his name [cf. Mt 18, 20 par.]. Therefore, it is incomprehensible why many insist so grimly on the presence of Christ in the meal, as no one can doubt this. And since the Lord demands nothing more than that [humans] celebrate his remembrance together, nothing further should be desired. - Due to lack of time, Renato does not write further about this. What he has presented here, he does not consider a dogma, but an opinion, on which he seeks the judgment of the more learned [Zürcher]. - Due to the high cost of living, the papists who traveled to the council, who are not used to hunger, are said to have already left Trient, fearing that they might give the Lutherans hope for victory if they were to die. If Bullinger has news about the princes of this world or about the religious matter [in Worms], he should report. - [P.S.:] Bullinger should forward the enclosed letter [unknown] to Celio Secondo [Curione] in Lausanne.</p>

      <p>Camillus Renatus to Heinrich Bullinger, the excellent servant of Jesus Christ, grace and peace from the Lord. Amen.</p>
      <p>In recent days, I sent a letter to you through Lord Peter Finer - for he asked me to do so - and I did so gladly, as he said he would soon come to you and deliver it. In it, I expressed how grateful we were for the booklet you sent us as a gift, especially since we had not yet received anything of the sort, which we were eagerly expecting. For who would not be driven to write by that Luther! I especially congratulated you, both for refuting the adversary with the utmost, as far as possible, modesty, and because many of us, who in Italy devote ourselves to the Gospel of Christ as best we can, seemed to be aligning closely with your opinion. We read through the booklet. It cannot but be highly approved by us, especially in such a just cause. We are deeply grieved by the fate of Brother Luther, our brother, yet we hope that God, who once made him so magnificent, will eventually assist him in this matter, and we pray earnestly from the heart that this may happen soon according to our wishes. But in your booklet, to speak plainly as requested, there is indeed something that does not yet quite please us, and you would not take it amiss, unless, God forbid, you think that we too are not allowed to bring our opinion to this matter, since you write that such matters are outside the articles of faith according to your judgment, and we, with our brothers, namely with you, deal with all things as the most learned and also the most pleasant.</p>
      <p>You affirm that in the meal, which Christ himself instituted for us to celebrate whenever we please, besides bread and wine, the body of Christ is truly in some way eaten and the blood drunk. We have not yet sufficiently understood by what scriptural testimony this can be substantiated. But we consider that so much should be attributed to the scriptures by each of us, that nothing said outside of them should be accepted or defended by anyone. But when Christ says, "Do this in remembrance of me," with these words the meal is indeed commanded to Christians, we do not believe that a manner of eating the body or drinking the blood was prescribed to posterity, but only of remembering, since there is only one way of eating the body or drinking the blood; but there can be many ways of remembering. Therefore, he instituted a new way of remembrance with the same words, not of eating. And indeed, eating and remembrance seem to be very different from each other, so that they cannot easily agree. Eating happens once, when you first assent to the gospel from the heart; but remembrance happens as often as you please; the former is done by each individually, the latter only in a gathering and assembly; the former even secretly, the latter only openly; the former without bread or wine, the latter never rightly, unless you use bread and wine; the former to obtain the forgiveness of sins, the latter to testify that you have already obtained it long ago. The former you do when exhorted, the latter when commanded. If the former does not happen to you in any way, you will not be accused of betrayal; but if you dare to participate in the latter without any faith or diminished, you will certainly know that you will pay the penalty of a traitor. To the former, the impious and hypocrites are invited, to the latter only the pious and those knowledgeable in Christian matters are admitted. There, receiving the body and blood is the same as believing and being persuaded that Christ died for your sake, the body was given up on the cross, the blood was shed; here, to partake of the bread and wine is to remember and commemorate the death of Christ for us, that is, the body given up on the cross and the blood shed for the remission of our sins. Christ's saying, namely: "Do this," Paul interprets in 1 Corinthians XI as: "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes," I would like you to consider.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we think that Christ prescribed us to eat and drink the bread, not the body, and the wine, not the blood, where we gather, and that for a purpose which is indeed spiritual and sacrosanct, namely to commemorate the death of Christ and that we have been liberated from death forever. The scripture also, as you plainly know, calls it the breaking of bread, not the eating of the body. Furthermore, if it is a remembrance, it must be of things that are indeed past and therefore absent, not present or future. Lastly, it would indeed be absurd and unworthy of Christ if he had said: "Eat me in remembrance of me." Paul calls it the Lord's Supper and the Lord's Table, not plainly to which you recline to eat the Lord, but to which you recline together to testify according to Christ's command that you belong to Christ's fellowship and kingdom.</p>
      <p>And in my judgment, to say this in passing, the supper, which Paul wrote to the Corinthians was corrupted by them and not celebrated according to Christ's institution, contained two things, namely a feast and a libation. The feast had, besides bread and wine, other kinds of dishes as the occasion demanded, but the libation had nothing besides bread and wine. But the corruption was not, as I conjecture, of the libation, but of the feast. For those words pertain to it: "One is hungry; another is drunk," and: "If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that he may not bear hunger while waiting for his fellow diners." For it was not troublesome to wait for the libation; that would have been very easy for those who had dined; otherwise for the feast. Therefore, they did not eat the Lord's Supper, who did not wait for the others at the feast; and that was why they were guilty of the body and blood of the Lord and did not discern the Lord's body. But who would have thought it likely that the body of the Lord was eaten or the blood drunk in any way at the feast? And indeed, that Christian feast, at which all reclined together indiscriminately, was a symbol of a certain spiritual and divine union, which all had together indiscriminately in the body of Christ and blood, as members joined together in one body. This was undermined when each one, driven by hunger, indulged his own belly without waiting for the others, so that he was rightly considered guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, who neglected that union of bodies, by which, as I said, that spiritual one was represented, being ignorant, namely, of the purpose for which Christ instituted that supper to be celebrated indiscriminately and collectively. May that feast be restored to us sometime, as the libation has already been restored by God's kindness, so that we may more eagerly partake of the full, not half, supper! Now you see, excellent Bullinger, why I have written these things; therefore, those who throw those sentences of Paul against us, to prove that the body is somehow eaten and the blood drunk in the Lord's Supper, seem to me to labor in vain.</p>
      <p>But if anyone objects to us the supper that the Lord made with the apostles, to overturn our opinion from the things said in it, there is indeed something we can give to him unawares: we sincerely confess that in that supper Christ proposed to those reclining to receive, besides bread and wine, also his body and blood, the bread there and the wine being a likeness and figure of the body and blood. He urged those reclining to receive both, the bread with the hand, the body with the mind; therefore, we profess that they received it, who undoubtedly believed that it would really happen as promised by Christ, namely that he would deliver his body to death and shed his blood for the remission of sins. Those who certainly believed it would happen, that was indeed receiving it for them, so that those who did not believe or doubted would in no way seem to have received the body or blood of Christ, however much they might put the offered bread or wine into their mouths. "But why do you not concede," you ask, "that the same happens in our supper?" Because there he urged to eat, but here to remember, and the nature of both suppers is not plainly one and the same. Unless you distinguish one from the other, my Bullinger, I see no end to the controversies. For in that supper, which Christ then supped, he urged those reclining by words and deeds to believe what he promised to do for their sake, so that from that belief they might reap the greatest fruit, namely the remission of sins and the gift of the heavenly kingdom. In this our supper, all things are different: to it the impious and hypocrites and those who were not of firm faith were admitted; to ours not so. There, what was to happen could be promised and received in some way; but here it is a remembrance of things indeed past. Therefore, there the body could be exhibited and received as it is a body, as it is a thing, as it is something visible and mortal, and likewise the blood, in that manner which we described a little before, no one will deny; for those who were present there were to be drawn or confirmed. But in our supper we see nothing of the sort so far, to which only those endowed and confirmed with faith are admitted.</p>
      <p>As for the presence of Christ in the supper, we do not doubt that he is in the midst of the diners, not in the flesh, but in the spirit, not in a special, singular, and proper way, but in the way he often promised to be present in the midst of those who would gather in his name for any reason, whether for dining together or for any other Christian matter. Therefore, I do not quite understand why many insist so grimly on a special and proper presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, when especially we see that no other can be constituted than that which we mentioned in the divine monuments of the gospel. In the handling of divine matters, it is dangerous to invent something new from our own mind. Therefore, since the Lord applied nothing else to that purpose than that we should celebrate his memory together while eating and drinking, and that is the chief aim of the supper and Christ's purpose, we thought nothing else should be invented or desired by us. I would have written to you more extensively about these and other matters, my Bullinger, if I had had more leisure. But from what we have written so far, I would like you to persuade yourself that we have by no means brought a dogma, but our opinion to that purpose, and that we wanted to consult you, whom we otherwise know to be far more knowledgeable in Christian matters than us, about this matter. For as we are indeed devoted to Christian discipline, which is of the utmost importance to us, it often happens that we are anxious about our opinion. Therefore, it will be your task either to deter us from our opinion or to confirm it, and that, which we most desire, from the testimonies of scripture.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Council of Trent, there is a rumor that the flood of the papal faction has left Trent due to the high cost of provisions. For they seemed to fear that, consumed by prolonged hunger, which they had never been accustomed to bear, they would leave us, whom they call Lutherans, with hope of victory and triumph. If you have any news, either about the fortune of the princes of this world or about the cause of religion, which will be either a pleasure or a benefit to us, make sure to write to us most diligently. For there is nothing pleasant, nothing gratifying, that we do not think is announced to us by your most delightful letters. Farewell in the Lord, in whose name you will also greet the church of Zürich for us. The brothers here greet you in return. August 10, 1545. Caspano.</p>
      <p>The same as always, yours.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you would do me a great favor if you ensure that these enclosed letters are safely and as soon as possible delivered to Celio Secondo, who resides in Lausanne.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man and most knowledgeable in Christian matters, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich, most beloved and esteemed brother in Christ.</p>
