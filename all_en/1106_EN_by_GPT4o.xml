      <p>Greetings, most excellent man. Your letters have reached me, from which I perceive the sincerity of your spirit and your uncommon goodwill towards me. The sincerity is evident from the fact that you have borne the loss, which was caused to you by me, so humanely and with such an even mind. Although I was entirely without fault, since it happened not by my doing, but by the sailors', whether I should call it their dishonesty or treachery, I do not know. But however the matter stands, you have affected me with no small joy, because you have interpreted the whole affair so piously. Your utmost goodwill is apparent from the fact that you have sympathized with my misfortune and congratulated me on my prosperous affairs with such humanity. As for what you say, that I am mindful of you, that is indeed true, and not only one year but not even all the years during which I shall remain in this life will be able to erase that memory from my mind; this you will certainly know, as soon as I have the opportunity to prove that I am mindful of you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the study of medicine at Oxford and the expense, I have delayed writing for so long until the truth was certainly established for me. I have learned from a friend residing there that the Oxford academy is such that it should not be compared with Paris in France or the Italian schools, but it is one in which a young student can engage with great benefit.</p>
      <p>The same is true for Cambridge. But I rather recommend Oxford, because it has a far healthier air. Cambridge, due to the nearby marsh, is very prone to fevers, which I have experienced more often than I would like. As for the expenses, my friend said that thirty French crowns are sufficient for a year, to which if another ten are added, there is hope of living very comfortably. Ten years ago, in my time, 20 crowns were sufficient. But in these recent days, with the increasing greed and cooling charity of mortals almost everywhere, and that as a divine scourge, everything has become almost twice as expensive: which I think happens for no other reason than that we so proudly and Pharaoh-like reject the spiritual food of our souls, so liberally and abundantly offered. May God have mercy on us and grant us better minds, so that we may truly and sincerely repent at some point, lest, by abusing the singular mercy of God, we bring upon ourselves a heavier vengeance.</p>
      <p>I wrote to Mr. Gwalther, asking him to arrange for six images to be described for me; he writes that he has done so, but that 4 have been retained for two reasons: first, because there is a danger that in the future a window to idolatry might be opened; secondly, lest it be imputed to you as a fault, as if it were done by you for vain glory. But the matter is far otherwise. Therefore, I desired to have them so that they might be an ornament to the library; and your images might be seen in a picture as in a mirror by those who are prevented by distance from seeing you in person.</p>
      <p>This is not done, excellent man, to make idols of you: they are desired for the reasons I have mentioned, not for the sake of honor or worship. Nor should you think that from this matter envy could be aroused against you: for besides me (who wishes your reputation and honor to be safe in all things) there is no one who knows by what means these pictures come to me. Therefore, I ask you, most excellent man, to allow me to obtain this from you. Please do not make yourself difficult in this matter, which is both trivial and will bring harm to no one.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man. London, December 10, 1550. Your most devoted, Christopher Hales.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Heinrich Bullinger, distinguished for his piety and learning. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>From Christopher Hales, Englishman.</p>
