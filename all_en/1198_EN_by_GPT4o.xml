      <p>Grace, peace, and constancy in these especially perilous times to you, most learned and pious Bullinger, I wish and pray from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>Since your writings and your benevolence towards foreigners have so commended you to all Christians in Lower Germany (who indeed are not swayed by the prejudices of some), that they praise you and your church for the purity of doctrine and ceremonies and the integrity of life, and prefer you to others. Therefore, moved by this most famous reputation of your honest and pious name, certain men from Kampen and Amsterdam, when they had decided to send their children to some academy for greater cultivation of their intellect, preferred, with the advice of learned and good men, to send them to you, where they might be rightly instructed about God and His worship and in piety and good letters, rather than to a place where they might be corrupted by bad doctrine and customs. But when they heard from others that I had lived with you for some time, they urged me, by the letters of a certain learned and pious man, to write to them about your school and what seemed to me in this matter. Which I did most willingly, both in their name and in the name of the church, and I not only described the custom of your school, but also what Haller briefly indicated about the school in Bern, and I approved their plan, since they indeed desired their children to be well imbued with the knowledge of sacred letters and languages. Therefore, they have now finally decided to send the young men to you as soon as possible. However, since parents are anxiously concerned for their children with natural affection, especially if they are forced to be far away, they have now also sent a messenger through the same learned man, earnestly urging me to commend these young men to certain learned and pious men known to me, so that their parents might safely entrust part of their paternal concern into their bosom. This pious duty I could not deny them, and I have indeed recognized you as a most humane patron of pious and studious young men, especially foreigners, who come to you for the sake of learning piety, as I have experienced myself, I now commend these to you as to another parent and would wish your piety to take care of them as if they were your own children, and if it could be done in any way, I would wish that they might be allowed to live and dine either with you or with my father Pellican for a fair price.</p>
      <p>If this is not entirely possible, I pray that they may have such a host, with whom they might be instructed in both doctrine and the probity of morals, where they might also have the company of studious and pious young men. If you take this care and concern upon yourself, you will have done us a most grateful service, and for this reason, you will have these young men and their parents, honest and liberal people, most devoted to you, and they will show themselves grateful to you, as is fitting, and you and your church will gain great praise among all the pious, if you send them back at some time laden with the fruits of your benefits. As for me and our church, I am well and live by the grace of God together with my wife, who sends you many greetings in the Lord and wishes to see your face and repay the acts of charity you have bestowed upon me. The Church of Christ among us still stands firm against the cruelty of the devil and the world in true doctrine and the purity of ceremonies, and now those who were advocating change have a better opinion of the true ministers than ever before. Pray, I ask, as you have begun, to the Lord for us and cheer us with your writings, which we now anxiously await. Meanwhile, we give immense thanks that you did not disdain to visit us with your letters at the last fair, which were a comfort to our ministers in affliction. They would have responded to you now if they had been made certain of their departure to you. Farewell together with your wife, children, and the whole church in the Lord, who may preserve us all incorrupt for the glory of His name. Amen. Hastily in Groningen, March 2, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Gerard zum Kamph. To the most distinguished theologian in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the most noble ZÃ¼rich church, his most esteemed brother and lord in Christ, greetings.</p>
