      <p>From God the Father, grace and peace through Jesus Christ our Lord to the most excellent and learned man Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In recent days, while I was still in Basel with my companions, I sent you a letter, both to keep the promise I made to you while still in Zurich, as I had pledged not to fail to inform you about my affairs, and because, since I came to know you and your writings and your face, I have always held you in the highest regard. For these reasons, just as I was then compelled to write to you, so now I have decided to send you this letter. Additionally, I do not believe that the previous letter reached you; for I cannot persuade myself that if it had been delivered, we would not have already received some response from you. This letter will therefore make up for the loss of the previous one, and you will know that we are here in Strasbourg, since it was not possible to stay in Basel, a city whose location and climate were very pleasing to us, and I do not say this because we were not received with great kindness by the pious and learned men of that church; indeed, the generosity of Bonifacius Amerbach towards us will always be memorable to me, and I will never allow it to be forgotten. However, we were compelled to move here because no conditions were offered to us there by which we could sustain the poverty of our exile. They themselves had, as they said, a sufficient number of professors, but, as the situation itself indicated, a great lack of students.</p>
      <p>With God's favor, I came to Strasbourg, summoned by the letters of Martin Bucer. Oswald Myconius, a most obliging man, had informed him that we were staying in Basel without occupation and idle. Nor did we come here in vain; for Martin Bucer did not cease to work for us with all his might until he secured a sufficiently honorable stipend for both of us, for Paulus and for me. I have been assigned the task of interpreting the prophets among those who teach theology; Paulus has taken on the task of explaining Thucydides. Thus, having been tossed by so many waves of the impious and storms of papal tyranny, we now consider ourselves to have found a peace that includes both piety and studies.</p>
      <p>May God grant that we are equal to the tasks offered and that we advance the Gospel, that is, the glory of Christ, for this is the sole pillar of all our actions.</p>
      <p>Martin Bucer has already departed for Cologne; may God grant him the desired outcome. We hope that through him many there will become participants in the Gospel, as they say the bishop of that city is not much opposed to it at present.</p>
      <p>I make considerable use of the services and frequent assistance of this good and kind Englishman, whose letter is attached to mine; for he is a very close and generous friend to me in Christ, according to his faith and liberality. I mention this now so that thanks may be given to God, the author of all good things, not only in my name but also in yours, for He never abandons His own and inspires such genuine love in true believers that they pursue the exiled members of Christ with uncommon benevolence and service.</p>
      <p>Finally, I implore from you the prayers, the proper support of Christians, and I impart the greatest health to you in the name of our Paulus, and I also send greetings to Master Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalter, and all the other holy members of your church.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, 14 days before the Kalends of January 1542. Peter Martyr Vermigli.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious theologian Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the church in Zurich, and especially esteemed by me. In Zurich.</p>
