      <p>Dear sir and brother, at this moment the cart is moving. I am sending you the beautiful Interim, that is (Heb: Firmament) which will separate heaven and earth. Oh, the great sorrow! My brother sent it here; it is poorly transcribed and in several places the speech is confused; I had to copy it, it makes no sense. Yet I clearly notice that it all means nothing.</p>
      <p>The best part is that it is all very crudely presented, and yet ours must all become godless villains if they want to accept it.</p>
      <p>Those from Strasbourg are said to have secretly ridden away from Augsburg; no one knows what it means (means?).</p>
      <p>Now they want to negotiate with our envoys before they send them out; previously the subordinates let the opposition and free surrender happen; now it is different.</p>
      <p>Send me back the Interim. Praying to God for us. Send this letter to Marcell. I would like, if you have this pretty thing copied, that he would also read it.</p>
      <p>Given on May 9.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
