      <p> Your most humane letters, most illustrious man, along with your most learned commentary on the prophet Daniel, were delivered to me by our Abelus in recent days. From these, I rightly perceive how much you value me, and I easily understand how much I, in turn, owe you. That you wished to write to me so lovingly and fraternally is indeed much, and I am very grateful: but that you have deigned to send me this excellent work of yours, full of all learning, and even, which I consider a great favor, to publish it in my name, you have truly done me a most pleasing service. Your kindness towards all is indeed remarkable, by which you are accustomed to render all who know you most devoted to you; but towards me, it is rare and singular: for not only did you receive me very kindly when I came to Zürich as an exile, wandering as if with uncertain dwellings, and pursued me with all acts of kindness; but even now, restored to my homeland by divine providence, you do not cease to love me, but strive to honor and adorn me by all means you can. As I diligently consider what gratitude I can return for your great benevolence, I find nothing at all worthy to repay these so great benefits of yours. Since, therefore, your benefits towards me are greater than I can repay with equal gratitude, for you give, and I receive benefits, I will gladly acknowledge myself to be your debtor, and since I am not able to repay, I will ask Him to repay, who has fully satisfied for all our debts. Meanwhile, I have arranged for our Abelus to deliver whatever token of my love towards you, who undertakes to ensure that it is safely sent to your kindness. I earnestly ask you to receive it with a grateful heart and, for your kindness, to regard not the smallness of the gift, but the willing mind of the sender. </p>
      <p> You will learn from the letters of others what is happening here and in what state our affairs are placed. I will say what is most important: the true religion of Christ has a place among us; the gospel is not bound, but is preached freely and purely. As for other matters, there is not much we need to care about. There is some contention about whether to use or not use papal vestments; God will also bring an end to these. Farewell, most esteemed man, and love me, as you do, and remember me in your prayers to God. I ask you to greet in my name Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Simler, your son Heinrich, and the other lords and brothers most dear to me in Christ. </p>
      <p> Worcester, January 3, 1566. </p>
      <p> Your most loving brother, Edwin, Bishop of Worcester. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, my most dear lord and brother. In Zürich. </p>
      <p> "Letter of Edwin Sandys, Bishop of Worcester in England, written in the month of January 1566." </p>
