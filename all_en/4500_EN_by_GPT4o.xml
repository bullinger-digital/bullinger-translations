      <p>The Glarus affair greatly troubles me; I fear that it may be over for them, especially if they feel no support from our side. Nikolaus von Diesbach has explained everything to me.</p>
      <p>Our people are displeased: 1. that Freiburg and Solothurn are also summoned to the meeting, 2. that the evangelical allies are not summoned, 3. that one should come together but not clarify what one intends to do if one does not want to let the people of Glarus remain in the right. It is thought that they have been silent for too long; now it is also up to others and especially to Zürich, since they let it be known that they will not tolerate so much being printed against their faith. Therefore, it is good to tell them in time what it is about.</p>
      <p>I wanted to remind you of these things.</p>
      <p>Recently, when your messenger was here, I was not at home; now I barely have enough time to write this. Herter was with us yesterday; he showed me Metzler's letters to you, for whom Blaurer, Frisius, and his brother also write to me. I can advise him nothing at all except this: Junker Hartmann von Hallwyl now has a vacant benefice at Bötzberg, where Leonhard, Gervasius's son-in-law, was before.</p>
      <p>I think, if he were recommended by you to the young lord, who is the feudal lord there, he should accept him. You can do much there.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I neither know how to advise nor help. This in haste.</p>
      <p>Diesbach, Musculus, Zehender, the treasurers, etc., greet you. Greet all yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, 16th October 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
