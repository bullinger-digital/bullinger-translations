      <p>Greetings. I received your letter in good faith through the courier from Kempten, dearest Bullinger; however, since it contained nothing other than the necessary, yet old complaint, and nothing else came to me, I did not think it would be beneficial to burden you with my writings unless some greater occasion to write to you had been presented.</p>
      <p>I will ensure that Musculus receives your letters immediately and that the others are likewise delivered to Paul Rasdorfer, who is preaching today in the Abtzell region at the church in Trogen. I suspect Musculus will soon depart to you with his family; I wish him to be as highly recommended to you as possible due to his exceptional learning and piety, and because he uniquely loves and praises you. The people of Augsburg have dismissed Georg Laetus quite honorably, as I hear, but for no other reason than that he has defended sound doctrine with remarkable freedom until now. Where he will go, I do not know; but the Lord will provide him with a nest. Our poor Ferechtus lies at Kirch an der Egg in the Württemberg land. An honest, devout merchant, who knows and has experienced much about the emperor's affairs, has confidentially informed me that the imperial majesty will not wage any civil war this autumn; but for the coming year, such a powerful armament is to be prepared and undertaken, the likes of which have not been seen in recent years; yet no one can know against whom and for what purpose. Finally, it is publicly announced again and again that he will not leave the freedom of the Swiss unchallenged, and he also trusts that he will not keep the German nation obedient unless he makes the Swiss obedient above all else, etc. Farewell and expect longer letters soon.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the ninth day of September in the year 1548. Yours sincerely, Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Zurichers, his most esteemed lord. Zürich.</p>
