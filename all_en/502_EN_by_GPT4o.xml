      <p>I convey all my duties as courteously as I can. I present to you the marvelous and never sufficiently praised kindness of divine providence, which takes care of my affairs most when they seem to be in the worst state, and things that seemed utterly impossible to me have happened. When I was intent on a journey to the valley of the Inn, behold, a young man heading straight to Zurich to me with two Polish letters and one Latin. He recognized me not quite quickly but well enough, promised and offered the letters, and I, terrified, hesitated, doubting whether I should read them. What more can I say to you? I understood from those letters that many letters were deposited for me in Antwerp on the penultimate day of January, and, as I suspect, perhaps also money. I also learned something from Poland, but I will understand everything better from the letters that are in Antwerp. Therefore, I suddenly changed my mind and set out for Antwerp, for it would be in vain to strive for Venice now. I immediately decided to write this to you, my most esteemed friend. The servant who offered me the letters first sought me in Strasbourg at the end of February, learned in Venice that I had set out for Bern and Zurich, and did not want to name the authors. My most esteemed lord Bullinger, I hope well, I commit myself entirely to God. I will write everything to you most diligently. I will immediately set out to John a Lasco as soon as I receive my letters.</p>
      <p>I beg and beseech you, write to him copiously about all your affairs and diligently commend me to him. For I highly value your authority. I truly commend, dedicate, and hand myself over to you entirely, so that you may be persuaded about me as you would about the lowest servant, since I recognize and respect Christ himself breathing in you. For your immense benefits, with which you have affected me, I beg you not to expect me to thank you with words; I want to prove it in deed, for I shudder at the crime of an ungrateful mind. I will send your money to Johann Hervagius as soon as I can without any procrastination. It will be your piety not to be annoyed if it is not sent immediately; certainly, there will be no delay on my part. I cannot hide my mental impotence from you. After I came to Basel (and that with almost galloping horses, for I had left the servant with my horse, who follows me), I encountered my most esteemed teacher Wilhelm Plancius, with whom I discussed many things in person. Nothing could have happened more pleasantly, nothing more opportunely; I wish I had that man as a companion to Poland; but enough about these things. I now come to that writing for the church of God against the Destruction. If I can obtain from you, most esteemed Heinrich, that something be added against that purple beast and his henchman Charles!</p>
      <p>For I already have a man who will commit it to the press. I have decided to prefix a great letter, in which I want to demonstrate that no nation has been so foolish and rash in adopting religion temporarily. I did not want to dare anything without your most holy consent. Therefore, you will write about this matter and others to me diligently and send letters either to Myconius or Munster, from there they will be carried to Strasbourg, and then they will be faithfully taken care of for me. For either I must perish or accomplish something in the adorable church of Christ. And since this book is to be printed at great expense, I would like to depict the impiety of Jeroboam in its true colors, who tries to introduce idols again not only into stone and wooden temples but into the hearts of men, the dwelling places of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, I await your most delightful letters. I hear Bucer has already reached England; may they care for the things of Christ. I have conceived great hope from this matter too, for I have learned that many books in sacred matters have been bought by the Poles, no money was spared, and I understand about the books of the Neoterics, you will understand better from Froschauer.</p>
      <p>I will write everything to you copiously, but certainly. I would write more to you, but I am not free due to great business, and these things are written very hastily (fenestinanter or fruest.), consider them kindly and fairly. I earnestly ask you to wish your perpetual benevolence towards me. Farewell again and again, most illustrious and friendly man. I pray to the eternal God, the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he may keep you safe in his church for as long as possible. I commend myself to the prayer of the church. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 2, before dawn, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient servant, Florian Susliga.</p>
      <p>Rozicz from Warsaw: A Pole subscribed.</p>
      <p>I ask you, most upright and learned Bullinger, to forgive the foolishness of my letters, for they slipped out, and I do not know how. However, I preferred to give them to you than to give nothing. For I not only greatly respect you but also love you dearly.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, supreme pastor of the Zurich church, most esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>"Florian the Pole, a notable impostor."</p>
