    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger apologizes for the late response, which is due to a lack of messengers and time. - He has gladly taken up Gerhard Westerburg's cause, if only because of his special talent. - For Schwenckfeld, Bullinger expected a different mediator than Borrhaus. He has known Schwenckfeld for a long time, and indeed better than Schwenckfeld himself thinks. Bullinger possesses letters from Schwenckfeld to Leo Jud, which clearly reveal the writer's attitude and also show how much he hates the lovers of peace in the church. This man is certainly peculiar, and not only in his doctrine about the body, the origin, and the transfiguration of Christ. Borrhaus simply does not know him well enough, otherwise, he would not have wanted to mediate. Be that as it may, Bullinger appreciates Borrhaus' effort for peace. - Harmony between [the Reformed] and Schwenckfeld is not to be expected, for the latter would never yield on any point. He only expects not to be bothered. Recently, Aeneas' [Schwenckfeld's] faithful Achates, [Jakob] Held von Tiefenau, wrote to Vadian that he is convinced their faith is the true one. What can be done with such people, especially considering that they do not understand each other? Bullinger must think of the [Marburg Colloquy] between Luther and [the Confederates], for which Bucer labored in vain. What Schwenckfeld and [his opponent] Vadian teach is evident from their books. Therefore, it is not necessary to negotiate further with Schwenckfeld, especially since there is no time for it and such negotiations would only be a waste of time. - If Schwenckfeld intends to publish books, let him do so! Hardly anything new will come to light, even if he becomes more verbose. This is already evident from the [handwritten "Summary of Two Kinds of Stands"] he conveyed to the Zurichers last year. It is also certain that the pious have no joy in Schwenckfeld's doctrine. Perhaps another opponent will even emerge. - Conversations with Schwenckfeld are also pointless. In Tübingen, Bucer already disputed with him, in the presence of Ambrosius Blarer and others. But even when Schwenckfeld was clearly refuted by Bucer at that time, he still claimed to have won. If one refuses him a conversation, he attributes it to the bad conscience of his opponents. If one engages in a conversation with him, he twists the facts so that he sees himself confirmed. - There is no need to come with the specious argument of Schwenckfeld's blameless, stoic way of life! It is solely about adhering to the purity and simplicity of apostolic doctrine: Christ became like all men, except for sin; after his transfiguration, he remained human, albeit without human infirmities. Schwenckfeld's subtle disputing is therefore not worth further attention. Rather, Borrhaus should beware of Schwenckfeld! - Greetings from all those whom Borrhaus greeted in his letter [No. 2254].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. Perhaps later than you expected, most illustrious and esteemed brother, I am responding. Although I had the opportunity to write once or twice amidst my duties, I was waiting for messengers, but when they were available, other matters intervened. Therefore, you will not take offense at my delay.</p>
      <p>If I have done anything for Mr. Gerhard Westerburg, a man of great merit, it was with a benevolent spirit, both because of your recommendation and for the Lord (and also because of the man's exceptional talents). I wish I could have done more for him!</p>
      <p>However, I would have preferred that Schwenckfeld had another mediator with us than you; not because of us, to whom you are exceedingly dear, but more because of him, whom we envy for using you so familiarly. I have known Schwenckfeld for many years, and indeed better than he himself thinks. I still have letters addressed to the late brother Leo Jud, in which Schwenckfeld painted himself in his own colors, so much so that anyone who loves the peace of the church would shun his company. That man has many peculiarities, even if you set aside what he has taught so recklessly in his published pamphlets about the flesh of Christ and its origin, about the deification of Christ's flesh from the resurrection and now reigning in heaven. As far as I understand from your letters, you do not yet know the man correctly (I say this with your permission); otherwise, I am sure you would not have written to us about mending concord, although in the meantime, I greatly admire your peaceful spirit. I will say briefly what the matter is, while also beseeching you to take my words in good part if they seem somewhat freer in places.</p>
      <p>I cannot hope for any concord between Schwenckfeld and us. I am certain that he does not have it in mind to concede anything to us in this controversy, but only desires, observes, and strives that we do not continue to be troublesome to him. His mind has become callous in the opinion he has once adopted; he will not change it by a single iota. Nor am I led here by vain or weak conjectures. I will recount to you what Aeneas' wandering faithful Achates recently gave to Mr. Vadian; I think it was Held from Tüffenau. He writes: "We know from God's grace and faith that our faith is the true, undoubted Christian faith, in which we also hope to be saved and to remain steadfast with God's help until the end. Therefore, it is in vain that you hope for anything from us concerning your new and unheard-of opinion or rather unbelief," etc. What then can you do with such obstinate people, who sell their own views as the truest and the opposing ones as the falsest? You think that those who argue do not understand each other! But that reminds me of the composition, in which Bucer played a role and expended effort in vain between Luther and us. Schwenckfeld's books exist, and Vadian's books exist, so it is not obscure what each thinks, as can be gathered from them. Now, what he desires to be done with him in writing is as if no one has dealt with him in this way until now! Vadian has dealt with him in writing. As far as I understand, some other good men have also dealt with him. But since he insists on defending what he has once accepted, it has been done with him without any fruit, but with great annoyance and loss of good time. But not everyone has such free leisure. Not everyone can afford to waste good hours.</p>
      <p>If he has prepared books, let him publish them! Those who have leisure will read them. Certainly, if he continues to be like himself, he will sing the same tune. He has published several pamphlets on this subject, but in all of them, he harps on the same string. He offered us a vast book written by himself in previous years, not yet published; but in that same book, he barely completed in many words what he said in shorter published ones. Schwenckfeld's doctrine is already known and recognized by most good people. However, it pleases very few. If he has written the truth, every good person will join him; but if false, obscure, intricate, slippery, the pious will beware, and perhaps there will be those who will respond to him.</p>
      <p>As for the conversation he requests from us, we do not see what fruit we can expect from it, both because of the previous reasons and because learned and pious men have conversed with him amicably, but without any fruit. In Tübingen, Bucer disputed with the man in the presence of Ambrosius Blarer and some others. But that good man fought with Bucer in such a way that even when he was clearly defeated, he still saw himself as a vigorous victor, and then boasted of miraculous glories among his followers; for it is indeed perpetual with him that, whether he is admitted to a conversation or rejected, he always has something to boast about himself among his disciples. For if you refuse him a conversation, he already affirms that he is prepared to give an account of his faith even to our most learned, but that they, out of fear and consciousness of a bad cause, neither want nor dare to confer with him. But if you converse, whatever you say, he twists it with a certain marvelous artifice to confirm his error among his followers. Therefore, it seems better and much more useful for the church to leave such a man to his own judgment (God) and not to confer with him at all.</p>
      <p>Now indeed, with a more severe life, he deceives many. But God is the one who knows hearts. We are not moved by a life, however severe and Stoic it may be. We require the purity and simplicity of apostolic doctrine in teachers above all.</p>
      <p>The purity and simplicity of the faith and apostolic doctrine professes: Christ the Lord is in all things consubstantial with us according to the flesh and made similar, having flesh from our flesh and bone from our bones, in all things, I say, similar to his brothers except for sin. The same confesses that he (Christ) remained a true man after glorification and retained the properties of a true man except for infirmity. Therefore, the human nature in Christ remained, glorified indeed, but not converted into God or absorbed, etc. In this faith and in the confession of this faith, with God's help, we will stand firm until the end. We do not care for his subtle disputing. And we, most illustrious and dearest to us and most venerable, pray that you take these things of ours in good part and beware of that man, whom you will someday know better.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All those whom you instructed me to greet in your letters greet you by name and most amicably.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 28, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Martin Borrhaus, his lord and always esteemed brother.</p>
