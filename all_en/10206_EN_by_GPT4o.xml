      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>I wish you would write to me with at least one word in this message about the state of your affairs. There are those who speak sadly about your republic. By the grace of God, everything is safe in ours. We have elected the most desired mayor, whom we all hope will apply himself to everything that concerns the glory of God. The people have never been so united and devoted to the word of God, even if you consider the enemies.</p>
      <p>I am sending to you what was recently read in each of the guilds (Zünften) by the authority of the senate. But see to it that no one finds out except you and Pellikan, my father. From this, you will understand both our constancy and our concord, which may the Almighty confirm and make long-lasting with His spirit. Amen. I have those who secretly transcribed this decree of the senate. Therefore, I want it entrusted to your faith, and under the condition that you return it through this messenger.</p>
      <p>Many of the nobility, as they are called, have gathered in Überlingen. I do not know what they are doing, but I suspect they are plotting against the Lord and His Christ. The Emperor did not satisfy them. Now it is likely that they will flee elsewhere, but not to God.</p>
      <p>It is written to me that the people of Nuremberg have abolished the elevation of the Lord's bread and, by publishing a book, declare this custom to be an abomination. Certainly, the whole church should applaud that Christ has such vigorous patrons of His supper.</p>
      <p>Our Ambrosius cannot extricate himself from Isny to finally return to us. In the meantime, I am anxiously burdened beyond my strength, as I am neither of his talent nor diligence to be able to fulfill this duty. Therefore, pray to the Lord for me always with my dearest father Pellikan.</p>
      <p>My brother, who loves you uniquely, sends you a Psalter as a gift and instructed me to write countless greetings to you. Farewell with your whole household. May the entire household of Pellikan, Leo, Karlstadt, Theodor, Steyner, and all good people also fare well.</p>
      <p>January 13, 1533, in Constance.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the truly learned and pious minister of the word of God, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, a brother to be especially respected.</p>
