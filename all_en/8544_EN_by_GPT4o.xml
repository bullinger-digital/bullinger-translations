      <p>S. D. Although I have nothing to write to you about at the moment, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, I should not miss the opportunity to greet you with a few words, given the chance provided by this young Frenchman, who has lived here very modestly for some time. Indeed, I do not consider him unworthy of the favor of good men, and therefore I commend him to you. I believe he will travel to France, passing through your area.</p>
      <p>I sent letters through Mr. Andreas Gesner and with them 100 florins in gold for the noble Schertz, acting in Schaffhausen with Jetzler. I asked you to send it through a trustworthy and reliable person, and I would like such a person to be hired for this purpose; for he will gladly incur these expenses, as he is in a foreign place where he is known to no one and needs money. I also earnestly ask you not to take it amiss that I dared to burden you; for at that time, no one occurred to me to whom I could more rightly entrust this. I also wish to know, when the opportunity arises, what has been done in this matter, whether you have received the money and when it could be conveniently transmitted.</p>
      <p>I believe you know that the Transylvanian is dead; I fear this will cause new disturbances. Such is the state of human affairs that, where we hope for good, evil often arises. It was reported that he had renounced Arianism; we were all in great expectation because of this. May God, the best and greatest, keep us all safe. Amen. On the 22nd of April.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Thomas Erastus. I wish to greet all colleagues, men whom I hold in the highest esteem.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
