    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The situation is getting worse and worse, may God help!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The unfortunate people of Ulm have made peace with Emperor Charles V and are allowed to maintain their religion until a council decision is made. This is tantamount to a denial of faith. They may only enter into alliances with imperial approval. This means the loss of their freedom and is intended to prevent them from joining with others, such as the Swiss Confederates. The people of Ulm have paid the Emperor a fine. Bullinger does not know the exact details of the other peace conditions, but the ones mentioned above are considered certain. So this is all that the people of Ulm think of the Gospel! May the other cities not follow their example. Such a peace seems good now, but over time it will be disastrous.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Johannes Gast should not receive the enclosed letter and should get the two guilders for the wool. Greetings to him and to Francisco de Enzinas. Unfortunately, Bullinger does not have the opportunity to respond to his letter [No. 2736]. Myconius should inform both of them of the contents of this letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] In eight days, a meeting will take place in Baden. Are there any news from France and the Netherlands?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings. In haste.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. The longer I write, the worse it gets. May God improve it!</p>

      <p>The people of Ulm, the unfortunate Swabians, have submitted to the Emperor's mercy! A peace has been negotiated and concluded between them. They are to remain in their faith until a council is held. Hoc est negare fidem et nebulonibus subiicere iudicandam, imo conculcandam. They are not to make any alliances without the Emperor's permission and foreknowledge. Hoc est prodere libertatem. This goes against the Swiss Confederation's alliances. It seems intended to prevent them from making any more alliances or becoming friends with us. Periculum, ne aliae urbes quoque sequantur. However, they will be truly oppressed later, ubi scilicet oportunum fuerit. They have paid the Emperor a fine. I do not know how much. There are more articles, but I do not know them exactly. The above are certain. This is their gospel! May God have mercy and grant others the grace not to submit in the same way. Now everything seems good; later it will become bad enough. Oremus dominum, nam sumus in tentatione gravi. Although the gospel is preached, the building (structure) is not firm.</p>

      <p>Referring to Gast. Do not give him the letter and give him the two guilders for the wool. Greetings to him and to Francisco de Enzinas, whose letter I have received. I cannot respond. Inform them of the contents of this letter.</p>

      <p>God be with you. January 2, 1547. In haste. I did not reread. Bullinger.</p>
