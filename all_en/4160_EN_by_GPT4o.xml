      <p>S. D. How grateful I was, most reverend man and dearest brother in the Lord, for your letters, there is no need for me to proclaim at length. For I had already completely despaired of them, since our booksellers had brought nothing of those things which I had diligently taken care of with sufficient industry. For on the twenty-seventh day of November, I first received those which you had sent from Zurich on the 24th of August, and they were broken and opened with another seal unknown to me. I do not doubt that they were thoroughly handled and read by the hands of malevolent people; but may the Lord repay them according to their deeds.</p>
      <p>I am glad that you received my letters sent from Danzig in December of the previous year; however, you doubt that yours, sent in springtime, reached me along with those which you sent at the same time. I believe that mine, written here in August, were faithfully delivered to you, from which you undoubtedly understood that I indeed received the letters, but the rest, as with your latest letters, have not arrived. However, I will take care, if I live, at the next spring fairs through other people, if there is anything with Froschauer that you wish to send.</p>
      <p>For all of which, I will be grateful whenever I can. You also learned from those aforementioned letters of mine what the current state of my affairs is, namely that I have been made an unworthy counselor of the most illustrious Duke of Prussia and thus live at court; however, I have the company of very learned and pious men. To Master Cellarius and your dearest son, both my esteemed friends, I sincerely congratulate on their marriages and pray for all happiness for them, and that the Lord may guide them with His Holy Spirit, so that they may be beneficial instruments for your church and republic. But you ask what I am doing.</p>
      <p>You should know that I am endeavoring to follow the example of those (whom you gave me as a model for marriage) and soon (may God grant it well) to be a groom. The sermon on marriage in your Decades was no small help, which I read and reread diligently. However, I desire that little book to which you refer us in that sermon, about which I do not doubt that it is more abundant and perfect. If only it could reach me as willingly as you would send it to me; I would hope to draw not a little piety, fruit, and even steadfastness and confirmation in my purpose from it. Timothy Gersonius, the secretary of our most illustrious duke, my dearest relative and diligent reader of your books, asks that I obtain from you a catalog of your and Peter Martyr's writings, as well as one or two copies of your books on marriage, also on grace and justification, of which you yourself made mention when I was with you.</p>
      <p>You cannot believe how much I have achieved with your books (Apology and On the Origin of Error) among certain pious and not ordinary men here, so that they even lament their former blindness, which I sincerely pray the Lord may remove from me and them entirely and from the whole world. The news here, I wish you to learn from the bearer of these presents, Claude Drohot of Grandval, a nobleman and very experienced in military matters. For how much exact knowledge he has of these and other regions, you will easily perceive from conversation when you invite him to a colloquy.</p>
      <p>For almost a whole year, he was in charge of the Livonians' military affairs, from which you will learn their entire state better than I could ever provide in my letters. Farewell and keep me commended in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Greet Master Gesner, Wolphius, Cellarius, your dearest son, and all the other brothers in the Lord, and know that I will never be unmindful of them, as long as I live (nor of you). Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given at Königsberg in Prussia on the 27th of December in the year 1559. Yours, Johannes Jaske.</p>
      <p>To the most reverend man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful father of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother in the Lord, to be delivered into his own hands. Zürich.</p>
