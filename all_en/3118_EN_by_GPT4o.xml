      <p>S. D. I received both your letters and those of the chief scribe of Geneva on the 24th of February in Regensburg and I thank you for the service rendered, which I also wish to convey to Mr. Roset on my behalf. Indeed, that man has rightly informed what should be done with the fugitive if he is caught in Geneva. Do not be anxious that you will be further involved in this profane business through me, as you have already done what was not very proper to ask of you. However, since Mr. Roset indicates that the man, possibly passing through there, could be imprisoned with you vouching for me in writing until justice is satisfied, and sends the form of the writ enclosed, it will be up to you whether you wish to vouch for me in writing. I pray that you do; I will fully release your pledge without any harm to your property or reputation, which I solemnly promise and confirm with an oath. As for the civil law of the city of Geneva, as Roset's letters state, nothing has reached me; however, I can easily conjecture that they are such and of such a kind that all the actors there should depend on them. Therefore, it will not be difficult for me to pursue the action according to them. Just do not hesitate to vouch for me so that the man is detained upon arrival; he was seen not far from Augsburg two months ago and obtained security for a transaction from some creditors, yet there is no hope that the stolen money will be returned.</p>
      <p>The diets now seem to be coming to an end; however, their outcome is considered meager. The contribution against the Turk will be scraped together from the poor populace and poorly allocated, peace will be feigned, the grievances of the empire will be proposed, but not removed. The rest remains in the previous state of decline.</p>
      <p>I deeply mourn the death of the most pious man Lavater from the heart. I congratulate him on the relief from his labors and the rest of eternal life, and I wish all the best to Mr. Georg Müller, who has been appointed in his place, to whom and to Mr. Consul Habius, the chief scribe, Peter Martyr, and the entire college of brothers, I wish to convey my greetings and commend myself to them greatly. Farewell and continue in friendship, as you are accustomed.</p>
      <p>Regensburg, 24th of February, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Georg Frölich.</p>
      <p>If I make any agreement with my impostor or if I have any other counsel than what I have written, I will immediately inform you by letter.</p>
      <p>[...] and highly learned Mr. [...]inger, prior of the church, [...] especially dear lord and friend. [Zu]rich.</p>
      <p>Finally delivered by the surgeon from Frauenfeld on the 19th of April.</p>
