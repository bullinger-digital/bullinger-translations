      <p>I inform you of the passing of the distinguished and, in his time, incomparable man among our people, Mr. Johann Travers, my father-in-law, who on the 22nd of this month departed to the blessed seats, leaving behind not only his family but also our entire country with the greatest longing. He lay ill for three continuous months, during which he exhibited such patience that it can scarcely be described. For even when he remained healthy, he did not benefit the country as much, even though he was by far the most beneficial man of our age, as he did while sick, tirelessly acting as a preacher of the word of God until the last day of his life. For there was a great gathering of people who visited him while he was bedridden, all of whom he received cheerfully and sent away from him wonderfully refreshed by the word of God; and he remained in that practice until the moment he departed from life.</p>
