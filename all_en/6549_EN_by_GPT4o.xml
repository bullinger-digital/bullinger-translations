      <p>Greetings. How my affairs are going, you have understood from those letters which I recently wrote to my brother.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I received yours, in which you congratulate me on the restoration of my health, for which congratulations I give you the greatest thanks, and also for your prayers, with which you interceded for me before the Lord. The Lord has heard them along with those of many others; blessed be His name forever! I pray to Him that the life He has given me anew may be directed entirely to the glory of His name and the salvation of many, including my own. I am beginning to leave the house, but I have not yet started preaching; this will happen when my strength is a little more restored. Meanwhile, we have also received what I now send back.</p>
      <p>I shared these with Mr. von MÃ¼linen, because due to the grape harvest, few senators are in the city, and both of the consuls are also absent. He gives you the greatest thanks, as do I, especially for the copy of your homilies on Daniel.</p>
      <p>You understood what happened to me upon the first inspection of this book; meanwhile, having recovered, I could not restrain myself from going through the whole along with the Epitome.</p>
      <p>This was my sole labor for several days now. You have freed me from many difficulties, especially in understanding some of the more obscure passages of Daniel.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I give thanks to the Lord, who has bestowed such gifts upon you, and I pray that He may preserve you for a very long time, so that you may still bring much benefit to the church through your labors.</p>
      <p>I will make an effort to show myself grateful to you as well. I do not know what this messenger brings; for he just now reminds me, if I wish to write anything, to prepare it; for he will leave within an hour or half an hour. Therefore, I have gathered these things and write these few words, intending to write more soon, when I have more leisure and have recovered somewhat better.</p>
      <p>My wife, mother, father-in-law, friends, and all brothers greet you. I have taken care of your letters to Beza, and also the others.</p>
      <p>Please convey my greetings, I beseech you, to Mr. Gwalther and to all your sons and sons-in-law.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 6, 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my lord and compatriot, to be honored with perpetual observance.</p>
