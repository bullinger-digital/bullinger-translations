    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Greetings. The senders Eberhard von Rümlang, Nikolaus Pfister, Johannes Wäber, and Jodocus Kilchmeyer have a compelling reason for this letter addressed to Bullinger, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and Konrad Pellikan.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] A dispute broke out between Peter [Schnyder] from Aarburg and two Zofingen pastors [Johannes Ulrich Göppel and Benedikt Schürmeister] over the authority of a pastor and the question of the Eucharist. It even led to a heated public argument in a square in Zofingen. Some people found it amusing, while others were upset by it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] [Schnyder] remained relatively reserved in this dispute and was therefore not punished by the councilors. However, he did not take a clear position on the Eucharist question. Sometimes he said that Christ was present in the Eucharist, then again the opposite. Although he gained the approval of his opponents, he did not do justice to the [doctrine] of the church. He did not clearly state that Christ is present in the Eucharist with his divine majesty, but absent with the body he assumed [at his incarnation]. However, in his sermons, he presents this correctly, as can be deduced from the observation that he is appreciated in Aarburg and peace prevails there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The two from Zofingen, on the other hand, were punished for their aggressive behavior according to public law. They cause confusion with their sermons. Moreover, they have suspended some churchgoers from the Eucharist, and others [through their behavior] have been deterred from it. They have also talked too much about the authority of the pastor, thereby arousing suspicion among their churchgoers. They reluctantly admitted that the authority does not depend on the pastor or his office, but on God. Furthermore, due to their unclear Eucharist doctrine, it is suspected that they are more Lutheran than Christian. Their lengthy explanations of the words "truly" and "spiritually" lead to the same conclusion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Recently, the bailiff of Aarburg [Vincenz Pfister] entrusted the entire matter to the Bernese council. They are to carefully review it and definitively resolve the dispute.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The matter was assigned by the council to Rümlang, Pfister, Wäber, and Kilchmeyer, without involving [Simon] Sulzer and Beat [Gering]. Since the matter is delicate and there is a risk that it could lead to further conflicts, the four Bernese request that the four Zurichers come to their aid in the interest of the church and make their God-given gifts available for the final resolution of the dispute and the enforcement of the truth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Urgency and utmost secrecy are required, as seeking external help could cause offense in Bern! The Zurichers should ensure that the messenger [...] does not learn anything about the matter. If this matter can be resolved in a good and definitive way, then the other problems of Bern will likely also be resolved. Thank God, the truth is increasingly prevailing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings. In the interest of the common service to Christ, the Bernese will certainly be able to count on the help of the Zurichers. Enclosed is a clear document prepared on the dispute, so that it can be argued more accurately and quickly based on it. The other enclosed letters should be delivered by Bullinger to the respective recipients.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace. Compelled by great necessity, Mr. Eberhard von Rümlang, Nikolaus Pfister, Johannes Wäber, and I are writing to you, Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and Pellikan, four to four. And so that we are not suspended from our usual studies by lengthy words, let this be the main point.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>A sharp dispute has arisen between Mr. Peter from Aarburg and two bishops of the Zofingen church regarding the ministry of the church and the matter of the Eucharist. This dispute has gradually progressed and increased to the point that it finally erupted openly. Fighting in the square of the town of Zofingen, two against one Peter, caused laughter for some and, as is usual, bile for others due to the diversity of opinions.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Peter was found to be much more modest in fighting. He emerged unscathed and was not punished by the moderators of the town of Zofingen as if he were guilty of fighting. Moreover, in the matter of the Eucharist, he acted and taught in such a way that he sometimes said Christ was present at the supper, and at other times not at all. In this, he seems to have thought correctly according to his accusers, but he did not satisfy the church because he did not clearly explain his mind. Present indeed by divine majesty, but absent by the assumed body. However, this distinction is abundantly testified to have been clearly added in his other sermons, as evidenced by the sincere love of the Aarburg church for its pastor and the mutual tranquility and holy concord of the church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>On the contrary, the Zofingen pastors fought in such a way that they were punished by the townspeople according to public law, and by disturbing the church with their sermons, they suspended some from participation in the sacred table and completely removed others. For they babbled on about the ministry of the church, concluding coldly and tardily that the fruit belongs to God, not the minister or the ministry, making themselves suspect of seeking dominion not only among us but also among their parishioners. Furthermore, in the matter of the Eucharist, they teach so obscurely and ambiguously that many understand them to be more Lutheran than Christian. They explain the word "truly" to many, as well as "spiritually," which certainly would not need explanation unless they were trying to introduce clouds and secretly bring in Luther.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>But now I will explain to you what has been done. Recently, the entire matter was referred by the proconsul of Aarburg to the magnificent Bernese council, so that after carefully discussing and examining the matters for both sides, a final hand could be put to the dispute.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The council transferred the entire matter to Mr. Eberhard, Nikolaus, Wäber, and me, excluding Sulzer and our Beat. Since this seemed quite arduous to us (and could easily not be finished but rather give rise to new disputes and tricks), we decided among ourselves to make you, Bibliander, Rudolf, Pellikan, our brothers in the Lord, participants in this cause and our labors, beseeching by the mercy of God and the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ and the salvation of the church, that you extend your strength with us to compose the matter in such a way that the truth appears to be vigorously vindicated by all, and thus to have won, so that in the future the ardor of daring such things in others may be extinguished. And if our opinion or declaration is to be made manifest to all Christians, then we should neither be ashamed nor regret it. Of this, we have no doubt, if you would deign to contribute your talents received from the Lord to the profit of the Lord and the salvation of the church of God with us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>In this matter, haste is required, and everything must be done in utmost silence. For we do not know whether it would be pleasing to accomplish what has been entrusted to us with external help. And the messenger from you should be received and sent back in such a way that he understands nothing of what is currently being discussed among us. We hope, brothers, that with this matter manfully and once for all composed with dignity, the remaining issues by which the churches among us are attacked will be easily brought into order. For the truth increasingly extends and vindicates itself. Praise be to God!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord always, who, as he has placed us as ministers for the common use of his holy church, so also for the glory of the Lord and the salvation of his churches, do not hesitate to add your arms with us, who are fighting in Bern. Farewell again. We have distinguished the matter of contention into certain heads, so that it may appear more briefly and clearly what and how to respond to each point conveniently and should be done. The remaining letters attached to yours will be yours to weigh and to return to each what is theirs. Given in Bern, January 11, 1547. I. K., yours to the altar.</p>
      <p>To my dear honorable lord and brother Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
