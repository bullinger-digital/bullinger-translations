      <p>Greetings and best wishes. The royal envoy is still staying here at the Stork Inn, and I believe he will depart tomorrow. He has discussed various matters with me in a friendly manner.</p>
      <p>I am suffering from diarrhea (pardon my words), and I have never been able to either have lunch or dinner with him. He wanted to give me a remarkable token of friendship out of his kindness; however, I thanked him and accepted nothing, promising to continue our friendship in Christ. You know that the 7 Cantons, that is, the people of Fribourg with those of Solothurn and the 5 Cantons, have sent a delegation to Valais. They first went to the most turbulent peasants in the district of Goms.</p>
      <p>They delivered a speech to them against our religion; they demanded that the followers of our religion be severely punished, that our books be removed, that children not be sent to evangelical schools, and that they strongly oppose the new religion; if the magistrates ignore and do not wish to eradicate it, they should use their own force, which they indeed want to abolish, but in all other cases, not in the matter of religion.</p>
      <p>The peasants of that place accepted all these things and confirmed them with an oath and given letters. However, the bishop and the prefect, the landvogt, and the senators were very indignant that meetings were held without their knowledge, etc., and they summoned the envoys to Leuk. They also attempted to preach in the district of Brig; however, the mayor of that place strongly resisted. They then went to Leuk, where they were heard by the bishop and senators.</p>
      <p>They proposed to them what they had previously proposed to the people of Goms.</p>
      <p>There are many absurd, intolerable, and bitter things in that proposal, etc. They were told that their presence was not necessary, as the public letters written by the Baden assembly to them had been read and approved in all parts; they would not depart from the Christian faith, and since some had rashly made certain designs against religion in recent days, they had been punished; however, they did not want to give or gather meetings for the 7 Cantons, as it is not possible now either. The envoys themselves did not take the response with a fair mind and demanded it be given to them in writing, which was done. Thus they departed.</p>
      <p>When the Bernese envoys arrived, they were received and dismissed very kindly. I hear there is great hope; may the Lord bless them, etc. Our envoy and those from Schaffhausen went as far as Bern, intending to enter Valais themselves, but instructed by the returning Bernese envoys with an explanation of the matters, they returned home. You see from this brief narration what we should expect from these people.</p>
      <p>May the Lord deliver us from evil. - Ferdinand is holding a diet in Linz, Austria, with three electoral bishops, the Archbishop of Salzburg, and the Bavarian prince about holding a council against us. Sanlaurentianus, sent by Cardinal Lorraine in the name of the King of France, has come to them. May the Lord scatter the plans of the impious. I am hindered by the wedding of my son Johannes Rudolf and cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 9.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you. 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours always from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, his most esteemed and dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
