      <p>Greetings. The person delivering this letter is a citizen of Magdeburg, sent by his senate to the evangelical cities throughout Germany to collect money for the citizens impoverished by the recent war; for this very purpose, everyone has given up whatever gold or silver they had, so that nothing remains with which they might return to their crafts or trades. Since they have suffered these things for Christ, they now ask for help for the same reason. Men renowned for their piety hope that no pious person will reject their request. So far, they have asked nothing from the brothers except to intercede with those who have and willingly give to the needy.</p>
      <p>We also ask on their behalf that you willingly undertake this truly apostolic duty; no one is compelled here, but a cheerful almsgiving is requested. Therefore, ensure that no diligence is lacking on your part, since you know that this entirely pertains to your duty. You will also have an eyewitness narrator of the story; he has seen everything and participated in all, and indeed you will hear of marvelous and invincible things, unless the Lord had been present. What do you think, if the cities of Germany had met Charles in the same way? But the gospel was not received with the same zeal except by a few poor ones; the rich and merchants listened to their mammon; venerating it, they nevertheless lost both earthly and divine riches.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the wretched now mourn, but in vain; for as long as Charles draws breath, I do not know whether the grace of the gospel can be restored.</p>
      <p>We also ask you in the Lord not to deny letters of recommendation to the people of Schaffhausen and St. Gallen; if they give nothing, you have still done your duty. Farewell in the Lord and do what you can and must. Basel, January 24, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger and the other brothers proclaiming the gospel of Christ in the city of ZÃ¼rich, his venerable fellow believers in Christ.</p>
