      <p>When last year we understood, most illustrious prince, that some contention had arisen among you regarding the attire of ministers, we greatly feared that if it progressed further, it might bring some greater harm to the church: and therefore, requested by pious and prudent men, we gave advice which then seemed to us safe and pious. For we advised the ministers of the churches not to depart from the churches over a matter not of such great importance, and to leave them to wolves and superstitious seducers. But the fear of greater danger, which we said we had conceived at that time, did not deceive us. For we hear that now not only is there contention among you about clothing, but moreover many other things are being imposed on pious ministers, which smell of pure papacy, indeed were first fabricated in the school of the antichrist, and therefore cannot be received or concealed with piety intact. However, it causes us no small pain that the letter, which we privately gave to a few friends on that matter, is said to have been printed, and that many extend our judgment on that vestment matter to other things, which we did not know were in controversy at that time, and which can never be approved by us. And indeed it is a cause of most just pain, that by the authority of our name, pious brothers are burdened, to whom we have endeavored to bring counsel and consolation rather than trouble. Yet we are more burned by the consideration of scandal, which we do not doubt has arisen from there. Furthermore, the unhappy condition of the Anglican church increases our sadness, which, since we have always loved it, we cannot but be moved with all our hearts, that which, having scarcely been freed from the bloodthirsty enemies of purer faith, had begun to flourish somewhat, is now shaken by internal dissensions. And because we are sufficiently assured of your virtue, most illustrious prince, and there are not a few proofs of your piety, we thought it right to send letters to your excellency, from whom many pious people have conceived no small hope. We ask, however, that you continue to defend the cause of the church in your usual manner before the most serene queen, and in the parliament (which we hear will soon take place) before the nobles of the kingdom, and not deny your patronage to the pious brothers; who, even if they have erred in some matter, yet deserve pardon, since it is evident that they were moved by fervent zeal of piety, and seek this one thing, that they may have the church purged from all papistic filth. Nor do they seem to us worthy only of being defended by pious princes; but this whole cause is of such a kind, that those who apply zeal and industry in managing it, by that very deed finally testify that they are most worthy of the name of princes. The Lord has deemed illustrious men worthy of that honor, that they may be called the nurturers of his church; which indeed praise far surpasses all the glory and dignity of this world. They will be faithful nurturers, if they not only snatch the church from the hands of enemies, restore the preaching of the word, and the legitimate use of the sacraments; but also take care that the bride, who ought to be brought to Christ untainted, is not defiled by any stain of superstitions, or by any rites alien to Christian simplicity makes her faith suspect. And it is known that Hosea, who warned the Israelite church, that she should remove her whoredoms not only from her breasts, but also from her face.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we again and again ask your excellency, that what you have done so far, you now especially continue to do, and strive by your authority with the most serene queen and the nobles of the kingdom to ensure that the reformation of the Anglican church, instituted with great admiration of the whole world, is not deformed by new filth and the remnants of the unhappy papacy brought back by postliminium. For if that happens, not only will the mark of inconstancy be imprinted on many in your most flourishing kingdom, but also the weak will be offended, and scandal will be given to the neighboring churches of Scotland, France, and Flanders, still laboring under the cross, the punishment of which will undoubtedly rebound on its authors. Indeed, the neighboring enemies of evangelical truth will take an example from you, so that they too may circumscribe the freer worship of the true God in their places with new laws of tyrannical superstition. We say this more freely, most illustrious prince, not because we doubt anything about your piety; but partly relying on your incredible humanity, we do this, partly compelled by the necessity of the matter. We wish to provide your excellency and many others with more material and opportunity to think about this cause. We pray, however, to the best and greatest God, that having had mercy on his church, he may restore true peace to it, and guide your excellency and princes like you with his spirit, protect with his favor, and preserve with his mighty arm for the glory of his name and the preservation of his church. Amen. ZÃ¼rich, 11/12 September, in the year 1566.</p>
      <p>Your excellency's most devoted, Heinrich Bullinger senior, and Rod. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious prince, Lord Francis Russel, Earl of Bedford, etc.</p>
