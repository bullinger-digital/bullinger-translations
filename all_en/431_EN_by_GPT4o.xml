      <p>Behold, at last, the long-desired and eagerly awaited call of Musculus by us. If he will take the oath (as we all are accustomed to) and freely reveal his mind to the brothers, the call will be confirmed. A theological profession will be enjoined upon him. All the brothers are well, as they see that it cannot be otherwise. I hope his calling will be beneficial to this church and to all of us, and most honorable to the city and the entire Republic of Bern. You (as I also asked in the previous letters) should speak to him with the other brothers and instruct him on how to conduct himself; I have freely proposed to him these three main points: 1. by insinuating that he will confirm the doctrine of our disputation, 2. that he will also publicly explain his previous writings, so that henceforth no one may have occasion to criticize, 3. that he should diligently avoid the company of all those who have hitherto followed opposing sides and have disturbed this church, etc. You also propose the rest to him. Then I finally ask that a public escort be provided to bring him here; this will be most honorable for both him and the lords of Zürich.</p>
      <p>I have also written to him to delay his arrival until the 24th of February, until I have returned from Lausanne. In the meantime, may you also fare well. Give my regards to the most esteemed lords and all the brothers, to the provost, Pellican, Bibliander, Gualther, Otho, etc., and finally to your wife and children from me and mine.</p>
      <p>Bern, 10th of February, 1549.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
