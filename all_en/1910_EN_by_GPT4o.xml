      <p>I know that my matter has been recommended to you, most prudent Bullinger, as I have learned from our mutual conversation and again from the letters of our Bibliander to Oporinus. However, the current state of my condition does not allow me to wait for that opportunity at the University of Tübingen, so that it may happen among the people of Montbéliard, due to the condition proposed to me by the people of Besançon. For since the plague is raging so violently there that almost all the citizens have deserted the city, it has been decreed by the Besançon edict that no one coming from that city is admitted, either by land or by mere entry, at least before 40 days, which they must prove they have spent elsewhere in a place not suspected. Furthermore, the condition offered to me would be lost if I wished to delay there; for I am not so much afraid of the plague itself, because I know how to guard myself somewhat with the art of medicine, and besides, I am most certain that God has prescribed the period of my life. These are the things I discussed with Bibliander. However, since I am going to stay here for a few more days for the sake of the typography begun with Oporinus, you can write to me if you judge there is anything in the Christian matter in which I can and should remain. For although, when I am in Besançon (if perhaps I return there), I can receive letters from you through our Oporinus, I would prefer, if you think it fair to decide in what I may be useful, that you take care to convey it to me now, before I leave, by means of a letter. You will learn the rest in Bibliander's letters. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Basel, on the 24th of June, or the sixth month, 1553. Your humble brother in Christ, Guillaume Postel.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief ecclesiast of the people of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>"Of Postel, the multilingual Frenchman."</p>
