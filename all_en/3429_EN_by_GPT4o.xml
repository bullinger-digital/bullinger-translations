      <p>Greetings, my Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I would gladly write about the state of affairs in the Netherlands if anything certain were known. The silence is astonishing.</p>
      <p>Rumor had it that 13 Swiss banners would return from the Netherlands, and ours were expected at any moment; but, as I see, the hope has vanished into thin air, and we infer that greater wars are being prepared, as if the calamity had not been long enough and the destruction not sufficient. Therefore, it is no wonder if both monarchs and nations, willing and thirsting for war and blood, are finally satisfied with wars and blood, as they do not cease to provoke the wrath of the Lord upon themselves in so many ways.</p>
      <p>A certain honorable man from the French reported in our college that he had recently seen in Paris, from where he claimed to come directly, the horrendous punishments of twenty martyrs, among whom several distinguished men and women of noble birth were miserably burned with the rest. If these things are true, it appears that our delegation and the weight of the princes had very little influence; even if it was admitted and heard. Meanwhile, the constant prayers of the churches will not be in vain, in which patience and constancy for the martyrs and confusion for the enemies are requested.</p>
      <p>The Worms Colloquy, as you know, was suspended for a time and I believe it has been renewed again, after a response from King Ferdinand was reported to have been received within 6 days, ordering the interlocutors to proceed; however, I hope to have certain information soon. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 8, 1557.</p>
      <p>Philipp Melanchthon's wife has fallen asleep in the Lord, an ornament of matrons, a faithful helper to the excellent old man. Yours, Simon Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
