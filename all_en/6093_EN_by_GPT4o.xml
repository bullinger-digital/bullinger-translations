      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not yet responded to your letters, in which you commend seven stipendiaries of your church, is firstly because I had no one to whom I could entrust the letters, and secondly because only three of those seven arrived here before the last day of March, whose arrival I had been expecting daily since I received your letters. It is unnecessary to recount what I have done on their behalf; but the person who delivers this to you will explain everything better in person. I wish I could fulfill what you ask of me on their behalf.</p>
      <p>If they deposit anything with me, I will faithfully account for it, and I will ensure that I do not neglect my duty in anything that pertains to their studies and good conduct. However, both Mr. Calvin and Mr. Beza can do much more than I can, and I am certain that your students are highly recommended to them. Finally, we will make sure that you understand they are under our care.</p>
      <p>Mr. Beza is also writing to you about their affairs; therefore, I will not be more verbose than necessary, to avoid being importunate. Moreover, most illustrious man, if there is anything else you think I can do, just command it with a single word, and you will find me immediately compliant. Yesterday, I received letters from Mr. Cognetius, which he sends to you and to Mr. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>There were also other letters attached, which he sends to Basel, and because they are addressed in French, I added a Latin inscription to prevent them from being lost.</p>
      <p>If you please, ensure they are delivered to Basel, and if you wish to reply to Mr. Cognetius, if you send your letters to me, I will make sure they are delivered to him diligently, and I will also ensure that Mr. Gwalther's letters to the same person (if you send them) are delivered with the same care. There is now an Italian here who asked me to request from you, in your kindness, to remind a certain Christoph Sgrizzer, a sculptor well known to you, to fulfill what he promised. There are certain wooden panels he received to carve at a certain price, and a written contract was made.</p>
      <p>The Italian wishes for him to complete them as soon as possible as promised. Forgive me if I dared to impose this burden on you.</p>
      <p>I return to your stipendiaries, for whom we arranged quite comfortable lodging yesterday. I hope they will diligently apply themselves to their studies; for they are no longer children.</p>
      <p>Whatever I can do on their behalf, I will certainly do willingly, as I wish all the best for all your people in Zürich. I know Mr. Beza will write to you about French affairs and other more serious matters, and he will also add something about Mr. Calvin's health. Therefore, I remain silent, lest I cause boredom with my repetition.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>May the Lord always be with you, guide you with His spirit, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, April 5, 1564.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, your most observant.</p>
      <p>I wish to know whether you have received anything from our Tretio in Poland since I wrote the letters, which I ensured were delivered to you. I ask you, therefore, if you have learned anything from him, to indicate it with a single word; for I am very surprised that no letters have yet been received from him, as he is diligent in writing. To the most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, faithful pastor of the Zürich church, with my utmost respect. In Zürich.</p>
