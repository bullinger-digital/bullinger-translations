      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter is the son of our first scribe. He is testing his character by speaking in Latin. He plays the lute sweetly beyond his years. If you praise him to me in these matters, you will earn praise from his father. Therefore, I commend him to you, only so that you may deal with him in a friendly manner.</p>
      <p>There is nothing else new to write, except that Johannes a Lasco sent greetings to me from England through a certain Polish nobleman, which I greatly admired.</p>
      <p>He added that religion is proceeding rightly there by the grace of the Lord. He himself went to Venice, intending to return to Poland to undertake the business of the gospel with the king's favor and help, and above all, with God's assistance. He spoke many good things about his king, and then about his great wisdom, through which he strives with God to gradually establish the gospel against the power of his bishops. He also said that the Emperor mentioned there are four in Germany who are delaying their Interim: Philipp, Bucer, Brenz, and Calvin. I, however, said: "He does not know the others, perhaps he will come to know them, and even these, if he lives." If he lives, I say; for the mathematicians almost agree that the day of Matthias should be his last day of life.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would like to know for certain about the dire rumors circulating about the people of Konstanz. I heard that you sent some things here, but they did not reach me. I would like this, so that the faith of such great princes may be better known. Good God, what monsters, even in appearance, not to mention the most monstrous souls. But I cease, still weary in body and mind; may the Lord, if it pleases Him, restore me. Farewell in Christ with Theodor, Gualther, and Otto.</p>
      <p>Basel, 27th of February, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most excellent man, prelate of the people of ZÃ¼rich, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
