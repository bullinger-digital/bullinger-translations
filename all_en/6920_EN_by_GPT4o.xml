      <p>My gracious lords have been informed through their reports that the pilgrimage to St. Beatus near Unterseen is visited by many people, such that they come there with priests and practice their papal ceremonies. Consequently, my gracious lords have instructed their officials in Thun and Interlaken that if they catch any such people at St. Beatus, they should apprehend them and bring them to Interlaken, and then report to my lords. This has been done, and the official in Interlaken has taken some into custody, brought them to Interlaken, and without special imprisonment, kept them in the monastery, and hereby reports to my gracious lords. They have instructed the named official to release them, with the condition of paying for their sustenance and warning them not to come into my lords' lands in such a manner again; otherwise, they would be punished according to the established reformation, order, and statute. And these aforementioned people are from Lucerne, Uri, and Unterwalden.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, the five places gathered in Lucerne and collectively wrote to my lords, reporting the matter as stated above; they could not know whether this happened by the command of my gracious lords or not, requesting a friendly response to their letter, etc.</p>
      <p>In response, my gracious lords wrote back, stating that this happened by their command, indicating that at the beginning of their reformation, such pilgrimages were forbidden at that place and elsewhere in their lands and territories, as is well known; therefore, they cannot allow it for various reasons, as mentioned in the letter. They requested them to ensure, through their people, to avoid causing offense to ours, that they desist and allow my gracious lords to remain peaceful in their lands and territories. Whatever concerns the alliance and peace of the land, they intend to uphold faithfully, etc. My lords expect that the matter will be settled and resolved in this way. Meanwhile, those from Unterwalden above the Kernwald have gathered and united, though not entirely, but a good part among them, and have decided to go to St. Beatus, and if they are prevented, they intend to open the way by force, etc.</p>
      <p>When my lords were informed of this, they instructed their officials that if they come as mentioned, they should be kindly turned back, indicating that my gracious lords will not tolerate or endure such actions. However, if they force their way through, they should immediately report to my gracious lords and detain them by force or otherwise, as far as possible.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, those from Unterwalden have become agitated. Those below the Kernwald immediately wrote to the four places; they appeared at the last September meeting in Stans, admonishing them to abandon their intentions. This did not achieve much, except that they settled with some of the mentioned ones to write further to my lords for the cessation of this pilgrimage. The mentioned four places, along with those below the Wald, have also written to my gracious lords in a friendly manner, indicating what they decided at the meeting, showing that their lords will write further to my gracious lords according to their situation or pleasure, and reporting that they believe the Unterwalden people will not start anything against the alliance and peace of the land.</p>
      <p>They also indicate that the Unterwalden people have imprisoned a man named Fridli Schilt from Interlaken because he allegedly spoke against the peace of the land; however, at their, the envoys', insistence, he was graciously released. This man from my lords' land has come here to my gracious lords and complained about the imprisonment, indicating that the bailiff had accused him in prison of being a spy; however, the land official told him, when he was released from prison, that he had spoken against the peace of the land two or three years ago when he was with some packhorses in their land; therefore, he was imprisoned; however, he was instructed to release him; he should avoid the land for a year, which he also swore in an oath.</p>
      <p>The man from the land indicates that he is innocent of the charges against him, as can be found with the bailiff Spichti. He also states that he has not been in the land with any packhorses for ten years; he also states that he has come to Unterwalden several times in the past year, and no mention was made of these matters, except that he firmly believes that if they had not found him so innocent, they would have shortened him by the head. Meanwhile, the Unterwalden people are raging and furious, openly calling our people heretics and desecrators of saints, etc., and my gracious lords are daily informed of the defiance, pride, and arrogance displayed by them against us. In response, my gracious lords, council, and citizens have gathered earnestly today, first to write to the four places along with those from Unterwalden below the Wald in a friendly and earnest manner, that they will not tolerate the inappropriate insults and rage of some of the Unterwalden people, asking them to ensure that they refrain from it and desist from going to St. Beatus; they are willing to uphold the alliance and peace of the land faithfully with them, - accordingly, to write to those from Unterwalden separately in a similar manner; for they will not tolerate it any longer. And they request a written response on whether they will do so or not. Meanwhile, they also ask them to reopen the land to our man, as he is not known to have spoken or acted against the peace of the land, and that they apply common law in such cases against my lords as my lords do against them, namely, if someone acts against the peace of the land, that they report it and allow my lords to punish them, as they also do against their subjects. Thus, they now await further response and prepare for St. Beatus, and prepare themselves, so if they remain restless, they will prevent it.</p>
      <p>This is all the business I have been informed of by my lord mayor Steiger, who instructed me to write to you and my lord mayor of Cham, so that you have a thorough report of the matter. I thank you both for your greetings and greet you in return.</p>
      <p>Given as in the previous letter, October 8, 1566. Greet my lords on my behalf. Your willing Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To my friendly, dear lord and godfather M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
