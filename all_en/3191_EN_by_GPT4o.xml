      <p>Greetings. In the past days, I have burdened you, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, with my letters, so now, since you have a living letter here, I think I should spare you, otherwise very busy. If you have not seen for a long time the Confession of the Swiss cities written in the year 1536, when I first saw and greeted you in Basel, you will now have it copied by these. What we have privately (I have not yet discussed with the brothers) decided regarding this Confession, they will report to you in detail. They have successfully accomplished everything by the grace of God, for which they were sent as delegates. Thanks be to God. Farewell, may you outlive us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 22, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. John Calvin, his dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
