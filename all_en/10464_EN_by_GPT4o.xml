    <p xml:id="regest1">The joint confession of Ambrosius Blarer and Erhard Schnepf regarding the substantial and essential, but not local, presence of Christ in the Eucharist is unclear and will lead to disputes. Assures that he is paying close attention to any possible solicitations by the Abbot of St. Gallen. Johannes Haab is also vigilant. Sends his book "De testamento seu foedere dei unico et aeterno".</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new, except perhaps this may be new to you, most distinguished man, that Blarer and Schnepf with one voice confess: "By the power of the words of Christ 'this is my body' [Mt 26, 26 par], the true body of Christ is truly, that is, substantially and essentially, but not quantitatively or qualitatively or locally contained and eaten in the supper." In this confession, I desire a bit more clarity and simplicity. For I fear it may become a great seedbed of disputes. To the holy, all things are holy.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am, I believe, carefully watching if the Abbot of St. Gallen is going to make any solicitations, so that you may know as soon as possible, but I have sensed nothing yet. Haab also diligently watches and carefully defends our cause.</p>
      <p>I am sending you our exposition "On the One and Eternal Testament of God" written against many heresies emerging today.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell, always mindful of us. For I am entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 27th of August, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Joachim Vadian, a most upright friend.</p>
