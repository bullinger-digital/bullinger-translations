      <p>Greetings. Your letters have reached me, reverend father in Christ, and I wish I had something with which I could repay you in return; but almost nothing is brought to me from Italy, which is nevertheless surprising, and I do not doubt that they are conceiving something that will later suddenly erupt. It is reported about the Carafa family that they have suffered the death penalty; whether these things are true or not, I cannot easily affirm, and yet this rumor is quite consistent. From France, we were eager to hear something certain from you; there are those who firmly assert that the King of Navarre has been appointed to the helm of the kingdom, while the Guises have been removed from their positions.</p>
      <p>These things are said by those who come to us from Italy, and the same is written by Vincentius Mayo from Basel; if this is true, you are not unaware, and it is something from which we can hope for better things from France. I cannot yet write anything certain about our own affairs.</p>
      <p>The people of the Upper League, because the Five Cantons (Swiss regions) are coldly indifferent, are very sharp and vehement, and without a doubt, in hatred of our religion, they frequently visit their angel with litanies and processions (as they call them). The bishop's cause is still pending, but if one can predict anything from the outcome, he will eventually fall.</p>
      <p>Surely he has fewer papists on his side than we have on ours; however, I hope that in our case it will be fulfilled what is written: "I will provoke you by a nation that is not a nation." The nephew of Mr. Traversius, namely the son of the one who perished in the snows in previous years, has recently been made the bishop's official (they call him hoffmeister), and he indeed renders excellent service to his bishop and now defends his lord's cause before the communities, which he would never do if he understood that his own people were offended by this action.</p>
      <p>I see and learn many things daily that I would prefer not to see and learn. From Mr. Legate, I was able to find out many things.</p>
      <p>Surely I would not have embraced him so familiarly if this acquaintance had not been extremely useful to me, although I have been rarer in meetings and have entirely commanded myself that if another comes, I will be even rarer. I have discovered more than I would like, and I often persuade myself that twenty or thirty years would not have provided what these two years have provided, nor would I have ever understood so clearly what money can do.</p>
      <p>Gold loves to go through the midst of guards And to break through rocks, more powerful than a thunderbolt.</p>
      <p>When I saw this extreme corruption, even though I could have accepted from a friend, with a clear conscience and within the law, something to sustain my poverty, I preferred to consume my own (for I have spent over two hundred florins of my own while I am here) rather than be counted among those who are themselves for sale and have everything for sale. And if I know Mr. Legate well, he loves me not in an ordinary way, and indeed for the reason that he understood that I, another Fabricius, had never said or done anything for his favor. Now, as he departs, he left me a ring as a token of his friendship, but it is very small, yet finely crafted, which I refused to accept (for what use is a ring to me in a chest?), he seemed to take it more seriously, saying that he was thinking of writing to me more freely as to a friend, which he would never do if I despised this token of friendship. I mention this in passing, because you write that something similar was offered to you, and that you, in your wisdom, accept nothing, you do well, since you are engaged in a very different republic than I am, and the condition of each is also different.</p>
      <p>May God bless this new marriage with you; but why did you not also add who the bride is? My wife, having now completed childbirth, wishes to express her deepest thanks to your paternity through me; for she received a crown from Mr. Philipp, who recently sold a horse and paid it in your name and that of your most honorable wife; she accepted it because she understood that you wished it, although she is not unaware that she has deserved nothing of the sort from you. So much for this.</p>
      <p>For the rest, I wish you to be well and happy for as long as possible with all your family.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, August 12, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
