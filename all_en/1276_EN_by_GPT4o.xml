      <p>Greetings from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. I wrote yesterday, as you will see, carelessly, about what is happening here. Since the messenger has not yet departed, I add these few things, but amidst great clamor, I also add dangers. For when many had gathered from all sides for the solemnity, as they used to, on this very day, behold, some, moved by the indignity of the matter, rushed to the temple, demolished all the statues and idols completely, and when the corpse of a certain Gaudentius was being kept with great reverence, they also threw it out, and I am now involved in this tumult, but not without joy. I have commended the cause and myself to God. I have just received letters from Italy. The Bishop of Bergamo, from the noble Venetian Soranza family, went to Rome to defend himself against the charge of heresy, and was thrown into prison, causing great fear throughout Italy. If only he had rather imitated me and chosen to be cast out in the house of God rather than dwell in the tents of the papists. Farewell, most illustrious man, and with the whole church pray for us, who are laboring and that intensely. I greet the fellow guests and brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Ensure that this letter is delivered to Geneva, which I earnestly ask of you.</p>
      <p>Casaccia, Ascension Day 1551.</p>
