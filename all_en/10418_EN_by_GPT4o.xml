      <p>My possible service, dear Heinrich.</p>
      <p>By the grace of the Lord, may I be fresh and healthy. It always delights me to hear the same from you, your beloved spouse, and other friends. I received your letter along with those that report on it shortly after Easter this year, in which I am justly reprimanded and scolded for certain reasons. Nevertheless, I wish to excuse myself to some extent, if I have any credibility with you, that I sent a letter to you last Shrove Tuesday with a bishop's messenger from Costens, in which a small opusculum by Rudolf Agricola was included. The same messenger firmly promised me, and also received a gift from me, to deliver my humble writings to you. However, I notice from your writing that this did not happen. Brother Jacob has recently been with me; I have learned from him about your health and well-being, but he traveled without a letter, because I have often been deceived by him and written in vain. On the other hand, you might object that my excuse is nothing, why I have not yet written against the Mass. I do not know, my Heinrich, what has prevented this so far. I will - God grant me life - rectify it and improve my possible service. Therefore, have patience, and I do not want to think that this was negligently left behind, for with what I might show you service or will, I am inclined. Moreover, if I do not know anything special to write or send to you, I am quite reluctant, I will stop it, even if I should write nothing more than a. b.</p>
      <p>My Heinrich, there is nothing new with us now, except that the Anabaptist monsters have taken over in Westphalia and are raging violently there. The bishop has surrounded them powerfully with his army. We do not yet know how it will turn out with the overcoming. The Dutch of the same opinion were on the move vigorously, several thousand, to speak and to protect. But they have been prevented. I hear that there is now also a sect among the Dutch who want to await the coming Messiah; they have themselves circumcised. Oh Lord, what will be the end of these new and strange sects. And all this is done under the guise of the gospel. The present messenger will tell you all things better. He has been with you more often.</p>
      <p>Send me the opusculum by Vadian on the Acts of the Apostles, and command me again if there is something here that you would like. With this, entrusted to the Almighty, who keeps you and your household in health.</p>
      <p>Given in Cologne on Monday after Pentecost in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Dietrich Bitter von Wipperf端rth, your favorable friend.</p>
      <p>I desire to learn from you about the dealings of the Landgrave and the Roman King in the land of W端rzburg, along with the plans and activities of the Confederates.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned, my beloved friend Heinrich Bullinger, residing in Zurich, to be delivered.</p>
