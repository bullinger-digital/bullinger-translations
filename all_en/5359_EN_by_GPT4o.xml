      <p>Greetings. In these days, since nothing but confusion and turmoil was being reported from France, I refrained from writing. For sadness and shame were hindering me.</p>
      <p>Now necessity demands that I write to you. Before I come to the main point, I will briefly inform you of the current state of affairs. It is certainly believed that our forces are encamped not far from the enemy, in which the greatest victory is placed. If only they had persevered more.</p>
      <p>But let us omit the past time, provided the proverb holds: quickly enough if well enough. The adversaries hold Picardy.</p>
      <p>In Champagne, the Duke of Nevers still holds prepared... Normandy is entirely ours, and Ommalius, the brother of Guise, was repulsed from there, not without his disgrace. We hold the Loire region up to Anjou, which was also ours, but a disgraceful surrender was made by them, when help was not far off. However, a stratagem was executed by them worthy of praise, as they left the city and occupied the fortress of their enemy Montpensier, who is the nephew of Bourbon. Thus it happened that he spared the city.</p>
      <p>A good sum of money was found among the Bituriges, which will sustain our army without any loss to private individuals. The Duchess of Ferrara came to Paris to show how alien she is to her own kind.</p>
      <p>In Aquitaine, the war is raging, where, however, our forces are far superior. We believe Bordeaux is today under our control.</p>
      <p>When I say the city, I mean the two fortresses that overlook the city from the sides. Toulouse was taken from us by the treachery of one man.</p>
      <p>About two thousand armed men left our ranks. The enemies who had secretly entered spared no kind of cruelty.</p>
      <p>The city's judge and several councilors were beheaded, more were hanged from the leading citizens. When they wanted to set fire to the public buildings, a wind suddenly arose and turned the fire elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Thus four hundred houses were consumed.</p>
      <p>The houses of all the pious were plundered.</p>
      <p>That devastation was horrible.</p>
      <p>Having set out for the nearby city of Calliacum, they slaughtered all the pious.</p>
      <p>This massacre surpasses all others.</p>
      <p>But perhaps they have already paid the penalty for their cruelty.</p>
      <p>For forces were approaching from all sides to bring aid to ours.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, from a bloody victory, such as I conceive in my mind, not much joy will result. These are the fruits of our delay.</p>
      <p>In Provence, we are still inferior but without disadvantage. However, a change for the better is hoped for within a few days, and already some joyful news is being announced. Recently, we suffered a severe loss in Chalon-sur-Saône.</p>
      <p>The one who was sent there was breathing great courage, but soon deserted his post without cause. That city is situated on the bank of a river, from where the greater part of the grain is brought to Lyon.</p>
      <p>Until now, it has been doubted whether foreign aid should be summoned. I have always been an advocate that we should not initiate it because I do not want to imitate the impudence of the opposing party, which avoids no disgrace. Now, because they have hired mounted arquebusiers from Germany, we will have a just excuse. However, the matter does not yet seem ripe unless they have led out their forces.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it is necessary for us to be so prepared that at every moment our aid may follow, which will have a twofold use, first that the mere rumor may instill terror in the adversaries.</p>
      <p>It is necessary that they oppose the enemies at Lyon and in the vicinity if perhaps our forces are not equal. The messenger will indeed test the spirits of the Bernese, to obtain the passage of soldiers by connivance; for it is hardly to be hoped that the senate will allow it to be openly written. We desire nothing else from you, except that volunteers from your region may mingle with others in the crowd; the Neuchâtel region can easily contribute five hundred. Three thousand and some from the Valais will suffice for us.</p>
      <p>Indeed, a month and a half ago, two captains promised to complete five or six banners; however, the plan did not please me, because it was both difficult and I did not want to invite a barbarian nation. I wish you to strive with all your might that your territory may supply us with some assistance; it will be enough if they are ready. Travel expenses will be prepared until they reach Lyon, and they will not be defrauded of just pay. But if now the noble Mr. von Artevelde supplies us with one hundred or two hundred horsemen, nothing would be more opportune and it would be a deed truly worthy of him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I earnestly ask and beseech you to seriously apply your mind to encouraging the man. It is not our place to set conditions; but when I understand his demands, I will give you my word, which he will find not to be in vain. Farewell, most illustrious man and my esteemed brother, together with Mr. Martyr, Gwalther, and the other friends.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe, sustain you, and enrich you with His grace and all good things. Geneva, June 9, 1562.</p>
      <p>Regarding the outcome of the embassy, there is no reason for you to be in any way anxious; in this matter, I have used some cunning. I knew from the beginning that there would be no way of negotiating; for it would not even be free for the prince. Let the Lutherans strive as they will; the Augsburg Confession will always be rejected.</p>
      <p>However, I hoped for something else, in which I think I have succeeded, that if envoys were sent by you and the Germans to pacify the church, the soldiers would remain at home; because I could not make our forces proceed more quickly, I at least interposed this truce.</p>
      <p>Whatever..., I free you from all care regarding the Augsburg Confession, and what Beza accepts in his letters, unless our spirit... changes, it does not touch the doctrine, which the adversaries leave intact for us in their agreements. Another danger was to be feared, lest they attack us unarmed again; but this evil has also been met.</p>
