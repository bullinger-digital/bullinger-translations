      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, most esteemed and upright man. Believe me, I was relieved of a heavy burden after I was able to pour out into your bosom and most faithful heart what had almost consumed and gnawed at me with the bitterest bite, though I know it was rather importunate. It troubles me that our preachers do not have more discernment; they act merely out of habit, paying little attention to what might follow. Since they know that many, whose hearts are ulcerated by the rejection of Sultzer and Batt, are carefully observing whether there is an opportunity for our downfall and for reproaching us, this magistrate requires not a little prudence in managing ecclesiastical matters; they have sharp and perceptive memories; we must therefore be careful not to speak inconsistently and not to act too hastily from the first impulse, as we are affected at any given time. Thus, Dr. Musculus is also hindered, whom I feel is so burdened that I do not believe it would be beneficial to mention him at this time unless he himself provides evidence and proof of his lapse, so that there is no remaining excuse for him to retreat or evade in any way. We have seen his declaration, which, since it is not entirely clear and is also ambiguous in some parts, did not satisfy, especially because of the substantive issue, which, as far as the sign is concerned, signifies, he made no mention.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would have been satisfied, as I do not separate the matter from the sign, but only distinguish it, namely that the sign has no benefit without the matter, but conversely, the matter always has benefit and power even without the signs. In such very difficult discussions, it is necessary to be satisfied. If the substantive is interpreted as signifies, as far as the sign is concerned, I say, we would have nothing to blame in it, and I trust it could then be achieved that it would be called, which I trust would be most useful for our church and I know well, etc., for which I would devote myself entirely to obtaining, as there would be nothing left that we could complain about, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there are four young students sent to you, whom I pray to be commended to you; you will find them to be most obedient and diligent, whom I would like to live together with an honest citizen; they will have money for board. One of them, named Blattner from Bruges, will come to you these days to arrange lodging, whom I wish to commend to you; you will find them not to be dull. We also want to establish certain lectures for them to attend regularly, so that they do not neglect any, from which we will require them to give an account, for we will ask them about these, along with your testimony of their diligence and modesty. There is no need for you to discuss anything about them with Evander, I know well for what reason, which should not be hidden from you if necessary, you are persuaded that they will be acceptable to you and all learned men, as they will follow my advice and will not neglect my orders, which I trust they respect me not a little.</p>
      <p>As for me, our lords in Bern have relieved me of scholastic burdens, but they have entrusted me with a theological lecture; in which function, if the ability matched the will, I would undertake it with greater spirit; but because I recognize my meager resources, I am not a little disheartened by it. Therefore, I will pray to God and to you, that you may deign to supply what I will request; for I am timid in this arduous task, so that I do not rashly assert anything unless I know it well. After I was appointed to the school, a public lecture was enjoined; I first lectured on Cicero's Rhetoric to Herennius, which, when completed, I lectured on dialectics; for the students needed these arts the most. When this was finished, as Sultzer and Batt were preaching most disgracefully from the pulpit, I decided I would do something worthwhile if I lectured on theology, so that there would be a place for refuting what they continued to instill in the tender age. I was inclined to the Epistle to the Romans, in which I had discussions on the calling of ministers of the gospel, the external and internal word, and other places, also on sacraments of this kind, which they did not dare to approach, although they knew and heard; for I also dictated. I wanted them to be provoked to attack me; but they ignored everything and believed me to be prepared to counter and refute their nonsense.</p>
      <p>Therefore, nothing was done until the Lausanensian preaching broke out. I completed the seventh chapter of Romans; our young men will be able to show you my method of interpretation if you see what they have noted. But I will discuss this with you at another time, I pray that you may deign to have me commended to all, I moderate all my matters with such unoffending truth, so that even our adversaries may be rendered peaceful, and not a little, as many as come to the lectures from the preachers in the field, encourage me to perseverance.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the fellow students, whom you will greet and commend me to them, I pray. Given in Bern, September 23, in the year 48.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, disciple Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and faithful man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief ecclesiastic of Zürich, his most esteemed brother in Christ, lord and patron.</p>
