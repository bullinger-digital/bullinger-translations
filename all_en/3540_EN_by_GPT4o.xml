      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I hope that our letters have been delivered to you with the utmost fidelity through Stanislaus, the minister. Meanwhile, an Englishman of small stature and with a reddish beard came here, who brought me letters from Mr. Johannes Utenhove, as well as from Mr. Melanchthon.</p>
      <p>He promised that he would go directly through Bern to Geneva, and then return to Poland through us. I gave him letters to carry to Bern and to Calvin: this was done on January 11th.</p>
      <p>However, in the meantime, this man has not appeared anywhere, he did not come to Bern, nor did he deliver anything to Calvin. I doubt whether he died on the journey, or whether he betrayed my letters to I don't know whom.</p>
      <p>The people of Geneva have formed a perpetual alliance with the people of Bern. Therefore, peace has been restored to those cities, which had been in jeopardy for some time.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the Swiss churches are peaceful by the grace of God. May the Lord grant that this remains long-lasting for us.</p>
      <p>The colloquium that had been established in Worms dissolved without any discussion and without any fruit, and I wish it had also been without harm, it was dissipated. At the beginning, some of the Saxons, having been offered condemnation by Julius the president, left their colleagues: then when they were pressed by the papists who remained from the Protestant learned, to also declare whom they thought were alien to the Augsburg Confession, they expressly named the excellent man Zwingli and condemned him. You can imagine how this affected the good men in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>And even our Philip joined them in this. Now some are working to set up a synod, in which the learned of the Swiss and German churches may confer. We will never fail in our duties, with God's help, as we are always ready to give an account of the hope that is in us to anyone who asks.</p>
      <p>But with what hope a colloquium is established with those who openly condemn our teachers and send the condemnation in writing to the emperor and the princes, understands he who understands nothing. May the Lord repair those human defects and grant to all who love the truth, that, laying aside envy, quarrels, and ambition, they may all think and speak the same. Farewell.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you with all of yours, Lysmanino, Utenhovio, etc. Greet them as well.</p>
      <p>Pray for us.</p>
      <p>Inform us of the state of your affairs.</p>
      <p>In great haste.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 17, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Johannes a Lasco, Polish baron now residing in Poland, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
