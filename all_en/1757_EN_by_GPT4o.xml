      <p>Greetings. I would have written more frequently until now, if not for the lack of material and messengers. No one has yet been appointed in place of Jodocus; many of the senators were absent, as they have now returned from the fair. Therefore, I hope another will be elected next week. We will propose no one to the Senate besides Musculus; for there is no one else who can be compared to him, let alone preferred. I only fear that he may not be approved by everyone, because he is a foreigner; but if it pleases the Lord, He will give him to us; if not, let the Lord's will be done. I will act in such a way that no one can rightfully call me contentious; meanwhile, I will not deviate even a hair's breadth from the truth. If a deacon is appointed, we will have nothing but disputes. But I have decided to freely warn the Senate, to free my conscience and faith at the same time. I know you will pray with us to the Lord, that He may grant a successful outcome. As soon as the matter is settled, I will write immediately.</p>
      <p>As for the latest news, we have nothing certain. Some affirm that the Margrave has defected to the Emperor, others say he is leading an army into Alsace for the king. The Burgundians fear for themselves, with whom our people are colluding, I know not what. The envoys from Fribourg and Solothurn were here these days, and the Senate was convened at unusual hours; what is happening is still unknown to me.</p>
      <p>Some also report, but still with uncertain rumor, that the city of Metz has been occupied again by the Emperor; likewise, in Saxony, a conflict occurred between Count Mansfeld and Heinrich of Brunswick, and the latter was defeated, the victors heading to Frankfurt to avenge the death of George of Mecklenburg. Thus, various things are reported, but their credibility is still doubtful.</p>
      <p>The plague has ceased again, so that no one dies from it; but in the countryside, it rages in many places, especially in those closer to you than to us. I have received copies of your sermons and will distribute them according to your wishes. Viretus will come here with Beza in these days, through whom I will also send yours to Lord Farel. I am very grateful to you; I greatly admire that learned simplicity. May the Lord always increase His gifts in you and keep you safe with us for as long as possible, amen.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Tremp has suffered almost the same as you; she is still bedridden, but has begun to improve. She had lost the ability to speak, but has regained it and is starting to feel better.</p>
      <p>This is written hastily to you. Today is market day. If anything else worthy of writing occurs, I will write through others who have come here to the market. Farewell.</p>
      <p>My entire family, as well as Musculus with his, send their warmest regards to you and yours. Bern, November 11, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>These letters concerning you were delivered to me from Lausanne. Gißlinger also sends something here to Felix Sprüngli, both letters and money.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
