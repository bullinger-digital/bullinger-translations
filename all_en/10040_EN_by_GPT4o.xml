      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, schoolmaster at Kappel, to the honorable, well-learned Mr. Mathias, pastor at Sengen, my particularly dear brother.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Praised be the high, only true, eternal, almighty, living, and one God, who created heaven and earth and all that is in them, and who has chosen us from eternity, that we should be blameless in the merit of His Son Jesus Christ, who were previously so exposed by sin and transgression through the fall of our father Adam, that we could not dwell with the high, pure God, whom His prophets therefore call "a consuming fire" [Deut 4:24; Heb 12:29; Isa 33:14], unless He had made a covenant with us out of pure grace and unspeakable mercy, through which He opened His favor towards us and presented Himself to us as the only God, that is, strength, comfort, protection, shield, salvation, and supreme good, and who would give us a seed, in which all the peoples of the earth should be blessed and saved. As then, at the end of the world, Christ Jesus, the blessed seed, previously promised in the law and prophets, was fulfilled, given into death and raised from the dead, and now sits at the right hand of God, a true pledge of God's favor towards us, who are washed from sins by His blood and have risen with Him to eternal life, if we otherwise firmly base our hearts on this, that He is given to us by the Father for purification, for piety, and satisfaction, who is forever our advocate before the Father and outside of Him no one else, etc.</p>
      <p>And since you, dearest brother, have also learned this mystery through the grace of God and know that there is no more than one only God, that is, one only comfort, help, salvation, and supreme good, also no more than one only Christ Jesus, that is, reconciler, satisfaction, righteousness, redemption, and savior, and only one only Holy Spirit, who sanctifies us and teaches true worship of God, so that outside and besides this there is no other worship of God, no piety, no satisfaction, no salvation, no comfort, no merit, no advocacy, no rest nor intercession that helps before our high God, therefore He looks at the heart and faith, but we are never pure of heart and therefore Christ is set before Him as the merciful of all the world. Yes, since, I say, you know all this truly and also how all error outside of this is cursed, I cannot sufficiently wonder that you so easily break forth with your testimony, which you owe with your preaching of the holy Trinity. Yes, would to God that you would not measure yourself more behind than you easily do. Have you already forgotten from where you came and that you were raised by the pious, steadfast servant of God, Konrad Schmid, who undoubtedly directed you in the way of the Lord, so that you well know that this error is from God, the truth and no lie, and heaven and earth must crash before a word of it passes away? But if you are a true Christian, that is, an anointed of God, then you already have the knowledge of God the Holy Spirit in your heart, who gives testimony to the external word of God, so that little of the world's disgrace can mislead you; for what does it matter to you how the world accuses of heresy, if you are certainly convinced in your heart through faith and the Holy Spirit, that it cannot be otherwise, even if the whole world rages against it? Consider the 1st Epistle of John at the end of the 2nd chapter about this anointing and knowledge [2:27]. But if you have this knowledge in your heart, that is, if you are a true Christian, how then do you not give testimony to your God, or how can you hide the Spirit of God in you? Or, if all this is of no use, do you not know that your subjects are temples of the Holy Spirit, and therefore, that God will destroy all who defile His temple? Consider once what the sin is that is called in the Holy Spirit [Matt 12:31]. But to fall away from the truth, to lie and to suppress the recognized truth is sin against the Holy Spirit. So many lie to themselves with their wavering in the way of truth, what great wrath of God they load upon their poor souls, for it is otherwise also written: "Whoever puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the kingdom of God" and again: "Whoever is ashamed of me and my words before this evil and adulterous generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in his great glory to judge" etc. and again: "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord!' will enter the kingdom of heaven," not everyone who begins well, but who does not run back and "endures to the end." "Oh, remember Lot's wife!" You are a shepherd, you should not deny the cross. For when did you think that your Lord Christ Jesus would break His eternal word for your sake? And therefore, when He says: "If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own, but because you are not of the world, therefore the world hates you. The servant is not greater than his master; if they persecuted me, they will also persecute you." But do not let this frighten you, "for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you." "I have overcome the world" and "your sorrow will be turned into joy."</p>
      <p>So if it is so, it must simply be endured. If you are now firm, you are a shepherd, if you waver, you are a hireling and not a shepherd. But wake up from sleep, be alert and step forth among your appointed, yes, own flock, do not fear, it is about a fleeting breath and give them green and healthy pasture, fresh living drink, and all that is trampled and trodden underfoot, cast it far from them. Only the only, eternal, true, living word of God makes our souls healthy, strong, and fat, as is shown by Ezekiel in chapter 34 [11 ff] and David, Psalm 118 or according to the Hebrew count 119 [1ff], and consider in the Acts of the Apostles in chapter 20 [Acts 20:28], how you will be entrusted with your flock. If you follow this and do not let yourself be turned away by every contrary wind, well for you, "the Lord is with you" [Luke 1:28]! But if the flock does not follow you, let the blood be on their heads. But if you do not follow this, all the blood of all your flock will be required from your hands and all the plagues will be poured out upon you, which are named everywhere in the New and Old Testament: Deuteronomy 28 [20ff], Jeremiah 23 [12ff], in Micah [1:3ff], Amos [1:3ff], Revelation [6:1ff; 8:7ff and others].</p>
      <p>Therefore be courageous, raise your voice and let the word of God sound like a trumpet and bring forth old and new, acting as befits a messenger or legate of Christ before the eyes of God, and do not be disheartened, for the Lord is with all those who seek Him with a right heart, and promises you with the mouth, through which no lie can pass, comfort, help, support, and deliverance, no more than faithfulness to Him; "for He cannot deny Himself," as Paul testifies of Him not only once, but often found. Jeremiah 1 [17-19] God speaks thus: "Arise and gird your loins and speak to them all that I command you, and do not be dismayed at their presence. I will also make you not fear their faces, for I have set you this day as a fortified city, as an iron pillar and bronze wall over all the earth, before all the kings, princes, and priests of all the earth. And they will fight against you, but will not prevail; for I am with you, says the Lord, to deliver you." Likewise, in Ezekiel 3 [8f] God speaks thus: "Behold, I have made your face much stronger than theirs and your forehead much harder than theirs, much harder than adamant and flint. Therefore do not fear them and do not be dismayed at their hard words, for it is otherwise a hard and stubborn people." So also Christ says: "I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves, therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. And when they deliver you up, do not worry about how you will answer or what you will say." For as long as you are those who carry God's word, you will be given such skill and speech that neither princes nor lords will dare to withstand.</p>
      <p>So if you know that this is the true and unerring word of God, which can never fail you, whom do you fear then? Why do you not step forth like a lion, against all that threatens to harm your flock? Do not allow yourself to be called a false prophet! Now the apostle speaks of such that all this is done for the sake of reputation, to please men, and that they flee from the cross. Not so you, my pious Mathias, but keep yourself free, brave, blameless like Matthias: Acts 1 [21ff]. Arm yourself with God's word, for it is enough that we have so long abused God's goodness and patience with our error and sins. Let us consider that we are dust and ashes and our days pass like a shadow, that it is a harmful gain if we gain the whole world and harm our poor souls. Let us take to heart that we are Christians and that the Christian life is not a freedom or frivolity of the flesh, while we are dedicated to good works and Paul says that "those who are true Christians crucify their flesh with its passions." Furthermore, it is required of you, for which you are a shepherd, a Christian life and that you are not greedy, arrogant, drunken, angry, blasphemous, envious, "of uncircumcised lips" [Ex 6:12], impure, adulterous, and the like (1 Timothy 3 [2ff]), for you must give an account to the chief shepherd Christ at the hour when you least expect it, and be judged before all the world when He comes "to judge the living and the dead" [2 Timothy 4:1], also to give to each according to what he has done.</p>
      <p>Take this my faithful exhortation, dear Mathias, in the best way, for it is written to you by your good, kind, and faithful friend; for certainly no one would have told you so much, especially a fatherless one, if he had not had favor towards you. And now be courageous, for you yourself know better that we are surrounded by divine truth. Or to whom do we point, but to God? What do we teach, but a Christian life? From what, but only from the divine word, which we also remain in its nature and explain scripture with scripture? Who is our comfort, help, and righteousness, advocate and life, but only Christ? Who then can frighten those who follow Him, while it is said: "I am the light of the world; whoever follows me will not walk in darkness"? Behold, this has spoken the mouth of all truth, whom we follow (you know well) with our teaching and also, as much as God gives, with our life. How then could anyone among the Christians frighten? But to those who so shamelessly accuse us of heresy out of ignorance, may God grant His grace, for we were also "once darkness, but now light in the Lord" [Eph 5:8], and indeed, should it ever come to the point, we would certainly and without effort publicly and clearly refute these slanderers not only from the divine word, but also from the old councils and fathers, Nicene, African, Carthaginian, Ephesian, Milevitan, Tertullian, Augustine, Cyprian, Lactantius, Athanasius, Origen, and the like, that they teach and uphold worse heresies than Ebion, Marcion, Arius, and Manichaeus ever were.</p>
      <p>But the God who blesses all those who walk before Him in true faith and innocent life, also not fearing to give testimony to His name before all the world, may He also enlighten your heart and mind, that you truly and without falsehood proclaim His true honor and glory, so that your flock, given to you by Christ, may truly serve the high only God in true faith and innocent life. And the grace of God be with you and all those who love Christ, the Son of God, in truth. Amen.</p>
      <p>From Kappel, the 8th day of February in 1526, quickly and hastily.</p>
