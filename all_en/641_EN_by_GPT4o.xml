      <p>S. I quickly and safely delivered the letters to Calvin that you, most learned Bullinger, enclosed to me, as you instructed. Nor do I doubt that you will soon understand this from his response, unless you have already received it. Consider those eager young men whom you recommended to me as highly recommended as possible, both because of our common studies, which ought to be of utmost concern to all of us, and indeed for the sake of all of you, whose recommendation holds such weight and authority with us that we consider it a great favor if you do not disdain to use our efforts in any matter, and we are quite pleased if any ability can be found in us to comply with and gratify you. However, you will be able to learn more fully from my letters to Mr. Gualther how we have provided for the studies of each. As for what you advise about the doctrine of your church, I wish you to rest assured and sleep soundly on both ears in this matter. We are not unaware that we have been not only burdened with false accusations among many good men, but also almost overwhelmed and submerged by the waves and most turbulent storm of sinister suspicions, as if we had suddenly become professed enemies of that doctrine, completely separated from you, and from that same agreement of minds and studies, which has always been most intimate between us from the beginning. But it is well that at last all those densest clouds of the worst suspicions and accusations, by which Satan has tried with marvelous arts to break our friendship and completely sever and overthrow peace, have not only been dispelled by the clear light of truth but have also vanished into smoke, as they were formed from smoke. If you are well persuaded about us, our doctrine, and all our studies, as you deserve to be, and we ought to wish you to be, I beseech you to retain that persuasion about us so firmly fixed in your minds that you never allow any trace of those blind suspicions to adhere to them, or let it be snatched from your hands.</p>
      <p>We, for our part, will strive with all our strength that we neither disappoint your expectation of us nor ever cause you to regret it. To testify and confirm this more and more, what you are doing will have no small importance. In this matter, we certainly judge your prudence to be worthy of great praise, and we strongly approve of your counsel. For this communication of studies and the literary training of your students with neighboring schools, besides being what you have prudently observed and wisely provided for the future, will also bring this additional benefit, that there will always be testimonies of others among others about the state of each church and its ministry, doctrine, and discipline, which will block the way to false accusations and blind suspicions, which can hardly be a more destructive plague to the church. And if only we could do the same with you. If this had been done earlier, either we would never have been thrown into these troubles, which have shaken this church so much and for so long, or your efforts would have made the way easier for us to extricate ourselves from them. For faith would have been placed in domestic witnesses, who would not only have relieved us of the greatest envy with their testimony but also could have prevented or at least easily restrained all the waves of this turbulent storm. But it was necessary for us to be exercised in this way, so that we might become more approved. In this excessively odious cause, because you have shown yourselves so fair to us, we give you immortal thanks, and we will continue to do so as long as life remains in us, since it is not permitted to repay you. For we do not doubt that the Lord, through the work, faith, diligence, prudence, counsel, moderation, and learning of all of you, especially yours and Mr. Haller's, has restored the serenity of our church as if the most violent waves had been dashed and broken on the shore. But the Lord, to whom you have devoted your efforts, will abundantly repay you. We, for our part, will gladly do what is within our power, which you know is very little. This alone we can do: retain a grateful and mindful spirit of the benefits, and strive with all our might that no trace of ingratitude ever remains in us.</p>
      <p>My colleagues, professors, and all fellow ministers send you their most dutiful greetings and to your entire college, and they beseech you to retain that benevolence and goodwill towards us to the end, and to commend us all to the Lord in your prayers. Your book on the origin of error, translated into the French language, will soon be published in Geneva. I do not doubt that it will be most pleasing and useful to our people. I did not want you to be unaware of this, so that you might understand that you also speak French.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, August 19, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Peter Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zürich church, brother and fellow minister, to be greatly respected. In Zürich.</p>
