    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] On August 2, the long-awaited [Zurich city] messenger [Andreas Müller] finally arrived. However, the response from the Zurich council [from July 28], which he brought with him, was unexpected! What do the people of Zurich want from Haller? He was the first Zurich pastor in Augsburg, and as the last one, he is still there. He has always strived to adapt to the will of the council, yet he receives no recognition for it and they hardly care about his well-being!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] However, he is grateful for Bullinger's efforts. Thoman Ruman will have described Haller's situation well to the Zurich council. But all in vain, just like Haller's letter [from July 24] and the intercession of his father-in-law Ulrich Kambli and the relatives.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] As Bullinger already wrote [in No. 2969], it will be according to God's plan that Haller, despite all these attempts, continues to bear witness to Christ in Augsburg with words and perhaps even with his death. God's will be done! Haller would be willing to sacrifice his life if his congregation could be spared the current tyranny and the reintroduction of old errors (in a possibly even worse measure than before) could be prevented! But since he cannot help his congregation and the most sincere members urge him to leave the city in time, even not understanding why he hasn't already done so (where he has good reasons to do so), he began to worry about his salvation, especially since he does not want to lightly disregard the opportunities offered to him by God. And since he is under the protection of the Zurich council, he thought he had good reason to be allowed to leave Augsburg. But now this way out has been denied to him, and he is caught between all chairs!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] All other pastors would have long since departed if they had a refuge like he does! He has persevered, and the worst part was having to hear from his colleagues that he had been betrayed by the Zurich council, indeed that they were in cahoots with the Augsburg council, like Pontius Pilate and Herod against Christ!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] All this has upset him so much (Bullinger will surely have sensed it in his letters!) that he had resolved not to ask for his recall any longer. But then he digested his anger again. When a new tragedy loomed in Augsburg with the upcoming Reichstag and the arrival of Emperor Charles V, he forgot his resolution and again asked for refuge with the Zurich councilors, who had once rejected him, indeed even (according to some Augsburgers) betrayed him. And promptly he was rejected again! What angers him the most is not only what he feels about it, but also what others think about it and about him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] But since Bullinger believes that the Zurich councilors did not make their decision out of malice, Haller suppresses his painful disappointment and even defends this decision against the slanderers. However, it is obvious that the people of Zurich have too high an opinion of the people of Augsburg. If they knew how things really stood with them, they would have decided differently! Only when one has dealt with the most distinguished people of the city for a while does one know how bad things are in this "swamp of Lerna"!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] So Haller better remains silent about the situation, now that the dirty scum of all nations flows together in the city and the Spaniards, the worst among all people, are in charge. A whole day would not be enough to describe how violently they act against the citizens, how they drive them out of their houses, throw them out of their beds, and rob them of everything! Almost every morning, the bodies of murdered people are found. There are many assassins who kill people for very little money. The Emperor knows nothing about it, and the Augsburg council proves to be weaker than a fly!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger will be able to gather some of this from Haller's last letters enclosed here [No. 2970, No. 2972, and No. 2973]. Haller did not want to rewrite them [into a letter], as they are very detailed. He could not, as planned, send them with the Swiss messenger [...] because he is still in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Contrary to the earlier promise, the pastors are forced to leave their churches and leave them to the devil and superstition. This leads to pangs of conscience, even if one is otherwise willing to risk one's life. Haller must think of Ambrose of Milan. For if one wanted to imitate him or Christ (who drove out the merchants of religion), one could do nothing else [but] abolish any sermon [of the opponents] (even those intended only for private circles). Although everything is allowed, not everything is edifying. Therefore, the pastors cannot openly oppose godlessness. However, they admonish people in their sermons not to participate in these godless customs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] On August 1, they began to decorate, or rather disfigure, the Cathedral of Mary, whose head was Wolfgang Musculus. They use the idols kept by the Augsburg authorities (in the past, the pastors had in vain both personally and publicly called for these idols to be secretly burned)! In the Dominican church, masses and requiem masses for the deceased Queen Anna of Bohemia are held daily. To save her soul from the underworld, the wicked crowd of Baal worshipers screams all day long! One cannot even list everything else that happens of this kind. The Emperor is always surrounded by twelve Italian and Spanish bishops, who in turn have whole hordes of priests around them, so that the city is full of these filthy people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The pastors, on the other hand, are treated like scum and are destined for the slaughterhouse. But whether dead or alive, they belong to Christ and must fulfill the measure of his suffering. Haller does not refuse to die for Christ (who is his life). Unfortunately, the [imperials] do not proceed with open violence, but with treacherous cunning against them until they have brought everything back under their power. Haller would rather be allowed to fight them as before than have to watch them smuggle in their old errors again. But the Lord's will be done!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Haller does not know what is in the response of the Augsburg council to the Zurich council [from August 4]. Much is promised and nothing is kept, especially since the council is powerless. They could not even defend Sebastian Lepusculus when he was driven out of his house and had to leave wine and wood to the Spaniards! If Haller could not count on God's help, he would have left Augsburg long ago. Hans Welser promised that he would be on leave within four or five weeks. He also openly admitted that the council was not able to grant him protection. But who knows if this dismissal will actually happen, and if Welser was not then commissioned by others to hold this prospect out to him. Haller will persevere as long as he can. He knows that he will be rewarded for it (if not by the people of Zurich) certainly by God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Greetings, also to the colleagues, especially to Rudolf Gwalther. Haller writes to him so rarely because he knows that Bullinger tells him everything. Otherwise, he would always enclose a separate letter for him. It's good that the storm around him [and his "Endtchrist"] has subsided! If only Haller's situation would also come to such a good end!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Just now Musculus comes and reports that yesterday evening at 6 o'clock three mounted and spear-armed [imperial] captains attacked a son [...] of Mayor Jakob Herbrot, along with [Georg] Feuchtweck, who was employed in Herbrot's business, and with a secretary [...] of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, as they were on their way into the city from Herbrot's garden located outside the city gates. The Saxon secretary was seriously injured and died as he was brought into the city. Feuchtweck was severely wounded. What happened to Herbrot's son, Musculus does not know. Haller will inquire ([Added in the margin:] He was able to get to safety). This was written in the presence of Musculus.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] One must always reckon with something like this. Pray for the people of Augsburg! Many families of good reputation are leaving the city so that their children (especially the boys) are not defiled. [School principal] Sixt Birck was approached over twenty times because of boys from the school, and it is clear why!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Haller will wait until the end of the month. If the [Zurichers] believe him by then, it is good. If not, he will leave with God's help, which surely no one who knows the situation in Augsburg will hold against him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] [P.S.:] Bullinger should show the present letter and the enclosed letters to the councilors, the colleagues, and the bailiff of Kyburg, Bernhard von Cham. Haller cannot write to everyone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] Enclosed is a pasquinade that originated at the Emperor's court and mocks the [Protestants].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">[20] Furthermore, the story of the capture of the Elector of Saxony.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">[21] Finally, a depiction of the submission of the Landgrave. He is still being held captive in Donauwörth.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. On August 2, the long-awaited messenger finally arrived, bringing an unexpected response from the Zurich council. I truly wonder what they think of me or what they want me to endure. I was the first; now I am the last in Augsburg, always striving to adapt to their will, yet I receive no gratitude other than seeing that my well-being is of little concern to them!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You have done your duty, for which I thank you greatly. Romanus, I believe, has explained the state and condition of my affairs. I have asked through letters; my father-in-law and relatives have also interceded, as I hear, but we could achieve nothing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Well, if it is the Lord's will (as you write) that I confess Christ here with my mouth and testify with my blood, despite all our protests, let the Lord's will be done, to whom I sacrifice and consecrate myself, since I see myself deprived of all human help! I wrote before, and I write now from the heart, that I wish, indeed desire, if it were possible, to free my church with my blood and life from this tyranny, where I see all the old errors being cumulatively reintroduced and the evil spirit returning with seven worse ones, making the last state worse than the first. But since I see that I cannot help the church in this part, nor the church me, indeed the most sincere members of the church advise me to withdraw for a time, and wonder why I do not, when I have so many opportunities, this has made me think about my salvation, and not rashly to renounce the means and opportunities granted to me by the Lord. Among these means, the first was the protection of the Zurich council, to which I wanted to flee, but now that I am also rejected from this, I am placed entirely between the altar and the stone.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I know that there is none among all the brothers who would not have left long ago if he had known where to flee, as I knew! But I have delayed, enduring everything, even enduring this most bitter thing, that I was forced to hear from some brothers that I was betrayed by my Zurich magistrate, and that the magistrates collude in our affairs, like Pilate and Herod in the matter of Christ.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Although these things have sometimes exacerbated me beyond measure, as your piety has undoubtedly sensed in some letters, so that I resolved never to ask for a recall again, yet I have digested and processed that anger anew, so that, forgetting my resolution, I have again sought refuge with those from whom I had previously suffered rejection, and, as others interpreted, was betrayed. But even now I have obtained nothing other than the previous response! Hence, I am not only greatly exacerbated because of what I think, but especially because of what others think and reproach me for.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>But since, according to your testimony, they make this decision with no ill will, I suppress my pains and defend them, as is pious, from these slanders. They imagine, I know well, some splendid things; but if they knew how things really are, they might perhaps consult my affairs differently. It is impossible for anyone to even think what Augsburg is and what kind of Lerna of evils it is, unless he has spent some time here among the foremost and observed with a discerning eye.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Therefore, I remain silent about what is now, where all the filth of wickedness from all nations flows together into one and fitting for this matter, where the most wicked of men, the Spaniards, hold all power. I could not, if I wrote for a whole day, sufficiently describe the violence they exercise, the injuries they inflict on our miserable citizens: they drive them out of their homes, throw them out of their beds, steal and plunder whatever they can. Rarely does a day dawn without some corpses of the slain being found. There is a great number of assassins who, for the smallest sum of money, murder anyone. The Emperor is unaware of this. Our magistrate is weaker than a fly!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I wrote some things in previous letters, which I send with these. I did not want to change them, as they are very detailed, for the common Swiss messenger is still here. From these, you can infer other things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Despite all promises, we are now being driven out of the churches, forced to give place to Satan, to yield to superstition. Who could endure all this, even if one completely neglected the safety of the body, but at least observed the peace of conscience? I remember what Ambrose once did. But if anyone now wanted to imitate him or Christ driving out these ecclesiastical merchants, he would achieve nothing other than that all, even private, preaching would be abolished. Therefore (although all things are lawful, but not all things edify) we cannot openly resist this impiety. In the meantime, however, in our sermons, we admonish our people not to participate in these impieties.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>On August 1, the Cathedral of Mary, which Musculus presided over, began to be adorned, or rather disfigured, with idols reserved by our lords (despite our public and private admonitions to burn them secretly). In the Dominican church, masses and funeral rites for the queen are held daily. The wicked crowd of Baal worshipers shouts all day to recall that soul from the underworld. Countless such things happen, which do not all come to mind, and even if they did, I could not write them. Twelve bishops constantly follow the Emperor, partly Italians, partly Spaniards, and they drag whole crowds of priests with them, so that the city is full of this dregs of humanity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>We are the scum of the world, and like sheep destined for slaughter. Whether we live or die, we are the Lord's; we must fulfill in our body the afflictions of Christ. I do not refuse to die for him who is my life, but those men do not act with open violence against us. They insinuate themselves with deceit until they regain all dominion. I would rather return in the future and fight them again than now watch them bring back their errors! But let the Lord's will be done.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I do not know what our council will write back to the Zurich council. They promise much, but deliver nothing! What could they deliver, when they can do nothing? They are so powerless that they could not even defend Lepusculus, who was forced to leave his house and leave the wine and wood he had to those Spaniards! Therefore, unless I had always looked more to the Lord's help than theirs, I would have left long ago and certainly would not remain a single hour now. Welser promised that they would release me within 4 or 5 weeks, for he (being more candid) admits that they can offer me no protection or defense. But I do not know whether this will happen or whether he even has the authority to promise this to me. I will endure as long as I can, knowing that if not from the Zurichers, then from the Lord, I will receive a great reward.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Farewell. Greet all the brothers, especially my Gwalther, to whom I write less frequently because I know everything is shared with you; otherwise, he would always have his own letters attached to yours. He himself endured not a small danger. Thanks be to God that the storm has subsided. If only my affairs would also find such a peaceful end!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Just as I was writing this, Musculus comes. He tells me some news. Yesterday at 6 in the evening, the son of Mayor Herbrot and one from his office, called Feuchtweck, and with them a Saxon secretary who still belonged to the Elector, were in the mayor's garden outside the gate, and as they were going home, they were met by three captains on horseback with boar spears, who shouted at them "These are the right ones" and attacked them. The Saxon secretary was stabbed, so that he was brought into the gate naked, and died. Feuchtweck has two mortal wounds. Musculus does not know where the mayor's son has gone. I will find out and let you know. Nothing happened to him, for he got away in time. This in the presence of Musculus.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>We must expect such things at all times and moments. Therefore, pray to God for us. Many honorable people are leaving, so that they now keep their children from disgrace. Boys are less safe than women. God have mercy in heaven! Sixtus has been approached over 20 times about boys from the school, so that he noticed what they wanted to use them for.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>I will wait until the end of the month. If they hold me, it is good; if not, I will take God's help and rid myself of this matter. No sensible person will hold it against me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Farewell again. August 4. You know the hand.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>I ask you to let all my lords, also all the brothers, see this letter, also the lord of Kyburg, for I do not want to write everything to everyone.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>I send you a pasquinade mocking our people from the Emperor's court.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>Also, the story of the capture of the Elector.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21">
      <p>And the form of the Landgrave's submission. He is still held in Werda.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful overseer of the Zurich church, his singularly esteemed lord. Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
