    <p xml:id="regest1">He is ashamed to have to ask Bullinger for forgiveness for such a vile matter; he has received the admonishing letters through Christian [Hochholzer] and Johannes [Pontisella]; he is aware of his great guilt, even though it was the woman [Barbel Esslisperg] who seduced him, and he promises to improve. Bullinger is misinformed about the situation; the woman in question did take him to court, but Rotacher is free [and does not have to marry her]. Like Hochholzer and Pontisella, he is unsure how Bullinger's and [Johann Jakob] Ammann's words were meant; they all share the same opinion as [Oswald] Myconius, that he can move to Marburg with the others; if he is called back to Zurich next spring, he will obey in the hope that by then the rumors about him will have somewhat subsided.

      <p>Greetings. I am not unaware, most humane man, that it is the act of a shameless person to ask for support from the best of men in such a vile matter. Therefore, I wish for this shamelessness to be forgiven, as necessity demands it. I received your letters from Christian and Johannes de Pontasella, our brothers, and they were quite harsh, yet (as I admit) deservedly so. For I have sinned very gravely against the Lord God, which torments and distresses my conscience beyond measure, but may He have mercy on me, which I hope and believe will happen if I repent, which will undoubtedly occur, and also against you, my parents, who have supported me with not insignificant expenses and still do, especially with ecclesiastical ones; therefore, my mind shudders at the very recollection of my wrongdoings. But whatever I did (I will not attempt to excuse my sin, lest I sin more gravely with shamelessness), it was not done out of intent or lust; rather, I was compelled and driven to this grave sin by the force of the reckless woman. She followed me for several weeks, enticing me both with words and gifts, which I never wanted to accept, but always ignored, as the Lord is my witness. Finally, seeing that she could achieve nothing with all this, she approached my bed (completely naked), behaving in such a way that it is shameful to speak of, and for this reason, I omit to say it. Acting in this manner, I fell, and I wish I had not fallen, but what is done cannot be undone, but it can be compensated in many ways with good morals and also a better life, which you will undoubtedly feel and experience. For if I ever did anything to please you, although I have erred gravely here, I will do so in the future, God willing.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Mr. Bullinger - for I do not dare to call you father, since I have not acted as a son should -, I beg and implore you and everyone to forgive me for this misery into which I have fallen. I, on the other hand, will ensure that I enjoy your benevolence and that you cannot justifiably be angry with me. I am wise now, but I wish I had been wise before, yet the Phrygians are wise too late. What you write about the wife has been falsely reported to you, as far as I understand from your letters; for I was summoned to court by the same woman with whom I lay, from whom I am, however, free. Regarding the change of place, you used ambiguity, which I could not quite interpret. Christian and Johannes interpreted it as not being prohibited to travel with them, but that it is prohibited to subject myself to others and abandon your stipend. Ammann also instructed them to tell me that if I desired to leave, it was free to travel with them. I did not trust these words enough; I consulted Mr. Myconius, who interpreted your writings in the same way. Following his advice, I went with Christian and Johannes to Marburg. I will stay there as long as it pleases you; but if I am called back next spring, I will obey without any objection, although I would like to forget about my reputation first, so as not to be in everyone's mouth and also a scandal, which can hardly be avoided. But whatever pleases you will also please me.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me commended to you and also in your prayers. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, September 13.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Christoph Rotacher.</p>
      <p>To the most sincere and serious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
