    <p xml:id="regest1">Is grateful for Bullinger's benevolent admonition and the permission to transfer to Leipzig for further studies. Unless Bullinger and [the school authorities] explicitly forbid it, Wolf would like to stay there for a year; according to a printer, Leipzig is distinguished by the quality of its teaching and the low cost of living; Wolf will report more extensively from there. Asks Bullinger to recommend him to the Hebrew professor [Bernhard] Ziegler; Bullinger should not be upset about his high but necessary expenses, which [Christoph] Froschauer will report on; in Leipzig, he will be much more economical; Wick's return may be imminent, but Wolf would like to continue his studies abroad, unless his mother dies. Regards.</p>

      <p>Even though your prompt and singular benevolence towards me was fully known and understood by me, I have now perceived it much more clearly and better on the day before the Ides of September, when I received your letters in Frankfurt, wherefore I have been all the more concerned in recent times about appeasing and reconciling you.</p>
      <p>For what could have happened better and more usefully than your fatherly admonition? What could be more pleasant than that you granted me the opportunity to travel to Leipzig? Indeed, as far as I am concerned, I am most grateful to you for this matter and will also be grateful whenever the opportunity presents itself.</p>
      <p>However, I beg you to allow me to stay there for a whole year, unless it is necessary for me to return home by the decree of the authorities and your will, to which I will never resist, nor would I have resisted now if you had wished otherwise.</p>
      <p>I heard from the Leipzig printer that the place is most convenient, not only regarding studies but also concerning living expenses. Therefore, so that we are not forced to make great expenses for this short time by traveling there, it would seem good and convenient to me if, with your peace, I could stay there for a whole year; but how all things are there, I have decided to write to you more fully and better from there; for the Leipzig fairs are imminent.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I strongly beg you, if you have any familiarity with Ziegler, the Hebrew professor, to recommend me to him, so that I may engage more successfully in this study. Moreover, if you have heard from Mr. Froschauer that I have made any expenses beyond my means, I beg you not to take it too harshly, for I have spent only on books and living, bed, and room, partly also on necessary clothing, and now I have enough books which I can use, so that I do not have to make such expenses in Leipzig; for I will be as frugal as possible, which I hope you will easily understand at the next fairs. Wick may perhaps return immediately. As long as I can stay abroad with your peace, I will stay most willingly, unless perhaps my mother (which God Almighty may avert) dies.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed father Bullinger, and may you always hold me as most commendable to you as before.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, in the year 1541, 16th day before the Kalends of October. Your Johannes Wolf.</p>
      <p>To the most serious and sincere theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his uniquely esteemed father.</p>
