      <p>S. D. I hope that my letters, dear brother, have reached you, which I wrote eight days ago. I handed them to our Kobler, who, when he intended to go to Basel, handed them over to his companion, who was to return to you, in my presence. I replied in them, as much as I could respond, to what you repeat in your present letters. I truly wish that many things would not happen, which nevertheless do happen. What should I do?</p>
      <p>I am forced not only to swallow many things but also to digest them with great annoyance. If, moreover, Bellevreius has sent a verbose and lengthy excuse of the king and an accusation of the admiral, of which he himself is the author, he will deceive more of the wiser ones among you than is beneficial, about which I also complained in my recent letters.</p>
      <p>I thank you for the reminder of Mr. Willi (whom, I pray, you greet most diligently).</p>
      <p>That Wegmann, who wrote letters here, does not want to appear Catholic; however, your reminder, stored deep in my mind, will remain useful to me in the future. Trusting in Christ the Lord, I hope to see him hanged sooner than he sees the Gospel expelled from Zurich. I have indeed seen and read Carpenter's letter diligently and copied many things from the written copy before I obtained the printed one. You will understand what kind of person he is from the confession of the traitor, who was hanged in Geneva a few days ago. You will return this writing safely. He indeed presents excellent examples and adapts them elegantly, but in a bad cause. You see, however, what learning and eloquence can do in a bad cause. If Beza is wise, he will respond to the scoundrel. I think he has returned to France, having performed his duty in Germany. Bellevreius praises this book in a remarkable way and shows wisdom from this book. Let us pray to the Lord to confound lying tongues and keep us from evil.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I wrote this in great haste. Greet all our people in order, whom you know. January 9, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at Chur at St. Martin, my dear lord and good friend.</p>
