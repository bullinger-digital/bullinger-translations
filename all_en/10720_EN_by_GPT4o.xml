      <p>Greetings from the Lord. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dear lords and brothers, it is well for you to know how I was with you in Zurich last June and informed you how my lord, the bailiff of Sargans, has dealt with me inappropriately and I feared he would accuse me again regarding the accounts he must present to Johannes in Baden. You, Master Haab, had instructed me at that time, and since then the aforementioned bailiff has left me alone. Now he is proceeding against me once more and secretly seeks acquaintances among those who please him.</p>
      <p>I do not know how he intends to deal with me, whether he wants to punish me here with us, accuse me before the Confederates, or summon me to answer. Even if he were to obtain acquaintances from 2 or 3 persons, I would still bring it before the common church members, so that it is clear I have not disturbed the peace of the land, unless it is a matter of misunderstanding. My lords from Glarus have the right of patronage over my benefice, and they have also taken acquaintances, more than 20 persons. The often-mentioned bailiff does not want to accept this, arguing that it belongs before the high court and before him, and not before my lords of the lower court of Glarus. So I must wait to see what God will do through this often-mentioned bailiff. Therefore, I urge and ask you to speak well on my behalf to my lords of Zurich, inform them of the matter, advise and help me so that I may also obtain justice and be able to respond.</p>
      <p>I wish you, brothers in Christ, always to fare well. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given at Walenstadt, in the house of Jakob Nusbommer, on the 17th day of November in the year 1535. Jakob Hewer, minister of the word in Wartau.</p>
      <p>To the pious and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger and Master Leo Jud, Zurich, my particularly dear lords and brothers.</p>
