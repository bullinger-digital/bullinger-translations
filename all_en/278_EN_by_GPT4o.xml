      <p>Greetings again, dearest Bullinger. When I had sealed this letter, behold, yours were brought, in which those of my wife were enclosed. She indicates more than she explains how great the misery of the Augsburg church is, and she confirms what you wrote about the captive elector and his preacher. However, concerning the cause of the Bernese vocation, there is nothing that I take badly, given the state of that church, as you also see in my letters. I am not rushing to any vocation, but I simply and with good confidence commend this cause to Christ our Savior; He will undoubtedly arrange everything much better than any of us could think. Such vocations ought to be conducted more by divine than human counsel if they are to bring any benefit to the churches of Christ. Meanwhile, I give immense thanks to your most sincere heart for this concern with which you wish to consult my affairs; I pray that the Lord may recognize it and reward it in due time.</p>
      <p>Let us maintain this love between us, whatever may happen with the rest. Again, farewell with all your family.</p>
