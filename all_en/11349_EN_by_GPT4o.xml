    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not finish reading Bullinger's epistle commentary; to a priest who wanted to buy the volume from him for a lot of money, he promised to procure a copy from the [Frankfurt] fair. Thanks for two more books gifted by Bullinger, "De origine erroris" and "De scripturae sanctae authoritate," which he read with pleasure. The council [in Cologne] decided [in 1538] to ban the import of Lutheran books; some pastors preach evangelically, but they must always be prepared for a report to the church leadership. Did not write to [Rudolf] Gwalther due to lack of time.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior.</p>
      <p>The more I engage with your writings, dearest Heinrich, the more I am filled with great pleasure each day. I have not yet finished the commentaries on all the apostles' epistles, which happened because I was occupied with another study. In the meantime, a certain priest, both learned and pious, borrowed them from me and read them. When he returned them, he added, after giving thanks, that he wished and desired to buy them for more than they usually cost, at any price. I then replied that I did not want to part with them under any circumstances, as they were sent to me as a gift by my best friend, a truly humane man, but I would ensure that he would have them after the next fair; and therefore, I entrusted a certain studious and evangelical man to bring them to us for the priest, who would immediately receive the fair price for them, not without interest.</p>
      <p>How delighted I was with the reading of those two books, one "On the Origin of Errors," the other "On the Authority of Holy Scripture," I can hardly express, which you sent to me as a gift of your own accord and out of pure goodwill, just like the commentaries on the apostles' epistles themselves, for all of which I can never express enough gratitude to you, my Bullinger, my dearest Bullinger, and also most humane and learned.</p>
      <p>Last year, it was decreed by the council that our booksellers should not bring any Lutheran books to Cologne. If any are brought, it is done secretly and not without fear, indeed because of the fear of the Jews. Nevertheless, continue as you have begun successfully. There are some preachers among us, namely one or two, who purely teach the evangelical scripture and teach nothing except what they draw from the New and Old Testament, and yet they are not safe from suspicion only because of those leaders who observe them very diligently, so that if they slip even in a word, they would seize the opportunity to slander and accuse them before the chief priests. But there are also some Gamaliels among them and therefore Nicodemuses.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Cologne, the day before the calends of September in the year 1539.</p>
      <p>You will greet Gwalther, yours and indeed mine, in my words as courteously as possible, to whom I would have written if I had had the leisure.</p>
      <p>Johannes Caesarius, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and equally distinguished in piety man Heinrich Bullinger, the most renowned preacher in Zurich, his best and almost incomparable friend.</p>
