    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks for the letter from January 31, which he received at the beginning of March. - He sends the [“True Confession”] of the Zurich Church in response to Luther's “Short Confession” and requests its acknowledgment, as well as not to prohibit the writings of the Zurichers and not to condemn the Zurichers unheard. They have been innocently and without legitimate cause reviled by Luther and condemned as heretics, so it would only be fair to also listen to their response. - Bullinger requests a favorable reception of his letter.</p>

      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince and most gracious lord, my humble, willing service along with the offering of all good things is always ready for your princely grace from me.</p>
      <p>Your princely grace's friendly, gracious letter, dated January 31, written in Heidelberg, I received at the beginning of March, and I express my humble thanks to your princely grace for the gracious, very friendly letter and offer, with the willing offering, that if I could also show myself grateful to your princely grace with faithful willing services, I would always strive to do so.</p>
      <p>And to demonstrate my very inclined, willing service, I hereby send to your princely grace the confession of faith and response of the common servants of the Church of Zurich regarding Martin Luther's short confession, which he wrote against our church, which we serve, and against us in a very inappropriate manner. Therefore, I humbly ask, for God's sake, that your princely grace will not disdain this little book, but, as far as possible given the many affairs, also read it and graciously prevent that our response, along with our other Christian books, in your princely grace's principality, will not be suppressed and forbidden to read, and that we will not be condemned unheard and innocent. Luther has reviled us without our merit and legitimate cause and condemned us as heretics, indeed as the worst people who do not rightly believe any article of faith, etc. It is only fair that our innocence and response should not be refused to be heard. Therefore, I also ask in the name of all the servants of the Church of Zurich your princely grace in the most friendly manner. God, who is the God and Father of all the oppressed, and who richly rewards even a cup of cold water offered to His servants, will graciously keep your princely grace in His protection.</p>
      <p>Most gracious prince and lord, I humbly ask your princely grace to kindly accept this my letter and request for God's sake and to graciously have me recommended. May Almighty God faithfully preserve your princely grace along with your associates in His grace.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich in the Confederation, on the 12th day of March in the year of our Lord 1545.</p>
      <p>Your princely grace's humble servant</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the Church</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious, high-born prince and lord, Lord Ottheinrich, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke in Lower and Upper Bavaria, his most gracious lord.</p>
