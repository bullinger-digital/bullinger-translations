    <p xml:id="regest1">Lindauer complains about the increased workload, as he can hardly do justice to his more than 64 students in the Latin school in [Stein am Rhein] on his own. He asks Bullinger for advice and help, as there is a danger that he might neglect himself and those entrusted to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Lindauer has [also] reported this to the [bailiff Rudolf] Kambli, who advised him to visit the mayor [Konrad Rapp?] together with the pastor [Georg Wimpfer], so that he could take care of the matter. However, Lindauer seems to find another approach more sensible, especially since the councilors of Stein am Rhein would proceed to the disadvantage of poor [students]. Among these are some very gifted ones who have so far been taught free of charge and with good success.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Lindauer often brings this up with the administrator [Johann Leuberer]. The latter gave him the following advice for Bullinger: The not yet very old monk Eustachius [Mörikofer], who lives in Lindauer's neighborhood, lives off church property, does not work, and yet repeatedly asks for an increase in his stipend. He would be suitable to teach beginners to read. Lindauer now asks for nothing more than for him to support him [in teaching]. Bullinger should inform [Rudolf] Kambli or Jörg Müller about this, as both are coming [to Stein am Rhein] next Sunday. In the meantime, Lindauer will diligently continue his work. Bullinger should inform him of his decision by letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings to the whole family, especially to [Bullinger's son] Hans Rudolf, who is very dear to Lindauer.</p>

      <p>S. D. P. The intention has always been in me (Lord Bullinger) that I should never shun or flee from honest and necessarily imposed labors, even though I am lazy. But now there is a reason why I should complain or refuse to bear a too heavy burden. For I wish that such a task be imposed on me that I am capable of bearing. I do this not so much for myself, but because I see another danger looming. For our Latin school here is growing day by day and hour by hour. I have more than sixty-four boys to instruct, and I alone am no longer sufficient for them. Therefore, there is a reason why I implore your help and advice. For there is a danger that I will have no time left to even breathe, indeed that I will completely neglect myself and postpone my studies, moreover (überdies), that those entrusted to my care will be neglected; whom I instruct as well as I can. However, I will not be able to persevere much longer with such a multitude.</p>

      <p>I indicated this to Kambli himself when he was with us. He indeed gave the advice that the pastor and I should approach the mayor, and that he should take care of this matter. But this matter seems to me to be considered and inspected differently. For our lords of Stein am Rhein would not help otherwise than by taking away what seems superfluous; where good talents would be lost and the poor, for whom this plan does not seem to be considered, would be neglected. For there are those who, if they were allowed to visit my school without a fee, as has been done so far, would be permitted by their parents to enter and take up study. There are poor ones who learn; who would have to do without if we were to extract money. Indeed, good and teachable talents, if enough leisure and hours were given.</p>

      <p>I often urge this before the administrator. He, however, these days gave this advice to be communicated to you. There is a monk incorporated with us in the monastery - his name is Eustachius -, not very old, living near me, enjoying church goods, doing no work, asking, since he is of no use, repeatedly (and he approaches our lords of Zurich when they come to us, to increase his benefit), to whom this labor could be most conveniently imposed (for they perhaps shrink from giving more money). He is suitable for teaching beginners the alphabet, also to draw and write letters, and to teach reading. I ask for nothing else, only that I be assisted in this. Therefore, I beg you to approach either Lord Kambli or Mr. Georg Molitor, and inform one of them of the matter; they will come to us, as we have heard from the messenger, next Sunday. In the meantime, however, I will show myself diligent and will not regret undertaking the appropriate labor. I will follow your advice above all. I ask and beseech you to deign to write a single note, by which I may perceive your mind and know what is to be done.</p>

      <p>I pray for the safety of your entire family, but especially for your Hans Rudolf, who is very dear to me.</p>
      <p>Given on the 5th day before the calends of February 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Bernhard Lindauer.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable, vigilant, and faithful shepherd and bishop of the Lord's flock among the people of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord. In Zurich.</p>
