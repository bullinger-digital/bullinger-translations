      <p>Be safe in Christ, most learned Bullinger! On April 26, I sent you a letter, which I hope you have received.</p>
      <p>However, your letter written on March 6 was delivered to me on May 23; but I did not receive the copy of your response dated the 2nd to Brenz, as you wrote.</p>
      <p>What should I wish upon such men, who have stolen such a treasure from me? If you had tied it with the letters of Gwalther, Lavater, and Simler, it would have safely reached my hands.</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen what Brenz wrote against you or Dr. Martyr, nor do I care much for such writings or trifles.</p>
      <p>I finally received your letter written on October 16, 1562, on June 27.</p>
      <p>Hyperius sent it to Luncker, Luncker to me, whom I have not seen for a long time.</p>
      <p>But I sent money to him on July 4: you have his letter to me enclosed here, from which you can understand how harsh and inexorable the college prefects are, from whom he cannot obtain permission to leave.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, a certain young Scotsman came to me, an excellent preacher, recommended to me by letters from Grindal, Bishop of London, and Coverdale, formerly of Exeter.</p>
      <p>He is now in my diocese, namely in the maritime town called Lynn.</p>
      <p>He brought me this news from Scotland: The Archbishop of St. Andrews, because he heard mass, was condemned to death; two or three nobles were thrown into prison for the same reason.</p>
      <p>In parliament, they decreed that adultery should be punished by death.</p>
      <p>The Queen of Scotland demanded these three things in the parliament house: first, that she be allowed to hear masses, second, that she could wage war against the English, third, that German (i.e., papist) guards be in the court, to whom the custody of her body would be entrusted.</p>
      <p>But in these three demands, she suffered a rejection.</p>
      <p>This he told me.</p>
      <p>There was a great thunderstorm with us around the beginning of July.</p>
      <p>The pinnacle of the cathedral in the city of Norwich was greatly shaken, but not thrown down, and was repaired shortly after.</p>
      <p>The plague is raging in London, and in New Haven, and in the French army, as it is rumored.</p>
      <p>The rest from the letters of Gwalther. On July 20, I sent letters to the councilors through one of my chief servants.</p>
      <p>He brought me the response on the 26th of the same month, and after four days he died of the plague.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us! Around the beginning of August, war was publicly declared against France.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name the most honorable matron, your wife, also the sons and daughters, learned friends, and most courteous citizens, whom you know to be known to me.</p>
      <p>In haste, at Ludham, August 13, 1563.</p>
      <p>Mine to you all; and thanks you for the letters.</p>
      <p>Because no German is present, he cannot reply; which grieves him from the heart.</p>
      <p>Yours, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>I hear peace has been made between the French and us. May God grant it! I know for certain that a truce has been made for some time, etc.</p>
      <p>My wife sends you two pairs of stockings, which you can use when the harsh north wind rushes from the axle, bringing cold, frost, and snow.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
