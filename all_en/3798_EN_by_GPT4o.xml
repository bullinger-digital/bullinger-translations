      <p>Greetings. Whatever news I had, most illustrious and esteemed friend, I have conveyed all to the honorable Lord Fabricius, so that he might inform you, as he delivered to me your letter written on the ninth of this month, leaving me nothing to add to this of mine, except that you might wish to add my respects, my commendations, and other such offerings of service. The Pope remains in the same health as before, with the illness neither increasing nor decreasing. You will hear strange and new things from the letters of Lord Fabricius about the affairs of Cardinal Pole, if indeed they are true, which I have explained to him and which I have from our Lord Cognetius, from whom the same and perhaps more abundant information has reached your piety. To whom I offer myself most devotedly and wish you to fare most happily in Christ.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur, December 16, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient friend, J. Ja.</p>
      <p>De Cambray.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
