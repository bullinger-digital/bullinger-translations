    <p xml:id="regest1">He has, among other things, spoken with two pharmacists and advises against prematurely taking Christoph Klauser's son out of his apprenticeship, as his master insisted on high compensation in a comparable case and would also hardly be willing to give the necessary consent for a change; he is willing to help find a new apprenticeship at the appropriate time. The Zurich merchants can report more about the news.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Regarding the matter you wrote to me about, dearest Bullinger, I have diligently consulted friends, including two pharmacists, who responded that it would indeed be in the interest of Klauser's son to be released from his master in a timely manner. However, since he has committed himself for two years, they do not see how this could be done without seriously offending the master and possibly causing considerable loss to the father. The reason for their opinion is certainly not trivial, as the same pharmacist not long ago very reluctantly released the son of a certain citizen of Colmar (of which I am a witness, for I know the matter well) after two months, when the young man requested release for some unknown reason, even though he had agreed to serve for more than a year. He only did so after receiving twenty-five gold coins from the young man's father, testifying that he did it as a favor to the friends pleading for the boy. This action of the man clearly indicates what Klauser can expect. Additionally, their laws prohibit anyone from taking another's apprentice unless the previous master gives permission. Since no one believes this can be done and the end of the agreed term is not very far off, they think it better for him to wait; then it will be easy and without litigation, when he no longer has any legal claim over the young man, to arrange with another. The character of the man also leads me to agree with this opinion; for, as far as I can see, he prefers, as long as the agreement allows, to use the services of a simple and honest young man for his own benefit, rather than releasing him before the legitimate time upon receiving money, the loss of which he cannot bear. Now, if you agree with this, it will be your task to inform me in time, so that if Christophorus wishes to have his son with another pharmacist here, I can inform you with certainty who will take him and under what conditions before the term arrives. I wrote this after reading your letter, which the son of Doctor Christophorus delivered to me the day after, when your merchant had not yet met me and had left for Frankfurt. I will gladly serve you in this matter as much as I can, if indeed I can do anything.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with all your family, dearest friend, and greet Doctor Christophorus and all your colleagues, especially Pellicanus, my teacher. You will learn the latest news here better from your merchants' reports than if I were to write it.</p>
      <p>Given in Straßburg, on the seventh day before the Kalends of October in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Petrus Dasypodius</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in both learning and humanity, Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the notable church of Zürich, his special and always esteemed friend.</p>
