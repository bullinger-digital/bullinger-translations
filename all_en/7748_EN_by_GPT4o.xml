      <p>Greetings. I am informed by Mr. Francisco Bonetto that there are some who wish to travel through Zurich to Geneva, to whom I can also, if I wish, give letters to you most directly. Therefore, I am sending what I received the day before yesterday from Mr. Lentulus, who greets your reverence most kindly from Chiavenna. I add to this that our royal envoy (as he himself spreads about) is in great distress because he has been accused of Lutheranism at the royal court; but he could very easily be at peace, as he professes the gospel with nothing more than the freedom to eat whatever he pleases. He does not make such a pretense in vain, as under the same pretext the French alliance was renewed not so long ago. Many believe that a new soldier will now be sought at the assemblies, indeed the entire government. However, I affirm nothing for certain, as the lords of the Grisons have not yet departed. But this is most certainly and firmly explored: everything in the distribution of offices has been for sale, and not insignificant dignities have been granted to the most worthless individuals. However, it was very well done that Mr. Rodolphus von Salis was elected as duke, and Peter Guler as the deputy of the Valtellina; for both are men of utmost integrity and the fiercest defenders of the true religion, and our monks would not have remained unpunished for the cruelty perpetrated if the Valtellinese had had such governors. What will be decided about them, we will hear shortly at this very moment. - It is reported among us that a review of a huge army is taking place in Strasbourg, and that Duke Christoph of WÃ¼rttemberg has passed away and left behind a son who is by no means Lutheran, who will not listen to Utopius Brentius in all things. - Moreover, a certain magistrate with his family died of the plague, the fault (as they believe) of a certain traveler. Recently, a certain citizen of ours was in Milan and claims to have witnessed such a tragedy: a certain doctor, truly learned, still a young man, accused in the name of the Lutheran religion (as they call it) and held in chains for a long time, was finally judged worthy of hanging.</p>
      <p>The sentence was pronounced that he should be dragged to the gallows tied to a horse's tail; however, he was led, not dragged, after being pleaded for. When he refused to die after being half-strangled, he was roasted over a slow fire and finally exposed to be torn apart by dogs.</p>
      <p>He remained steadfast in the true faith and even in his last breath foretold the monks of God's just judgment. All these things were seen and heard by one of our citizens. May your greatness fare well and be safe forever. Quickly from Chur, January 15, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most illustrious and foremost leader of the Church of Zurich, his most eternally revered lord.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Ann, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
