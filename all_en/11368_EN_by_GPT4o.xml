    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not attend to the letter carrier recommended by [Werner] Steiner, as he immediately took his leave again; therefore, asks to apologize to Steiner on his behalf. An accusation has been made against Bullinger, claiming that in his preface [to Johannes Travers, No. 1283] he indirectly attacked Bucer and Luther, thereby endangering the concord. [Martin] Frecht sends his regards to Bullinger and the people of Zurich.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Stainerus recommends to me that excellent man, the bearer of this letter; but as soon as he delivers the letters, he immediately takes his leave, so that I could not show him any kindness or confer with him at all. Therefore, I want to be excused to Steiner through you.</p>
      <p>As for you, there is nothing to write, since there is nothing new except for this one thing, that some think your preface to Vadianus' letter is quite offensive and that no one fails to understand whom you are attacking, namely that Bucer is your Vertumnus and Luther your Thraso, and that you do this after a concord has been reached and a good part of the disputes have been settled, finally at such a difficult time, etc.</p>
      <p>Frechtus, writing to me recently, asks that I commend him to you and the people of Zurich with due respect.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the brothers and the whole household.</p>
      <p>In haste, October 31, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, as to a most dear brother.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
