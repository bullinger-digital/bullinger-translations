      <p>Greetings. A good man has conveniently presented himself here, but the inconvenience in this convenience was that he indicated he would leave immediately. Therefore, I am compelled to write to you briefly, esteemed and beloved lord and brother Calvin. I write these words so that you understand I am not an enemy. Although no one would persuade you to think that of me. However, since Ulmius, returning from England, hinted at some hostility, I could not completely disregard it. I was bedridden for a long time and indeed seriously ill last winter, and I still feel the force or remnants of the illness.</p>
      <p>I mention this so you understand why I have not written to you for several months. Therefore, if anyone has reported that Bullinger has become an enemy of Calvin, they have reported falsely. For I love your piety and pray to the Lord to keep you safe in His holy will. Although I did not fully respond to your wishes in the matter of Jerome, I do not hate you for it.</p>
      <p>I wrote then why we should not simply subscribe. And I do not doubt that there are some minds more inclined to quarrels than is proper, who seek discord between us. But if you maintain that fairness of mind intact, which God's goodness has granted so far, you will not believe the reports of just anyone. Let us love each other mutually in the Lord. Live and farewell. Zurich, the last day of March 1553.</p>
      <p>In great haste. My sons-in-law Zwingli, Lavater, Simler, and brothers greet you. You will greet the brothers for us, especially the most distinguished man, Mr. Martinengo, Nicolas Gallasius, etc.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
