    <p xml:id="regest1">Urgently awaits the instructions requested [in No. 1526], as higher maintenance costs will be incurred after the prince's [Philipp of Hesse] departure yesterday. At the Imperial Diet, thoughtless supporters of a union [Joachim of Brandenburg and others] have shown themselves ready to make concessions contrary to the scriptures, but have not succeeded so far. As soon as the Protestant estates receive their copy of the [Regensburg] book, they will take a position on it, which will end the negotiations on the religious question and make Gwalther's further stay pointless; the opponents are not willing to make any concessions, and the hope of some princes to overcome the religious division through a peace alliance is deceptive. War is looming; [King] Ferdinand's attempt to storm Buda was unsuccessful, although rumors claim otherwise, and [Sultan Suleiman I] is said to be already on his way there; envoys from Hungary and Austria have indicated that the Turks cannot be repelled without the help of the Empire. Ferdinand lost documents of the Bohemian kingdom in the fire at Prague Castle - thus God punishes those who do not listen to the complaints about the arsonists -, and three cities have also burned in Pomerania, yet the instigator [Duke Henry of Brunswick] remains unmolested in Regensburg; however, the Bishop of Constance [Johann von Weeze] refused to shake his hand. Dionysius [Melander] declared himself ready to support the matter addressed in the letter sent to Winterthur in front of [Landgrave Philipp], asking about [Zurich's] willingness to join the [Schmalkaldic] League; Gwalther assured him of the goodwill of the Zurich council, but is aware of the lack of agreement in faith. Konrad Zwick will support the matter of Erasmus [Schmid?] at Gwalther's request, but applications from private individuals will only be dealt with at the end of the Imperial Diet. [The Landgrave] has not yet had time to write; Gwalther will personally deliver a letter from Dionysius [Melander]. Greetings from Draconites and Pistorius, who will also write, from [Johann] Meckbach, as well as from Gwalther himself. [Johannes] Eck is sick from drinking and whoring, while [Leonhard] Marstaller is limping not only mentally but also physically since he had an accident on the return journey to Ingolstadt.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>I sent you a letter many days ago, most esteemed father, and I eagerly await your response, as it contains matters concerning me. The illustrious Prince of Hesse departed yesterday, having obtained leave from the Emperor, leaving only his advisors, Draconites and Pistorius, behind. While he was here with us, all my affairs were settled, as he covered my expenses and those of my horse. However, I am now uncertain about what will happen. I can indeed freely attend their tables; but as for the horse, a decision might be made today. If I have to maintain it myself, the expenses would be hardly bearable for me. Therefore, I sought your advice in time through previous letters; I am greatly surprised at what might be delaying your response.</p>
      <p>As for the Imperial Diet, although there are some things worth knowing, many are doubtful and uncertain, and many cannot be safely committed to letters as they are.</p>
      <p>Satan has exercised strange temptations here through the spirits of the unionists, who indeed have caused more trouble for the pious brothers than those who openly profess themselves as enemies of religion. There are those who, either fearing the highest monarchs or being drawn by excessive zeal to the pursuit of peace, attempted to accept many remnants of the papacy that contradict the Holy Scripture, so that even in this way the adversaries might accept the preaching of the gospel. This matter was debated for many days by princes and learned men. However, the invincible truth of the Lord has prevailed so far.</p>
      <p>Now, all the states of the Empire are copying that book of the discordant concord proposed by the Emperor, and once it is copied, our people will briefly respond with their opinion, and the religious matter will no longer be pursued. Once this is finished, I cannot see what I will do here; for everything is conducted in such a way that you cannot discern a certain end from all the actions. As for religion, everyone has despaired. They see that the great hope and promises were not made by the adversaries to learn the true doctrine, but to drag us back into the abyss of the papacy. There are now some princes who urge the Emperor to establish public peace in Germany, to bind the princes with a treaty and concord; for they believe that religious concord will follow from this. But as you know, these are human plans, who, as Christ advises, should first seek the kingdom of heaven; they attempt to acquire heavenly things from these earthly and feigned reconciliations. But these are the mockeries of the present age, by which it is deluded.</p>
      <p>I see little hope for peace, but fear of war stands everywhere. At Buda, Ferdinand was repulsed by the townspeople in three assaults he attempted, with great loss of soldiers. As I hear, several thousand were killed. However, rumors are spread daily by the imperialists about the capture of Buda, which we have often found to be false. It is a constant rumor that the Emperor of the Turks is approaching by land and sea. If Ferdinand is deprived of the help of the Germans, both Hungary and Austria will soon be stripped. This is what the Austrian envoys complained about before the Emperor this week, saying they could no longer resist the Turk without the help of the Empire; therefore, they would receive him if no help arrives.</p>
      <p>Another damage has occurred, scarcely any more serious for Ferdinand. In these days, the Prague Castle and the largest part of the city were completely consumed by flames, along with the letters and privileges pertaining to the Kingdom of Bohemia.</p>
      <p>But these are the judgments of the Lord, so that those who have hitherto refused to hear the complaints of the miserable about the arsonists now see the same evil in their own.</p>
      <p>Three towns in Pomerania also burned in the meantime, while the best leader of religion and peace moved to Regensburg. But what is being done about the arsonist in the meantime, you ask? Absolutely nothing. He mingles with the princes daily, eats, drinks, and plays with them. I wonder what end this matter will finally have. One from the opposing side is the Bishop of Constance, who avoids and abhors his company, indeed recently refused to extend his hand to him publicly, adding that he would give an account before the Emperor if anything was offended by this act.</p>
      <p>I almost forgot to mention the letters sent to me from Winterthur, the subject of which you probably still know. I recently discussed this matter with Dionysius, a most loving friend of our churches, who indeed liked the plan and promised to inform the prince if the matter required it, but in the meantime asked whether our people would be willing to live under the same conditions of peace and alliance with those (whom they are now trying to insinuate themselves with) and to experience common dangers. Since I was not allowed to make a promise, I only replied that I found our magistrate to be of such a mind that I do not doubt their constancy, faith, and virtue. But all these things do not need a longer description; for I see no agreement in religion. As for public concord in political matters, you yourself understand how firm it will be without agreement in piety and religion. For how can it be constant and durable, whose foundation is laid on sand?</p>
      <p>I spoke with Conrad Zwick about the matter of our Erasmus, because I saw that he could be of great help to me in this matter, who also said that he is now the patron of many such cases, but that there is no time or opportunity to deal with these now, as these private matters are always reserved for the end of the Imperial Diet. However, he promised in good faith to remember me when the time comes.</p>
      <p>The reason the prince has delayed his response so far is the crowd of affairs, with which he has been overwhelmed here day and night. However, he will respond as soon as he can. Dionysius gave me a letter for you, which I did not want to send, because he instructed me to deliver it myself, which I hope to do soon, if only I receive a response from you.</p>
      <p>Draconites and Pistorius wish you well, who will write most copiously through me; especially Mr. Megabachius, our prince's physician, enjoined me yesterday, as he mounted the carriage, to greet you and all the fellow ministers most dutifully in his name. You will also greet Mr. Werdmiller, the treasurer, Mr. Pellicanus, Theodor, Leo, and the other preachers and readers, my most esteemed teachers, in my name. Convey my utmost greetings in my words to your wife and mother, your children, and the entire household. Farewell, most dear father.</p>
      <p>From Regensburg, from the Hessian house, 18th of the calends of July 1541. Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rod. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>It should be added at the end, which I think will make everyone laugh: Eckius, the strongest Achilles of the papacy, while drinking and whoring as usual, fell into a fever and buboes, as they call them, whose swollen tumors are now being lanced by a laughing doctor. His colleague Markstaler, while being carried back to Ingolstadt by carriage, broke his right leg, as if to limp both in mind and body. These are new and certain.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his uniquely esteemed father. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
