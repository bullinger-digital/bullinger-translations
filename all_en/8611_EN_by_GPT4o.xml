      <p>Greetings. The Swiss lords have written to our people urging them to resolve the matter of our coiners in such a way that Wendelin Heberlin and others do not lose their cases, and that the debt owed to them by our Karl, a very frivolous man, or by his associates, is paid. At the end, they append some threats, which our people understand as the blocking of supplies.</p>
      <p>The Rhaetian lords write primarily to your council and describe the whole affair as it has been conducted so far. We ask that nothing be prohibited or denied to us before the time; for the situation is very different from what some complain about, and our people are excessively burdened, pressed by the scarcity of all things. I do not know what will become of the friendship between you and the Rhaetians if, due to complaints, the necessity of bread is cut off from us. I wanted to warn you of this while the delegation presents everything to you in person regarding this long-standing dispute.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, July 24, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord forever.</p>
      <p>To the pastor in Zürich at the Grossmünster.</p>
