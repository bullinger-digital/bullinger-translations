      <p>Greetings and best wishes. If you are well, father, it is good; I am well. Your recent letters were most delightful to me for three reasons: first, because they are the most certain witnesses of your health; which health I so desire for you to be complete, that I ask nothing equally from God as that He may keep you safe for us, indeed for the church.</p>
      <p>Secondly, because they were filled with new matters (which we read with great eagerness and reread with even greater pleasure), and thirdly, because they conveyed a most friendly and excellent gift joined with them, for which I give you the greatest thanks and will continue to do so as long as I live, perpetually. It provides me with much enlightenment. Praise be to God, who continually reveals His treasures to us more and more. I have nothing new, except that many brothers around us, who were previously sad and downcast, now lift their heads with great joy, many [Greek] who were previously somewhat arrogant now furrow their brows. May God be praised in all things.</p>
      <p>My wife sends her greetings to you; greet all yours in my name. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Biel/Bienne, 17th day before the Kalends of June, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his father, always to be greatly respected.</p>
