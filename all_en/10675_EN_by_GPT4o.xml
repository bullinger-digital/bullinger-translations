    <p xml:id="regest1">Capito, whose negotiations with the Basel council regarding Grynaeus are not precisely known to him, has urged the Zurichers on behalf of the Strasbourg council to refrain from making a public statement against Luther, as there are favorable prospects for a concord following the success of the delegation of Gereon [Sailer]. Despite all reservations, the Zurichers have agreed to temporarily refrain from publishing their "Apologeticus"; in the meantime, Capito is to try to persuade [Erhard] Schnepf and [Johannes] Brenz to relent. The plague has broken out in Bullinger's house. Myconius receives Bullinger's commentary on some of Paul's letters through Froschauer; additionally, Utinger sends him a letter. A visit from Bullinger to Basel is not expected this autumn.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. What Capito has accomplished with you, dearest Myconius, we do not know, except that he said he had reported certain things about Grynaeus to your council. Here, if anything had been written against Luther, he wanted to delay or suppress it, but nothing was prepared by us against him. Indeed, we are writing an Apologetic for our faith and religion, which we would not have published without you and the people of Bern. He reported some broad hope of solid concord. He spoke much about the delegation of Gereon of Augsburg, solemnly protesting that the peace of all Europe would be disturbed by us if we proceed to confer the Apologetic with the brothers and publish it. We replied that we had often had excellent hopes of concord, but these had fallen to ashes, not without harm to our truth and innocence. Therefore, those truces have so far been a fraud to us, while the adversaries continue and abuse our peaceful silence. He added that now at last the concord would be ratified and firm. Finally, in the name of the Strasbourg council, we agreed to suppress our writings for a time, while he himself ensures that Schnepf and Brenz among the Cherusci cease to slander, oppose, accuse, and malign. For unless it is proven to us with certain arguments within a certain period that this concord will be solid, we will not neglect our opportunity. However, the Apologetic will be such that it cannot seem to be published in anyone's name in particular, but only to testify to the purity of our faith and innocence. This, most learned Myconius, will not be done without you.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, you will pray to the Lord for me, dearest brother; for the plague has entered my house and has gravely attacked a certain relative of mine, an excellent young man. So far, it has not departed from the houses of the neighbors unless it has emptied them completely. But glory be to our God, who is the Lord of life and death.</p>
      <p>Froschauer will give you a copy of the Commentary on some of Paul's letters. You also have letters from our Utinger.</p>
      <p>I had always intended to visit you this autumn, but I fear I will be otherwise occupied and will have to forgo it.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>August 31, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the people of Basel, dearest brother in Christ.</p>
