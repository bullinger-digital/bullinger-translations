    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the books and Bullinger's letter No. 463 with the clear confession, which he sent to Schnepf. Expects Gryn채us at any moment. Philipp Melanchthon and Osiander have not yet arrived. Hopes for an understanding. Bucer is planning a meeting of theologians, as both Bullinger and Blarer wish. It is good that his justification No. 453 was not printed, as it is now necessary to defend against an anonymously published pamphlet about his "retraction," which Johannes Eck had sent to Matth채us Zell. Wants to present Bullinger's book to Duke Ulrich as soon as possible, to whom he only writes in urgent cases. The Zurich church order will be useful. Bucer has just arrived here on his journey to Augsburg. Only three days ago did Bullinger's letter from August 15 arrive. His question about Blarer's defection to the Lutherans has long been answered. Greetings. Thomas Hofmann came at an inopportune time.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>As I was recently on my way to a sermon, your messenger intercepted me, delivering your most delightful letters along with the most learned booklets, for which, my esteemed brother Bullinger, I give you the thanks I can. For I do not even think of ever being able to repay you, so great is the generosity of your benefits towards me. May the Lord Himself be your great reward. I am greatly pleased with what I have tasted, and I do not doubt that the rest will also please. For what could be displeasing in Bullinger, adorned with so many and such great gifts of the Lord? You grow daily with happy increases and continually surpass yourself in the most beautiful kind of victory, which the Lord wishes to be perpetual for you. I seem to be born for the greatest troubles and plainly for those things which have much labor, but little joy and glory. Yet I willingly entrust myself entirely to the best Father, who deems me worthy of His ministry even in this way.</p>
      <p>I sent your confession, which seems to me solid, clear, and complete, to Schnepf to be read, and also to Gryn채us, whom we expect at any moment, to present it as soon as he arrives. For Philipp is not yet thought to have even begun his journey. Osiander himself is also delaying for some unknown reasons. You know Bucer's plan for a meeting of the brothers. I have high hopes for Philipp, whose authority will also mitigate the others. Indeed, I have never been more hopeful for concord, especially since the prince will try everything from which it can proceed. I too would greatly wish for pious and learned men to be called, and I know that Christ will soon fulfill our wishes.</p>
      <p>It is well that you did not allow my justification to be published in print. Eck sent some pamphlets to Zell in Strasbourg, in which my confession and the terms of agreement with Schnepf, although somewhat altered, are expressed with this title prefixed: "On the Retraction of Ambrosius Blaurer concerning the Most Revered Sacrament," etc. Neither the name of the author who arranged for them to be printed, nor the place where they were printed, nor anything else is indicated. Only my name is prominently displayed on the front page. However, Eck writes to Zell that a certain Catholic published these in favor of the Lutherans. Oh, what a theologian worthy of crows! How Satan turns himself into everything to defame our ministry! I am indeed contemplating how I might best vindicate myself from this grave slander in a Christian manner.</p>
      <p>I will diligently present your booklet to the prince at the first opportunity. I do not write anything about your letters to him, as I have not been with him for many weeks, nor is it permissible to handle these matters by letters, which I never use unless compelled by the most serious reasons, which often occur. I gladly received the account of your synod. For it will be of some use to me, as will the affairs of other republics that have received the word of the Lord.</p>
      <p>But behold, my servant affirms that our Bucer is present. He himself is about to set out for Augsburg for certain reasons. I have presented your letter. He gives thanks to the Lord and, beyond the previously conceived hope of concord, bids us hope even more. He also instructed me to convey his greetings to you and your ministers in his name, and he will write himself if he has the leisure.</p>
      <p>Four days ago, I received a letter from you written on August 15. Such is the negligence of the couriers or those to whom they entrust the delivery. However, it contains nothing except that you wanted to be informed about my defection to the Lutherans. But you have long since been informed. Pray to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>Greet your most holy wife. Commend me to the most illustrious men Leo and Pellican, to whom I do not know if I can write now through this good Thomas, who, like many others, arrived at an inopportune time.</p>
      <p>In T체bingen, the last day of October.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, my venerable and dearest brother.</p>
