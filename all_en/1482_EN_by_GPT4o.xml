      <p>S. D. I have labored with all the diligence and faith I could muster. You will understand what I have achieved partly from our Michael, to whom everything was granted by our magistrate as he requested, and partly from the common letters. It is difficult, indeed not easy for everyone, to simply subscribe to the disputations, especially when they often find things in them that readers think could be treated in another way, and perhaps more conveniently. And I am surprised that you asked this of us. This matter is clearly explained at the beginning of our agreement, where we discuss the election, salvation, and damnation of men. I accept these things no differently than I have explained in my Decades, especially in the 4th series, 4th sermon. God is philanthropic, with whom there is no respect of persons, as Peter testifies, and according to His goodness, He wants all men, as Paul says, to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. It is the counsel of God... to justify by forgiving sins in the sole mediator Jesus Christ our Lord, namely out of pure grace, for the sake of His Son incarnated for us, crucified and raised from the dead, a free gift through faith, not by works that man himself does. He also wants to damn all unbelievers for their own fault, because they did not believe in the Christ presented to them.</p>
      <p>God the Father Himself grants faith out of regard for His Son. For the implantation and nurturing, and thus also the preservation of faith in the souls of men, He has appointed the Word and the sacraments, which are made effective by the Spirit of God. Therefore, as many men as are saved, are saved by the pure grace of God the Savior: those who perish, do not perish driven by fatal necessity, but because they willingly rejected the grace of God. For there is no sin in God: in us lies the guilt and the cause of our damnation.</p>
      <p>But about these things in a public writing.</p>
      <p>If Hieronymus attributed everything to the pure grace of the Lord for salvation, nothing to our own strength, and only stumbled or was astonished at that acute and subtle question of reprobation, and judged more fairly about those who also attribute everything to divine grace, nothing to our merits, then indeed, if it were possible in any way, your modesty would seem to me to attract and preserve him from destruction.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus bring peace to your church in truly holy peace.</p>
      <p>It is written from England that new disturbances have arisen. For again, the Duke of Somerset, along with his wife and almost twenty princes and nobles, was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London before Michaelmas. Afterwards... also, I do not know for what reason, he was thrown into chains. Some think that he imprudently blurted out something to the Emperor. In October, the bishops of Worcester and Chichester, grave wolves, were deposed. The Marquis of Dorset was created Duke of Suffolk, the Earl of Warwick Duke of Northumberland. I hope that the gospel will suffer no harm from their imprisonment.</p>
      <p>You rightly assert that, however the fathers of Trent may rage, Christ will still be with us. Let us meanwhile persevere in our station and prayers. I wonder if you received my last letter along with the booklet dedicated to the King of France. For from your last letters, I could not suspect anything of the sort. If the Marquis is going to write anything, let him send it to Strasbourg to Mr. Christopher [Mont] the King's secretary. Laelius has undertaken to take care of his letters.</p>
      <p>May all good men be safe: the Marquis, Jacob of Burgundy... and all fellow ministers. Farewell and love us. Zurich, November 27, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my lord, brother, esteemed and dearest fellow minister. Geneva.</p>
