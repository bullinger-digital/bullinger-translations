      <p>The grace of God be with us, etc. Faithful, beloved father, know that we have once again received good hope for Hans Rudolf; for since Sunday, no more blood has flowed, but only some clotted or stagnant blood that remained from before in the chest and is gradually being cleansed. Also, the fever he had before has subsided and he has become somewhat milder in the head, etc. If now, as we trust in God, it remains so, there is good hope that the matter will soon improve; may God grant it. Sister Dorothea and my wife we intend to keep here today and send them back to you tomorrow, and if it remains so, I will also return home on Thursday, so that I can further consult with the doctors on what to do about the matter. We ask that this also be communicated to Sister Veritas, so that she may be somewhat more courageous and comforted. May Almighty God grant that this improvement be a beginning and serve towards complete health.</p>
      <p>May He also keep you, beloved father, in His grace at all times, etc.</p>
      <p>Berg, June 17, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your obedient dear son Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
