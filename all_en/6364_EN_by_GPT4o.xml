      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Bullinger, the most worthy minister among the people of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To your fellow citizen, Mr. Tuchiner, whom I love, and who is traveling to you for his own affairs, I have instructed to convey my greetings to you in my words and to discuss certain matters with you, which are dear to my heart and are in the interest of both of us to be accomplished. You will trust him as you would trust me if I were present with you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the assembly in Lucerne convened on the 29th in the name of the Pope, you will be able to discuss more extensively with Tuchiner. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Love me.</p>
      <p>In Solothurn, on the 22nd day of the month of January, 1565.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your dignity, N. de La Croix. To the most learned man, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The envoy of His Royal Majesty writes this in Solothurn in the month of January 1565.</p>
