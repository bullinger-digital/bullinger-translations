      <p>Greetings. Today I received your letters, most esteemed sir, and since Johannes Bader is inquiring about the letters at this very moment, which he voluntarily offers to take care of, I wanted to write these brief lines to relieve you of the concern that Mattlius, with his delay in delivering the entrusted letters, has imposed on you. I had written mine at midnight and sent them at the break of dawn; however, in the evening, after everyone had already left, I received yours. Therefore, I received everything well, although late, and delivered. We give thanks for your incredible care and diligence for our church, which will certainly never regret it; indeed, if it is wise, it will have deserved thanks for it. Most of the senate did not want to do or consult anything about accepting Campell before the return of the consuls from the Davos assembly; indeed, when Consul Willius mentioned it, there were those who preferred Marius, Brunner, or others. However, I know that Gantner is inciting some to call Marius, not Campell, whom he does not love as he should. Many want many things, which they clearly do not understand whether they benefit the church, as long as they diligently satisfy their desires. Gantner, however, improperly understood the senate's decision recorded in writing, as I sent you an example confirmed by the consul's hand; for immediately on Tuesday, he reported back to the senate, forced to excuse himself, complaining about many things; namely, that he never aspired to take up the function again nor preferred himself to the public good, that he had not sinned in confession, did not support or protect the Anabaptists, nor thought so badly, as long as he was rightly understood. D. Pontisella, opening his mouth, excellently shamed him: 'Did you not, Gantner, say this and that about the oath?' He affirmed. [He responded]: [Why then do you want to excuse yourself?] Consul, seeing the man's madness, briefly replied to him: 'Gantner, you yourself are at fault; please, do not blame anyone, etc.' Finally, Gantner, accepting the blame, requested the payment of his salary and added: 'He who delivered me to you has the greater sin.' Now there are many from the senators who would like the man to be reinstated after all this, etc. I could not write more, I am so harassed from all sides. I will write more extensively today, if I can, and send your writings. I hurried with this, so that Bader, returning to the fortress, would not leave mine behind. May the Lord Jesus restore you to firm health. Amen. 1570. Chur, October 23.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his singularly beloved sir.</p>
      <p>To the pastor in Zurich at the Great Minster.</p>
