      <p>Greetings. I easily believe and rejoice that my diligence in first obtaining and then sending Mr. Haller's letters was pleasing to you, and all the more so because by this matter I have bound Mr. Haller, an excellent man, a most learned person, and a most delightful friend, to me, who holds you in high regard and, by his right over me, has now also imposed on me the task of sending you his letters, to which I wish you to respond as soon as possible, so that he may understand that I have not lacked faith and diligence in handling his affairs. Recently, your Rodolphus Collinus wrote to me, and since I do not have the time to respond now, I would be grateful if you, without inconvenience to yourself, would greet him on my behalf and excuse me to him for not sending letters, just as to Mr. Wolf, whom, when I was there, I easily sensed to be very fond of me.</p>
      <p>Nothing can be brought from France that is not sad. There are those who say a battle was joined favorable to the Cond√©'s forces, from whom they report a large royal sum was intercepted; but these are perhaps the dreams of those who love God. Whatever it is, my spirit forebodes nothing good for me. May God look upon us mercifully, having pity on us. I ask you to continue to commend my and my family's well-being to Him, and farewell.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg on the very day of Matthias, on which I completed my 51st year, may it be fortunate for me.</p>
      <p>Matthias Schenck, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most humane and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, to be respected and a friend.</p>
