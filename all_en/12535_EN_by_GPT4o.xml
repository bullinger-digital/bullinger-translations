      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I do not have time to write, the messenger is in a hurry, dearest Bullinger, but only so that he may have the opportunity to meet you. He himself knows better than I do whatever is worth knowing from Lombardy and all of Italy and will recount everything by word of mouth. Write to us about what you have learned in Zurich.</p>

      <p>Farewell and extend our greetings to all the brothers.</p>
      <p>From Chur, July 6, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the city of Zurich, his lord and foremost friend.</p>
