      <p> Greetings. As I am about to depart for the countryside, I write this very quickly. First, I wrote to Mr. Bellievre, asking him to either write to Mr. Beatus or to go to the Council himself and use his authority. I would have much to say about the convened assembly, if it were permissible to trust the pen. Believe me, our people are very well-disposed towards you, and the envoy has the best commission, so that nothing, even in the smallest matter, is done or agreed upon against religion. I wrote to Bern to Mr. Consul Steiger, recommending the matter to him; I wrote to Glarus to Caspar Tschudi and Schuler, asking them to ensure that Beldius is sent as an envoy. I wrote to Beldius himself; he thinks Schuler should be sent. Our envoys are good men and favorable to religion. The council has long awaited Mr. von Cham; but he has not yet returned from Augsburg. Let us pray to the Lord, my brother, that He Himself may calm the storm that has arisen, for He is the best peacemaker. I also wrote to Appenzell to my friends, urging them to assist in the troubled matter and to hold true religion in high regard. It is astonishing how remarkably people behave in this cause; what do you think will happen in another and greater one? Lord, save us. - It is written from Heidelberg that the assembly is to be concluded and perhaps is already concluded. Württemberg and Zweibrücken have striven with all their might to exclude the Palatinate from the so-called peace of religion, but have washed the brick not without shame. The Palatinate is highly esteemed by good people for its steadfastness and sobriety, feared by the wicked, and that the matter of religion will not be further handled; they let it remain as it is. The Count Palatine is now reforming his Lower Palatinate, which is intolerable to the neighbors; but he proceeds nonetheless. Let us praise the Lord and pray that He continues to bless us. </p>
      <p> Farewell. May the Lord bless you and deliver you from evil. I have spared no effort, I have done what I could; may the Lord bless the matter. May 19, 1566. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. </p>
      <p> Greet the brothers. </p>
      <p> To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Hans Schmid, preacher in Chur, my dear lord and godfather. </p>
