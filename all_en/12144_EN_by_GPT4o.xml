    <p xml:id="regest1">Crodel should not have thanked Bullinger so much for the small gift [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“]. He surely knows that [Johannes] Cochläus claims to have refuted this writing with a “Replica [brevis]”. Whether Cochläus succeeded in this, he will have learned from Bullinger's [„Brevis ἀντιβολή“]. Bullinger does not send a copy of this, because Crodel probably already knows this writing. Many appreciate the treatise on the [true] Church that appeared in it. - Bullinger has read most of Crodel's letters, with which he tried to dissuade Pellikan from his false doctrine of the Lord's Supper; but Crodel can neither convince Bullinger with them nor dissuade Pellikan from his opinion. Bullinger continues to adhere to what he set out in his preface to the Apostolic Letters [1537], as long as he cannot be proven wrong based on the Holy Scripture. - Crodel accuses Bullinger of a false understanding of the Lord's Supper, which he supposedly adopted from Zwingli about 18 years ago as an insufficiently trained young man. But what do public schools and [academic] degrees mean? He wants to boast only of the true knowledge of Christ and the rightful faith. Moreover, Bullinger had outstanding men as “praeceptores” and teachers at the University of Cologne 24 years ago, such as Johannes Caesarius, Jakob Sob, Johann Matthäus Phrissemius, Arnold von Wesel, Matthias [Kremer], and Konrad Koellin. But it was only through the reading of Augustine and Erasmus that he began to turn to the study of theology. The Dominicans in Cologne were the first to raise questions about the Lord's Supper with him, which disappeared again through the reading of Augustine's writings. Bullinger left Cologne in 1522. At the end of 1523, he met Zwingli for the first time, without discussing the Lord's Supper with him. But when Zwingli questioned the physical presence and nourishment, Bullinger examined his argumentation based on the Holy Scripture, which he already knew, and since he was convinced by it, he immediately defended this position. His treatise “De origine erroris” [1528] can confirm this. - Bullinger thanks for Luther's [„Kurtz bekentnis“] and wonders why Crodel attributes so much to this furious book, which is unworthy of a theologian, especially since many have distanced themselves from Luther because of it. - Bullinger sends Crodel the [„Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio“] in return, which responds to Luther's writing. Crodel and indeed all readers can see from this response that the stance of the Zurichers is not foolish. - Why refer to Bucer's retraction in this context? Who knows if he [still] believes what Crodel writes about him. Bullinger could understand Bucer before his retraction; not after, while the Holy Scripture is clear. Moreover, Bullinger depends neither on Bucer's nor on Luther's opinion. - Crodel should receive this response kindly. The [Zurichers] will not send Luther a copy of their response, as he no longer wants to read anything from them. However, the Zurichers would be grateful if Crodel would show him their response. They are being fought by the Pope, the Anabaptists, and Luther. But the truth will prevail.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>There is no need for you to give such thanks, my dear Markus, for the small gift. I wish I could demonstrate my goodwill towards you with greater things. You are not unaware, I believe, that Cochläus wanted to refute my response, which he called "Replica." But whether he succeeded in this, he learned from my second response, which I would have sent to you, had I not thought that you had already seen and read it. Many learned and pious men have written to me, praising especially the treatment of the Catholic Church of Christ in our latest work, in which I have diligently discussed against the papists.</p>
      <p>I have read most of the letters you sent to Master Pellikan. You add that they were written with the purpose of recalling Pellikan from erroneous doctrine about the sacrament of the Eucharist to concord. But, to speak frankly, I have seen no arguments, even apparently probable ones, by which you could persuade either me or anyone else who examines your opinion a little more deeply, to the Lutheran or Papist view. You hoped that I would join you of my own accord, once the venerable old man, Master Pellikan, had changed his mind on this matter.</p>
      <p>However, I have known another mind and erudition of Pellikan, than one who would easily accept falsehood for truth or change for any trivial reasons. But if he were to change, I certainly would not depend on a man's opinion and change. For I know whom I have believed, and I feel the power of Him in my mind, whom I have believed. What I have given in my preface to the epistles of the apostles, which I have expounded as best I could, I would give even today, if I had not already given it. For I am ready to openly, expressly, and candidly recant, when a faithful brother comes to me, who has convinced me of error in doctrines with more solid arguments from the scriptures. For I confess again that only the canonical scripture, inspired by the Holy Spirit, is the unique, certain, and absolute rule of truth and right living and judging, which neither errs itself nor leads anyone into error, and the other things which I have set forth in my preface.</p>
      <p>You say: "Readers have nothing to blame in your writings, except that one erroneous doctrine about the sacrament of the Eucharist, which you received from Zwingli about 18 years ago, as a very young man and, as they say, not at all versed in public schools," etc. I do not wish to boast about public schools and degrees, etc. I prefer to boast of the true knowledge of Christ and orthodox faith. However, I was engaged 24 years ago in the school of Cologne. I had as teachers outside the school in free, as they call them, or extraordinary lectures, the most distinguished men, Master Johannes Caesarius and Master Jakob Sob. Otherwise, I was a listener of the best and pious men of blessed memory, Master Johann Matthäus Phrissemius, Master Arnold von Wesel, a man most learned in every way, and the excellent philosopher Master Matthias Kremer, etc. I also tasted scholastic theology under Master Konrad Koellin of Ulm, a distinguished Thomist of the Dominican order. But as God willed, and with some books of Augustine and Erasmus shining a light, I began to devote myself to better studies and more sincere theology. The theologians of Cologne, whom I gladly heard disputing at the preachers, were the first to raise this scruple about the sacrament of the Eucharist, which the reading of Saint Augustine later removed for me. And in the year 1522, I finally left Cologne. Around the end of the year 1523, I first saw Zwingli, not yet disputing about the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>But when he began to oppose the bodily presence and eating of Christ, I examined the man's arguments, and the truth, clearly asserted by the scriptures - and already imbibed before I knew Zwingli's name - I received not unwillingly, and I joined his side, writing, teaching, disputing, and preaching in support of the cause of truth. My books "De origine erroris" published, testify how much I have exercised myself in this cause. And at that time, indeed, I was a young man, who now am in my forty-first year. But God has always led me to the best, and has given me learned, pious, and faithful teachers. Therefore, what I have learned and professed from the scriptures, the fathers, and the best teachers, I will not easily change or recant, unless my arguments are refuted and confuted by firm scriptures and the opinions of the best men.</p>
      <p>I received Luther's booklet, and I thank you for the gift. But I wonder what kind of judgment you possess. Allow me, I ask, with your good grace, to speak freely what I feel, that you attribute so much to a plainly furious booklet. If I had ever been more devoted to Luther, now I would be compelled to attribute less to him than I would like. What, I ask, is in that whole book worthy of such a great theologian? You can hardly believe, Markus, how many minds Luther has alienated from himself with this booklet! For who, being good and truly endowed with a Christian heart, would approve of that dire and unparalleled rage of reviling? What, I ask, are the arguments? Or how many are there, by which he delivers, fortifies, and commends his inconsistent opinion about the supper? I read the booklet diligently with my emotions set aside, and I was astonished to see that man given over to a reprobate mind. May the Lord restore him! In return, I send to you as a gift what the ministers, that is, the pastors, readers of sacred letters, and preachers of the Zurich church, have responded to Luther. You will understand that our church does not rely on foolishness. Now indeed, and as always it is fitting, he has been answered modestly. Readers are not so stupid that they cannot judge who defends and delivers a better and more scripturally consistent cause. For not all depend on the authority and judgments of men. Truth will prevail.</p>
      <p>But what do you tell me about Bucer's recantation? I do not know whether he will confess what you write about him, as he has most certainly revoked. Again, I do not depend on Bucer, nor on Luther. Moreover, I understand Bucer speaking and writing about the Eucharist before he revoked; I do not understand much of what he has discussed since the revocation. But the word of the Lord is plain and intelligible.</p>
      <p>These few things, my dear Markus, I wanted to respond to your matters quickly. Consider and accept these things as coming from a friendly heart. We would have sent Luther a copy of our response, but since he so solemnly testifies that he will not write even a little more on this matter nor accept any writings from us, we have sent him nothing. And unless he commends his matters to us with firmer arguments and clearly dissolves ours for us, our people will not yield nor be silent.</p>
      <p>The matter of truth is at stake, for which life must be laid down and one must bravely fall. You will do a not ungrateful thing if you show him our response. For we are not ashamed of our cause. The Pope opposes us, the Anabaptists and other sectarians oppose us, and Luther opposes us, but relying on God's help, we will oppose all these. Truth will conquer. Christ reigns and will reign forever, to whom be glory.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all good things.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 12, in the year of our Lord 1545.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Master Markus Crodel of Dorgau.</p>
