      <p>Most pious and illustrious men, most esteemed lords, we wish health and the increase of God's gifts to your piety through Jesus Christ, our Lord. We have read the letters of your excellency, most distinguished men, and we are prepared to serve faithfully and willingly both the church and your piety.</p>
      <p>We have understood, however, that a few days ago, certain articles were being disputed in your church, and that our opinion on these matters is desired. Therefore, we have included this with as much brevity as we could, doing what we could by the grace granted to us by our Lord God. Your excellencies are not unaware that a consensus on the sacramental matter was long ago written and published among the ministers of your church, our dearest brothers, and us, in which from the very beginning we comprehended as much of this matter as we thought would suffice for the pious, nor have we ever taught anything different in the churches entrusted to our faith, nor do we today deliver anything different from these. For we establish that the election, by which God chose sinners and those deserving nothing good in Christ, is entirely gratuitous according to the apostle: "It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy," and also: "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world was laid, and predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace." Then we teach that faith, by which we are made partakers of Christ, is a pure gift of God, as it is given by the heavenly Father Himself, so that no one may boast before God, in respect of His most beloved Son, so that the beginning and progress, briefly all things of faith, are gifts of divine grace. However, we attribute nothing to the powers of a man not yet reborn except corruptions, guilt, and punishment, but to men renewed by the Spirit of God, we attribute voluntary and good operation because of the governing Spirit, yet in such a way that in the remnants of our flesh, as long as we live in this world, grace always finds something to work on and cleanse, according to the apostle: "I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh the law of sin," and also "We are not sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God," and again: "It is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure." Furthermore, that the reprobate do not believe the word of God, but live impiously against God and His word, this indeed should be imputed to them, not to God.</p>
      <p>For God is the immaculate force, who does not will iniquity, but is just in all His ways and holy in all His works. Therefore, men who perish, perish by their own fault, etc. Of this kind, we wrote not dissimilarly two days ago to our brothers, the ministers of your church. Jerome errs and does not rightly understand the sense and mind of the blessed memory of Zwingli, the faithful doctor of our church, if he thinks that he taught that man sins by necessity and is thus compelled by God. For although something of this may seem to be inferred from his book on the providence of God, yet his other books, which he published before and after that, should also be consulted, in which he explicitly does not derive the guilt of sin to God, but from human corruption and voluntary affection. Many of us still live who heard him preaching and know that he always spoke religiously on this matter. We wished to respond with these few words to your excellency and to summarize what seems to us, observing your piety, that you may take this our duty kindly and with perpetual prayers ask for the increase of God's gifts from God the Father through Christ Jesus, so that we may walk blamelessly before Him by His grace and finally attain the promised life. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Zürich, the first of December, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>Your excellency's devoted pastors and teachers, ministers of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and illustrious men, the lords consuls and the most distinguished senate of the republic of Geneva, their most esteemed lords.</p>
