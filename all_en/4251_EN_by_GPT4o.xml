      <p>Greetings. I have read (reverend father in Christ) the letters of Mr. Gesner and from them I have understood a few things about the French movements. I wish Mr. Gesner had been more detailed in his writing.</p>
      <p>I also communicated with Mr. Legate; but he (as they usually do) downplays it somewhat and asserts that the movements have been settled, which I, however, do not believe. Therefore, if you, reverend father, have any certain information, do not hide it from us.</p>
      <p>I know your occupations, especially now; but you can assign this task of writing to others. I also read your letters to Mr. Philippus, my colleague; but I could not sufficiently marvel that you added something about returning the crowned to my wife.</p>
      <p>How did it come to your mind to think this, as if I truly do not owe everything of mine to you and yours, and why would I not show the same humanity to yours as I would to strangers who have deserved nothing from me? Therefore, if you love me, do not let me hear such a thing from you in the future; I would certainly consider myself wronged if you offered me money for the many services owed to you under various names. This would be to reproach the service, not to appreciate it.</p>
      <p>I believe it is not the way of good friends to calculate services so precisely. I thought Mr. Philippus, having taken on that care, had already written long ago; the horse has recovered well; he will pay. I will have enough trouble with a bad payer; he is an Engadine.</p>
      <p>This is said in jest; for I love Mr. Philippus and I perceive that I am loved by him.</p>
      <p>Now to domestic matters: The legal case has begun; the next court day is set for the next Thursday after St. George's Day. The brothers offered their sister to torture and were about to have Hercules captured as well; but they have not yet been able to achieve that. Many are intervening on both sides; but God is urging this cause.</p>
      <p>For who would have ever believed that with everyone else ceasing, the brothers themselves would undertake the matter and expose their own sister to the executioner? - Three districts have written to the Landrichter (chief magistrate) of the Upper League to ensure that our Beccaria is expelled from Misox. The Landrichter wrote with his people from Misox; the matter is pressing.</p>
      <p>The people of Misox are appealing to the other two Leagues.</p>
      <p>They may, thank God, not bring the matter to an end, and if they should, etc. Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Chur, on the calends of April in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>All of ours wish you well.</p>
      <p>You will bid all of yours to be well from us.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes (head) of the Church of Zurich, his much-respected lord and patron. Zurich.</p>
