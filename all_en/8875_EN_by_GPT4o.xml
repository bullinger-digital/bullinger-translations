      <p>Greetings. I wanted to respond more fully to your letter written on April 4th, most esteemed lord; however, with the messenger in haste, I am now unable to do so, being hindered by a certain relative of mine, who, when I had already begun to write, distracted me for nearly 3 hours. Meanwhile, as I said, the messenger is preparing to leave, so I can now give nothing more than this enclosed note, which I had previously arranged to be written, so that I could insert it into the letter as soon as the messenger was offered, or, if he were delayed, add more. At the same time, I give you great thanks for writing to me so diligently about the tumult of the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Given at Augsburg, April 23, in the year 1572.</p>
      <p>Your most observant, Georg von Stetten. To the reverend, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
