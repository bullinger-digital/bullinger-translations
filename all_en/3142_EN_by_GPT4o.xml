      <p>Jesus Christ for salvation. Dearest Bullinger, the slanderous writings of Westphal, Schnepf, and Timann have come into my hands, unanimously reviving the long-dormant tragedy. Whereupon, driven by old zeal, I began to recollect my armor long since laid aside and to rearm myself for any event. This year, I gathered what I am sending to you here, before I had obtained Calvin's second response and your Apology; from which I would have refrained from labor if your responses had reached me earlier. I also recently obtained a copious letter from Johannes a Lasco, sent to Bucer ten years ago, which I transcribed with my own hand and which satisfies me in every way. Lasco also recently was with me, as well as with our princes, both the elder and the younger, while he was returning to Poland, and where Johannes Garnerius had shown him my collected works, which I am sending to you here, he desired them to be communicated to him, which could not be done, as there was only the autograph at hand. Our younger prince is entirely ours, a lover of learning and scholars, gladly conversing with the learned; he is never in my little town without calling me to converse and dine with him. I was also in Marburg a month ago for eight days, where I procured an increase in salary for Hyperius from both princes, where the younger prince also said he would honor you with some gift at this fair for the book dedicated to him by you, and he reminded the prince's treasurer, who was going to the fair, of this promise. However, the elder prince has not once, but even objected to me and to Pincier that Christ was seen by Paul after the ascension; therefore, the article of the ascension should not so strongly fight for our opinion on the supper, and we should refer to you to solve this knot for him. Although we could do this ourselves, he prefers to be instructed by you copiously on this matter. Therefore, in my collected works, I have indeed reduced the sum of the arguments into three questions, in the first of which it is discussed whether God has ever communicated his essential differences and intrinsic properties essentially to any creature, in the second, whether from the moment of Christ's conception his true body has ever been essentially in different places at the same time. With the negatives of these questions obtained, all the arguments of the Lutherans about the ubiquity of Christ's body fall apart, and for this reason, I have not contended with any adversary about the supper unless I have first brought these questions to their due conclusion. I offered your German Apology to Hyperius and the prince in the presence of his wife; he promised to read it when he had time, the lady kept it with her to read it herself and to commend it to the prince in your and my favor; for she, although once very devoted to Luther, is now entirely ours. I leave my collected works to your discretion, to publish them or to send them back to me or to Johannes a Lasco. I commend the sinner Lening, who has passed his 66th year, to your prayers and those of all the brothers, whom I also bid much in Christ to be well. Farewell, all of you.</p>
      <p>Given on the Sunday of Judica in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Lening, Minister of Christ in Melsungen.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his dearest brother in Christ.</p>
