    <p xml:id="regest1">Would like Bullinger not to conceal his situation any further; with his transfer as a schoolmaster to Stein am Rhein, the intention had been that he could prepare himself for church service by occasionally preaching; when he did this twice in the Schaffhausen region - Jakob Leu probably reported about it - the council became angry and forbade him from preaching; after a clarifying conversation, in which Hochholzer assured the mayor [Konrad Rapp] of his loyalty, the mayor allowed him to preach once or twice, which does not meet Hochholzer's expectations; asks Bullinger for advice and hopes to be relieved soon; greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Even though I do not wish to trouble you with my letters, venerable lord and dearest father, knowing that you are more than occupied with many other matters, yet, because you promote my affairs with singular zeal and because such things happen to me that rightly seemed to be referred to you, as the archbishop in our metropolis, it did not seem right to conceal them from you any longer, lest you be displeased later that they were not immediately reported to you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will explain the matter briefly: I do not think you have yet forgotten the counsel by which you and the other examiners, men as honorable as they are wise, sent me to the people of Stein am Rhein, namely, that I should preside over the school for some time, and in the meantime, if the opportunity arises, I should practice public preaching, so that in due time I might more conveniently preside over the church.</p>
      <p>To do this, I did not wish to seek favor in the city for certain reasons, nor did it seem necessary to seek favor to preach in the village, but I always judged that the Lord's calling should be awaited, lest I run without the Lord's command.</p>
      <p>It happened recently that an opportunity was given to me, not by my seeking, but almost by the compulsion of others; thus, I preached twice in the village near the city, yet within the jurisdiction of the Schaffhausen people. How and by whose command I undertook the duty of preaching, I think Jacob Leu has narrated. The council of Stein am Rhein, however, takes this with a displeased mind and does not want me to preach; they have prohibited it.</p>
      <p>When they presented certain reasons for their unwillingness, I responded to each in such a way that they had nothing beyond their private feelings. However, because they are the magistrates, I willingly obeyed until I could consult others. I spoke with the consul to carefully understand each matter. Then among other things, when he had nothing convenient to say, finally no longer concealing his feelings, he burst out with these words: "I assure myself, my lords of Stein will not allow themselves to be forced, nor will they have to do it" (for these are his words), "that they should call a schoolmaster who also wants to be a preacher." Sensing the consul's mind being carried away by his feelings, I briefly replied that I would not compel the most honorable council, to whom I rightly ought to obey, nor had I ever intended to do anything against their will, that I had undertaken this duty at the command of others to whom obedience was due, and that I was inquiring more diligently so that I might accommodate myself to their will in the future; that I had undertaken the care of the school, and therefore, since they wish it so, I would preside over it as diligently as I could, as long as it was my duty. Finally, he added that if I wished at some time, if necessary, to preach once or twice, either in the village or in the town, I should have a sermon. I denied that I would do this; for I do not wish to seek favor in this way nor can I ascend the pulpit unprepared and unpracticed. I did not wish to conceal these things from you. Since they do not want me to preach continuously, even if I neglect nothing in the school, I ask you to advise me in this matter; for I do not wish to preach in the future while I preside over this school.</p>
      <p>One thing remains, that whatever labor and tedium there is, I bear it patiently, and it will be lighter for me the sooner I hope to be freed. I will remain in this dust through this winter, for it is not fitting to leave so soon. After this time has passed, I will do what seems right to you again. I ask you to remember me in due time. I know you will do what you know to be in my interest, so keep me as always commended to you. I have written more extensively than I intended, only so that you may know each detail carefully.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Greet your wife, each of your children, and your maid in my name.</p>
      <p>In the town of Stein am Rhein, September 19, 1543. Yours most devotedly,</p>
      <p>Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful bishop of the church of Zurich, his most revered lord and father.</p>
