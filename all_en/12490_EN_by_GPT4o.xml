    <p xml:id="regest1">From the long and strengthening letter [not received] that Bullinger wrote immediately after the sermon on the Passion, despite his exhaustion, his affection for Haller is clearly evident. Everyone should be grateful for the diverse talents assigned to Bullinger by God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- With great joy, [Georg] Frölich and Haller read the many letters addressed to them by the [Zurichers]. Due to Frölich's great admiration for Bullinger, Haller receives several benefits from him. Bullinger might perhaps thank Frölich on Haller's behalf.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The cultured, pious [former] mayor [Hans] Welser also shows Haller many favors. Unfortunately, there is a tense relationship between Welser and [Michael] Keller. Haller tries to mediate cautiously and interacts with both to avoid suspicion from either. Haller must always be prepared to preach, as he often has to step in at short notice for the ailing Keller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Following Bullinger's recommendation, Haller shows respect towards [Wolfgang] Musculus. He often meets him, goes for walks with him, asks him about unclear [Bible] passages, and seeks his advice in other matters. Their relationship is sometimes even friendly. Shortly before Easter, Haller spoke with Musculus about the participation of unworthy people in the Lord's Supper. Haller noted that the statement that one eats the body of Christ sacramentally with the bread is just as blasphemous as the claim that one eats the body of Christ with the bread. Musculus agreed and asserted that believers eat Christ through faith. When they spoke about the ceremonies, Musculus remarked that the Lutheran and papal ceremonies resembled each other like two eggs. Haller had to laugh out loud about it. Musculus has thus become dear to him. Perhaps he will find the right path. If only he were not so dependent on [Martin] Bucer! The concern for the "sweet unity" leads him astray. He values Bullinger highly but thinks that Bullinger does not understand him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- A student from Augsburg [Hieremias Hermann?] was recalled from Wittenberg to [pastoral] service in his homeland and reported that Haller was notorious there as an impudent enthusiast and troublemaker. Musculus has therefore written a letter to Philipp [Melanchthon] to restore Haller's reputation. Bullinger should also advocate for this in writing to Melanchthon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Around Easter, Haller preached about the Lord's Supper for the third time. He used the expressions [common in Augsburg], but addressed the difference between the sign and the represented and emphasized that Christ can only be eaten in faith, and that this does not depend on an external action, but solely on God's voluntary act of grace. This even found favor with several opponents. Even though one can never satisfy the worst, he now lives somewhat more peacefully.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- He would have followed Bullinger's advice if Musculus were not currently interpreting the Gospel of John on Saturdays and Keller the Gospel of Luke. Instead of Luke, Haller will therefore preach on Matthew on Mondays, especially since no Gospel is interpreted in the Moritzkirche during the weekdays.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Here is the weekly preaching schedule: On Mondays, Haller preaches in the Moritzkirche on the Epistle to Timothy. On Tuesdays, Musculus preaches in the Marien[dom] on the Psalms. On Wednesdays, Keller preaches in the Moritzkirche on the First Epistle to the Corinthians. On Thursdays, [Johannes] Ehinger preaches in the Marien[dom] on the First Book of Kings. On Fridays, [Johann Heinrich] Held [von Tiefenau] preaches in the Moritzkirche on the Epistle to the Romans. On Saturdays, [Johann] Meckart preaches in the Marien[dom] on the Gospel of Luke. From this, it is evident that in the Moritzkirche [on weekdays only] the [New Testament] epistles are addressed. Haller plans to preach on both the Old and New Testaments: on Sunday evenings on Genesis, and on Mondays (as soon as he finishes interpreting the Second Epistle to Timothy) on Matthew. The interpretation of the Epistle to the Hebrews would also have been appealing, but Haller is deterred by the difficulties of this book.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Greetings to the family, to Haller's father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli], and to the colleagues. Greetings from Bernardino [Ochino], who recently spoke brilliantly in public about the Lord's Supper, and from Haller's wife [Elsbeth, née Kambli].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Haller will send any future new publications about Luther's death.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- [P.S.:] Enclosed is the quite good [“Refutation of the Twelve Reasons”] by the schoolteacher Sebastian Coccius from [Schwäbisch] Hall, directed against [Kaspar] Schwenckfeld. Unfortunately, Coccius attributes too much authority to the condemnation of heresies pronounced by the Schmalkaldic League.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Bullinger should procure and send some copies of the work on the Resurrection [“Hope of the Believers”] translated [into German] by [Johannes] Fries from [Christoph] Froschauer. Many see the work with Haller and want to own it as well. Haller will settle the bill later through his brother [Wolfgang]. Due to the unavailability of [“Defensio verae doctrinae”] by Johannes a Lasco, he will still write to Basel.</p>

      <p>S.P. through the Lord Jesus Christ. I received your letters, most esteemed man, immediately after the sermon on the Passion of the Lord (as you write), from which I understand how much you love me, who, despite being exhausted from speaking, also took on the labor of writing for my sake. But although they were long, they could not satisfy my desire to read them, let alone cause me any weariness. Therefore, I thank you, my father, for strengthening me with such spirit; and indeed, you are fulfilling your duty! The Lord has entrusted you with innumerable talents, which (I now feel) you will return to the Lord with great interest. Therefore, we all owe not only much to you but very much to God, who has given you to us. Continue, therefore, to love not only yourself but also us and our church, which, if it were possible, would not be ungrateful to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We, Mr. Laetus and I, have read the letters written by all of you, of which there were so many that we were not occupied but delighted for several hours reading them. It is amazing how much this man loves you! He always has Bullinger on his lips and does me many favors because of your name, so that I cannot give thanks worthy of the Lord God, who has given me such a patron in such a laborious province. I would therefore wish that you would also thank him in my name.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Consul Welser also shows me many favors, being very humane and pious. Here, one scruple presses me, that there is some, not small, discord between him and Mr. Cellarius, which I am trying to remove from both (though prudently). For while I adhere to one, I become suspect to the other. Hence, I use the familiarity of both in such a way that I do not offend either. Cellarius is very much an invalid, which gives me a lot of work in preaching. However, I miss one thing in him, that he entrusts the pulpit to me almost at the last moment. Therefore, I need to always be prepared, so that I am not overwhelmed by uncertainty when unprepared.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I hold Mr. Musculus in high regard, as you advise, and show him all honor. I frequently meet him, accompany him on walks, ask him about obscure passages, seek his advice in matters, and honor him in any way I can. I also sometimes converse with him amicably. I detest quarrels and dissensions! I long for pious and sincere concord! By these means, I have achieved so much with him that, if he does not love me, he at least pretends to. I also recently discussed with him the matter of the Eucharist, especially about those who partake unworthily (for Easter was approaching), where I said, among other things, that the impious only eat the body of the Lord to the extent that the bread is sacramentally called the body of the Lord; which he approved, saying that the pious also eat the Lord in no other way than through faith, that is, that he becomes ours and remains in us. We also came to the ceremonies. To which question he said: "These ceremonies of the Lutherans are as similar to papism as one egg is to another." At which statement I was very much delighted and began to love and honor him more. I hope, therefore, that he can easily be brought back to the right path, if only he were not so completely led around like a puppet and dependent on Bucer. For whatever Bucer says or writes, he adores as an oracle. The good man is deceived by the sweetness of concord, under the title of which he destroys much. He also loves you very much. He only complains that you do not understand him, as he means it. This sore (if it is the only one) can be easily healed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>A young man from Augsburg, who studied for some time in Wittenberg, has now been recalled to his homeland for ministry. He reported astonishingly how my name is slandered in Wittenberg, how impudent a fanatic I am, and what disturbances I cause in the Augsburg church! When I heard this, I approached Mr. Musculus, informed him, and asked him to write on my behalf and defend me to those he knows. He did so and wrote to Mr. Philipp, so that he too might remove this opinion of me from others, that I am not at all a lover of disturbances, but of peace. I therefore also ask you, if you ever write to Philipp, to defend my innocence and testify to what kind of person I am.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Around the Easter festival, because the time demanded it, I preached for the third time on the Lord's Supper. I presented the matter with as much clarity as I could. I did not reject their modes of speaking; however, I explained how they should be understood, and thus I agree with the other brothers. I indicated what the difference is between the sign and the signified; that Christ is eaten by faith alone; that this eating is not bound to an external action, but is free to divine grace, etc. By these sermons, all the pious were delighted; even many of the adversaries were well content. No pious person will ever satisfy the coarser ones. Therefore, the state of my affairs is now somewhat more peaceful than before. I pray to the Lord to increase and preserve his peace in us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I would follow your advice in preaching, if Musculus were not interpreting John and Cellarius Luke. Therefore, I will take Matthew in hand on Mondays. For no evangelist is preached in the Mauritian church on weekdays.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Thus, the weekly sermons are arranged: On Monday in the Mauritian church: Haller has the Epistle to Timothy. On Tuesday, in the Marian church: Musculus has the Psalms. On Wednesday, in the Mauritian church: Cellarius has the First Epistle to the Corinthians. On Thursday, in the Marian church: Ehinger has the First Book of Kings. On Friday, in the Mauritian church: Held has the Epistle to the Romans. On Saturday, in the Marian church: Mecardus has the Gospel of Luke.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>You see that in the Mauritian church all have the epistles. Therefore, I will take Matthew; for Cellarius has Luke, Musculus has John on Saturdays. I will begin, however, with both the Old and New Testaments: Genesis on Sunday evenings and Matthew on Monday, but first completing the one (epistle) which is the Second to Timothy. My mind suggests the one to the Hebrews, but the difficulty of it greatly hinders me. But it matters little. For all scripture is divinely inspired and useful for teaching, for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. I thank you for your advice. The praise will be the Lord's if any fruit arises from it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Farewell. Greet your entire family, my father-in-law, and all the brothers and colleagues. Mr. Bernardino, who recently also spoke candidly about the supper publicly, and my wife wish you well. Augsburg, May 9, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>If the booksellers bring any news about Luther's death, I will send it. Yours most devotedly, Johannes Haller.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I am sending here the Refutations of the 12 Articles of Schwenckfeld by Sebastian Coccius, a schoolmaster from Hall, as I hear, which seems to me to handle the matter not unsuccessfully, if he did not attribute too much to the excommunication of the Schmalkaldic League, as if it were heretical, whatever they proscribed. For I know what kind of people they all are (whose catalog he has placed here) towards us.</p>
      <p>I ask you in return to send, as soon as you can, one or two copies of your handbook on the resurrection, as translated by Frisius; for many, seeing my copy, also wish to have it. Our booksellers do not have it. Froschauer, from whom you will receive it, will credit my brother, whom I will satisfy. I have not yet found the booklet by Johannes a Lasco; however, I will write to Basel for it.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and most humane man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, first bishop of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
