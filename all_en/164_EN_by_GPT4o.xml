      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings beforehand, well-learned, dear, special one. We have been informed by Zaiger, this master Heinrich Panthaleon, assistant in the parish of St. Peter here, that he intends to take his journey up to Zurich to you. We have entrusted him with some news, which came to us on the 19th of this month, for you to receive from him. Whatever else is new with you, and how the situation stands with those from Constance, we kindly desire to be informed by you. We hereby commend you to God the Almighty.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, the 21st of June, in the year 1548. Zaiger also has instructions to report to you what you should announce to the mayors on our behalf; we trust you will be able to fulfill this without difficulty.</p>
      <p>G(eorg), C(ount) o(f) Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, our dear, special Heinrich Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther, preachers in Zurich, to their hands.</p>
