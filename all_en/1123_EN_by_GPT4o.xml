      <p>Greetings in the Lord forever, and I pray for all future prosperity for you, your family, and all of Switzerland this year, so that the word received may remain and flourish to the praise of God's name, the honor of Jesus Christ, and the benefit of all Christianity.</p>
      <p>Amen, amen. As you request my opinion, dearest Bullinger, on whether I have judged it necessary to write to the king, I will not hesitate to reveal it briefly, nor do I doubt that you will accept candidly whatever I am about to say. A great evil threatens the Church of England, and I know that all the good and purer ones are greatly disturbed. However, this evil can easily be removed or mitigated by your authority and that of your church if you write to the king. Hooper strives to restore the church to its original purity: on the other hand, the other bishops, who are both learned and profess the word, are ashamed that they have not seen their errors. Hence, they stubbornly contend that he should be involved with them in the same superstitious ceremonies. They accuse the man of disobedience when he says he cannot admit anything other than what the apostles used in the beginning. They have also persuaded the king at first that he condemned vestments and such things as evil in themselves and simply.</p>
      <p>However, when they did not prevail with this, they devised another lie; namely, that he conceded vestments, shaving, and other such things used by bishops as indifferent matters. Hooper did neither: for he did not condemn vestments as evil in themselves, nor did he concede vestments and the shaving of bishops as indifferent and tolerable in the church of God.</p>
      <p>Now the dispute is pending before the king as judge; if he is solidly instructed by you on this controversy, to the extent that it should be judged by the word of God, I do not doubt that it will greatly benefit the cause of religion. However, I do not judge it necessary or useful for you to write specifically about this controversy, but rather about what ceremonies are to be admitted in the church and to what extent; lest you seem to be prompted by Hooper to write these things. You now have my opinion; and if you write letters, I will send them by courier at no expense to you. Not long ago, I received letters that the contention is not yet finished. Hooper has John a Lasco and a few others on his side; against him, many enemies, and among them Bucer, who, if he had the same authority as he once had with us, it would be over for Hooper's dignity; he would not become a bishop: which I fear may happen, and the Bishop of London strives in every way for it to happen.</p>
      <p>Dr. Christoph Mont has been in Augsburg for almost six whole months now, and he has not yet returned: he is expected daily. Farewell. My wife sends her regards to you and your wife most dutifully. May she be safe from me as well. Strasbourg, December 28, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, John Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent, wisest Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, my gracious lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
