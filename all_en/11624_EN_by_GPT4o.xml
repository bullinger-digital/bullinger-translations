May Christ protect Bullinger [from the plague]; the church relies on good pastors. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write to you as Ambrosius [Blarer] is writing to you. However, I am sending here a letter given to me from Augsburg. I give a thousand thanks for your concern for Georg [Wimpfer], the pastor in Stein, so much so that his stipend has already been increased, largely thanks to your efforts. You have Ambrosius's letters regarding other matters.</p>
      <p>May Christ keep you safe for the glory of His church. For what do you think will happen if the church is deprived of its pious ministers?</p>
      <p>I wish your entire household well. Farewell. November 5, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother in Christ.</p>
