      <p>Grace and a tranquil conscience, etc.</p>
      <p>From the synod, as I was returning to refresh myself in my home with the bothersome gout, along with the brothers of Matthias Vituduri, most kind man, I returned, and the same handed me a writing containing your law, stating that I had prescribed to a certain sick person a prayer to the number of the Lord's Prayer for the recovery of former health, etc. I beg you, do not wish to make me, so insignificant and unfaithful, ignorant of the art and the natural virtues of medicine. If grace and faith were lacking, yet the long day, which even makes lions obey man, and the learned pagans, in whose reproach, if I did not wish to spare faith and Christ, of whom we both are, would have forbidden to impose this superstition, and my own somewhat meager Minerva. Therefore, I have been accused before you. Consider the accuser a liar, my most learned teacher.</p>

      <p>To the learned and pious master Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest teacher in the Lord.</p>
