    <p xml:id="regest1">Recently wrote, but if he is already sending letters, he does not want Bullinger to be left empty-handed. Reminds him of the requested books and asks for the dispatch of his lute. Sends him a self-made armillary sphere, which [Georg] Binder can reassemble, and promises further shipments. M[artin] Peyer has gone to Frankfurt and will travel from there with Philipp [Melanchthon] to Wittenberg; he sends greetings to Bullinger and asks Froschauer to send him Zurich paper through Moritz Goltz; Myconius also wishes for a delivery. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>Although I have not sent you a letter many days ago, dearest patron, I do not hesitate to add another now, so that in the great number of letters I am sending, you are not left without one from me. Your former benevolence and paternal love towards me, which you showed me in person, make me not doubt that my letters, though absent, are most welcome to you.</p>
      <p>I have already explained in previous letters that I have returned to Basel and the state of affairs here, so I do not think it worthwhile to detain you longer with a report of these matters. I ask you this one thing (if indeed you wish me to remain in Basel), to send me my Cicero and other things I requested. I would also like to have my lute, if only there were someone who would bring it to me at a fair price. Perhaps Quirinus will undertake this task.</p>
      <p>I am sending you here an armillary sphere, which I composed during my leisure before I went to Strasbourg, which Binder can now reassemble.</p>
      <p>I will also send some other things this summer, if God is favorable to my studies.</p>
      <p>M[artin] Beyer has now gone to Frankfurt; from there he will go with Philipp to Wittenberg. He wrote to me as he was leaving Strasbourg and asks that I convey his many greetings to you in his name. He would have written to you himself, had shame not prevented him. He also instructed me in Strasbourg to write to Froschauer, to send the best paper he has, ein rysen, to Frankfurt and there hand it over to the bookseller Moritz Goltz, so that Martin can take it to Wittenberg. He will pay whatever it costs. Please, I ask you, request this of Froschauer; your requests will be more effective than mine. BÃ¤tend inn allein, that he does not take the purest paper he has. Miconius also instructed me to write in his name, that Zurich paper be sent to him as well.</p>
      <p>Farewell, esteemed father, and always keep your Rudolf recommended to you. Greet in my words your mother and your wife with the whole family.</p>
      <p>From Basel, from the house of Mr. Myconius, March 4, 1539. Yours most observantly,</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron.</p>
