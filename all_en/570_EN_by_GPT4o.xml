      <p>Greetings, most humane of all men.</p>
      <p>As soon as I returned to ZÃ¼rich, I was so... and with the constraint of time and a certain weariness of this business, not so much exhausted as completely worn out, that I could not communicate with you even those matters which seemed more serious to me, as I had hoped to do before my departure, and when I see people so self-interested and everywhere devoted to their own advantages, that even the cause of Christ himself is either despised by some or treated coldly or rejected under some pretext of worldly affairs, which if they involve themselves in, they think they are disturbed, indeed have defected from Christ, as if it were not permitted for us to use these to glorify God, when the opportunity presents itself to us, and they prefer to act as ministers in this rather than allow anyone to follow their calling, and if others recognized their own, perhaps they would not be so critical of others and would strive to be less pleased with themselves. But if the spirit of the Lord had not long since settled in my mind, so that it cannot be torn away, and had not occupied that seat of the mind, I would fear that, following the common example, I would do the same and rather hide in some corner attending to domestic affairs than pursue the business of Christ so earnestly. But let such an execrable blasphemy be far from me, that I should cease to rest for him, who never rested for me, until he endured the reproach of the cross. Therefore, I now return to Italy prepared for all cases no less than I did before, and I desire to be bound for the name of Christ. And because in delivering these letters the Senate of Venice will undoubtedly inquire of me individually about the state of your affairs, especially why you did not enter into this alliance with the French, it would be necessary for me to have at hand the reasons why it was so acted, which I could offer or explain to them, so that they understand you acted rightly. However, Master Haller, while I was in Bern, would have granted them to me, if they had not been written in German, and since... there was not enough leisure left in my departure for them to be translated into Latin, he referred me to you, and so I had hoped; but in that confusion of affairs, it slipped my mind to ask them from you. Therefore, I ask you again and again to send them to me, and if you have anything else that I can report to those lords, do not take away, I beg you, this opportunity from me, which will not only benefit this cause, but also, I hope, bring not a little authority and advantage to our affairs. Master Vadian, when he comes to you, can conveniently bring it. I met him at the hour when he wanted to depart booted; he would have liked, having read your letters, to try everything to satisfy me; but the constraint of time did not allow it, however, he promised to return within eight days and will leave nothing untried. I know in that man the highest piety and singular humanity; he is very similar to you, and rightly you call him brother, as he is almost another. In the meantime, I will remain here or elsewhere with as little expense as I can. Urge him, I beseech you, that we may obtain these letters in the name of the procurator; for what those commendatory letters will accomplish, I do not yet have ascertained.</p>
      <p>It is indeed troublesome to me that we give the impious an occasion for blasphemy; for when they see that I have returned and have not obtained from the brothers those things which even pagans would not have denied and, if I had wished, I could have obtained even from the impious, they will say: "Let him now go to his Lutherans, for whom he has so rashly contended even to blood, nor can he protect himself in their name, even procuratorial letters are denied to him." You see how great scandals will arise from the smallest matters; take care that they are removed by your diligence. It can be done most conveniently by the work of Vadian. Nor do I want that worn-out saying to be rightly attributed to me. "We have wasted effort and expense"; for I am prepared to give even my life for this cause.</p>
      <p>I had been troublesome enough to you with my presence; I also wanted to add these most troublesome letters. But you, in your humanity, consider everything rightly and love me.</p>
      <p>From St. Gallen, June 28, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Baldassare Altieri.</p>
