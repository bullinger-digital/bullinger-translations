      <p>Greetings through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Honorable and gracious Lord Bullinger, I would be very glad to hear about your and your family's health. As for myself, I give praise and thanks to God the Lord, who may continue to share His grace with us. My last letter was sent through Mr. Christoph Thretio, hoping he has arrived well. Since then, I have received a letter from him, confirming that you have received the goods, and I asked him to convey my friendly greetings to you.</p>
      <p>This letter is solely to inform you that there is talk here that the Spanish campaign is to be observed over Geneva and Switzerland. The Pope is said to have sent a legate to the Duke of Alba in Dillingen, urging him not to refrain from attacking the city of Geneva and to raze it to the ground. He was reportedly told in response that he had such orders from His Majesty, but he considers it wise that the King of France should first be brought into the alliance, otherwise it would be difficult to proceed. Consequently, the legate is said to have been dispatched to the French court; time will tell what he accomplishes. If the French hesitate, it could indeed go badly, but we trust in God, who is stronger than all potentates. There is also talk that the Duke of Ladran is to raise two regiments of infantry in Augsburg for the benefit of the King of Spain, and is also said to have large orders for horses. If matters are not settled with the Duke of Savoy and the Bernese, it could indeed lead to serious conflict. May God turn His wrath away from us and have mercy on His poor Christian church. You will likely have better knowledge of all this than I can convey; I ask that if you have anything worth writing, please share it with me.</p>
      <p>Recent news from the Netherlands reports that the poor Christians are being severely persecuted. In Valenciennes, it is said that two preachers and three prominent citizens have been executed by hanging and the sword, so the persecution is great; also, some princes of the empire are said to have sent their envoys there to plead for the poor Christians, but reportedly with little success. May God have mercy on them. Nothing more at this time, with a request that you kindly accept my simple and humble writing, and I commend you to the protection and care of the Most High. Dated in Nuremberg, June 18, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your humble servant, Gabriel Schl√ºsselberger.</p>
