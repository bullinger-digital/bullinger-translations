  <output>Greeting and remain in the knowledge of Christ.
You are doing well, most sweet Heinric, for striving as hard as you can to restore, adorn and defend the somewhat shaken Christian faith and true piety following the untimely death of the most blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli. May the Lord, who gives increase to all, foster, increase and support your fortunate endeavors. This gives our spirits great hope, when (which may be fortunate and propitious) you succeed to the most famous and most upright man, who will himself be no less famous! You can see foolish and foolish men carrying trophies, singing hymns, and bragging about triumphs (but according to the proverb, praise before victory), to whom the ball will easily and quickly come to their mouth if you go bravely, stick to your plans and the spirit that, as he says, alone conquers all, and do not give yourself what many promise you. They promise that you will overcome with a pious skill and cruelly and harshly too much afflictions to piety and (hopefully not too immodestly) no less with piety and integrity lift and help whatever anguish everywhere attacks and tortures the pious. Try to do more than all the prayers and do it so that I myself will experience and feel your duty in getting the job done from my state of exile (which I have been brought to present by some atheists for a most abominable impiety).</output>

  <output>You are doing very well, dear Henry, to strive with all your might to repair, adorn and defend the Christian and true piety which was somewhat shaken by the premature death of the most blessed man Ulrich Zwingli. May the Lord, who gives increase to all, favour, increase and strengthen your happy endeavours.

And they promise that with a certain piety you will overcome the most cruel and harsh troubles that assail piety, and (God grant that I do not speak too daringly) with no less piety you will relieve and help, with your support and your help, whatever misfortunes assail the pious from all sides and oppress and torture them. Try to give better than what is expected of you by all, and try to do this so that I too, in my state of exile (which I have been given by certain atheists for an abominable impiety of which they have been accused), can experience and feel your effort in taking up the function. Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, acted very piously and happily in this matter and should therefore be rewarded with an immortal name by posterity.

May the Lord, who gives increase to all, bless and increase your efforts.

And they promise that with a pious skillfulness you will overcome cruelly and excessively pressing troubles of piety, and (I hope this is not said too boldly) with a pious integrity you will ease and assist whatever misfortunes and hardships press and torment the pious from all sides. Strive to do more than the wishes of all, and do so that I too may experience and feel your office in acquiring the position in my state of exile, which I am suffering through some godless men due to one abominable impiety. Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, acted very piously and happily in this matter, and therefore should be rewarded by posterity with an immortal name. It is necessary that you should renew his work and industry in helping his brothers. I am one of those whom they call strangers.

  <output>You are doing a great job in trying your utmost to restore, embellish and defend the Christian, true piety which was somewhat shaken by the premature death of the most blessed man Ulrich Zwingli, Heinrich, my dearest. May the Lord bless your efforts, increase and support them, for He gives progress to all. It gives us great hope that, happily and fortunately, you will succeed the very famous and honest man who will himself become famous. You may see ignorant and stupid people carrying trophies, singing paeans and proclaiming triumphs (as the proverb goes, praise before victory). It will soon and easily be shown to be nothing more than a straw in their mouth if you courageously continue and persist in your undertaking and with that spirit which, as that man said, conquers all. Never consider it beneath you to do what so many promise to you. They promise that you will be able to overcome through a certain pious dexterity the cruel and harsh afflictions to piety and, I hope, not more shamelessly, through a certain pious integrity to alleviate and to help with support and aid whatever miseries assail, oppress and afflict the pious from all directions. Try to do something even better than what all desire and do it in such a way that I, too, from my state of exile (which I have been subjected to through certain atheists due to one abominable impiety) will be able to experience and feel your duty in taking on this position. The most blessed Zwingli, your predecessor, carried out this task piously and most successfully and, for this very reason, should be held in immortal name among posterity. You must, therefore, follow his example in helping his brothers by doing something new as well. I am, indeed, one of those whom they call foreigners. (You know well, through your own candor, how a Christian may be an alien and a stranger to a minister of the gospel). And I certainly see and experience (for I speak from experience) that some not sufficiently pious and, therefore, inexperienced in brotherly afflictions, are not neglecting us, despising us or scorning us. It is for them to consider what their attitude should be.</output>

  <output>You are doing very well in striving to repair, adorn, and defend the Christian and true piety that was somewhat weakened by the untimely death of the most blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli, and you are doing quite the honorable thing, Heinrich, my dear. May the Lord bless your fortunate endeavors, increase them, and support them, as He gives to all growth. This brings great hope to our minds, since (which may be fortunate and prosperous) you succeed a very renowned and sincere man, who will himself be no less renowned! You may see foolish and stupid men carrying trophies, singing paeans, and boasting of triumphs (but according to the proverb, praise comes before victory), and it will easily and shortly be proved that they have a pill in their mouth, if you continue boldly and remain faithful to your goals, and with that spirit which, as he said, conquers all, you shall not consider it unworthy of yourself that many promise of you. And they promise with a pious dexterity that you will overcome cruelly and harshly pressing troubles of piety and (which I hope is not too shamelessly said) with no less piety will lift and support with aid and help whatever afflictions, press upon, and torture the pious from all sides. You shall strive to do more than all that is promised, and strive so that I too may feel and understand your duty in obtaining the office, in this most pious and fortunate manner that your most blessed predecessor Zwingli was to be rewarded with an immortal name among posterity, for this very reason. It is necessary for you to renew his labor and diligence in helping his brothers. I am indeed among those whom they call foreigners. (But you know as well as I do, with your sincere heart, how far a Christian is from a Christian and an evangelist from a minister.) And I see and experience (for I speak from experience) that not a few, not sufficiently pious, and thus inexperienced in brotherly calamities and compassionate towards us, do not neglect, despise, and scorn us. Let it be their concern what attitude they have towards this. Certainly, those whose spirit is not sufficiently sincere and incorrupt, they aim at being useful for Christian gentleness, as many as need it. Those that need it chiefly are (which you know better than I do) those who, for the glory of Christ, have left their homeland, or have been driven away, and now, at last, being subject to many misfortunes, they bravely and strongly fight for its defense.</output>

  <output>You are doing very well in your efforts to repair, adorn and defend the Christian and true piety which has been weakened somewhat by the premature death of the most blessed man Ulrich Zuingli, and you are doing very well, Henry, most sweetly.May the Lord bless and increase your successful efforts, who gives increase to all.For it gives us great hope that you are succeeding to the place and function of a very renowned and sincere man, who himself will be famous in the future!You may see ignorant and foolish people carrying trophies, singing paeans and boasting of triumphs (but as the proverb says, 'praise before victory'), but it will be clear to them in a short time if you persist bravely and remain devoted to your cause with the spirit which, as he says, alone conquers all, and you will not be doing unworthy of what many promise you.They promise, with a certain piety, that you will overcome cruelly and harshly pressing troubles on piety, and (I hope I am not too immodest) that with an equal piety, you will relieve them from suffering and help them, whatever woes beset the pious from all sides and torment and distress them.Do your best to surpass the wishes of all, and make sure that I, too, in my exile (which I have suffered for one abominable impiety committed by some atheists) will experience and feel your duty in taking office.Your predecessor the most blessed Zuingli acted most piously and happily in this matter and deserves to be remembered by posterity with an immortal name.It is necessary that you take up his work and diligence in helping his brothers.I am indeed one of those whom they call aliens (but you know how a Christian is alien to another Christian and a minister of the Gospel).And I experience this for certain (for I speak from experience) that certain people, not sufficiently pious and inexperienced in the calamities of their brothers, neglect us, despise us and scorn us.Let them consider why they do this.Surely those with an impure and incorruptible spirit, seek to be useful to all who need them in the name of Christian sincerity.Those who mainly need them (as you know me better) are those who, for the glory of Christ, have left or been driven from their country and are now exposed to many hardships, and fight bravely and strongly to defend it.This I would like to be known from those who report about me.</output>

  <output>You are doing very well to strive to this end to repair, adorn and defend the Christian and true piety, which has been somewhat shaken by the untimely death of the very blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli, most worthily, Henry, most sweet. May those of your efforts be blessed, increased and seconded by the Lord, Who gives the increase of all. It gives great hope to our spirits that (which may be lucky and fortunate) you will succeed a man both famous and candid formerly, yourself to be no less famous and celebrated! You may see foolish and dull people carrying trophies, singing paeans, and boasting of triumphs (but, according to the proverb, praise before victory); a ball easily and quickly put in their mouths, if you continue bravely, and adhere to your intentions, and with that spirit which, as he said, alone conquers all, do not think it unworthy of you, what many promise themselves of you. And they promise with a certain pious dexterity, that you will overcome cruelly and too severely the molestations that are pressing upon piety, and (that I may not speak impudently of what I hope) with no less piety you will raise and help by your aid and assistance whatever afflictions attack and torment the pious on all sides. Do your best to exceed all expectations, and so strive, that I also may experience and feel in my state of exile (which some atheists have brought upon me by an execrable impiety in one missive) your office in obtaining this function. Your very blessed predecessor, Zwingli, acted most piously and happily in this matter, and therefore he deserves to be celebrated by posterity with immortal fame. You must also do your part to help your brothers. I am indeed one of those whom they call foreigners (but how far a Christian may be foreign to another Christian and a minister of the gospel, you know well enough, from your own candour). And this I certainly see and experience (for I speak from experience): that some, not sufficiently pious and therefore inexperienced in fraternal calamities, do not so much neglect us, despise us, and contemn us. What their mind is in doing this, let it be their care. Certainly those who have less sincere and incorrupt minds, intend this, that they may be useful to as many as need them, in the name of Christian candour. And they have the greatest need (which you know better about me), who, for the glory of Christ, have left and perhaps are now fighting bravely and courageously for the same, being cast out of their native country and now liable to many evils. Which I wish to be known by others reporting of me. For you can better judge of the foetus than the mother herself.</output>

Try to give more than all wishes and so try that I too, in my state of exile (which the atheists have brought to me through one abominable impiety), experience and feel your office in obtaining the function. The most pious and happy predecessor of yours, the most blessed Zwingli, has done this very piously and happily, and therefore is to be named with an immortal name by posterity. Your work and diligence must be renewed to help the brothers. I am one of those whom they call aliens.

  <output>You are doing very well, Henry, to strive with all your might to repair, adorn and vindicate the Christian and true piety that has been shaken somewhat by the untimely death of the most blessed man Ulrich Zwingli. May the Lord bless your efforts and increase them. This gives us great hope, for (may it be fortunate and prosperous!) you are succeeding a very famous and trustworthy man, who will be famous and trustworthy too! You may see foolish and stupid people carrying trophies, singing hymns of praise, and proclaiming triumphs (but according to the proverb, praise before victory); but it will be easily and quickly proved that these are mere words if you continue bravely and stay true to your objectives, and with the spirit that, as he said, conquers all. Do not think it beneath you to do what many are promising you. They promise that you will surpass others with a pious dexterity in dealing cruelly and harshly with the troubles that attack and torment piety, and (may I not speak too boldly of my hope) that you will also lift them with a pious integrity, and support and help whatever afflictions assail the pious from all sides. Try to do more than all desire, and do it so that I too may experience and feel the benefit of your appointment in my state of exile (which I have been given by some godless men for that abominable impiety of mine). Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, acted piously and happily in this matter, and should be remembered forever for it. You too must do your best to help your brethren. I am one of those whom they call foreigners. (How far a Christian can be a stranger to a Christian and a minister of the gospel, you can easily guess from your own candor.) And I certainly see and experience (for I speak from experience) that some not sufficiently pious, and so inexperienced in calamities of their brethren, do not take enough notice of us, despise us, and scorn us. What their motives may be, is their own concern. But certain it is that those of a less sincere and uncorrupted spirit are aiming to be of service to all who need help in the name of Christian charity. They need it especially (as you know better than I), those who, for the glory of Christ, have been driven out, or even abandoned, their country, and now, after so many misfortunes, are bravely and firmly fighting for it. I would have this known by others who speak of me. For, as you know, the midwife is better able to judge of the child than the mother. Indeed (perhaps foolishly I am telling it), I was in a place where, according to the times, I did not oppose impiety, but even agreed to it, did not protest against an abomination, but even cried out against it; and did not resist danger to my life, but even gave an opportunity to the destruction of many. So wickedly was the business managed.</output>

  <output>You are very rightly and most deservingly doing your utmost to repair, adorn and defend the Christian and true piety which was somewhat shaken by the premature death of the blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli, Heinrich, most sweet. May the Lord, who gives increase to all, favor, increase, and support these your endeavors. For it gives us great hope, when (which may be happily and prosperously so) you succeed to the place and office of a man so renowned and straightforward aforetime, and yourself being no less renowned in due time. You may see foolish and rude men bearing trophies, singing paeans, and boasting of triumphs (but, according to the proverb, praise before victory); which, if you go on intrepidly, and adhere to your undertaking, and with that spirit which, as he said, alone conquers all things, you will not do unworthy of yourself, as many promise you. For they promise, and with a pious dexterity, that you shall overcome cruelly and very severely those assaults which are made on piety, and (that I may not speak too boldly) with an equal piety remove and support with your aid and help whatever of afflictions on every side press and torment the pious. Endeavor to perform more than is expected of you, and so endeavor that I myself may experience and feel, in my state of banishment (which I have been brought into by certain atheists, on account of one abominable impiety) your office in obtaining this employment. Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, acted most piously and happily in this matter, and for this very cause he is to be had in everlasting remembrance. It is necessary that you should add your endeavours to those which he has made to help his brethren. I am certainly one of the number whom they call strangers (but how a Christian can be a stranger to a Christian, and a minister of the Gospel to his fellow-minister, you, with your candor of mind, easily know). And certainly I perceive and experience (for I speak of that which I have tried) that there are not a few who, not being sufficiently pious, and therefore not feeling the calamities of their brethren, do not so much regard us, nor take so much pleasure in us. What they do it with, let them consider. However, those whose minds are less sincere and uncorrupted, aim at this, to be of use to as many as stand in need of them, in the name of Christian candor. And they have most need of it (which you know better than I), who, for the glory of Christ, have left their country, nay, have been driven from it, and are now oppressed with many miseries, and bravely and stoutly fight for its defence. Which I wish were known to others who relate it of me. For, as the midwife better judges of the breech than the mother herself, so you best know the state of my condition. To be plain (though I may be too bold), I was in such a place where, according to the temper of the times, I did not oppose impiety, but was consenting to it, nor did I cry out against the abomination, nor did I oppose it with my life, though I gave occasion to the destruction of many. So great was the mischief of a wicked desire. And to this I have been driven, that, though I must myself yield the place, yet the abomination may not succeed, unless in the changing of things, worse than now happen.</output>

  <output>You are doing excellently in straining every nerve to restore, adorn and defend the Christian faith and true piety which has been shaken somewhat by the premature death of the blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli. May the Lord bless your endeavors and increase them. This gives us great hope when (which may be lucky and auspicious) you step into the place and function of the well-known and most honest man, who will be no less famous himself. You may see foolish and barbarous men carrying trophies, singing paeans, proclaiming triumphs (but according to the proverb, praise before victory); it will easily and shortly be obvious to them, if you continue boldly, persist in your efforts and with the mind, that, as he says, conquers all alone, you do not degrade yourself to that for which many promise themselves of you. And they promise with a certain pious skill that you will be able to overcome cruelly and too harshly pressing oppressions of piety, and (that I may not say anything more impudently than I hope) with the same pious integrity, you will raise up and assist with help whatever miseries from every direction assail and torment the pious. Try to perform more than everyone's expectations and try to do it in a way that I too will experience from my state of exile (which I have been inflicted with by certain atheists for one abominable impiety) your duty in taking over the function. Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, was most pious and lucky in assisting his brothers in this matter and you too must certainly do the same. I am certainly one of those they call foreign. (But you must be aware with your own candour how foreign a Christian is to a Christian and a minister of the Gospel). And I certainly experience (because I speak from experience) that some, not sufficiently pious and inexperienced in the calamities of the brethren, do not neglect, disdain or despise us. What is their intention, let it be to their own care. Certainly, those whose mind is not sincere enough and incorruptible, aim to provide themselves with a service to any who need it, as many as need it. And they need it particularly (which you know me better), who for the glory of Christ, or rather expelled from their homeland, are now subject to many miseries and fight bravely and strongly for its defence. This I would like to be known from those who report about me. For you can judge the baby better than the mother. Certainly (perhaps I am speaking thoughtlessly) I was in such a place, where, according to the circumstances, I did not oppose impiety, even agreed, did not reproach, shouted at the abomination and did not resist even at the risk of life, even provided opportunities for the destruction of many. So our business was neglected by an evil libido. And certainly I went there in order that, although I should give way, the abomination should not be succeeded, unless worse things happen than now, by a turn of events. And my own departure will cause many to have a reason to stay with piety, I mean my brothers, to whom, as far as I could, I had opposed.</output>

  <output>You are doing very well in your efforts to repair, adorn and defend the Christian faith and true piety, which has been damaged to some degree by the premature death of the most blessed Ulrich Zwingli, Heinrich, and very worthily. May the blessed Lord bless and uphold your endeavors and give them increase. He gives hope to our hearts, for, happily and fortunately, you succeed a man both famous and upright, who is sure to be famous himself. You may see stupid and hardened men carrying trophies, singing paeans, and boasting of triumphs (but, as the proverb has it, they sing before the battle is over). It will easily and soon be proven wrong if you go boldly on and persist in your undertaking, and with that spirit that, as the saying is, conquers all. Do not think it beneath you that many are promising much of you. They are promising that you will outdo the cruelly and harshly oppressive enemies of piety with a pious dexterity, and with a piety no less pure you will relieve and assist, by your support and aid, whatever affliction and distress press upon and torment the pious from all sides. Try to fulfill the wishes of all even better than they expect, and do your utmost so that I, too, may experience from my state of exile (which has been thrust upon me by some godless men on account of an abominable impiety) that you have discharged your duty in gaining this office. Your predecessor, the most holy and most blessed Zwingli, acted with great piety in this matter and thus deserves to be honored with an immortal name by posterity. You must by all means continue and add to his efforts in helping his brethren. I am one of those whom they call foreigners (how far a Christian may be a foreigner to a Christian and a minister of the Gospel, you, with your candor, can easily understand). And this I can see and experience (for I speak from experience), that some who are not sufficiently pious, and so inexperienced in brotherly affliction, are not so neglectful, disdainful and contemptuous of us. How they do this with their minds is their own affair. Certainly those who are less sincere and uncorrupted aim to be of use to as many as need them in the name of Christian candor. And those, of whom you have a better knowledge than anyone else, who fight for the glory of Christ, who have been forced to leave their homeland or are now oppressed by many evils, need such help especially. I would have this known from others who report it about me. For one can judge better of the offspring than the mother. Indeed (I may be speaking imprudently), I was in a place where, according to the circumstances of the time, I did not oppose impiety, but rather consented to it, did not protest, called an abomination what it was, and did not oppose it even at the risk of my life, and so gave many an opportunity for their destruction. So our concern was badly served by a wicked lust. And I have come here, if nothing else, in order that this abomination may not be successful unless there are worse times than now. And my own departure will lead many, for whom I have been able to do something, to stay with piety. The danger of exile was imminent.</output>

  <output>You are doing very well in your best efforts to restore, adorn, and defend the Christian and true piety which has been weakened somewhat by the premature death of the most blessed man, Ulrich Zuingli, Heinrich most sweetly. May the Lord, who gives the increase of all things, foster, increase, and support your happy endeavours! For it gives us great hope that, in the fortunate and auspicious event that you take the place and function of that most famous and candid man who shall also be renowned, you would be no less so. You will see foolish and slow men bearing trophies, singing paeans, and boasting triumphs (but according to the proverb, the praise comes before the victory). The ball thrown in their mouth will be easily and quickly put to rest, if you go intrepidly, and adhere to your intentions with a spirit that, as he says, alone conquers all; and you will not do anything unworthy of yourself, as many promise of you. And they promise that you will overcome with a pious skill the oppressions of piety which too cruelly and sharply come upon and (without impudently boasting) you will also lift with a pious integrity, and help with your support, whatever afflictions of pain come upon the pious from every side, press them, and torment them. Do your best to fulfill the wishes of all, and strive so that I too will experience in my state of exile (which I have received through the present hardships imposed on me by certain atheists for one abominable impiety) your duty in obtaining this function. The most pious and fortunate predecessor of yours, the most blessed Zuingli, has acted in this matter in a most pious and fortunate manner, and should therefore be remembered with an immortal name to posterity. It is necessary to renew his work and industry in helping the brethren. I am certainly one of those they call strangers (but how a Christian can be a stranger to a Christian and a minister of the Gospel, you yourself, with the candor of your soul, know well). And I certainly see and experience (for I am speaking from experience) that not a few, who are not sufficiently pious and therefore inexperienced in the misfortunes of their brethren, neglect, disdain, and despise us less. What is their intention in this, let them take care of it themselves. Certainly those with a less sincere and incorrupt spirit aim to be useful to those who need it, as many as possible, in the name of Christian candour. And they need it especially (which you know better than I do), those who, for the glory of Christ, have left or even been driven out of their country, and who are now exposed to many evils, and are vigorously and bravely fighting for its defence. Which I would like to be known through those who speak of me. For you are better able to judge of the birth than the mother herself. Indeed (I say it perhaps imprudently) I was in such a place, that, according to the time, I did not oppose impiety, even consented to it, did not protest, even called it abominable, and did not resist even at the risk of life, even giving occasion to the destruction of many. So a bad affair was brought upon us by a bad desire. And I certainly came here, so that, although I must yield my place, the abomination will not succeed at all, unless worse things than now happen in the reversal of the circumstances. And my departure alone will make it so that many will have a reason to stay with piety, I mean my brethren, to whom, as far as I was able, I would have opposed. The danger of exile was imminent. For those rascals and wolves, who are devastating the sheepfolds of Christ, there is almost no safe place for us again, unless, I fear, a greater affair is offered to us by those five, as they call them, sacred places (according to the saying, hunger for gold is sacred).</output>

  <output>You are doing very well to strive here to repair, adorn and defend the Christian and true piety that has been somewhat shaken by the premature death of the most blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli, Heinricus, most sweet. May those of your efforts be blessed, increased and supported by the Lord who gives the increase of all things. It gives us great hope when (which may be fortunate and blessed) you succeed to the place and function of a very famous and most honest man before, who himself will be no less famous!. You may see foolish and dull people carrying trophies, singing paeans, and boasting of triumphs (but, as the proverb says, the praise comes before the victory), but their mouths will be easily and quickly shut if you proceed bravely, persist in your undertakings, and with a spirit, as he says, that alone conquers all, do not think it unworthy of yourself. Many promise themselves great things of you. And with pious dexterity they promise that you will overcome cruelly and harshly the molestations that come upon piety, and, that which I hope without impudence, with the same piety you will lift and support, by your help and assistance, whatever misfortunes assail and torment the pious from all sides. Strive to do more than all their wishes, and strive so that I too may experience and feel in my exile state (which through certain atheists I have been afflicted with afflictions due to their abominable impiety) your office in obtaining your function. Your predecessor, most holy and most blessed Zwingli, acted in this matter most piously and happily, and for this he should be honored with immortal fame among posterity. It is necessary that you also strive to increase his efforts in helping the brothers. I am certainly one of those whom they call foreigners (but how much a Christian is a stranger to a Christian and a minister of the gospel, you know for yourself by the candor of your spirit). And I see and experience this certainly (for I speak from experience): some not so pious, and therefore inexperienced in the misfortunes of the brothers, neglect us less, despise us, and scorn us. What their intention is, let them consider. Certainly those with an impure and corrupt spirit aim at this, that for the sake of Christian candor they may be useful to as many as need them. They are most in need, as you know better than I, of those who, for the glory of Christ, have left, or rather been driven out of their country, and now, exposed to many evils, bravely and valiantly fight for its defense. This I wish to be known from others who report of me. For it is better for the midwife to judge the fetus than the mother herself. Indeed (perhaps I speak too rashly) I was in a place where, according to the time, I did not oppose impiety, but even consented to it, did not protest, did not cry out against the abomination, and even offered an opportunity, with danger to my life, to the destruction of many. So our business was sadly neglected by our passions. And I have come here, that although I may be compelled to yield my place, yet the abomination itself may not succeed, unless, by a reversal of circumstances, worse things than now happen. And my departure will make it so that there will be good cause for many to remain with piety, I mean the brothers, whom, as far as I could, I opposed. The danger of exile was imminent. For those raving madmen and wolves, ravaging the flocks of Christ, almost again there is no safe place among us, unless, I fear, a greater business awaits us in those, as they call them, five sacred places (according to the proverb, “sacred hunger for gold”). Wherefore the atheist is exceedingly inflamed against their associates among us, and boils with bitter gall. And certainly I have gone so far that, though I may be compelled to yield my place, yet the abomination itself may not succeed, unless, by a reversal of circumstances, worse things than now happen.</output>

Ab eo, qui has tibi defert literas, queso, si per ocium tibi vacat, diligencius exquirito, utut nobiscum agatur.Ab eo, qui has tibi defert literas, queso, si per ocium tibi vacat, diligencius exquirito, utut nobiscum agatur.Ex cuius responso in illius inscende animum et tanquam concepto themate pia quadam commonicione et ardenti cohortacione tepentem illius forte non nihil mentem in Christi fidem sensim firma, erige roboraque.</input>
  <output>You strive with all your might here to restore, adorn and defend the Christian and true piety that was somewhat shaken by the premature death of the most blessed man Ulrich Zwingli, and you are very rightly and worthily doing this, Heinrich, most sweet one.May the blessed God foster, increase and support these your labours, who gives increase to all things.It gives us great hope when (which may be fortunate and blessed) you succeed to the high function and place of that illustrious and most candid man, who himself shall be of no less fame.You may see foolish and dull men carrying trophies, singing paeans and boasting of triumphs (but according to the proverb, the praise comes before the victory), and it will be easily and quickly known what ball they have in their mouth, if you proceed boldly and persist in your undertakings, and with that spirit which, as he said, alone conquers all things, nor should you think it below you to do what so many promise themselves of you.And they promise that, with a pious dexterity, you will overcome cruelly and very harshly the molestations which are brought upon piety, and (that I may not say it too boldly) with no less piety, you will relieve and assist, with your support and aid, whatever miseries press upon and torment the pious from all sides.Endeavour to exceed all expectations, and labour so that even I myself shall feel, in my present state of exile (which I have been brought to by certain atheists for one most abominable impiety), the benefit of your taking this office.Your predecessor, the most blessed and fortunate Zwingli, behaved most piously and felicitously in this matter, and is therefore to be honoured with an immortal name by posterity.It is necessary that you should avail yourself of his help and industry in assisting your brethren, and I am one of the number whom they call strangers.And (how far a Christian is a stranger to a Christian and a minister of the gospel to his co-minister, you, with your candour of mind, can easily understand).And this I see and experience (for I speak from experience), that certain persons, not sufficiently pious and therefore inexperienced in the calamities of their brethren, do not take sufficient care of us, slight us, despise us.Let them consider in what spirit they do this.But certainly those who have not a sincere and uncorrupted mind, have this intention, that for the candour of a Christian, they may be of use to all who need them.And those who need them principally (which you know better than I do), are those who, for the glory of Christ, have left, nay, been driven from their country, and are now, perhaps, exposed to many evils, both bravely and manfully resisting for the defence of it.Which I wish were known by those who report of me.For you are able to judge of the fruit better than the mother herself.And I was in a place where, according to the state of the times, I did not oppose impiety, but consented to it, did not cry out against abomination, and even exposed my life to danger, affording occasion to the ruin of many.So there was a bad business for our ill-employed lust.And I came here, so that though I be forced to give place, yet the abomination may not follow, unless worse things happen than at present.And my departure will be the cause, that many may have a reason to stay with piety, I mean my brethren, against whose necks, as much as in me lay, I had stood.The danger of exile was near.For those rascally whisperers, and wolves, who lay waste the folds of Christ, there is now scarcely any safe place among us, unless, which I fear, the greater business of those, as they call them, five sacred places (according to that, the love of money is the root of all evil).So that atheist has a wonderful warmth of mind towards their associates among us, and boils with a bitter gall.Let him that looks down upon them from on high, our Lord, laugh at them.Farewell (for the paper will fail my writing).And highly commend me to yourself.Farewell (for the paper will fail my writing).And highly commend me to yourself.And if you can by any means or manner, foster, preserve and keep them.Farewell (for the paper will fail my writing).And highly commend me to yourself.And if you can by any means or manner, foster, preserve and keep them.Save at your house the most valiant Lion, and those pious persons, known to you by their conversation, though not to others by their name.

  <output>From the one who brings you this letter, if you have free time, please inquire diligently to see how he is with us. From his response, please get into his soul and, as if you had grasped the subject, with a pious conversation and an ardent encouragement slowly strengthen his perhaps somewhat lukewarm mind in the faith of Christ, and raise and strengthen it. I think it would bring great benefit if you encouraged him in this way and sincerely for your sincerity. His duty, which is exposed to all, can easily benefit many.

  <output>Greetings and persevere in the knowledge of Christ. You are doing very well, Henry, as you strive to restore, adorn, and defend the Christian faith and true piety which has been somewhat weakened by the premature death of the most blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli. May the Lord, who gives increase to everything, encourage, strengthen, and support your blessed efforts.

They promise that with your skillful right hand you will overcome the cruelly and harshly pressing troubles of piety, and with your pious integrity you will help and support whatever misfortunes assail the pious from every side. Try to do better than the prayers of all, and strive to do so in such a way that I too, in my state of exile (which I have been given by certain atheists because of their monstrous impiety) will experience and feel your duty in obtaining this office.</output>

  <output>You are doing a great service to yourself, Henry, by striving to the utmost to repair, adorn and defend the Christian faith and true piety, which have been somewhat shaken by the premature death of the blessed man Ulrich Zwingli. May the Lord, who gives increase to all, bless your efforts and further them. There is great hope in our hearts, now that (may it be happy and auspicious) you are succeeding a man who was both famous and most upright, and who himself will become famous. You can see foolish and shallow men bearing trophies, singing paeans, and boasting of triumphs (but, as the proverb says, praise before victory); and it will easily and shortly become evident if you go boldly forward and remain steadfast in your undertakings, and with a spirit which, as he [Zwingli] said, alone conquers all, that you are not unworthy of what many promise of you. They promise that, with a certain pious dexterity, you will overcome cruelly and excessively oppressive troubles which beset piety, and (may I not speak too boldly of what I hope) with no less piety, you will lift and help whatever of sorrows and afflictions assail the pious on every side. Strive to do more than is desired by all, and so strive that I too may experience and feel in my exile state (which I have been plunged into by certain atheists for a most abominable impiety) the benefit of your obtaining the office. Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, acted most piously and happily in this matter, and is therefore deserving of immortal fame among posterity. It is necessary that you too should, with your own efforts, increase his aid and industry to his brethren. I am one of those whom they call aliens (and you, with your candour, can easily understand how alien a Christian is to a Christian and a minister of the Gospel to his co-minister). And in this respect I see and experience (for I speak with experience) that certain persons, who are not sufficiently pious and are inexperienced in fraternal calamities, are less inclined to disregard, despise, and neglect us. Let them consider how they do this.</output>

  <output>You are doing very well to strive here to repair, adorn and defend the Christian and true piety which was shaken by the premature death of the blessed man Ulrich Zuingli, Heinrich dearest, and you are doing yourself the greatest credit. May the Lord, who gives the increase to all, bless, increase and support these efforts of yours. It gives great hope to our hearts when (which may be a happy and propitious thing) you succeed a man equally renowned and blameless, and who will be no less renowned himself. You can see fools and blockheads bearing trophies, singing paeans, proclaiming triumphs (but according to the proverb, praise before victory) and if you go on bravely and persist in your undertaking, it will soon be clear to them that you are not unworthy of what many promise themselves from you. They promise that you will be able to overcome with a certain pious dexterity and cruelly and very harshly pressing troubles against piety and (so that I don't say anything indiscreet) that you will be able to lift up with just as much piety, and with help and support, whatever misfortunes press, urge and torment the pious from all sides. Try to do more than all wish, and do it in such a way that I too, in my state of exile (which I have been given by certain godless people because of one abominable impiety) will experience and feel your service in taking up this function. Your predecessor in this matter, the blessed Zuingli, acted most piously and happily, and must be rewarded with immortal fame by posterity for it. It is necessary that you should give new help to his work and industry in helping his brethren. I am certainly one of those whom they call foreigners. (But you, with your honest heart, know well how foreign a Christian is to a Christian and a minister of the gospel to his fellow minister.) And I certainly see and experience (for I speak from experience) that some, who are not sufficiently pious and hence inexperienced in the misfortunes of their brothers, are less inclined to neglect, despise and ignore us. Let it be for them to consider what their feelings are. Certainly, those whose minds are not sufficiently sincere and incorrupt, have this intent, that they may be of use with their Christian candor to as many as need it. But those who need it the most (which you know better than I) are those who, for the glory of Christ, have left, or were driven out of their fatherland, and now, at last, being subject to many troubles, fight bravely and stoutly for its defense.</output>

  <output>You are doing a great service, Henry, by striving with all your might to repair, adorn and defend the Christian faith and true piety, which were somewhat shaken by the untimely death of the blessed man Ulrich Zwingli. May the Lord bless your efforts and increase them. It gives us great hope that you are succeeding such a renowned and fair-minded man in his place and office, and you will surely be as famous as he. You may see some foolish and rude people carrying trophies, singing paeans, and boasting of their triumphs, though, as the proverb goes, praise comes before victory. If you continue bravely and persist in your efforts, it will easily and quickly be seen that you are worthy of what many expect of you. They expect you to overcome cruelly and fiercely the difficulties that come against piety, and with the same piety to relieve and help with your support whatever afflictions and sorrows befall the pious. So strive to fulfill the highest expectations, and so that I too, in my state of exile (which I have been put into by some godless men for their abominable impiety), may experience and feel your office in obtaining this position. Your predecessor, the blessed Zwingli, was most pious and successful in this matter, and so must you be, even more so, in order to be remembered with immortal fame by posterity. It is necessary that you do even more to help your brothers. I am one of those whom they call strangers. (You know from your kindness of heart how far a Christian is a stranger to a Christian and to a minister of the gospel.) And I can see and experience (for I speak from experience) that some not very pious people, and therefore not experienced in the misfortunes of their brothers, do not neglect us, despise us, or scorn us. What their intentions are in this, let them decide. Certainly those with an insincere and corrupt heart are trying to be useful to as many as need them in the name of Christian kindness. Those who, for the glory of Christ, have left or have been driven from their homeland and are now subject to many miseries, probably fight bravely and courageously for its defense. This I wish to be known from those who tell of me.</output>

  <output>You are doing very well in striving with all your might to repair, adorn and defend the Christian and true piety that was somewhat shaken by the premature death of the most blessed man Ulrich Zwingli, Henry, most sweet one. May the Lord bless your efforts, increase and support them, for He gives the increase of all things. For it brings great hope to our hearts, when (which may be blessed and fortunate) you succeed to the position and function of the renowned and most honest man of old, who himself will be no less renowned and celebrated. You may see foolish and ignorant people bearing trophies, singing paeans, boasting of triumphs (but, according to the proverb, praise before victory), who will soon have a pill thrown in their mouths, if you shall courageously continue and persist in your resolve and with a mind that, as he says, conquers all, not consider it beneath you to do that which many promise for themselves. And they promise, with a certain godly dexterity, to overcome the most cruel and bitter afflictions that assault and torture piety, and (to speak without impudence of that which I hope) with no less piety to lift and aid with support whatever afflictions assail the pious from all sides. Try to fulfill the wishes of everyone, and do so that I myself in my state of exile (which I have been given by certain atheists due to an abominable impiety) may experience and sense your assistance in obtaining this function. Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, acted in this matter piously and very happily and shall therefore be remembered by posterity with an immortal name. You too must surely try to help your brothers in this manner. I am certainly one of those who are called aliens (which you know very well, from your sincere heart, how alien a Christian and a minister of the gospel is to another minister). And I clearly see and experience (for I speak from experience) that some not so pious and therefore inexperienced in the calamities of our brothers, do not pay enough attention to us, scorn and despise us. What their spirit is in this matter, let it be for them to consider. Certainly those with a less sincere and uncorrupt spirit direct their efforts to being of use to those who need it, as many as there may be, for the glory of Christ. You know better than I what I need, for having left and even been driven away from my fatherland, I am now at the mercy of many afflictions, and I fight bravely and strongly for its defense. I would like this to be known from those who report of me. For it is said that the midwife judges the fetus better than the mother herself.</output>

  <output>You are doing very well to strive to repair, adorn and defend the Christian faith and true piety that was weakened somewhat by the untimely death of the most blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli, Heinrich, and you are doing very well indeed. May the Lord bless your efforts and make them successful; he gives hope to all of us. We are delighted that you are succeeding such a famous and upright man, and will be no less famous and upright yourself! You may see some foolish and rude people proudly carrying trophies, singing paeans, and boasting of triumphs (but, as the proverb goes, praise before victory), but if you continue bravely and stay the course, it will soon be proven that they spoke too soon. Many people are promising great things of you, and with a pious dexterity you will surely overcome the ruthless and cruelly oppressive attacks against piety, and with a pious integrity you will help and support those who are beset, oppressed and tormented by all sorts of troubles. Do your best to fulfill these expectations, and do so in such a way that I myself, in my present state of exile (which I have been subjected to by certain unbelievers because of their monstrous impiety), shall feel and recognize your office in assuming the position. Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, rightly and happily did this, and should therefore be remembered with an immortal name. It is necessary that you should also work hard to help our brothers. I am one of those whom they call foreigners. (You know very well how foreign a Christian can be to another Christian and to a minister of the Gospel.) And I have noticed and experienced (for I speak from experience) that some of the less pious, and hence less experienced in the calamities of our brothers, are neglecting us, despising us, and even treating us with contempt. What their motives may be, it is for them to consider. Certainly, those who are not entirely sincere and uncorrupted, look to serve their own interests rather than those of the Christian faith, and to be of use to as many as possible who need help. This is especially true (as you know me best) for those who, in their devotion to the glory of Christ, have left or been driven from their native land, and are now exposed to many hardships, yet are valiantly and courageously fighting to defend it. I wish this were known to those who relate tales about me, for as they say, the midwife knows best about the unborn child. Indeed (perhaps foolishly), I was at a place where, due to the circumstances, I did not oppose impiety, but even consented to it, and did not protest against the abomination, instead raising my voice in support of it, and did not resist even at the risk of my life, thereby giving occasion to the destruction of many. May this be known to those who have good will toward me.</output>

You are doing very well in trying your utmost to restore, adorn, and defend the Christian and true piety, which had been weakened somewhat by the untimely death of the blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli, and you are rightly and most deservedly doing so, dearest Heinrich. May the Lord bless your happy efforts and strengthen them. He gives the hope of increase to all. For in taking the place and the function of the famous and highly esteemed man, you will not be less famous and esteemed than he was, and it is my happy and fortunate wish! You will see foolish and boorish men carrying trophies and singing paeans, boasting of triumphs (but, according to the proverb, before victory, praise), and it will soon and easily be shown to be a pill in their mouths, if you persevere bravely, adhere to your plans, and show the spirit which, as he says, conquers all things, and do not do anything unworthy of yourself, as many hope you will. But they hope that you will surpass them with pious skill and harshly and cruelly suppress the troubles which afflict piety, and (may I not speak too boldly of what I hope) with pious integrity you will also lift and help with your advocacy and assistance whatever misfortunes attack and torment the pious from all sides. Strive to do more than all their expectations, and so that I too may experience in my state of exile (which I have been brought to by certain atheists as a result of their abominable impiety) and feel your work in taking up your function. Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, acted most piously and successfully in this matter, and he must be rewarded with an immortal name by posterity. It is necessary that you should renew his efforts and industry in helping the brothers. I am certainly one of those whom they call aliens. (But you, with your candor, know very well how Christian a Christian can be and how alien an Evangelical minister can be to him.) And I certainly see and experience (for I speak of what I have experienced) that some, not sufficiently pious and therefore inexperienced in the misfortunes of the brothers, do not treat us so attentively, disdain us, and despise us. It is for them to consider what spirit they do this in. Certainly, those whose spirit is not sincere enough and uncorrupted aim at being useful to all who need it in the name of Christian candor. They need it especially (which you know better than I), those who, for the glory of Christ, have been forced to leave their fatherland or have been driven from it and are now oppressed by many misfortunes, and who are fighting bravely and resolutely for its defense. I wish this were known from others who speak about me. For, as you know, one can judge the fetus better by the midwife than by the mother herself. Indeed (perhaps I speak too imprudently) I was in a place where, in accordance with the circumstances, I did not oppose impiety, but even consented to it, did not protest it, and even shouted for abomination, and did not resist with the danger of life, and even gave an opportunity for the destruction of many. So our business was neglected by a badly conducted desire. But when I received your letter, I promised myself that I would thank you greatly if I received any advantage. So I am doing here what I promised, although I do not obtain what I can wish, that I should enjoy what your spirit and eyes foster.</output>

  <output>You are most deserving of praise, Henry, for your efforts to restore, adorn and defend the Christian and true piety, which was weakened by the premature death of the blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli. May the Lord bless your noble endeavours and give them increase. This gives us great hope, as you have taken the place and office of that famous and sincere man, and will no doubt become as renowned as he. You can see fools and barbarians carrying trophies, singing paeans, and boasting of triumphs (but as the proverb says, praise comes before victory); but it will easily be proven that their boasts are empty if you continue to boldly pursue your goals and stay true to your mind, which, as the saying goes, conquers all. Let many not be disappointed in their expectations of you; expect them to think that with your piety and skill, you will be able to overcome the stern and harsh attacks on piety, and with your own piety and support, you will be able to relieve and help all of the misfortunes that assail and torment the pious. Try to be worthy of all their wishes, and do so in such a way that I can experience the benefit of your office, even in my state of exile (which I have been given because of the abominable impiety of some atheists). Your predecessor, the blessed Zwingli, did very piously and happily in helping his brothers, and it is necessary for you to do the same. I am one of those whom they call aliens (but you know very well how a Christian can be an alien to another Christian and a minister of the gospel). I also see and experience (for I speak from experience) that some not very pious people do not pay enough attention to us and show us enough respect and kindness. What is in their hearts is their own concern. Certainly, those with a less sincere and uncorrupted mind are aiming to be useful to all those who are in need of help in the name of Christianity. They are most in need of help (which you know better than I), those who, in the name of the glory of Christ, have left their homeland, or have been driven out of it, and now are subjected to many misfortunes, and bravely and strongly fight for its defense. This I wish to be known to those who report on me. For as the midwife knows better about the baby than the mother, so too you know better about me. Indeed, I was in a place where, according to the circumstances of the time, I did not oppose impiety, but even consented to it, did not protest the abomination, and even gave an opportunity for the destruction of many by not resisting it or even risking my life. So our business was greatly harmed by the evil desires. And I have come here so that the abomination will not happen, unless things change and worse happens than now.</output>

  <output>You are doing very well indeed to strive so hard to restore, adorn and vindicate the Christian and true piety that was somewhat shaken by the premature death of the most blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli, Heinrich most sweetly. May those happy efforts of yours be cherished, increased and aided by the Lord who gives the increase of all things. For it gives great hope to our hearts that (which may be happy and fortunate) you succeed to the place and the function of that most famous and candid man of old, you yourself being no less famous and candid. You may see stupid and rough men carrying trophies, singing paeans and boasting of triumphs (but according to the proverb, praise before victory), which will easily and shortly be put in their mouths, if you proceed bravely and persevere in your endeavours, and with that spirit which, as he says, alone conquers all things, and you commit that to yourself, which many promise you. And they promise that, with a pious dexterity, you will overcome cruelly and excessively oppressive molestations to piety, and (that which I hope is not too bold) with a pious integrity, relieve and assist with your patronage and aid, whatever of afflictions press, distress and torture the pious from every side. Strive to do more than all wish, and so attempt it, that I also in my state of exile (which through certain atheists for one execrable impiety has brought me present miseries) may experience and feel your duty in obtaining the function. Your most pious and happy predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, most certainly deserves an immortal name for this among posterity. It is necessary that you should add your work to his in helping the brothers. I am indeed one of the number whom they call strangers (but how a Christian can be a stranger to a Christian and a minister of the gospel, you know very well from the candour of your mind). And this indeed I perceive and experience (for I speak from experience) that not a few, not sufficiently pious and therefore inexpert in the calamities of the brothers, care less for us, despise and contemn us. What spirit they do it in, let it be their care. Certainly those of an impurer and uncorrupt spirit tend to this, that they may be useful to as many as have need of them, for the sake of Christian candour. Now they have need principally (which you know better of me) of those who, for the glory of Christ, left and indeed, by force, their country, and now at last, having fallen into many misfortunes, fight bravely and strongly for the defence of it. Which I wish to be known from the reports of others. For you can better judge of the birth than the mother herself. Indeed (perhaps I speak too imprudently) I was in a place where, according to the time, I did not oppose impiety, but even consented to it, did not cry out against the abomination and even endangered my life, by not opposing, and gave occasion to the destruction of many. So much did a wicked desire control us. And this I certainly came to, that although I must yield my place, yet the abomination itself may not succeed, unless more grievous things than now happen upon the change of affairs. And my departure itself will be the cause, that many have a cause to stay with piety, I mean the brethren, to whom, so far as I was able, I opposed my neck.</output>

  <output>You are doing very well to strive earnestly here to repair, adorn and defend the Christian and true piety which had been shaken somewhat by the untimely death of the most blessed man Ulrich Zwingli, Heinrich most sweetly. May those of your efforts be blessed, increased and supported by the Lord who gives the increase of all. For it gives us great hope, that (which may be happy and fortunate!) you are succeeding such a renowned and candid man in his place and functions, who will be no less celebrated himself. You may see foolish and blind men bearing trophies, singing paeans, boasting of triumphs (but according to the proverb praise comes before victory); it will be easily and quickly known what is being cast into their mouths, if you proceed boldly, cling to your undertakings and with the spirit which, as he said, alone conquers all, do not put yourself to such an unworthy task as many promise you of yourself. And they promise, that by a certain pious dexterity you will overcome cruelly and excessively pressing attacks on piety, and (may I not too boldly speak of it!) by no less piety you will alleviate and support by your aid and help, whatever misery and suffering besets the pious from every side. Strive to do more than all prayers, and do so that I too may experience from my condition of exile (which I was put into by some atheists on account of a most abominable impiety) and feel your duty in obtaining this function. Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, acted most piously and happily in this, and is therefore to be rewarded with an immortal name among posterity. It is necessary that you should renew his work and industry in helping the brethren. I am indeed one of those whom they call aliens. (But you, with the candor of your mind, know how alien a Christian and a minister of the gospel can be to another.) And I experience this at least (for I speak from experience) that some, not sufficiently pious and therefore inexperienced in the calamities of the brethren, less neglect us, disdain us and despise us. What spirit they do this in, let them take care of. Certainly those with an insincere and corrupt mind, intend this, that they may be of use with their Christian candor to as many as need it. Those of us who, for the glory of Christ, have left, or even been driven out of our country, and now at length are exposed to many evils, have the greatest need of it. Which (as you know me better) I wish were known to others who report of me. For (as the proverb says) it is better for an obstetrician to judge of a fetus than the mother herself. For I was in a place where, according to the circumstances of the time, I had not opposed impiety, yea, even consented to it, not cried out against the abomination, not resisted even to the hazard of my life, and had even given occasion to the destruction of many. So far did our ill-managed appetite prevail with us. And I come here, that though I must give way myself, yet the abomination may not succeed, unless worse things than now befall by a change of circumstance. And my departure will be such, that many shall have cause to stay for piety sake, I mean the brethren, to whom, as far as I was able, I opposed. The danger of exile was at hand.</output>

You are doing a great service by striving with all your might to restore, adorn and uphold the true and Christian piety which was somewhat shaken by the premature death of the most blessed man, Ulrich Zwingli; you are doing yourself a great credit, dearest Henry. May the Lord bless your efforts and make them successful, for he gives the increase to all things. Our hearts are filled with great hope, since (may it be a happy and fortunate thing!) you are succeeding a most celebrated and candid man, who will himself be no less famous. You may see foolish and stupid people carrying trophies, singing paeans and boasting of triumphs (but according to the proverb, praise comes before victory) but it will soon and easily be seen that it is all false if you carry on bravely, keep up your efforts and, as that man said, let him who conquers all conquer your heart. Do not be unworthy of what many people promise of you. They promise that, by a certain pious dexterity, you will surpass the cruelly and harshly oppressive things to piety, and (may I not say it immodestly) with the same piety you will relieve and aid, with your support and help, whatever of miseries assails, presses or torments the pious from all sides. Do your best to give better than is to be expected, and strive in such a way that I too, in my state of exile (which I have been brought to by certain godless men on account of one abominable impiety), may experience and feel your duty in taking up this office. Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, acted in this matter with great piety and success, and for this reason alone he deserves to be remembered forevermore. It is fitting that you also do your best to help your brothers, for I am one of those whom they call aliens. (You know well, from the candor of your mind, how far a Christian can be an alien to another Christian and a minister of the gospel.) And I certainly see and experience (for I speak from experience) that some, not sufficiently pious and thus inexperienced in the misfortunes of brothers, do not take enough care of us, or despise us, or look down upon us. What spirit they do this in, it is their own care. Certainly, those of a less sincere and uncorrupted spirit, aim at this, to be useful to as many as need them, in the guise of a Christian candor. And they need it chiefly (which you know better than I), those who, for the glory of Christ, have left, yes, been driven out of their country, and are now oppressed by many miseries, and are doing their utmost to maintain it. This I wish were known to those who report of me. For you can better judge of an unborn child than the mother herself. Certainly (perhaps I speak too rashly), I was in a place where, according to the nature of the time, I not only did not oppose impiety, but even consented to it, did not protest against the abomination, and even gave an opportunity to the destruction of many with my life, by not opposing it with danger. So the bad business had us in its power. And this is why I came here, that, though I myself must give way, the abomination shall not follow, unless worse things should happen than at present by a change of circumstances. And my departure will make it so that many shall have cause to stay for piety's sake, I mean my brothers, to whom, as far as I was able, I had offered resistance. The danger of exile was pressing. For those rascally courtiers, like wolves, were devastating Christ's folds, and almost no safe place is left among us, unless, as I fear, we give the worst of opportunities to those five places, as they call them, sacred places (according to that saying, the love of money is the root of all evil). If ever those places should be invaded by war, then it will be shamefully taken away from us, and be lost to us in a miserable manner.</output>

  <output>You are doing very well to strive here to restore, adorn and defend the Christian faith and true piety, which were somewhat shaken by the untimely death of the most blessed Ulrich Zwingli, Henry, most amiable. May the Lord favour your happy endeavours, increase and strengthen them; for He gives increase to all things. It gives us great hope to think that you are taking the place of so renowned and excellent a man, and that you will be as celebrated as he was. You will see silly and boorish men, bearing trophies, singing paeans, and boasting of triumphs (but as the proverb has it, there is no praise before the victory); but their boasting will soon be stopped, if you proceed intrepidly, continuing in your designs, and with a mind which, as the saying is, alone conquers all. Do not think it beneath you to do what many expect of you. They expect that you will surpass them in pious diligence, and by your courage and severity remove all the troubles which press heavily and cruelly upon piety; and, which I hope without impropriety, by your integrity and assistance, relieve and support whatever calamities threaten the pious from every quarter. Endeavour to do more than all their wishes; and do it in such a way that I myself, in my state of exile (which I owe to some godless persons who have brought upon me the present miseries through one abominable impiety), may experience and feel your activity in obtaining the office. The most pious and happy Zwingli, your predecessor, deserved to be had in everlasting remembrance among posterity for this very thing, and it is necessary that you should improve and increase his labours in relieving his brethren. I am one of those whom they call foreigners. (How far a Christian and a servant of the Gospel can be a stranger to a fellow-Christian, you, with your candid mind, know full well.) And, in this respect, I see and experience (for I speak from experience) that not a few, who are not sufficiently pious, and so have no sympathy with the misfortunes of their brethren, do not enough take notice of us, contemn and despise us. What their intentions are, let them take care. Certainly those whose minds are not sufficiently sincere and incorrupt, tend this way, that they may be useful to as many as have need, in the place of Christian candour. They have need principally (which you know better than I do), of those who, for the glory of Christ, have left, or rather been driven from their country, and now, exposed to many evils, are courageously and manfully fighting for its defence. This I wish to be known from others that relate it of me. For you can better judge of the infant than the mother. Indeed (I speak too imprudently, perhaps) I was in a place where, according to the circumstances of the time, I did not oppose impiety, but rather consented to it, did not remonstrate against it, but even cried out against it; and, what is worse, did not oppose it, even at the risk of life, but gave occasion to the destruction of many. So great was the power of a wicked inclination. And, in this, I have arrived at this point, that, though I must give place myself, yet the abomination shall not succeed, unless things are changed, and worse events happen than now. And, my departure shall be the cause, that many shall have reason to stay with piety; I mean my brethren, against whom, as much as I could, I have made opposition. The danger of exile was imminent. For those wandering knaves, who, like wolves, devastate the folds of Christ, have now no safe place among us, unless, as I fear, a greater mischief shall befall us from the five, as they call them, holy places (according to that saying, the love of money is the root of all evil). On this account, the atheistical mind is greatly inflamed against their associates among us; and boils with a bitter gall.</output>

  <input>Quod pro virili tuo sumopere huc anniteris, ut labefactatam nonnihil immaturo beatissimi viri Ulrichi Zuinglii [obitu] christianam eamque veram pietatem repares, adornes et vindices, bene teque dignissime facis, Heinrice suavissime. Foelices istos tuos conatus foveat, augeat, secundet, qui incrementa dat omnium dominus. Addit enim spes ingentes animis nostris, quum (quod foelix faustumque sit) in locum et in functionem succedis viri celeberrimi pariter et candidissimi pridem, non minus ipse futurus et ipse celebris[!]. Stupidos ac bardos homines videas trophea ferentes , paeana canentes, triumphos (sed iuxta proverbium[?] ante victoriam encomium ) iactantes, quibus iniectam in os pilam facile brevique constabit, si intrepide pergas, coeptis inhereas animoque, qui, ut inquit ille, solus omnia vincit , neutiquam te indigno id prestiteris, quod pollicentur sibi de te plurimi. Pollicentur autem et pia quadam dexteritate te superaturum et crudeliter et acerbe nimis ingruentes pietati molestias et (ne quid, quod spero, impudencius celem) non minus pia integritate levaturum et suffragio et ope, quicquid undequaque aerumnarum pios impetit, urget, cruciat. Tu omnium votis pociora prestare conare, et ita conabere, ut ego quoque ipse exilii mei statu (quem per atheos quosdam ob unam missae abhominandissimam impietatem presentes mihi peperere aerumnae) experiar et senciam tuum in adipiscenda functione officium. Egit hac in re pientissime pariter et foelicissime antecessor tuus beatissimus Zuinglius vel ob hoc ipsum apud posteros immortali nomine donandus. Cuius in iuvandis fratribus operam et industriam ut noves data eciam opera, oportet omnino. Sum ego quidem ex eorum numero, quos alienigenas vocant. (Quam autem sit christianus christiano et evangelii ministro alienus cominister, ipse pro animi tui candore facile nosti.) Et hoc certe nomine video et experior (expertus enim loquor) non nullos non satis pios adeoque fraternarum calamitatum inexpertos eoque compacientes minus nos negligere, fastidire, contemnere. Quod quo animo faciant, ipsis curae fuerit. Certe, quibus animus parum sincerior incorrupciorque, huc intendunt, ut pro christiano candore usui sint, quotquot opus habent. Habent autem opus potissimum (quod me melius nosti), qui pro Christi gloria relicta, imo pulsi patria aliquando nunc demum malis obnoxii plurimis fortassis et gnaviter et fortiter pro eadem fulcienda depugnant. Id quod aliis de me referentibus velim compertum foret. Nosti enim illud de foetu rectius iudicare obstetricem quam matrem ipsam . Plane (imprudencius forte refero) eo agebam loco, ubi pro ratione temporis impietati non obstetisse, consensisse etiam, non reclamasse, abhominacioni inclamasse et vitae eciam periculo non repugnasse ansas etiam praebuisse multorum perdicioni. Adeo nobis facessebat negocium male negociosa libido. Et huc certe profeci, ut quamquam ipse loco cedere cogar, ipsa tamen abhominatio successura sit minime, nisi inversis denuo rerum vicibus peiora quam nunc eveniant. Et ipse meus discessus efficiet, ut multis cum pietate sit causa manendi, fratribus dico, quorum cervicibus, in quantum valui, obstetissem. Imminebat exilii discrimen. Missicantibus enim illis nebulonibus et luporum more Christi caulas devastantibus pene iam denuo apud nos nullus est locus tutus, nisi, quod vereor, maius nobis facessere negocium quinque illa, ut vocant, loca sacra (iuxta illud auri sacra fames ). Quibus ob id cum suis apud nos συνεργοῖς mire incandescit animus atheus, et coquit illos bilis amara. Irrideat illos desuper conspector , dominus noster illi [!] .

 Tu vale (deficiet enim charta scribentem) meque intime commendatum habe. Tu vale (deficiet enim charta scribentem) meque intime commendatum habe. Et si quo poteris modo et ratione, fove, tuere, serva. Tu vale (deficiet enim charta scribentem) meque intime commendatum habe. Et si quo poteris modo et ratione, fove, tuere, serva. Salvos iubeto apud te et leonum fortissimum Leonem et pios quosque conversacione ignotos, Christi nomine notissimos.

 Ex Liechtenstaig, idibus februarii anno etc. 32.

Ab eo , qui has tibi defert literas, queso, si per ocium tibi vacat, diligencius exquirito, utut nobiscum agatur.

  <output>You make a very worthy effort to repair, adorn and defend the slightly weakened Christian and true piety that was left behind after the premature death of the most blessed man Ulrich Zwingli, Heinrich, most pleasantly. May the Lord bless your happy attempts, increase them and support them, who gives the increase of everyone. It gives us great hope when (which may be happy and fortunate) you take the place and the function of the most renowned and candid man, who will himself be celebrated. You may see foolish and dull people carrying trophies, singing paeans, proclaiming triumphs (but according to the proverb, praise before victory), which will easily and soon be proved wrong, if you continue intrepidly, persist in your undertakings and with the mind which, as he said, alone conquers everything, you do not deserve to do what many promise themselves from you. And they promise, with a certain pious dexterity, that you will overcome cruelly and harshly the molestations that threaten piety, and (so that nothing that I hope should be spoken impudently) with the same piety you will reduce and support with your help and aid whatever distress besieges, oppresses and torments the pious from all sides. Try to do more than all wishes, and do it so that I too, in my condition of exile (which I have suffered due to the atheistic men who, for one abominable impiety, have made me present sufferings) will feel and understand your office in taking up the function. Your predecessor, the most blessed Zwingli, acted most piously and happily in this matter and, for this very reason, must be awarded an immortal name among posterity. It is necessary that you also renew his efforts to help his brothers. I am indeed one of those whom they call strangers. (But how a Christian can be a stranger to a Christian and a minister of the gospel to a fellow minister, you know yourself, with the candor of your mind.) And this I certainly see and experience (for I am speaking from experience) that some not very pious and therefore inexperienced in fraternal calamities, less neglect, despise and scorn us. It is for them to consider how they do this. Certainly those whose mind is not very sincere and uncorrupted, aim to be useful to all those who need it, as far as Christian candor is concerned. They need it especially (which you know better than me), those who, for the glory of Christ, have left, rather have been driven out of their homeland and now, at last, oppressed by many misfortunes, are fighting bravely and bravely for its defense. It would be good if this were reported to others about me. For you know better than the mother herself to judge the fetus correctly. Indeed (perhaps foolishly I report) I was in a place where, according to the circumstances, I had not opposed impiety, had even consented, had not protested, had shouted against abomination and, at the risk of life, had not resisted, had even given occasion to the destruction of many. So bad business was in full swing with us. And I came here certainly to prevent, if I could, the abomination from happening, at least if the vicissitudes of things are reversed, that worse things do not happen than now. And my departure itself will cause many to have a reason to stay with piety, I mean the brothers, whose necks I would have opposed, if I could. The danger of exile was imminent. For those busybodies who, like wolves, devastate the flocks of Christ, there is almost no safe place among us, unless, I fear, a greater business is done with us, those five, as they call them, holy places (according to the proverb, the hunger for sacred gold). For this reason, the mind of the atheist is inflamed among us with his colleagues and boils with a bitter bile. May our Lord laugh at them from above. Be healthy (for the paper will fail the one who writes) and keep me deeply recommended. And if you can in any way and way, cherish, protect and preserve. Be healthy (for the paper will fail the one who writes) and keep me deeply recommended. And if you can in any way and way, cherish, protect and preserve. Save with you and the most valiant lion the lion and the pious, known by the name of Christ, unknown by conversation.

From the one who brings these letters to you, I ask that, if you have free time, you inquire diligently how things are with us. From the one who brings these letters to you, I ask that, if you have free time, you inquire diligently how things are with us. From his response, enter his mind and, as if it were a pre-conceived topic, with a pious exhortation and an ardent encouragement, warm his mind perhaps not a little, and firmly, raise it up and strengthen it in the faith of Christ.</output>

  <output>I ask you to please carefully inquire of the one who delivers these letters to you, if you have any free time, to see how he is doing with us. From his response, penetrate into his mind and, as if from a preconceived theme, with a kind communication and a passionate encouragement, gradually strengthen his perhaps somewhat lukewarm mind in the faith of Christ, raising it and giving it strength. For, I presume, it will be of great value if you thus stimulate him, and do so sincerely out of your sincerity. His duty, being exposed to almost everyone, will be able to be of great help to many.</output>
