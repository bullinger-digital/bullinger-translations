      <p>Greetings. Dear brother Heinrich. Hans Hugi from Solothurn has written to me, asking me to assist, as much as possible, in having Paulus Rasdorfer, along with the bearer of this letter, travel to Dorneck to the castle; he has several parishes in his bailiwick that are still not provided for, and if it pleases Paulus, they desire to appoint him in one of their parishes. The people of Solothurn have over 35 parishes, but there are not more than 12 where mass is still held, and they need a pastor for each one. He also wrote to me that the bailiff of Dorneck will cover his expenses. I did not want to keep this from you. In our area, it is still not possible to appoint him, as we still have more city and country children, but if he could find an entry to remain in the Solothurn area, I would be very pleased, hoping that if the other brothers had a pastor, God's work would be greatly advanced. With this, I ask you for God's sake, write to me, and by certain message, how things stand in all matters.</p>
      <p>Given on the 23rd of January.</p>
      <p>Yours, Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>He may travel down alone and inspect all things. I would not like to send him away. If he goes in vain, I will complain to the people of Solothurn.</p>
      <p>To the faithful Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
