    <p xml:id="regest1">Does not need to write much, as [Hans] Vogler [the Younger] will report orally; calls for prayer. Bucer writes that Emperor [Charles V] has arrived in Speyer; in Luxembourg, thousands have perished; Pope [Paul III] is trying to persuade the bishops of Augsburg [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg], Eichstätt [Moritz von Hutten], and Trient [Cristoforo Madruzzo] to betray Germany by granting them the cardinal's hat; there is much agitation against the [Arch]bishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied], while the bishop of Strasbourg [Erasmus Schenk von Limpurg] is a worldly-minded procrastinator. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Regarding both our state and that of the church, it would not be worth the effort to write more on paper, since Vogler will teach everything in person, most excellent and learned Bullinger; only pray to the Lord with your colleagues, that He may advance and complete the work begun, and that it may not be overthrown by the cunning of Satan.</p>
      <p>Horrible rumors are heard everywhere, bloody massacres, murders, and a flood of all evils is approaching. Bucer writes that the Emperor arrived in Speyer on the 10th of this month by post with only three horsemen. In Luxembourg, many thousands of people, old and young, have perished from hunger and cold during these winter months.</p>
      <p>The Pope wishes to create the Bishop of Augsburg, the Bishop of Eichstätt, and the Bishop of Trient as traitors to Germany by offering them the cardinal's hat. The Archbishop of Cologne is beset by many adversities; our neighbor, the Bishop of Strasbourg, seeking his own and devoted to the world, is an excellent procrastinator and spectator.</p>
      <p>Greet your family. We greet you, our Megander, Erasmus, Gwalther, Bibliander, Pellicanus, and all the doctors of your church, as many as are appointed in our field to the word of God.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Riquewihr, on the 14th day of January.</p>
      <p>Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and distinguished in learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his patron and most beloved brother, etc.</p>
