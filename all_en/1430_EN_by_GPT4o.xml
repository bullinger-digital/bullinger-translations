      <p>Blessed be the Lord God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, in His immense mercy, has deigned to send His only begotten Son into the world, so that all who would believe in Him might be delivered from the power of Satan and obtain eternal life. And who, by His grace, in these last times, has called not only the Germans but also the Hungarians, Greeks, and other nations, among whom the eternal Gospel of God had little or no place, to His banquet, by sending the seed of His word into the lands, etc.</p>
      <p>I received, reverend brother, in recent days, a complete bundle of your letters, which contained all those things you sent to me. Although I cannot repay you with equal gratitude, nor do I see how I can return your goodwill towards me with any kind of gratitude, I nonetheless give great thanks, as much as I can, that you, in your singular piety, have deigned to respond to my rude and uncultivated letters in a Christian and very humane manner, and to send a public writing to strengthen the spirits of the ministers of God's word and other Christians dispersed in Hungary, Thrace, Bulgaria, and Turkey in sound and true evangelical doctrine. May God grant you, for such a benefit, bodily and spiritual goods in abundance; indeed, all pious people, whoever will read or have already read your writings, give and will give great thanks.</p>
      <p>I have shaken off all doubt about dwelling among the papists, which has so far greatly tormented my mind, through your writings, and henceforth I will dwell among them in such a way, as long as I cannot avoid them altogether or God has otherwise decided about us, that I do not partake in their ceremonies, just as I have not partaken until now, but have abhorred them and contradicted them as vain in the highest place of papistic religion.</p>
      <p>Regarding not adoring the bread in the papistic mass, I am sufficiently confirmed from the fifth Decade of your sermons; for I had long ago acquired the first four Decades. I wish to understand from you whether you will add more to them; for many are raised in the hope that you will add something to them and provide an index.</p>
      <p>As for the matter of wives abducted by the Turks, I would have wished from the heart if you had written some certain advice; but since you left it unexplained for grave reasons, I must in the meantime have patience until you write something more certain to me in that case. Since you wish to know from me who I am and where I am, I will tell you frankly that I am the secretary of the Hungarian Chancellery in the court of the most serene prince Lord Ferdinand, King of the Romans, Hungary, and Bohemia, etc., with the chancellor of the Kingdom of Hungary, bishop of the church of Eger, who, as much as was permitted by God's grace, I have embraced the gospel of the kingdom of God from my youth, having already several times made a confession of the Christian faith before the president.</p>
      <p>There are with me good, upright, and sincere men who agree with me in the gospel and entirely abhor papism, who with me desire to change courtly life.</p>
      <p>I rejoice that your affairs are peaceful by God's benefit; although ours are now quite troubled, we nonetheless hope that God will also change the state of our country for the better.</p>
      <p>I have understood from both your letters and the letters and speech of many others that Italy is boiling with war, and many proclaim the Roman pontiff as the author of its flames, who preferred to hold a council in blood and dust rather than in a time of peace; in which I wish to understand from you what the holy fathers are doing.</p>
      <p>Here, or rather in Hungary, what is happening, receive in a few words; for I am so affected both in body and mind that I cannot write to you in more words. The Turk had begun to attempt many things in the previous months; but after some of their troops were routed and cut down by Hungarian soldiers, they keep themselves within their borders, except that the highest prefect of the Turkish emperor, called Beglerbeg, having gathered forces to the number, as they say, of sixty thousand Turks, having crossed the Danube at Taurus, which he is said to have bridged, is said to want to advance towards Transylvania, perhaps to avenge the injury done to his prince by the army of the royal majesty of the province of Transylvania; for his majesty has taken the whole of it into his hands and power. Against him, the army of his majesty is setting out to meet him and is said to be a day's journey away. We are expecting the uncertain outcome of Mars at any moment; but God must be prayed to, that reconciled, He may be propitious to us; for if we win now, we will reign, if not, it will be over for the state of Hungary. Whatever will be, I will write to you in my next letters, God willing.</p>
      <p>The Gospel, as I wrote in my previous letters, is preached everywhere throughout Hungary, not without, however, the contradiction of the bishops and papistic priests. But in Turkey, it is announced more freely. There are pious and learned men in Transylvania, skilled in languages, who have sent catechisms printed in their language to the Greeks, Thracians, and Lithuanians.</p>
      <p>Many report that in Turkey, Turks mixed with Christians attend sacred sermons, which was unheard of in previous centuries. From this, I easily conjecture that the Turks, unless they are timely destroyed, will soon accept the Christian faith. The matter is not without admiration, that whenever there is a dispute between Christian pastors and papistic priests before the judges and prefects of the Turks, the sentence is always given in favor of the Gospel of God, which you will understand in part from the enclosed letters of one of the pastors. Here Michael Ztianius is a preacher of God's word in a certain town called Lasko in the county of Baranya, which the Turk has possessed for fifteen years.</p>
      <p>Regarding ministers of the word skilled in the Illyrian language, I cannot write anything certain to you now; for I have not yet spoken with those barons in whose domain they would know how to preach; but after I have dealt with them, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>I have sent you with these letters some coins and a piece of native gold from Transylvania, as a token of my highest love and duty towards you, in which there is a larger gold and a smaller silver Turkish coin, so that you may know what coins they use. The rest, as they truly are, I think are common with you. You, with your candor and my love for you, receive with a serene countenance. Greet in my name all the holy ministers and professors of God's word of the Zürich church, especially those whose names you greeted me with in your letters. Those who are with me, brothers in the Christian religion and my co-workers in this public office, greet you, namely Matthias of Tolna, Sebastian Ferekis, Emericus Paludii, Johannes Lysch, Transylvanian, Felix Stainpergerus. The grace and favor of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. Vienna, Austria, October 10, 1551.</p>
      <p>If the occasion permits, greet in my name the most illustrious man, my very dear friend Wolfgang Musculus of Dusan, preacher of God's word of the Bernese church in Switzerland; shortly, if it pleases God, I will also write to him.</p>
      <p>Johannes Feyerthoy, Hungarian, by my own hand. To the reverend, outstanding in religion, piety, and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church in Switzerland, etc., his most esteemed lord and friend in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
