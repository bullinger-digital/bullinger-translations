      <p>Greetings. I have returned safely to my people by the grace of the Lord. Here I found Mr. Vergerius, who, desiring very much to be in Lausanne, was received by our senate yesterday for a period of three months and is departing for Lausanne today. He will receive 4 crowns each month until further provisions are made for him. He has compiled into one bundle the main points that command us to reject the Council of Trent; he will print it, I believe, in Basel. Here, all sensible people will see the just reasons for our protest against the council. Otherwise, there is nothing new to write, except that Jodocus Vergerius has never deemed it worthy to speak and, having been called five times to the assembly of brothers to discuss Vergerius, he never wanted to come, always offering other excuses. Nor did he appear when I invited Vergerius and called him together with the other brothers; but today he criticized him publicly from the pulpit, not moderately nor lightly.</p>
      <p>This man is a great burden to our church. May the Lord look upon him and grant him a more Christian spirit! I fear that we will soon hear strange things about Eberhard; Satan attacks us from all sides. Mr. Treasurer is gravely ill with gout.</p>
      <p>Mr. Musculus and all of mine send their greetings to you. Farewell. Bern, August 8, 1551.</p>
      <p>I am returning Osiander's propositions, which I had taken with me from there. Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
