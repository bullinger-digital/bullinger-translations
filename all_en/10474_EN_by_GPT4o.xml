    <p xml:id="regest1">Bern mediates between the Duke of Savoy and Geneva, although a few in the council indeed advocate for war. Haller still knows nothing about the negotiations concerning Solothurn. Ambrosius Blarer's confession, the WÃ¼rttemberg Concord on the Lord's Supper, allegedly caused joy among the Papists. Haller was admonished by Erasmus Ritter regarding this matter to uphold the endangered truth together. Haller replied to him that he was not aware of any danger from Blarer's "Confession" if it was only interpreted correctly; he also pointed to Bullinger's commentary on 1 Corinthians 11. When will Bullinger's commentary on the 2 Corinthians be published? Haller wants to have the two volumes bound together. The Zurich delegates to the Diet were reportedly very steadfast.</p>

      <p>The situation in Geneva is such that our council is fully committed to mediating between the Duke and this city. Very few desire war, although there are some among the more sensible ones. I do not know who is influencing them in this way. Regarding the matter of Solothurn, I hope to hear from you at some point about what was decided at this assembly, as I know nothing about it. Concerning Blaurer's confession, I hear that the Papists are triumphing throughout all of Switzerland and are boasting that his recantation was made with this confession. Furthermore, Erasmus from Schaffhausen wrote to me, and unless I am mistaken, I suspect that I have also offended him, as he advises me that we, who teach Christ with one voice in Switzerland, should come together in this imminent ruin of truth to support it, lest the truth be endangered more and more. I replied to him that I see no danger yet, as long as we interpret both the deed and Blaurer's confession piously. I referred him to what you published on 1 Corinthians 11.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you did not respond to the other matters because you were occupied with other things. I would like to bind your annotations on both epistles to the Corinthians together; if you plan to publish them by the next Easter, I ask you to let me know. You will not escape my memory as long as I live.</p>
      <p>I hear that your delegates have steadfastly fulfilled their duties.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest Heinrich, and use my commendation as you wish.</p>
      <p>14th of September, year 34.</p>
      <p>Your B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
