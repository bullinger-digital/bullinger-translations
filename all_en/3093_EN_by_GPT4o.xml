      <p> Greetings. Your letters, dearest Father Bullinger, full of Christian piety and charity, have greatly consoled me, for which I am very grateful to you. Although they have indeed brought much consolation, I still need you to commend me to God, the author of all true consolation, in your prayers. There are indeed many things that console my mind and spirit, such as the fact that the soul of my wife, always holy and now blessed, has been taken from this wicked world and age; that she bore such a severe and prolonged illness with such fortitude of mind, as can scarcely be found in heroic men and certain Christians, and finally overcame death itself, which she often mocked and scorned; that with admirable and firm trust in Christ and certainty of her salvation through Christ, she undoubtedly ascended to heaven; that she now enjoys, most joyfully and happily, the true spouse she long desired and invoked, Jesus Christ. All these things, indeed, I congratulated her on greatly, even shortly before she passed away, and I daily congratulate her from the heart and almost envy her with a certain holy emulation. These things, I confess, console me greatly; yet her most dear and sweet constant companionship, presence, appearance, modesty, gravity, gentleness, honesty, and above all, piety, were so dear to me that, seeing myself now deprived of such a great wife, sister, and daughter, I cannot help but my flesh still grieves, mourns, and weeps. For she always appears before my eyes, and she whom I loved so intensely cannot so quickly fade from my memory. I see and feel that I still carry too much of the flesh; for if I had more of the spirit than of the flesh, I would perceive more spiritual joy from her ascent to Christ than sorrow from her departure from us, and I would be more affected by joy that she now enjoys eternal and blessed life with Christ and his angels and thousands of blessed souls than by the sorrow that I can no longer enjoy her company in this mortal and miserable life. But I am carnal, sold under sin. Therefore, I ask you again and again to commend me to God the Father through Christ in your prayers; for you see how greatly I need His Spirit. </p>
      <p> What you wrote about our dear Dr. Peter, I read most gladly and pray to God that He may preserve him safe for a long time, not only for you but for the whole Church of Christ. </p>
      <p> The news about the world and especially about the Pope, that his affairs are proceeding so unfortunately for the dignity of his beatitude and that he is being treated so excellently by the Spaniard, was not unwelcome. May God soon destroy that beast. </p>
      <p> I greeted Dr. Alexander in your name, a truly pious and learned man, who has been gravely ill for a long time and has not yet escaped all danger. He in turn sends you his most affectionate greetings; Sturmius does the same. </p>
      <p> Farewell, and please convey my greetings to your most holy wife and your entire family and all your most esteemed relatives in my name. </p>
      <p> Strasbourg, January 8, 1557. </p>
      <p> Yours sincerely, Hieronymus Zanchus. </p>
      <p> [before 756:] To the illustrious Dr. H. Bullinger, renowned for his learning and piety, pastor and most esteemed father of the Church of Zürich. Zürich. </p>
