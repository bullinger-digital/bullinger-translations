      <p>S. I received your last letter, most reverend lord, and presented your apology to the most honorable consul, who certainly, like me, is not surprised that you, burdened and afflicted in many ways, do not refrain from the duty of writing. However, I am compelled to wound your ears, indeed your mind, with our senate's decision against Ganthner, which, once known, was somewhat cheered. He was indeed seriously dismissed, as the example of the decree from the hand of the consul, which was first composed in favor of the scribe, can abundantly testify, having been transcribed and sent to Ganthner by the public officer. However, not without reason, Ganthner's supporters wanted to suspend another election until the return of the consuls; in the meantime, they concocted the most cunning plans with evil arts and incited Ganthner, who was already running of his own accord, to complain to the senate and citizens, that is, the most numerous magistracy consisting of 70 men, about the entire outcome of the matter and the whole cause, hoping that with this last effort he would achieve the highest goals. Therefore, on November 3rd, when the consuls had already returned from the assembly, Ganthner, contrary to the custom of the country, entered the great senate, well-armed, as he thought, with paper weapons. He complained a lot about the injustice done to him and about his sermons being twisted into a wrong sense by malevolent people out of hatred and envy: that he had never felt that way nor does he feel that way today, as some interpret maliciously; that everything he said and did was turned and perverted against him out of hatred and malignant zeal. At the same time (the proverb comes to mind: A bad plan is the worst for the planner), while he was trying to clear himself and began to contradict himself, he pulled out a very long paper from his pocket, on which he had recklessly poured out with tragic clamor the opinions of a thousand different fathers about not punishing heretics. He brought up Augustine, Jerome, Tertullian, and especially the juggler Brentius, who mixed heaven with hell for people and obscured it; he praised him with such marvelous eulogies up to the stars that he left all the most learned and sober men of our time far behind in hateful criticism. He recited almost all of Brentius's weak arguments, which he deals with in a certain booklet, in which he discusses the question of whether the magistrate can rightfully kill Anabaptists, and with a strange clamor and insane wailing, he repeated the passage about not uprooting the tares to the point of everyone's weariness: Hear the clear and express word of the Lord: "Do not uproot, do not pull out," etc. Hear, I say, etc. etc.</p>
      <p>Having finished these, he again offered his service, which had been denied so many times, and repeatedly insisted that he was a citizen, as if a foreigner's favor (which no one seeks) should not be eliminated or removed, even if he errs and leads others astray; for at least the space of one hour he wore himself out shouting. He did not wait for the sentence to be given outside, so arrogantly does he think of himself, but quickly, with a stomach that he had nevertheless greatly cooled, he went home or to his father-in-law's house, hoping that by bending everyone's minds with his untimely loquacity, he had compelled them not only to restore him but also to be drawn by prayers or a cloak. But what? Since he does not fear to stir up trouble and with the most brazen face tried to shame the lesser senate, namely the conscript fathers, because they had decreed such a sentence in writing, by which he was prohibited from the duty of preaching at home and abroad, finally the most honorable consul, whom Ganthner suspects most of the damage inflicted on him, found and advised such a remedy, that I should be ordered to summon six or seven brothers, whom I considered most suitable for this business, from the Three Leagues at the expense of the magistrates, whose work and advice would carefully examine that question and elicit the truth, and Ganthner, defeated by the truth, would yield and abandon his error. The greater and far larger part of the senate was in favor of this plan and opinion; however, several and three distinguished men, yet Epicureans, rejected this remedy and wanted Ganthner to be restored to office, disregarding all else; they certainly were not ashamed to condemn themselves by the example of a lie and lack of seriousness, who seriously wanted him, who had been dismissed before, to be received so impunely. They want the Anabaptists expelled; meanwhile, they strive with the greatest zeal to retain their supporters and patrons. They contend for this because Ganthner's opinion that no one should be forced to faith beautifully pleases and delights the Epicureans and atheists, which I certainly openly objected to from the pulpit on the occasion of some Julian contexts. In the evening of the day when the decision was made by vote, that some brothers should be called together to judge by the sacred scriptures whether anyone should be urged or punished for reasons of faith and whether our Frellus should be recalled and tolerated with impunity or not, Ganthner himself went to the consul W[illium] and demanded the rest of his salary and, as if he had come for the sake of this cause alone, arrogantly carried himself. Then the consul opened to him the greater opinion of the senate and citizens, and urged him with prayers to adopt a better mind, to return to fruitfulness, not to so rashly disturb the accepted confession; such obstinacy leads to civil unrest and disturbances, than which there is nothing more miserable or pernicious in the world. Ganthner - I do not know how well he trusts his Brentius - immediately responded to the known decree of the lords: 'I do not wish for a synod to be convened for me, nor should matters of faith be overcome and conquered by the multitude of human votes.</p>
      <p>Everyone attaches a peculiar sense of some place to themselves; if many others also hold it, they will immediately defeat me with their multitude, not with the testimony of truth. And who would be the judge of the dispute? [] As if, [replied the consul,] we were deprived of the judge of the word of God! [He retorted:] However, if the task of calling the brothers is given to Tobias, he will call those who please him in every way,' etc. He dealt with him at length, but in vain; for he refuses to submit to the synod, fearing that the last things may become worse. He again asserted that he had done nothing wrong in the Zurich confession, where the consul said: 'What you, my Ganthner, say, I ask you to think more deeply. Do you not know that Anabaptists, according to that confession, are not to be supported, not to be defended?' The arrogant man replied: 'I am not surprised that the Zurichers inserted their hatred of the Anabaptists into this confession; for from the beginning of the Reformation, they even punished and deprived innocent Anabaptists of life. Therefore, since they had previously exercised such severity against them, they could not now refrain from persecuting them out of shame, but in the confession, they also proposed that such good men should be persecuted by others, lest the Zurichers themselves seem to have acted beyond duty from the beginning. Behold, with what slanders that man oppresses the Zurichers and what spirit he has. While he celebrates the Brentians and Tertullians, that is, those defecting to heretics, so much, who oppose the accepted confession in every way, he only curses the Zurichers, to whose confession Ganthner himself, as the free and synodal book testifies, once subscribed with his own hand. The consul replied: not only the Zurichers, but also the Bernese and many other leaders do not tolerate Anabaptist errors; indeed, in the recently held assembly at Davos by the Three Leagues, that decree about uprooting and expelling sectarians was renewed and confirmed.</p>
      <p>He replied: he cannot with a clear conscience accept this doctrine; therefore, he rightly taught: no one should be forced to faith;</p>
      <p>Frellus should be recalled and tolerated with impunity, having done nothing worthy of exile; much worse are tolerated within the walls, etc. After this, he left the consul. When he had left, the consul immediately (as I was ignorant of all things) called me to him through a maid, and what had been done and with what arts and forces they wanted to restore the wolf. I was certainly amazed that Ganthner had dared to mock the most honorable senate so impunely and condemn the unjust sentence. It was decided that as soon as the senate would be held again (it will be held after the market), Ganthner's rejection would be proposed, as he was distrustful of his cause, and immediately after that announcement, they should take care to elect another. However, since Pontisella, who has now come to his senses and defends our side vigorously, is lying down, and our market is at the door, it will be done by the advice of both that this business, whatever it is, will be postponed until after the market. If they elect another (since Ganthner abhors the judgments of the brothers and adores the revelations and sleepy oracles of his spirit), I will not call anyone; but if they want to nurture new monsters and openly or by arts restore Ganthner, I will summon more brothers and for these reasons (as you recently wrote) I will urge our senate to write to your most honorable senate and ask to send someone from your choir as a witness and superintendent of our colloquy. But I know what will happen. There will be no lack of those who will immediately bark: 'Oh, why do we summon the Zurichers? Does Rhaetia lack learned men who can settle this dispute?' But let us not care about such buffoons. I will strive with all my might to summon one or two.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the entire burden of the church rests on my shoulders, and if I at least mention the contrary opinion and sentiment out of duty, I am immediately intercepted by Ganthner's supporters: 'Oh, that foreigner will drive the citizen from office, expel him from the city? Rather let us retain the citizen and reject the foreign and inflated man.' Hence follow frequent contentions and quarrels between men and women scattered among themselves, so much so that it is not far from coming to blows due to the licentious detractions of many. I will truly say this: if Ganthner is received and has not publicly retracted and repented, I will not be able to be in office, no matter how fatherly you advise me not to think of leaving in such a disturbed church.</p>
      <p>I do not want nor should I betray the truth. If he has obtained the position, and I have taught differently, the matter will come to arms, which from many indications I can now also not find difficult to gather. I will rather leave with your grace than provide (as others may think) the cause of internal dissension.</p>
      <p>It is not the truth itself that stirs up trouble, but that robber depicted in John 8. However, those people will not dismiss Ganthner; therefore, I will be expelled. So often does that shameless man slander the Zurichers that he has given ample occasions for a just response and excuse. But what do you think of Brentius's booklet, I ask, let me know promptly. This in the middle of the night.</p>
      <p>Chur, quickly, November 6, 1570. May your reverence forgive me; for what I wrote quickly, oppressed by sleep, I could not review. May the Lord Jesus preserve you, our father and patron, in honor of himself and his church for as long as possible in safety.</p>
      <p>The consul greets you, as do Pontisella, Bonettus, the polytarch, and Balthazar, formerly the highest tribune, now a senator superior to the highest tribune.</p>
      <p>I wrote elsewhere about some things done in the assembly. Consul Willius was elected as commissioner, who presides over the accounts in the Italian provinces. It will be good for the Italian pastors to have such a pious and just leading man. These commissioners, of whom there are 9, were also tasked with following the national law to expel the younger monks from the Morbennian cloaca and gradually reduce those worn out by old age, so that this stable may finally be cleansed of its filth. But this will hardly be, as they always add and suborn new ones if any are missing from the number. - The bishop also helped in favor of Borromeo, so that the exiles of Mesocco would be expelled. They wrote to the leaders of the valley; but the good men defend themselves with the diploma of the Three Leagues, by which it is safe for them to adhere. It is certain that our bishop wrote sweetly, singing like a fox to the crow for the cheese. I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Your most submissive servant, Tobias Iconius.</p>
      <p>I ask, what your reverence has begun to consider regarding these new arts of impious men, by which they strive to set a wolf over the sheep, please communicate, if you can, without being burdened by health.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. H. Bullinger, the most complete and primary doctor of the Zurich church, his singular lord to be honored with faith and observance.</p>
      <p>To the pastor in Zurich at the Great Minster.</p>
