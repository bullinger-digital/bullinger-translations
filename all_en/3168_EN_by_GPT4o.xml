      <p>Wittenberg, May 1, 1557.</p>
      <p>Indeed, dearest father, I would gladly respond to your letters, especially with the opportunity presented by such certain news; but I have nothing to write back, and this is not without great sorrow on my part. For the bookseller from Wittenberg, to whom your letters were entrusted by Froschauer, lost them on the journey due to his great negligence and carelessness. You can imagine how much this pains me, as I have been eagerly awaiting them throughout this entire winter, and now I am uncertain about what has truly been decided regarding me, and I am in suspense; for even the bookseller could not say a word about whether I should remain further in Wittenberg or move elsewhere.</p>
      <p>However, dear father, I do not doubt that your opinion, which you declared in your previous letters, remains unchanged, namely that after greeting the teachers in Wittenberg, diligently collecting testimonial letters, and properly arranging other matters necessary for my studies, I should proceed to Marburg and so on. Assuming that this opinion of yours has not yet changed, I have almost entirely adapted myself to it. But because last year (as you know) and often before, you granted me permission out of your paternal kindness to travel to the neighboring parts of Saxony and to explore them, to see the academies with reputable men, and the more famous maritime cities along the Baltic coast. However, due to the Livonian and Prussian war, which disturbs all of Saxony with various tumult, it was not possible to travel there, but at the encouragement and advice of my teacher Philipp and other learned men, I wished to travel through other parts of Germany and decided to journey with Mr. Theodor Collin through Meissen, Silesia, and Moravia into Austria. If, with God's guidance and help, I arrive there safely and unharmed, I will proceed directly from Vienna to Marburg and turn to the course of my studies and compensate for that interruption in Marburg with greater diligence. Now, therefore, dear father, I have nothing else to write; for from the previous letters sent to you through the booksellers, I believe you have sufficiently understood the entire account of my life and studies.</p>
      <p>Finally, dear father, I earnestly commend to your piety this honorable and upright young nobleman, Johann Travers, a Rhaetian, who has devoted himself to studies with me this winter in Wittenberg and has rendered me many services of a good friend. Therefore, so that I may not be ungrateful, I ask and beg you, dear father, not to disdain to honor him with whatever benefits you can. Farewell, dear father, and always consider me as your beloved son. Greet on my behalf most diligently my mother, along with my sisters, relatives, and the whole family.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, your beloved son.</p>
      <p>[... to the] most excellent and outstanding man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most beloved father. Zurich.</p>
