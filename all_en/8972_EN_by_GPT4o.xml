      <p> Greetings. I have sent your letter, most esteemed sir, to your nephew through my Raphael without delay; for there was no one else available to deliver it, and I feared that it might eventually get lost in the abyss. I am sending the proceedings of the sub-assemblies, to which other matters will be added in due course and time. They wanted to defend Conradin Planta, as the previous assemblies had decreed. But the peasants of the Rhaetian Valley will disregard this, since in the first judgment it was decided quite differently by the will of the communities. </p>
      <p> It does not yet seem peaceful, and I greatly fear that this man will still cause us much trouble. </p>
      <p> May the Lord firmly settle everything. - Josue a Salicibus has returned from Venice, who asserts that the Venetians have recently suffered a great defeat by the Turks. But they also block the roads for letters, so that we can have little certainty from Italy, especially regarding the Venetians. - I give thanks for the news, which I am sending back. All of ours are amazed by it, who are now entirely occupied with receiving and devouring the royal stipends, by which they will eventually be burst. </p>
      <p> Farewell. I ask that these letters be given to Lucius Niero, which I have addressed to my brother; he will easily arrange for them through some coachman from Gynopedia. </p>
      <p> So far, I have understood nothing other than that your nephew is well, to whom I have now written a second time and, if I could have done anything to please him, I would have eagerly done so. Farewell. Most swiftly from Chur, Rhaetia, July 28, 1572. </p>
      <p> Your most devoted servant, Tobias Iconius. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most renowned Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord. </p>
      <p> Zurich. </p>
