      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your last words, which you addressed to me in a very pious and learned manner with a certain unique speech on the road, when you were escorting us from your city with great kindness, those words, since they were about my duty and specifically pertained to me and can be of great use if I observe them correctly, those words, I say, remind me and urge me beyond your other benefits to me, which are indeed many and great, that, although I know quite certainly your other occupations and the pleasure you derive from the letters of others, I still wish these rough and uncultivated words to reach your learned ears, at least so that you may feel that these and similar things, which you have kindly done for us, are not placed upon the ungrateful. For we will always remember that supreme benevolence, which you have abundantly shown us not for our dignity or merits, but from your own virtue for the sake of the fatherland. And if perhaps we have not given worthy thanks - for who can encompass such beneficence even in mind and thought? -, you will still know and have it for certain, being persuaded about us, that we very much wish to do whatever we can for your favor, provided we are truly approved by such good and prudent men, not in appearance. For I clearly see how much benefit can proceed to me throughout my life if I retain you as friends perpetually: For firstly, it is in itself pleasant to enjoy the friendship of the most learned and holy men, then it is also useful for those who do not so excel in counsel, who must depend on the wisdom and prudence of others; finally, which I value greatly, it is consistent with nature and honesty to seek integrity of character in associations. All these things are certainly so united in you that they can hardly be separated, even so manifest and clear, that they cannot be hidden or obscured. For these reasons, I am led to seek your familiarity. And because it has not been possible for a long time to enjoy the fruit and pleasure of it as much as I would have liked in person, nor perhaps will there be an opportunity to return to you more often, which I would very much desire, therefore I will attempt through letters to do something either in conciliating or preserving your spirits inclined to any honorable services, if perhaps the best and greatest God would grant his grace in this way, so that I might come into greater intimacy with you. For by myself I could never insinuate myself into anyone's favor, nor indeed will I ever attempt it of my own accord and strength.</p>
      <p>But it is God who touches and binds hearts; I pray to Him that what I wish to be accomplished by these my letters may first redound to His praise, then also to the benefit of us all. I ask that you take this as a declaration of my mind towards you in good part.</p>
      <p>Others will undoubtedly write to you more elegantly about public affairs, although I also have nothing new that would greatly interest you to know. Therefore, I refrain from speaking about unknown and uncertain matters; but I commend both myself and our entire church to your prayers, especially myself, who am altogether unfit for such an arduous task of God, unless He who called me grants more abundant grace. Therefore, as much as you can help me in this matter, as indeed you have greatly helped, you will have done this not for me, but especially for the church of God.</p>
      <p>May God repay your kindness to me with His infinite generosity towards us.</p>
      <p>Farewell then through Christ, most excellent, together with your whole household, and, as you do, love me.</p>
      <p>Given from Frankfurt am Main, on the seventh day before the Ides of April, in the year 1544. Your Johannes Pincziger from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the sincere overseer of the divine word, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy president of the Zurich church, his lord to be revered with sanctity.</p>
