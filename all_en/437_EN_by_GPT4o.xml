      <p>S. When I came from the council and opened your letters, a messenger was brought to me at the Golden Lamb Inn, Jacob Brenwald, ready to deliver anything I might have to send to Zurich. I promised to give him the letters to deliver; however, I opened the package and found Calvin's book, which you mentioned to me, for which I first express my great thanks to you. I wish more copies could be obtained from you to be sent to friends; for I do not doubt that it is worthy of reading, what has been elaborated by our Calvin. If our Antonius had them, he would sell them at a high price, even if they were not publicly available. We have also received the latest letters from our merchant friends sent from Antwerp, a copy of which we send to you, but on the condition that, after you have read and shared them with our people, especially the honorable councilors, you return them to me.</p>
      <p>I will shortly send how the brother of the royal protector perished by what kind of punishment, and then also what happened with the other conspirators; for he who has written other things so far has solemnly promised to write all these things, and I have prayed to my people that they conceal nothing from me. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, during lunch on February 18, 1549. Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>The news about Musculus greatly cheered me; I sincerely congratulate him on such a fruitful and honorable position. May the Lord preserve him for public piety for a long time, whom you will also greet warmly in my name.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, my dear lord and friend, to his hands.</p>
