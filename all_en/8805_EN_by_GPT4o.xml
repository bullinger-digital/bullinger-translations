      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Johannes Haller, faithful minister of the church of Bern, honorable lord and dearest brother. Greetings.</p>
      <p>We send to you, honorable lord and dearest brother, this bundle containing letters, the catalog of which we will soon provide. We send it for this purpose, so that you and yours, indeed our brothers and fellow ministers as well, may read each one and rightly understand the matter we are dealing with. At the end, you will find a letter drafted by us, which we intend to send to the upcoming synod of Nîmes. And since we are of one and the same confession, we share these with you, in case it pleases your piety to join us, so that we may send that letter to the synod in both our name and yours. If anything seems to need changing in the letter, adding or removing, feel free to advise. We do not indulge our own judgment so much that we disdain to listen to our brothers suggesting better things. And indeed, we send this messenger solely for this matter and we ask, if it can be done in any way, that you return all these things with your response through this same person. We have instructed him, if it pleases you, to stay with you for a full eight days, so that excessive haste does not cause you annoyance. Here is the catalog of what we send:</p>
      <p>1A: Our letter to the synod of La Rochelle. Beza's letter to Bullinger. And the response. 2B: Mr. P. Ramus's letter to Bullinger. 3C: Bullinger's letter to Beza. 4D: Mr. Beza's letter to Bullinger. 5E: Bullinger's response to Beza's letter. 6F: Beza's response to Bullinger's letter or response. 7G: Bullinger's reply to Beza. 8H: Bullinger's letter to Peter Ramus.</p>
      <p>9I: The writing of the brothers of Nîmes to the people of Zurich. And ours for the synod to be held at Nîmes. The letter of Mr. Admiral and our response. We pray that you receive these kindly from us, as we act with a sincere heart towards you. Love us, who certainly love you dearly. And farewell in the Lord. All of ours greet you and all the fellow ministers and brothers who are with you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 9, 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, H. Bullinger, in the name of all pastors and professors.</p>
