      <p>Dear lord and brother, I would like to write you news, but I truly know nothing that I do not think you already know. Yesterday, Sunday, there was shooting early in Konstanz, and there were many shots heard; however, no one has come to inform us of anything; we do not know what or why it happened. God have mercy on His own! It is worrisome that the Emperor might intend to bring the city entirely into his hands, so that he can occupy the place and always place people at the door, so that they must stay at home and guard, and cannot travel to the king without great danger.</p>
      <p>The scribe from Pfin, a very good, pious man, was recently in Zell am Untersee and also in Meßkirch, where he collected some interest for my brother-in-law Gorius from Ulm and also for my dear [sister] (my dear [brother-in-law]). He informed us last Saturday that it was said quite credibly in Meßkirch and Zell that the Emperor had moved from Speyer to Cologne.</p>
      <p>But a fresh troop, all Italian, three regiments of foot soldiers, were in Ulm, not entering the city, but had crossed over the Danube; there were also 500 well-equipped cavalry; they all moved towards Tuttlingen and the surrounding area; no one knows what they intend, except that some think they will further concern themselves with Konstanz. This also makes me somewhat anxious, as I fear something might have been dealt with yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>May God grant His own temporal and eternal peace, let us once be free from worry in His pleasing security, so that we may praise and glorify Him further in the community of His saints!</p>
      <p>The delay with the envoys of the Confederates, that they do not return, does not bode well, as the Emperor undoubtedly reports that they intend to negotiate that no foreign troops be stationed in the city, and if this is not convenient for him, he will see to it that he enforces his will and, before negotiations begin, he will have already acted.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Savoy is said to have had a steward with you and requested to renew an old agreement; these letters are said to have been made in the Emperor's chancellery, and he is entirely willing to challenge Savoy, in which neither Zurich nor the others of Bern want to get involved. If there is any truth to this, please inform me.</p>
      <p>I have not yet heard from Konstanz what response my lords' envoys have brought back from your lords.</p>
      <p>Also, it is said that Seestetter was in Schaffhausen with some Frenchmen intending to ally themselves with the Confederates, as with France. You will probably know if there is any truth to this.</p>
      <p>I hear that the Emperor has sent a justification to your lords and others, explaining how he is being falsely accused of having promised the cities to let them remain in their religion; but this was done by his advisors without his command, which I cannot believe; I think you would have written to me about it.</p>
      <p>Frechtus, along with four other preachers, has been taken away as a prisoner by the Elector; there is great intercession for them, but nothing has been achieved. Where they have been taken or what will be done with them is unknown, as it is also unknown where Brentius has gone. May God grant them all a steadfast heart and joyful spirit to confess His name in the presence of kings.</p>
      <p>Thomas Naogeorgus was in Ulm when Frechtus and the others were taken away. He wrote to me recently, coming from Kaufbeuren, and would like to find a place to stay; he is a very learned man, had to leave Saxony because of the sacrament, but I am otherwise unfamiliar with his character. Excuse my poor, lazy writing. Greet all good lords and friends and especially your entire household. My dear sister sends you all her Christian loyalty and love. Oh, let us call and cry out, that the strong, dear Lord God may look upon us with grace and not put us to shame, spare His great name, and have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Dated Griesenberg, September 10, 1548. Yours, A[mbrosius] Bl[aurer].</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his own. In Zurich.</p>
