    <p xml:id="regest1">Refers to letters from Basel to Zurich and from Melchior Wirz to his brother, which report news of an attack [on French students]; [Wilhelm] Arsent incited a student related to him [Jakob Arsent] to betrayal. The events in Bern demonstrate that only personal conversations can help; after certain pastors revived the conflict, he is tempted to leave the Bernese church to itself. In light of the expressions of friendship from the people of Zurich towards Osiander, he is surprised by the disdain with which they treat Bucer.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You will understand the treachery and robbery that have happened to us from the letters of the senate to your people and from the letters of Melchior Wirz to his brother. A cruel crime. May the Lord avenge it, I pray. Indeed, I cannot mention it otherwise. It originates from a pensioner. He is called Arsent, from Freiburg, who in previous years contended with the Frenchman before the Swiss judges. He has a nephew from his sister, a young student of letters and theology; he made this one a traitor, a veritable Judas. You will receive one thing from another.</p>
      <p>Moreover, regarding the business of the Bernese, where everything was done piously and happily, I see how we achieve nothing with letters. And unless we are given the opportunity to speak face to face, laying aside emotions, I do not know what end will follow. You believe others; you believe nothing of us, who nonetheless cultivate and handle the truth. I could say that the writings are despised, for which you would shudder. Would that God make me an honest plowman, just so that those I think about are removed from the duty of tending the Lord's flock! They teach so frivolously, so perniciously, not to say anything else. They are full of emotions and bad doctrine, from which what good will finally come, the end will prove. There has not been a pain for some time that has agitated me so. And because I am so unfortunate that what I say or do is worth nothing, I am often in this, about to give up and serve my church with all my strength. On the other hand, after it occurs to me: "Should such a noble church be abandoned?", I return and again do as much as I can; but I achieve little. I know you wonder what they are and what they are about, of which I speak so obscurely. If I were in person, I would conceal nothing from you. Now I am not allowed to write otherwise.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Osiander, a most ingenious man, most learned, endowed with the gifts of languages above many, a most exact and diligent theologian, you embrace so much (as I also embrace his virtues) as no one more, although he has always been the fiercest enemy of Zwingli; Bucer, a perpetual friend of Zwingli, doing everything for us and for the common concord of the churches, I do not know in what place some of you hold him. What could be the reason? I indeed see. But what if I say it? I would lie to them. I pour these things into your bosom, lest I irritate anyone.</p>
      <p>Farewell and, what I write, consider it kindly, I pray.</p>
      <p>Basel, 26th year 37.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
