      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I received your kind letter and took care to send it to Vergerius, so that it may be delivered.</p>
      <p>You write about the war, which now afflicts all of Germany. I fear it will not yet abate; for the Emperor has returned from Villach to the county of Tyrol, is gathering soldiers, and is expecting 13,000 Spaniards to come to the Adige from Italy, as they boast. But a certain doctor of medicine from Pavia told me that only 5,000 have arrived in Genoa, of whom a large part are camp followers and servants.</p>
      <p>The Emperor's soldiers are also partly being sent to Naples; that kingdom is troubled both by rebels and by the imminent Turk. Human affairs are in a miserable state; they began to become entangled thirty years ago and are becoming more and more intricate and perplexing every day. I believe that they will continue to worsen until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; however, for those who love God, all things work together for good. A man of great renown among us said in an honorable place before the magnates that the councils of Zürich and Bern had sent envoys to the King of the French with such a mandate: The Emperor is preparing a great war, gathering soldiers from all sides, whence there is a strong suspicion and rumor that he intends to invade France; they, however, sent by their leaders, promise to declare their favorable disposition towards his majesty, offering to bring aid as much as they can, both in person and with whatever resources they have, and to bring with them 50,000 crowns ready to be lent to the king, and, if more is demanded, they will also lend more, etc. Some of ours wonder whether this is true; they suspect otherwise. I have been asked by good men, whom you know, to inquire of you secretly whether these things are so, etc., so I ask you to inform us of the reason why Consul Habius was sent. In the future, I will inform you more clearly of the matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Chur, August 2, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>Haimius, Philippus, and Tscharner greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his foremost friend.</p>
