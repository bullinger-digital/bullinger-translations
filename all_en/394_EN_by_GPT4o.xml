      <p>All good times and years here, but eternal life there.</p>
      <p>Many hundreds of thousands of thanks and all good things, especially for the effort and work you have done for my sake, a person of such little importance...</p>
      <p>May the Lord God Himself be your reward and thanks; may He grant me grace and reason so that I may prove myself grateful and not lose the trust and love you have shown. Your very dear letter has greatly delighted me, which you sent to me through Agnes, showing that you do not wish to exclude me from your love, no matter how things may go [Greek] in part.</p>
      <p>Now, regarding the letter written at length by Walther, I truly cannot respond at this time as I would like, as this new year has brought me so much to write. I have always written to many good distressed people in the city; I will write to you as much as is necessary and useful for the matter this time, the rest at its time later and soon.</p>
      <p>Firstly, I hold to the fact that you, writing to me as a brother and very Christianly, do not wish to lay a burden on my neck that would be too heavy for me, etc., nor do you wish to advise me to act against my conscience, and even less to bring myself and the churches in Bern into conflict and unrest, etc.</p>
      <p>Now, it stands with me that, due to various considerations, this burden is too heavy for me, which I have also previously mentioned, etc.</p>
      <p>Secondly, my conscience still fluctuates in some matters in this case, so I am truly not at peace. Especially, you have frightened me even more by writing that I must not only sign the disputation but also swear, etc., which seems very strange and inappropriate to me, ne quid gravius dicam; for the matter seems without precedent. For I cannot bring myself to swear to such a thing; such an oath has always seemed strange; for it is a very dangerous, worrisome, and unseemly thing to bind oneself with an oath to any such thing, unless one wishes to bind someone to swear to teach according to God's word and the Bible, although in my opinion, this is also not necessary, since the authorities already have the power to dismiss any preacher who does not preach according to the matters or God's word. I cannot and do not know how to take such an oath, even if I were completely at peace with everything (which is not the case), let alone since I am still not entirely certain in some matters. And since I have nothing to say against their order, nor do I wish or want to ask them to release me from it, as this would only make me more suspicious, I know nothing else to do than to ask and beg you, as my trusted brother, most brotherly and diligently, to help and advise me in this matter, so that it may be settled or postponed this time with leniency and without any offense; for I truly could not engage in this matter, especially in this oath, without seriously injuring my conscience, where death would be preferable to me.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, it might not be an inappropriate response if I wrote to those in Bern in such a way, namely that I had fully expected, as is true, that by this time and until now, matters in Constance would have developed and been handled in such a way that my dear brother, I, and the other expelled would know what they were about, whether they would also allow us to join them or would want to have us as equals, so that we would also know how to proceed and arrange our affairs accordingly.</p>
      <p>Since this has not yet happened and no decision has been made until now, and it is entirely uncertain how soon this will happen, I cannot commit myself to where I should preach, but it is best advised that I remain silent until I see how they wish to regard me and the others. For if they wish to regard us as equals and perhaps also write to the Confederates not to detain us or give us shelter, and I have undertaken the office of preaching in Bern or elsewhere, they would be more burdened by my service than pleased; for they might not want to let me go (as is now happening to Schärtlin, as you wrote to me, and several others are said to be implicated). If they then wanted to seriously insist on protecting and keeping me against the imperial will, they might be in great heartfelt sorrow because of me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is much better to wait for the matter to unfold as God wills; for I have been in the old special disgrace of the king for 17 years, since I was in Esslingen, where he wrote a note with his own hand to the governor, Herr Jörgen Truchsess, and gave orders that if I were caught in the land of Württemberg, of which he was then lord, I should be sent to him. The bishop of Augsburg also let it be known to my brother that the imperial majesty was informed that he and his brother (hoc est ego) were to blame for the situation in Constance.</p>
      <p>Thus, it is quite possible, my dear brother, that we are regarded with special disfavor; but if this could be extinguished on my part through my silence, so that they might otherwise seek and find cause against me and because of me also against those of Bern or elsewhere where I have entered into service.</p>
      <p>This reason is truly and fundamentally not of small importance to me, that good sense dictates, I do not put myself forward until another opportunity arises; whatever you then consider good to do, you may also inform me, yes, I ask you most friendly to do so.</p>
      <p>In summary, that it all has the appearance that it does not happen for any other reasons, and no one has cause to suspect that I am against you in teaching; for this would be very burdensome to me for many reasons, which is why I also ask and testify to you most earnestly to keep all this confidential according to my trust and not to tell anyone about it, but to present other reasons to anyone who asks, and also to persuade dear Haller to do the same. For I do not know where it comes from that some have a general inquiry about my opinion on the sacrament, and I cannot hide from you that (Dr.?) Wolphius recently told my cousin Walthart... that he should write to me (though all from himself) and ask me to give him a report on the sacrament, etc., for he thinks it does not all fit together as is taught in Zurich and as he heard it in Constance, etc.</p>
      <p>To which I replied to him circumspectly, quia subolebat mihi nescio quid alienę personę, and wrote that I could not give him a report on it unless he first wrote to me how and in what points he thought the teaching did not fit together; if he did so, I would write to him further, for I could not otherwise recall that there was any disagreement in teaching. I also wrote to him about the use of the sacrament and admonished him with what heart he should approach it, etc. Now, when he comes here and I speak to him about it, he confesses to me that his lord had ordered him to write to me about it, but at the same time strictly forbade him to reveal it to me. Therefore, my highest request is not to speak to Wolphius about it at all, for various reasons; especially since it might also cost the... with him. But it troubles me very much, for what reasons this has happened. I have also received such a matter through my cousin Conrat Zwick, who wrote to me from Stain, for which I ask you again and again, as diligently as possible, not to let anyone know about it; for I will certainly not reveal it to anyone outside of my own, who intend to keep it as secret as I do, and it would be a great sorrow to me if any suspicion should arise about me in such matters; for you in Constance have always..., so that no one thought to involve us in this...</p>
