    <p xml:id="regest1">Viret is pleased about the well-being of Bullinger and his colleagues, which he learned from Bullinger's [not preserved] letter to Celio [Secundo Curione]. However, he is greatly troubled by the news about Luther's [„Short Confession“]; if only he had delivered a more honorable and useful swan song, instead of delighting the enemies! Although Viret is not proficient in the language of Luther's book, he is very saddened by what he has heard about it from Bullinger's letter and from friends during his stay in Bern. - He has heard that [the Zurichers] are preparing a response and does not dare to dissuade them, as they consider it necessary, even though experience shows the rather opposite effect of such writings. He wished that there would be no more occasions for polemics, so as not to let the enemies hope for a mutual destruction of the [Protestants] in the manner of the Midianites. May words and pen be used only against obvious enemies of the Church! - Viret does not want to oppose his opinion to the plans of the [Zurichers] and demand their silence or urge them to moderation, but only to bring up the consideration of whether such a matter should rather be spared from the ignorant public. He writes this because he has heard that the response [of the Zurichers] is to appear in French, German, and Latin. He does not know the reasons for this. However, like his friends, he is of the opinion that it is sufficient to respond only in the same language [as Luther's writing], as this way satisfaction is given to the offended [German reader], while those who are only proficient in Latin, [French], or Italian remain unaware of the dangerous matter; otherwise, one puts a weapon in the hands of the enemies. Only if [Luther's „Short Confession“] had appeared in several languages could a multilingual response be justified. - Viret writes to Bullinger more openly than he is entitled to, but hopefully not as if the sow wanted to teach Minerva, but like friends who consult with each other about the welfare of the Church. - In Geneva, Calvin's writing [„Against the Fantastic and Furious Sect of the Libertines who call themselves spiritual“, Jean Girard, [February] 1545; CO VII 145252; Bibliotheca Calviniana I 180-183, No. 45/4] is being printed against the Libertines, about which he does not need to write, as they are known to Bullinger. - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I am greatly pleased, most learned Bullinger, that from your letter to Celio I have learned that you and your colleagues and all your fellow ministers are in good health. But the news that has reached us about the booklet recently published by Luther on the matter of the Eucharist has greatly troubled my mind. If only the old man had sung us a different swan song, which would have brought him more honor, more pleasure and usefulness to his friends and all good people, and less delight to the enemies of our religion. For although I am ignorant of the language in which that book is written, it does not comfort me, indeed it greatly distresses my mind, if what I have heard about it is true, both from your letters and from friends when I was recently in Bern: which I do not think you all would have written unless they were true. I hear you are preparing a response against him, which I do not dare to dissuade you from. For I do not think you would have been inclined to write unless the matter itself greatly demanded it and extorted it from you.</p>
      <p>For what has been achieved so far by such writings, by which contentions have been more inflamed and by which we have made ourselves a spectacle to the enemies, the matter itself speaks more than enough. I would therefore wish that all such occasions be taken away from us and completely removed, so that we do not give hope to the enemies that we might someday be pierced by our own weapons like the Midianites, and fall by mutual wounds. These conflicts between those who profess the same religion, in the very bowels of the church and with such a multitude of external enemies, cannot but be very bloody. But what shall we do in the face of the importunity of some, who awaken the evil that is somehow asleep, who behave in such a way that we cannot remain silent? With the most ardent prayers, we should seriously ask the Lord that we may be compelled to sharpen and wield our tongues and pens only against those who openly profess themselves to be enemies of the church, and not against those who retain some name in the church, and by whose ministry the studies of piety have been not commonly increased. But when the defense of the truth is to be undertaken, silence must be broken, lest we seem to have betrayed the church by it. I do not dare, therefore, to oppose my opinion to your plans, nor to demand perpetual silence from you, since I hear that a just occasion for writing has been offered to you. Nor do I dare again to admonish you to moderation, lest you retaliate insult with insult, since I hope you will exhibit such moderation of your own accord, without any monitor, that no one can judge how much you have spared the peevish old man, and how your youth is tempered with senile maturity. This alone I wish to obtain from you, if my reasons have any weight with you, that as far as possible you strive not to disclose to those who are completely ignorant of them those things which cannot be heard by good people without the gravest pain of mind; things of such a kind that it is safer for them to be unknown than to go out into the public. I add this because I hear, if the rumor that has reached us is true, that you are going to respond in French, German, and Latin. I would not rashly condemn your plans, as one who perhaps does not know the reasons for your deliberations. But unless there is something else of more serious cause, or of sounder counsel, which I do not perceive, I am rather of the opinion, and with me all the friends I have here, and as many as wish better counsel for the peace of the churches, that you should respond only in the vernacular language in which the book was published. You will seem to have sufficiently fulfilled your duty, in my judgment, if you satisfy those who were offended by that booklet, and who can be offended in the future. Those who are ignorant, and who do not understand, will more safely remain ignorant. Those who know only Latin, German, or Italian, ignorant and unskilled in the German language, will remain ignorant without any inconvenience to themselves, of what they might not be able to learn without some danger to themselves. I wish that our people would never hear a word about such contentions. Our enemies would not have weapons against us with which they attack us. If the book had been translated into other languages, you would seem to have had a more just occasion, if you also used the benefit of languages to defend your cause and the church with their multitude.</p>
      <p>I write this to you, most beloved Bullinger, perhaps more freely than I ought, but not more freely, I think, than your humanity, and that sweetness of your character, and our friendship, which I rely on, allows me this boldness, not to teach Minerva, but to write something as a friend to a friend about the common progress and business of the church, and to seize the opportunity to interrupt our long silence, so that our friendship may be somewhat awakened. All of ours are well by the grace of the Lord. In Geneva, a book is being published in Calvin's name against the Libertines, about whose sect and manners there is no need for me to write to you, since you are well acquainted with the whole matter. If it is not burdensome, you will greet your colleagues and fellow ministers in my name. All our brothers greet you. Farewell. Lausanne, January 21, 1545. Yours, Pierre Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished in singular learning and piety,</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church in Zurich.</p>
