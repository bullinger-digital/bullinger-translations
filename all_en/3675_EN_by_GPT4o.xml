      <p>S. P. There is no need for you to be anxious about the letters you wrote to me; for I have received them all, and none can be lost that are given to the postmaster to be delivered to me. Moreover, I am grateful that you informed me about what you have understood, and they are not entirely vain or rash, the things... celebrated in the Belgian acts and commonly spoken of; for Mr. de Thermes, after accomplishing what you saw in the copy of the letters which the king had written to me, when he wanted to retreat and return to the king's army with the few troops he had with him, was caught off guard by an ambush, overwhelmed and besieged by Philip's cavalry, who came unexpectedly and by long marches, and in the first skirmish on the 12th of July, they killed about five hundred of the others; but the next day the adversaries doubled their forces and fresh troops arrived from nearby, and after our men, in the first assault, routed and slaughtered about fifteen hundred of their first line, in the end, they could not withstand the assault of the cannons, which were positioned on English ships on the shore and in the castle of Gravelines, nor the eight thousand cavalry, and nearly two thousand were killed, the rest were either captured or escaped. There was no prince there, nor was any of the slain of any name or reputation. Nevertheless, the king has a very well-equipped and large army and, as I hear, intends to besiege the city of Cambrai, near which Philip's army has fortified itself with great ditches and ramparts. Victories and peace are in the hand of God; He is to be prayed to, that He may turn all things to the glory of His name and preserve His own from such great storms and finally apply a remedy to such lost and afflicted affairs, which, as I hope, He will do. All these tumults and events are not new to you, who know well the nature of the world and the story of the two jars placed at the threshold of Jupiter. But nothing is less than a story that the life of mortals is tempered by good and evil; in this, however, the wise excel and the pious are happier, for they season and store up their evils in Him, who is the source and author of all good and makes all things work together for their good, and for this reason, they are wholly engaged in celebrating His praises and in the exercise of good works. Furthermore, what you heard about the death of Mr. Dandelot, you will not bear with difficulty to be false; for I have certainly received that he lives in great freedom, acts pleasantly, and praises God with his wife who has given birth, and there are no persecutions in France now. The things written by Salice from Vienna were most delightful; but what he praises about me, I revere in others, I desire in myself. I owe him for erring so lovingly, I accept his greeting and return mine with much interest.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sanlaurentianus wrote to me expressing his surprise that you do not respond to what he had sent through Vincentius Magi; I thought I had satisfied him. You, when you have leisure, will write back. I pray that you will set a fee with him whom you think will take care of my son and treat him as befits a boy of good character, and inform me. With my words, you will greet the most honorable and illustrious council and express and testify my willingness to gratify them. You will also greet Walter and other learned men.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love us, as you do.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 15th of August.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, outstanding in learning and piety, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
