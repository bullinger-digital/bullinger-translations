      <p>Soon, as I hope, I will see you, dearest Father Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You will hear from the envoy of the Clavenna church what the council has responded.</p>
      <p>The adversaries rejoice; the friends are saddened.</p>
      <p>I give thanks to God that He finally takes me away from here, where I could no longer be of service to the church of Christ, and calls me to a place where I hope my work and ministry will not be unfruitful.</p>
      <p>At least from there, I will be able to defend the good cause, which has been oppressed here for two and a half years, with the edification of the church.</p>
      <p>The rest I will tell you in person.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you safe with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Oh, miserable church of Christ, which is continually deprived of its old and best fathers and teachers, and is invaded and torn apart by new, inexperienced, and furious men.</p>
      <p>May God have mercy on His people.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>With how much sorrow I am consumed that I leave this school, indeed the entire city, in such a state, with the French church also overthrown, which has retained pure doctrine and religion here for about thirty years, you can think better than I can express in words.</p>
      <p>Farewell then in the Lord and greet the brothers, Josias and all the others, in my name.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, September 7, 1563.</p>
