      <p>Greetings. Mr. Flaminius wrote to me about a certain very foolish book, which Mr. von Cambrai, who served as a legate among the Rhaetians, took care to have printed, and he believes that on one page some learned men, with their names suppressed, are included among the flatterers. You will see, if it is not troublesome, what I should reply to him, and you will send the letters to him when the opportunity arises. I also send to you a copy of the letters written about those things that took place in the suburb of Lutetia, causing a chill to the priests. The king wrote to the prefect of Lyon and other metropolitan cities, to select eight or ten men from each city of the highest integrity and learning, free from contention, and who have not sworn allegiance to another, and to send their names, so that a plan for the reformation and purification of religion can be made. The bishop of Rennes thinks the plan is over... and no hope remains. I send to you two booklets of poems and epigrams, in which you will find many delightful things, when there is leisure. You will share them with Mr. Martyr, to clear my conscience. Tomorrow the Savoyards and Fribourgers will meet in Payerne; but they will do nothing.</p>
      <p>In eight days there will be a meeting in Basel; I have not yet decided whether I should attend, although all those concerned strongly urge me to intervene. My wife and son send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>In my words, you will greet all the lords and friends. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Nothing will happen in Frankfurt; the assembly is postponed to the next month. Solothurn, May 11.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
