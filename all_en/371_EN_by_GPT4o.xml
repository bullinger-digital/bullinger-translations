      <p>Revered, well-learned lord and friendly brother-in-law, my entire unwearied, willing service to you beforehand. Dear lord, your manifold goodness and friendliness shown towards us emboldens me to seek your reverence for more service and help. Namely, my dear late brother, Hans Ulrich, has a son, a journeyman who has learned the goldsmith trade in Geneva, and now that his apprenticeship years are over, he would like to serve in Zurich with his brothers, and especially, if possible, with Master Jacob Stampfli or, if that is not possible there, perhaps with another well-regarded and pious master; thereby he might in the meantime see his work and perhaps later come to him. Therefore, I earnestly request your reverence, my humble, pressing request, to entrust this dear cousin of mine (as I otherwise trust well) and perhaps assist him; he will willingly demand less pay, so that he may come to pious, honorable, and well-regarded people. I am willing to serve at any time to the best of my ability.</p>
      <p>Dated the 17th of December in the year of our Lord 1548. Your reverence's willing servant, Ludwig Zehender, bailiff of Biberstein.</p>
      <p>To the revered, highly and well-learned lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of God's word in Zurich, my dear, honorable lord and friendly brother-in-law.</p>
