      <p>Greetings. I have two booklets, one by Theodor Henne against the Interim, which is brief; it does not exceed three gatherings; the other by Justus Menius, titled: "On the Defense of Necessity." I wish both to be newly printed, but more willingly the former, so that people may be briefly taught about the pernicious Interim. The latter has a defect, so I do not care about it as much now. However, since it has been ensured among us that book scribes do not print anything against the Interim, I thought of your workshop, if it might perhaps still be freer, although neither place nor printer would need to be added. I wanted to write to you for this reason, to see if anything of what I say can be obtained; therefore, reply in time.</p>
      <p>Today, letters were read to me from Strasbourg, in which it was reported by the envoys: four weeks have been granted, within which a response must be given, yes or no. And great threats were added if they deny the harmful Interim. From the city, the wealthiest and noble merchants have migrated, up to 48; hence the rest are terrified, complaining in this manner: surely a grave danger threatens us, because such great men are leaving. Indeed, they do not feel as I do; for I would rejoice, as I would seem safer from treachery with them absent. The preachers still act bravely, whatever they may ultimately achieve.</p>
      <p>Dr. Johannes Marbach has finally returned from Saxony, Meissen, Thuringia, Hesse; for he had been sent to those regions. He reports a great consensus among the ministers and people, and not a few princes and nobles, to remain in the sincere confession of Christ. The three sons and wife of the captured elector, with the entire remaining province, to which still belong 7 counts and numerous nobility and a great abundance of towns in Thuringia, have with great constancy decided to leave these their remaining possessions rather than the pure confession of God. In the same sentiment are all the free cities of Saxony, the Baltic with the princes of Mecklenburg Heinrich, the two Pomeranians, the wards of LÃ¼neburg, Margrave Johann, the brother of the elector, Margrave Albrecht, the appointed successor of Prussia, his uncle, who obtained for him from the Pole both a sister as a wife and succession in his duchy. I did not want you to be unaware of these things.</p>
      <p>It is reported by a noble Frenchman that the Poitou are in arms for the gospel; the academy of Dole has forcibly seized a certain evangelical captive from prison; in the rest of France, too, things are being done wonderfully for the same gospel. We await what will follow.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with Gwalther, Otto, and the others. Basel, September 4, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most learned and pious, brother in his Lord, venerable.</p>
