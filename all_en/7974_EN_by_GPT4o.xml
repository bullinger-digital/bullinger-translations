      <p>It is known to everyone what recently happened, when in their field a certain minister of the word of God was captured and taken away, whom they consumed by fire in Rome in the past month of May. What, therefore, will the most audacious men not dare, if they see those who ought to be especially concerned about these matters turning a blind eye to everything?"</p>
      <p>In Chiavenna, August 22, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and obedient servant and in Christ a son, Scipione Lentolo, minister of the church in Chiavenna, by the order and will of the entire college, Philipp von Vertemate, senior of the church in Chiavenna.</p>
