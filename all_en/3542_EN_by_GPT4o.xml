      <p>Greetings. A certain famous man from Strasbourg, knowledgeable about French affairs, writes to me in these words: "The mission of the German princes, which was supposed to be sent to plead with the king for the safety and well-being of the faithful prisoners, has been hindered by malicious people. Then, a new papal bull concerning the cardinal triumvirate was sent to France, to which two most cruel and tyrannical, indeed Pharaonic, royal edicts are subjected under the jurisdiction of those three men. Our senate has taken this matter very seriously.</p>
      <p>I will add this: Cardinal of Lorraine, the first in the triumvirate, wrote to the Elector Palatine that the Parisian captives are unworthy, for whom he, along with the other princes, should intercede, because they are all Calvinists, Zwinglians, sacramentarians. Therefore, in those two royal edicts, they are never called Lutherans, as before, but always sacramentarians. The king needs German soldiers; they will not be easily allowed if you continue, etc.</p>
      <p>I wanted to add this to my previous letters to confirm that what has been written to me from elsewhere is true.</p>
      <p>But soon your envoy will return from France, Mr. Hercules von Salis.</p>
      <p>From him, you will undoubtedly learn that the king declares foreigners free, but subjects all his own to the Spanish Inquisition and severely persecutes Christ. Wait until he returns; if he wants to tell the truth, he will narrate things that are horrendous. But the authors of all these matters are the pope with the bishops and cardinals, whose princes are servants and ministers of punishments. If only, as has been done more than once before, they would sometimes draw the sword against the authors of cruelty themselves; but it is ours to pray for those who persecute us. I received your letters written in good faith about the things that have happened among you these days. Be faithful and prudent, serious, not imperiously threatening.</p>
      <p>May the Lord help those afflicted for His name's sake. Farewell together with our Philipp; I would gladly host the book, but I will also write to him if only time permits. Zurich, March 18, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, serving the Church of Christ in Chur, my esteemed and beloved compatriot and brother. Chur.</p>
