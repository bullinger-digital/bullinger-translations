      <p>We wish you very much health in the Lord, dearest and most esteemed brothers, whom we also pray for daily with the utmost zeal, as is fitting, that He may avert the scourge of the plague from you and your churches for His singular goodness and graciously look upon us all, having once forgiven our sins. However, the more urgent the occasion and the arduous the matter, which we now intend to discuss with you, the more confidently we hope that you will take our intercession in good part, as it proceeds not from any πολθπραγμοσθνΗ (meddlesomeness) or levity, nor indeed from any other source than a common zeal for salvation. The matter is of this kind:</p>
      <p>It has been decided by Emperor Maximilian, as you know, to hold a diet of the entire empire in Augsburg on the 14th of the next month, in which not only in general about establishing religion, but specifically and expressly about restraining heresies and sects will be discussed. For it is written to us that these are contained by name in the edict.</p>
      <p>A truly holy and plainly necessary counsel.</p>
      <p>But what if there too, under this pretext, the truth is condemned without being heard? This we truly fear not without reason. For how often have some attempted this in recent years, and how wonderfully the Lord has broken their plans, you are not unaware. So far from time softening the hardness of some, they have never been more unjust, indeed, so much so that in published books and daily sermons they clearly and openly declaim that we are worse not only than the papists but also than any Epicureans and even the devils themselves.</p>
      <p>This rage of theirs is greatly sharpened by the open transition of the excellent Prince Elector of the Palatinate to the side of truth; unless they oppose him by all means at the earliest opportunity, they foresee their errors exposed and consequently the imminent ruin of their doctrine.</p>
      <p>Moreover, since France is now joined to us, they understand well enough that they will not be superior even in number, and therefore they are entirely focused on either forcing the French churches to embrace the Augsburg Confession and thus alienating them from us, which we nevertheless hope they will never achieve, or opening a way for the papists, who are also intent on this one occasion and even now simulate a certain appearance of concord with them, to once and for all destroy those churches. They must be driven headlong, as they have once made shipwreck of a good conscience.</p>
      <p>They think that what they now desire will be much easier to achieve than ever before, both because they will have the papists themselves as allies in condemning us, which was not the case before, and also because, besides the fact that there is no longer a Melanchthon to restrain them with his authority, they have some of great authority, whom it is not necessary to name, so inclined to this very thing, that is, to condemn us rather than to hear us, that our adversaries rely on none more than them.</p>
      <p>"But indeed," someone might say, "let them obtain what they want, what does this concern us, who are not bound by their decrees?" We indeed not only confess this to be so by the grace of God, but also fully trust that, as our God has promised us, His truth will prevail, whatever the whole world may contrive against it. Meanwhile, if by our inaction we allow ourselves and the still tender brothers looking to us to be cast into such evils, from which we may not easily emerge later, we truly fear that this may justly be charged against us before the tribunal of God.</p>
      <p>For as far as we are concerned, if it should happen, as they are attempting, that we are condemned as heretics and consequently attacked by them and the papists with a common consent, what do we think will happen then? The condition of France will be much worse, for the adversaries there have long aimed at nothing else than to utterly overthrow the nascent churches under this pretext (with Germany not only silent but also approving). Nor do we conjecture these things rashly, esteemed brothers, since we receive letters from both France and Germany itself about these matters, which indeed cast us into great difficulties, for even if the danger did not extend to us, whom it is certain they seek by name, us, I say, Zwinglians and Calvinists, as they call us, charity would nevertheless command us not to abandon the brothers in such great peril. Therefore, a remedy is needed, which the Lord will bless as He sees fit; but what the most suitable remedy might be, especially in such an urgent occasion, has not yet come to our mind. Therefore, this is what we have thought to consult you about, to hear your opinion more willingly than to set forth our own. What we finally think, we will write frankly, but with the condition that others rather than we decide what needs to be done in this common danger.</p>
      <p>Since therefore we do not think it possible, especially in such a short time, nor, if time allowed, expedient, that the delegates of the cities be sent to the diet, we are most pleased with this plan (as it seems to be beyond all danger), that a brief German or Latin writing be immediately published, although not with the public authority of the cities, yet faithfully and as gently as possible embracing the doctrine received in all the churches of these parts, namely the same which was long ago written and published in the name of the Swiss churches, and also showing that the most convenient and indeed the only way to settle the dispute about the Lord's Supper appears, not if those who have never been heard are condemned by the judgment of one party, as in the Council of Trent all who do not approve the doctrine of the Roman pontiff were condemned, but if at least a synod of the entire German nation is convened at a suitable place and time, in which first of all the judges to sit and then the whole future action is decided in the presence of the Imperial Majesty itself, as was done in the legitimate ancient synods, with the papists also coming there, if they wish, so that they too may be judged from the one word of God. Moreover, the Imperial Majesty can urge the other kings and princes to approve that synod and send delegates, which if they please, the greater will be the usefulness of this synod.</p>
      <p>But if they refuse, Germany will nevertheless be peaceful to the great benefit of the empire, and there is no doubt that at least all who profess the doctrine of the gospel in other regions outside the empire will follow the authority of that synod. And since this cannot be accomplished in such a short time, it is most just that meanwhile all harshness on both sides, both in writing books and in delivering sermons, be restrained, which thing does nothing but partly foster and partly also continually stir up disturbances and dissensions, as experience itself has proved. This, therefore, esteemed brothers, is what has now come to our mind, which indeed we approve all the more willingly, because we hear that the French churches, which are opposed by almost the same difficulties, and not only the French but also the English and the Belgians, are about to publish similar writings, which consensus we hope will be very effective.</p>
      <p>But if anyone, having progressed further, asks what the outcome of this plan will be (for it is not the part of a prudent man to rashly throw himself into something from which he could not later escape without harm), we indeed think that the plan of holding this synod will be very difficult and indeed almost αδθνατον (impossible), which nevertheless, if it is offered so unexpectedly, should be considered a singular benefit.</p>
      <p>"To what end then are these things?" someone might say.</p>
      <p>Namely, that the plans of those who breathe nothing but condemnation and anathemas may now be hindered; for if this is done (and it will be done, as we hope, very easily by this one means), then we trust that within a short time the churches rightly thinking will be so confirmed even in Germany itself, that we will no longer fear them.</p>
      <p>This, therefore, is our opinion on this matter, esteemed brothers, which we would have communicated to you much earlier if we had been informed of these things sooner, and now we pray that you will consider it favorably.</p>
      <p>For these things are written to you by our senate, whom we have informed of these matters, and by us with no other counsel than that you may consider what needs to be done in this common danger.</p>
      <p>We hope that our concern, even if it perhaps seems superfluous, will not be disapproved by you. Geneva, December 14, in the year of our Lord 1565.</p>
      <p>Theodorus Beza, on behalf of all the pastors of the city and countryside of Geneva, I have signed.</p>
      <p>To our brothers and fellow ministers in the Lord, most venerable pastors and teachers of the church of Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
