      <p>Nor do I myself see, my venerable and dearest brother, whom we can safely trust in the future, after even those fail, whose faith and integrity seemed to be the highest. I am more and more inclined to think that what V[alentinus] F[ortmüllerus] recently affirmed to us here with great constancy is not at all in vain. A certain distinguished man, when he recently heard these things, said that several years ago he had received from a certain notable senator of St. Gallen: "Oh, you do not know what lies behind the man; there is no steadfastness behind him. He does not anger anyone where he must be concerned, he can be easily persuaded, and especially when he is honored with goods and money, one can achieve with him whatever one wants. I (he said) have experienced this myself more than once." And yet the authority and reputation of this man are so great with me that, even if I see with my eyes what I hear with my ears, I think I am being deceived by some illusions rather than that things are truly as they appear to the eyes. I sent V[alentinus] F[ortmüllerus] your letters wrapped in mine, so that there would be no suspicion among them and that it could not be a fraud to either of you. There is no one in the world more to be trusted, not even a brother is safe from a brother, etc., and yet one must trust, even if every day (as they say) a murder occurs.</p>
      <p>How and what was finally answered to the king in Baden regarding the ban, I cannot ascertain and have not been able to learn anything from anyone except the little you wrote to me, except that it is said he earnestly demanded an answer, namely that the Confederates drove the fish into the net so that they had to do what he wanted.</p>
      <p>Now all the exiles are reconciled and agreed except for my dear brother, also cousin Conrad Zwicken; from them, they want 1000 florins from each; they are to pay in cash within 14 days, or they will be attacked, sold, etc.</p>
      <p>The city clerk gives 600 florins but is to avoid the city forever. Ulrich Hochrütiner from S[ant] Gallen gives 400, and he is also not allowed to have access to the city, and as he has suffered great damage when the servants were inside, he is to seek justice for the damage inflicted on him.</p>
      <p>Lude Hüruß gives 600 florins, guild master Labhart 400 florins, guild master Bär 300 florins, Heinrich Hack from Frauenfeld, on behalf of the Confederates and the governor, gives nothing, as does, it is said, Hubentobler, who was also a Confederate and councilor.</p>
      <p>The absolution from the imperial ban is to be brought to Constance these days by the one from Lie[r]; thus the colonel comforts the citizens well. There are wonderful things: the imperial and royal councils are not of one mind in Constance; the imperial ones would have liked what they begged for in Constance before the city became the king's; the king cannot and will not give it without great ruin to the city; thus they cannot agree on the matter, etc. Thus, the devout abbot of Weingarten also negotiates between the city and the bishop; he also has great claims, which no one wants to satisfy. The patrimony of Christ and his robe cannot be rightly divided anywhere.</p>
      <p>Today my dear brother-in-law Peter Schär writes to me, among other things, to convey to you his very friendly, Christian service with all good. He has let us copy a document of a papal commission, which has come to Stuttgart, and as he was there now, he wanted to send it to us, having asked one from Blöningen for it; he was to return it the next day as promised. He relied on this; but it was not returned to him on the promised day, which he is very dissatisfied with. Yet he writes that it is a commission of the pope to three notable cardinals; they are to absolve in all of Germany all those who, led astray by the shameful heresy, want to return to the bosom of the church, with much other villainy; and since Germany is so large, that it is too much for the three to oversee, etc., the three cardinals give a subcommission to each bishop to do this in his diocese. There is nothing in it about the Interim, that people should be left with it, etc. These three also report that they have orders to travel to the imperial majesty and to persuade him to execute and enforce everything that the commission contains, etc.</p>
      <p>In Württemberg, in many places, things are very miserable. Almost everywhere the preachers are praised. Now they are asked in some offices to teach the people and the youth, not as pastors and they should not have the name, but as catechists, etc.; this is not to be asked of them in vain, etc. Thus, they twist and turn wonderfully where they do not follow the right, straight path of truth. May Almighty God once give a heart and zeal, that with clear eyes we look only to Him and with feet of grace walk the path of His pleasure.</p>
      <p>All those who did not want to preach alongside the Interim have been praised; some, however, have accepted to preach alongside the mass and Interim as in Thurgau, etc.</p>
      <p>It is written to my aforementioned brother-in-law from Montbéliard on July 22, that they are gathering around Cologne and that there is some war present; but no one can know where it will lead. The month of August is said to be fatally fortunate for the emperor in war; it is thought he will stir and undertake something; indeed, then it goes plus ultra, as his rhyme says. Well, Lord God, make us poor ones better once, so that we may also become better authorities!</p>
      <p>Oh, how blessed we would be! May the Lord once give us different hearts; then we would be good, and everything would be good. But I see, it will not and cannot be; everything must go to ruin. May God keep us among His own!</p>
      <p>Given in great haste on the 31st day of July 1549. If you want to answer the enclosed letter of Marcellus' son, if he is still in Zurich; if not, let it be given to Hans Fry at the Count of Oettingen; he can well get it to Ror, or if you have other means to send it there. It comes from my brother-in-law Peter Schär.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his own. Zurich.</p>
