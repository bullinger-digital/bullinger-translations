    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received], which he received yesterday through the German schoolmaster [Benedikt Euander]. Just shortly before, he had sent a letter for Bullinger [18020 from January 31, 1548] with his nephew Josua Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">He expects that the bridal couple [Hans Rutishauser and Dorothea Diethelm known as MÃ¼nchin] will appear at any moment to report on the status [of their marriage request]. Since the Thurgau governor [Leonhard Holzhalb] is also supposed to travel to Zurich because of this matter, Bullinger should do his utmost [for the bridal couple]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">The people of Konstanz must continue to practice patience [waiting for Emperor Charles V's response to their reconciliation request]. God forbid that unrest and other misfortune arise from this! The minds of councilors and the population are unpredictable in distress.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">It would be appropriate if Johannes Gisling [at his new position] were strictly supervised and had no personal responsibility. He also asserts his willingness to do so. Perhaps he means it sincerely. Currently, however, he cannot withstand his unbridled desires. God have mercy on him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Blarer is waiting for further news from Bullinger about the Baden [Diet].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">The letters that Blarer sent to Bullinger for forwarding to Bern have not yet arrived there. At least the young [Kaspar Seidensticker] did not confirm receipt in his last letter. Bullinger should not forget it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Euander, who delivered Bullinger's letter yesterday, should be able to continue traveling from Konstanz without difficulties as a confederate. However, Blarer preferred not to give him a letter to avoid putting him in danger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Blarer has not yet received news about Ercole II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">If the book mentioned in Blarer's letter from yesterday, "Onus ecclesiae," is available in Zurich, Bullinger should send it to him as soon as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">After the brawl with the Steckborn youths, a boy from Hemmenhofen [N.N.] has now died. And several are said not to have recovered yet. Fortunately, there is agreement that the Hemmenhofen residents are to blame [for the altercation].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">Everyone sends their regards. Blarer himself also sends greetings to the people of Zurich. They should pray for Konstanz.</p>

      <p>I am expecting the bridal couple at any moment to see how things stand. The governor of Thurgau has indicated that he intends to go to Zurich for this and other matters. If he comes, you should handle this in the best possible way.</p>

      <p>We must await our situation with patience. May God grant great and much grace so that the delay does not lead to unrest and other misfortune! The common minds of the councilors and the populace are unpredictable in distress.</p>

      <p>Regarding Gislinger, it would be good if he could be under discipline and supervision, so he does not have personal management. He always claims he is willing to be guided and corrected. Perhaps he is sincere. However, in the meantime, he is overcome by his uncontrollable desires. God have mercy on him!</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Regarding Baden, I will be ready for what you write further.</p>
