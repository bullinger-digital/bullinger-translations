      <p>Greetings, my venerable and dearest brother. I received your letters, as I usually do, with great longing and read them with even greater joy of spirit. I am very grateful to you for constantly remembering us and for continuing to be like yourself in the duty of writing. May the Lord Jesus remember you and all yours with His most abundant blessing, keeping us in solid salvation forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>Those whom you have greeted, in turn, greet you reverently and with much more eagerness, and they commend themselves diligently to your sacred prayers. Dr. Fuchs and we are equally grieved by the lamented illness of your dearest brother; may Christ, the best and most blessed physician, who even calls the dead back to life, kindly extend His life-giving hand to him, so that the dreadful illness may either completely depart or treat the most pious young man in such a way that he can bear it tolerantly.</p>
      <p>I consider those most fortunate who, from the utterly desperate calamities of this mournful age, are transferred as soon as possible to that heavenly and tranquil security and secure tranquility by dying in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Samuel Witenbach, my godfather, left for military service on May 6th and could not be restrained by any advice or persuasion, either from me or from other friends, even though he admitted in the meantime that he was gravely sinning against God, his wife and children, both parents, and other friends. In this matter, I do not know whether to be more angry with him or with our magistrate, who, although he learned of his decision early enough and had him summoned and admonished by some leading men to be recalled to a better mind as far as possible, nevertheless, when they achieved nothing and he persisted in his obstinate mind, allowed him to leave openly and freely, to the great offense of all good people, when he could have been restrained either by a new oath or certainly by being thrown into prison, which should have been done for the sake of his father (if nothing else), who is most grievously afflicted by this more than impious obstinacy of his son. Before the wretched man left, I informed some senators of what you had written to me about the laws of your people against military service, hoping that they would bravely imitate your example here, as they had otherwise forbidden this kind of military service to their citizens. But I do not know by what evil spirit this larger beetle broke through these spider webs, in which, however, flies are miserably entangled enough, although this is nothing new, the big hand and the small hand do not have the same rights in the world, and the mayor's cow must be more valued and paid for than that of his neighbor, Mr. Clewis.</p>
      <p>What I recently wrote about the people of Bern is different, and the elder Witenbach, being poorly informed, did not explain to us what the matter was on the day I was writing to you. However, I hear that they have now taken the same precautions as before, although, as usually happens, they make little progress with the rebels. For the measure of our Germany must be filled, so that blood pursues blood and is most miserably plundered, which has already been plundering for so many years.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant us, among the few of His own whom He still has, His solid peace here, and eternal peace through Christ Jesus in heaven.</p>
      <p>There are indeed some who are constantly hoping for peace in Germany this year, however much Albert may rage, whom neither the French nor the Emperor now trust, as he has wanted to extract a great amount of money from both with amazing cunning, so that he could avenge himself on the Noricans and other enemies of his.</p>
      <p>The Elector Palatine has requested several ministers from the brothers in Strasbourg, as well as from the WÃ¼rttembergers, which they also affirm that Albert, the prince of Bavaria, has done; but I expect more certain information about this at any moment, and perhaps these things are already more known to you than to me. Let us pray to Christ that He may kindly inflame all Christian princes with a serious zeal for His word and thus continually dispose their hearts to pursue peace.</p>
      <p>As for what came from Winchester in England and the new disturbances in that kingdom, etc., I do not doubt that you have already been informed from elsewhere. They write that the Emperor is ill, those who usually write reliably; but this is not new, it would indeed be new if it were truly written that he had departed from life, although we seem likely to provoke even worse ones by the stubbornness of our sins unless we repent. Farewell, my soul, with your whole household, whom mine, along with Funck and other friends, especially Fuchs and Valerius, reverently greet. May your most holy and learned fellow ministers and the most renowned professors of your school be greeted. We commend ourselves accurately and most diligently to the faithful patronage of all of you before Christ. Bienne, May 17, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>God knows that I would gladly and heartily like to promote your dear brother-in-law, if it were possible for me; but there is no writing here; there is no scribe here except for a single city scribe, who is still of such age and ability that, according to human reckoning, his service will not be vacant for a long time.</p>
      <p>But in the Bernese territory, there are many small towns where there are city scribes in all; he would have to find a place there. It always happens that some such positions become vacant. If you then had someone in Bern who was vigilant, he could soon find a place, and our dear Mr. Hans Haller could also be very serviceable and helpful in this. I know no one in Bern in authority or otherwise; I have not been there since the disputation; but you, as an acquaintance, could achieve much there for the sake of your dear brother-in-law.</p>
      <p>I know that your dear brother-in-law is very dear to my dear cousin, and she would gladly do all kinds of good and kind things for him. I have truly written to her about him in many letters now, and I also hope that she will live a little longer for the good of many people; for she is a great benefactor to her friends and the poor, and therefore I hope to the Lord that He will graciously extend her life; so she would not willingly lack your brother-in-law in her lifetime.</p>
      <p>Please inform me what is held by law or custom in such a case with you: when a child dies, who is the only one and has no siblings, also no father, but a mother; whether the mother inherits the child's estate, which comes from the father, or whether the same estate falls to the ascending line.</p>
      <p>A child has died, whose father was rich, but died years ago. The child has no closer relatives from the father's side than the brother of his father's grandmother, that is, the brother of his great-grandfather; he wants to inherit and thinks that the rightful mother should inherit nothing from the child because she contributed very little to the man. If possible, please inform me soon.</p>
      <p>According to written law, I know well how it should be; but these inheritance rights are made according to the customs of each land; I would like to know what is right and customary with you.</p>
      <p>The dispute between Gregor from Ulm, a strong man and dearest relative, and our Johannes Ulmius, a learned and not regrettable and very friendly young man to me, keeps me very concerned. You, my soul, be present for both in time, lest, as often happens, it spreads more widely and grows into hatred or lightly admitted alienation of disturbed minds. Greet Johannes most lovingly, and urge him, as much as you can, to control himself and defer to Gregor on my behalf.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
