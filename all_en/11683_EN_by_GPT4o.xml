      <p>Our friendly greetings along with the offer of all honor, love, and goodwill beforehand.</p>
      <p>Well-educated, pious, honorable, wise, especially kind, dear sirs and good friends, as our preacher, Mr. Michael, the bearer of this letter, will come to you, we have instructed him to arrange for our scholarship holders with your council once again. However, it is our will and intention that the boys henceforth be assigned to someone who has more boys at his table, so that they may use the opportunity to converse in Latin with other young students. Therefore, it is our earnest, friendly request to you to assist our aforementioned preacher with advice in this matter and for each of you to take diligent care of our boys as if they were your own. We would like to earn and kindly deserve this from you, together or individually, whenever it is appropriate, and we would gladly repay it with the help of the Almighty, whom we ask to keep you safe and sound, etc.</p>
      <p>Dated Sunday, the 25th of June, in the year 1542. The Mayor and Council of Biel.</p>
      <p>To the well-educated, honorable, wise gentlemen, the united preachers along with other learned men of the city of ZÃ¼rich, our especially kind, dear sirs and good friends.</p>
