      <p>S. D. You are not unaware, my most esteemed lord and godfather, how I am affected towards the church of Zürich and indeed all the people of Zürich, nor am I unaware of what I owe them; but likewise, you are not unaware of how it is not possible for me to help them among our people, as much as I would like to. For the situation of our church is almost the same as yours; for by the grace of God, we have many devoted people and among them many, as they call them, expectants, so that if any position becomes vacant, there are many who try to occupy them, so that in such a great number of them, we are often very perplexed in conferring benefits, with complaints from those who seem to be neglected for a longer time. And I have incurred much envy among some for promoting those who were recommended to me by you, so that now I hardly dare to mention any foreigner anymore.</p>
      <p>Thus, our Laurentius returns to you with the matter unresolved; however, I obtained travel expenses for him from the senate, namely two crowns; Steiger also added one of his own; others also gave something, so that even though he obtained nothing, it may not seem that he made a loss of his own affairs by coming here. Please regard my efforts favorably. I wrote recently about the Apocalypse and our plan through Froschauer, so there is no need to add more to this.</p>
      <p>Now my remaining fellow ministers are engaged in reading the work. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>In Bern, December 26, at the end of the year 56. All of ours greet you and yours, especially my mother and wife.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>The people of Lausanne were here these days requesting a general synod, in which the matter of predestination would be discussed; but we resisted their attempt with all our might, knowing that this discussion would be the beginning of a greater conflagration. Therefore, this was denied to them by our magnificent senate, but it was decreed that the visitation of the classes should be made again next summer. Eustachius Quercetanus was also freed from his function at his and all their request.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his dearest and most esteemed lord and godfather.</p>
