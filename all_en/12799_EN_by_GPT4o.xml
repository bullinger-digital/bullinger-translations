    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frey hopes that Bullinger is doing as well as he himself and his family are.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] When he recently went through his [handwritten] "Annotations" on greed, he came across the story of a man [...] from Bremgarten, which Bullinger or his deceased mother [Anna, n√©e Wiederkehr] had once told him. That man is said to have often stated that a young man should do everything possible to acquire wealth, even if it means losing his soul. On a Sunday, God revealed to everyone that the man from Bremgarten had done this himself (Bullinger knows how the story continues). Frey had to realize that when writing it down, he failed to include some important details, such as the man's name and the time of the event. Since this example is very suitable to deter people from greed, Frey asks Bullinger to provide him with the missing information so that the story gains credibility.</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes. If you are well, that is good, my father. I am indeed well with my family.</p>

      <p>Recently, by chance, while going through some of my annotations on greed, I came across the description of such a memorable example, which I recall having heard either from you or from your late mother, of a certain man from Bremgarten, who often had this saying: "A young man should set his soul on a fence post until he acquires wealth," etc. And what he taught with words, God made manifest with a notable event. Namely, that on a certain Sunday, etc. (you understand the matter). In this, however, I found a great gap in the writing, because both the name of that unfortunate man and the time escaped me when I was writing. Since the event is most worthy to be brought forth at some time to deter the reckless impiety of the greedy, I beg you, my father, do not hide the man's name from me (the rest is known), and also assign the time for greater certainty, if you remember.</p>

      <p>Our people greet you. Please greet all yours in my name, etc. Farewell and love me, as you are accustomed. Biel/Bienne, January 13, 1547. Entirely yours, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his father, always to be honored greatly. Zurich.</p>
