    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger received Serin's letter from August 4 [No. 2979], in which he was reproached for his long silence. However, he wrote several times [not received], without ever getting a reply. So he stopped the correspondence, as he suspected that his letters (which contained nothing compromising) were intercepted and read by others, which Serin's last letter now confirms. By breaking off the correspondence, Bullinger, who is hated by many, wanted to spare Serin from hostility and inconvenience. However, since he could gather from Serin's last letter that his previous letters had no serious consequences and Serin would be pleased with further letters, he decided to write this reply.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He never approved of the prevailing disunity in doctrine and customs within the church. This rightly caused much resentment among the opponents [Protestants]. How often did some change their view of the Lord's Supper and the customs of their church! And how good it is that Serin remains with the recognized truth and does not constantly preach something else or introduce new church customs! Such inconsistency cannot be justified with the Gospel! Many years after Christ's ascension, Paul wrote to the Corinthians: "What I received from the Lord, I passed on to you," etc.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Now to Serin's question of whether the people of Zurich would tolerate the administration of the Lord's Supper to the sick. The answer is no, as this is an abuse introduced by the Roman Antichrist. Paul did not want the Lord's Supper to be celebrated in any corner, but in public assemblies. Also, in the early church, the Lord's Supper was not brought to the sick at home. Therefore, the people of Zurich want to continue to adhere to the custom founded by their Lord Christ, their true high priest, and observed by the early church. Due to time constraints, Bullinger cannot elaborate further.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Serin wrote that he prays to God to thwart the plans of the enemies [of Zurich or the Confederates]. However, Bullinger knows that the [people of Zurich], just like the [people of Ulm], are sinners. And since the [people of Zurich in the Second War of Kappel] have already been chastised by the Lord, this could also happen to the [people of Ulm], especially since no one can oppose the will of God, the strongest judge. He is the hope of man and will not abandon those who call upon him. It is very important that the Confederates do not give the enemy any reason to want to exterminate them. And should the enemy nevertheless attack them and want to deprive them of their God-given freedom, then they will bravely defend themselves with God's help and prefer to die rather than submit to disgraceful and godless soldiers! If the enemy tries to exhaust them through a costly delay tactic, he will soon find that he is dealing with a people who can survive in the mountains with very little! The enemy, on the other hand, would eventually have much greater expenses than the Confederates and be forced into an open battle by their surprise attacks, in which God will hopefully fight for the latter. They are ready for a long war. There is unity among them. And even if they do not share the same beliefs, they are all convinced that only God decides the victory and supports those who implore him repentantly. Moreover, they are all ready to die for the fatherland. And those who do not clearly take a stand against the enemy will all perish. But even though they are ready for a military confrontation, they do not believe that Emperor Charles V will take action against them. They bear the [Imperial] eagle in their seal and have the promise of a prince [Emperor Maximilian I] to take no action against them. Moreover, that [Charles V.] is also striving for a new alliance with them. Yet they remain constantly vigilant!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Serin and the people of Ulm should pray for the church of Zurich. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [P.S.:] Greetings to Martin Frecht, to Johannes Piscatorius, and to the other colleagues. The people of Zurich know what the [pastoral colleagues of Ulm] have to endure for the Gospel. The Lord has promised nothing other than the cross! Therefore, it is important to be brave in battle, to implore God's help, to disdain the transient things of this world, and to strive for the eternal! The [colleagues of Ulm] surely know this and do not need admonishing comfort, because they themselves must provide it to the weeping church of Christ. May the Lord deliver his own from evil!</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received your letter dated August 4th. In it, you complain and accuse me of laziness and my long silence in not writing letters. However, my dear Leonhard, I wrote once and again, which I easily gather from your letters that you did not receive! Therefore, I ceased from the duty of writing. I suspected that in these troubles, letters were intercepted and opened. However, there is no need for you to fear for yourself and your affairs. Nothing was discovered by those who opened the letters that could harm you. Furthermore, I feared that I might cause you envy and make enemies for you if I continued to write to your kindness. You know how odious my name is to many. Therefore, so as not to inconvenience you, whom I cannot benefit, I wrote nothing further. Now, because I understand that my letters are neither ungrateful nor harmful to you, I respond briefly to yours.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have never approved of the variety of doctrine and customs in the church. Nor did it bring us any common envy among adversaries (and indeed deserved!). How often has the doctrine of the Lord's Supper been changed by some! How often have the customs been changed! Therefore, the adversaries shout that nothing is firm or certain among them (the Protestants). I approve of your decision, who think to persevere in the recognized truth and not to change words and customs daily. For we did not learn such vanity and inconstancy from the Gospel! Paul, writing to the Corinthians many years after the Lord's ascension, says: "I delivered to you what I received from the Lord," etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You then ask whether it is considered tolerable among us to bring the Lord's Supper to the sick. It is certainly not accepted among us, nor is it tolerated! We count the carrying of the Supper to the sick among the abuses. For Paul, according to the Lord's tradition, wants the Supper to be celebrated not in corners, but in a frequent assembly. Nor was the Supper brought to the sick among the ancients. We owe that custom to the Antichrist, the Roman Pope, with whom we wish to have nothing in common. It is enough for us if, following the tradition of our Lord Christ and truly our high priest, we meet in the temple or in a public assembly and there celebrate what he handed down to us to celebrate. There is no time to place arguments here that hold us in this opinion. It will be enough for you the simple tradition of the Lord and the observance of the ancient church.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You pray that the Lord may change all the plans of our enemies. But I see that we are sinners, just as you were and are; and the Lord has visited our iniquities. Therefore, it may happen that he visits yours as well. But who can resist the strongest and most just judge? Yet we hope in his mercy, who has neither abandoned our prayers nor us. We will try in every way not to give those who wish us ill just occasions to fight us. But if they want to contend with us altogether and oppress us and our God-given freedom out of innate envy, we will conduct ourselves, invoking God's help, as befits the brave. We would rather fall in battle bravely than servilely and disgracefully submit to the lust of the impious soldier. But if we are not given the opportunity to fight and the enemy wishes to wear us down with delay and expenses and bring us into his power, he will find, God willing, a frugal people who can live with very little among the mountains! He will be forced to make greater expenses and will be less able to bear it than we, who are almost accustomed to labors. He will feel intolerable incursions, so that he will finally be forced to find it more advantageous to engage with us in open battle. When that happens, we hope the Lord will fight for us. By God's grace, we lack nothing of those things that pertain to even a long war. There is the utmost concord among all the Swiss! For whatever religion we may be of, we all agree on this: Victory is from God; he helps those who repent and call upon his name! We all agree on this, that we all wish to endure the utmost for the fatherland! Those who seem to want to follow the opposing side in the imminent danger will be cut down and fall pierced. However, no matter how prepared we are and vigilant, we do not think that the emperor will attempt anything hostile against us. We have the seals of the eagle and the solemnly bound faith of the prince that he will do nothing to harm Switzerland. Indeed, he seeks a new alliance. Meanwhile, we know that we must be perpetually vigilant.</p>

      <p>Pray with all the pious for our church! Farewell. Zurich, August 30, 1547. Your H. Bullinger.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Greet the most excellent man, Martin Frecht, and Johannes Piscatorius, and the other colleagues lovingly. We know what you suffer for the word of Christ. But here he promised us nothing else but the cross. Therefore, be strong in battle! Implore his help! Despise the present, grasp the future! The things in the world are momentary; the heavenly things are eternal. But you do not need consolation, who are trained to console the whole mourning and weeping church of Christ. May the Lord deliver us from evil.</p>
      <p>To the excellent man, Leonhard Soerin, faithful minister of the church of Ulm, esteemed and dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
