      <p>In Christ our Savior, eternal salvation! A few days ago, when I was in London, I wrote a few lines to you, most excellent man, partly because I was pressed for time, partly because I thought you would learn more fully from Stumphius about matters that could greatly concern your dignity. Now, however, since I have more leisure and a more just reason to write to you is provided, I cannot refrain from informing your eminence as soon as possible of those things which I am certain will be pleasing and acceptable to you.</p>
      <p>A few days after Rudolph and Andreas had left here, I met with Cheke, a knight of the royal majesty, and a man who (believe me) is very fond of you, once and again, and I kindly inquired how your book was received by the Duke of Northumberland. He then replied to me in this manner: "I know well, Johannes, that the little gift is most pleasing to the prince; for he has always loved distinguished men, and he has indeed greatly esteemed and loved Bullinger's writings: but so that you may understand more fully how the matter stands, I want you to meet with the prince, or carefully write letters in the sentiment that seems best, which I can present to him in your name when he retires to bed at night. For then he is alone, and less hindered by public affairs; and I am then rightly freed from the king's care." We therefore seize the opportunity to approach the prince skillfully and conveniently. However, free access is never granted.</p>
      <p>So I write letters in the sentiment I was instructed: as soon as the prince read them, he said that your zeal and effort were wonderfully approved by him, and that he would reciprocate with the most benevolent and friendly service towards you, whom he wants you to always consider as having been and to trust will be.</p>
      <p>As for why he has not yet written to you, it is not due to forgetfulness or contempt, but partly due to the expectation of the fulfillment of your promise, which you made kindly to his highness two years ago, and partly due to the management of public duties, which he wants you to believe he is miraculously occupied and distracted by, especially in this dangerous and turbulent time for the republic, during which I do not know if anything more bitter or dangerous has ever existed before. Cheke had indeed intended to write the same to you, for this reason, while I was staying in London for four whole days, when suddenly he was informed that his wife had given birth and was eagerly expecting her husband's arrival.</p>
      <p>He hurriedly left for his wife early in the morning, leaving me these little letters in the hall, which contained nothing but the title of the Earl of Warwick and an excuse for not writing a letter. From these, you will consider, with your wisdom, what is expedient for you to do. I truly judge it best and most pleasing to the prince if you fulfill your promises as soon as possible, that is, honorably dedicate some of your works to his highness. You cannot deny this to the prince, given your humanity; and you will not want the promises you made to be broken. This prince is a man of the highest glory, of the greatest authority, who has deserved well of religion; he is praised by many, revered by the king as a parent: what more? He almost alone, with the Duke of Suffolk, governs the republic, and supports and protects it with his shoulders. He is indeed a thunderbolt and terror to the Papists. The Duke of Somerset, in previous years, when he had granted his sister, the royal majesty, who was miraculously supplicating, permission to attend mass and visit sacrificial charlatans, and did not want to command anything by force; it is said that the Earl of Warwick was gravely displeased with this and said: "The mass is either from God or from the devil. If it is from God, we will equally give all our people the power to kiss it.</p>
      <p>But it is not from God, as we are all taught from the holy scriptures. Why then should this fury not be equally forbidden to all?" Scarcely a year had passed from this exhortation of his. Behold the miserable and calamitous fall of that Duke of Somerset, who is cast down from the highest degree of his dignity, undoubtedly for this very reason, that he was more lenient and remiss in religion than a prince endowed with such power should have been. Therefore, as soon as the Earl of Warwick succeeded to his office, he immediately had Mary's priests dragged to prison, and ensured that both the woman herself and the mass and papist books were universally forbidden to her.</p>
      <p>You should have this form of inscription: "To the most illustrious prince and lord, Sir John Dudley, most powerful Duke of Northumberland, Earl of Warwick, etc., principal counselor and chief of the kingdoms of England, Ireland, and France." Cheke will add little letters to me in this bundle, which our Hyls will collect in London, in whose house I left them. I am certain it will be pleasing and delightful to both of you if you establish a mutual connection through the writing of letters. You are prior in both age and judgment, he is very influential with the king in both learning and favor. I have been excellently recommended by you, and greatly assisted and advanced by him in many ways. Therefore, if no other argument for writing to Cheke occurs, let this be it.</p>
      <p>When my cousins came here in the previous months, he kindly received them twice in the king's hall for a meal for your sake, asking many things about you and Mr. Pellicanus affectionately; he often wished to see either of you in these places. Then he was almost the sole reason that I was admitted to the king's college, with no one interceding for me except Treherne alone, who affirmed that I was recommended to him by you. Most recently, he has firmly promised to bring to an end the cause of Alexander, begun by Huperus, for your sake with the Earl of Warwick. However, the excellent young man will expect no fruits of your recommendation until you fulfill your promises to the prince: for then his matter can be accomplished of its own accord, with your dignity intact, and also with Alexander's honor preserved. You will ask nothing from Cheke, but only make it known that we have not been ungrateful or forgetful to either of you. You can honorably remember Alexander's father in your letter to him, and say that it is pleasing to you that he has kindly offered his zeal and effort to the son of a most distinguished man for your sake.</p>
      <p>While I was writing this, behold, a constant and certain rumor has now spread that the Duke of Somerset was brought to the Parliament house four days ago from prison, and examined before a very large crowd. There were twelve judges, the chief of whom was the Duke of Suffolk. He is first said to have been accused of treason against the royal majesty, then of murder, which he attempted against the Duke of Northumberland and the other counselors.</p>
      <p>They say the first charge was excellently refuted by him; but they affirm he was convicted of the second and condemned to the gallows according to the law. The Earl of Warwick, noticing the severe and sad expression of the entire people over this matter, exclaimed in the middle of the assembly from his seat: "O Prince of Somerset, you see that you have been brought to the utmost danger of life, and nothing but death has been adjudged to you. I once took care to have you freed from a similar danger of life; I will not cease to wish you well, although you may not believe it much. I think you should appeal to the royal majesty's mercy; I do not doubt that it will be favorable to you. As for me, I will gladly forgive you everything, and do my utmost to ensure that mercy is granted to your life."</p>
      <p>Therefore, Somerset appealed to the king, and asked him to remember the dangers and labors he had often endured for the country. The best and most holy king, with his humanity, is said to have immediately shown himself easy and persuadable to his uncle, and restored him to his former favor with the Earl of Warwick. And in this way, all rejoice and are glad that these princes have been reconciled. However, he is not yet completely freed, but has been handed over to custody again for a certain and prescribed time.</p>
      <p>So much for this. You will learn much about Huperus from Stumphius, and these few things from me. A few days ago, when he was accused by some of being a severe judge towards commoners and tavern-goers, but lenient and indulgent towards nobles, he said, "Brothers, I would like you to first bring forth any noble whom you can prove with certain witnesses to have been caught in fornication or adultery: if I do not make you understand that I judge equally against all, let me be punished with the extreme penalty of death." A few days later, it happened that Anthony Kingston, a knight of great renown, was accused of adultery before Huperus. Huperus summoned him; the knight first refused to come, but finally persuaded by the hope of impunity, I think, he approached the bishop, from whom, when he was more severely reproached, he struck him in the face in the sight of the people, and gravely insulted him with reproaches. Huperus reported the whole matter to the magistrate. The counselors immediately summoned the man to them, and treated him in such a way that it would have been better for him to endure anything else than the punishment imposed on him by the magistrate; for he was immediately fined five hundred pounds, and handed over to Huperus to be dealt with according to custom and usage, which is the most disgraceful and shameful kind of punishment.</p>
      <p>The last thing will be that you fulfill your promises to the Earl of Warwick as soon as possible; then write to John Cheke.</p>
      <p>Finally, include the letters written to them in mine. They will never be with each other, so they are torn apart. The letter from the duke's daughter, which you sent recently, was completely ruined with ink. Therefore, I would like you to always include them in mine. I will send you more and, as I hope, more pleasing things in my next letters. Peter Martyr will do everything according to your will. He diligently instructed me to write greetings in his name to you and the other ministers of the church. Oxford, the day before the Nones of December, 1551.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your eminence, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>The books of Peter Martyr have not yet been delivered, nor is there any hope of recovering them soon.</p>
      <p>For God's sake, take care of the letters well when you send them back. There is no other way than to place them in mine.</p>
      <p>Make the seal firm, so that no one can get over it. To the most learned and distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
