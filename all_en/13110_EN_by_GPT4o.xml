    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enclosed is the monster brought forth by Theobald Thamer [Thamer's 28 Theses against the Doctrine of Justification], which he has long incubated! An even greater number of such monsters would appear if he had not been forbidden. In sending this, Happel is not concerned with further damaging the presumably already tarnished reputation of this madman in Zurich. Rather, the people of Zurich should be able to see where Thamer's zeal for novelties, allegorical and sophistical explanations, his contentiousness, arrogance, and ambition, indeed his contempt for the old and new Church Fathers, leads. There is already enough to deal with from the attacks of the [Catholic] opponents. Now they also receive help from traitors who, like that [Herostratus] (who set fire to the Temple of Diana [Artemis in Ephesus]), want to become famous and court the favor of the opponent, as they realize that they have no place among the sincere scholars due to their delusion!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] What will happen with this Thamer is still unclear. In aggressive and venomous sermons, he defended his view and brought the teachings of his colleagues into disrepute. Consequently, such sermons were forbidden to him by the competent judicial authority in Marburg, and he had to promise to refrain from them in the future. Yet, he later said in a sermon that despite the chatter of his colleagues, he could believe nothing else; he was not obliged to anyone, neither Luther nor the wording of the Augsburg Confession; but since some were of the opinion that he preached nonsense, while others claimed he was not in his right mind, he wanted to resign his position until the Lord restored his understanding; in the meantime, his listeners should look for a better preacher, unless he was allowed to preach according to the inspirations of the Holy Spirit and in accordance with his conscience. He said this without having previously consulted with the landgrave and the city council and only to make his colleagues hated by the uneducated people (among whom he is considered very pious due to his hypocrisy), which he succeeded in doing. He also accused them of having given him cause to preach again about his views a week later. According to the fears of some, it almost led to a riot. He did all this without being prompted by his superiors, whether by his superintendent [Adam Krafft] or the councils who had hired him and could have authorized him alone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] To give the impression that he was right, he planned what he considered an important disputation and posted his theses on the doors of the [University] Church on a holiday. In a sermon, he expressed his will to win and declared that he no longer intended to resign lightly under pressure from his colleagues. Three days later, the printer [Andreas Kolbe] was prohibited from further selling the theses, and Thamer was summoned by the landgrave's councils to Kassel and asked to abandon the planned disputation and also his view. He replied that he could not act against his conscience unless he was forcibly prevented. Thus, the Hessian chancellor [Tilemann Günterode] forbade him from lecturing and preaching. In Kassel, he advocated for a trip to Wittenberg, where he wanted to discuss his view with Philipp Melanchthon, as if the latter's views were not clearly enough laid out in his writings! He probably did this to appease the Hessian councils or then to avoid experiencing the disgrace [of the teaching and preaching ban] in his presence thanks to this trip. May the church and school of Marburg be freed from this restless and impudent man and peace return!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Otherwise, Happel has nothing to report, except that he earnestly asks Bullinger to ensure that the [Johannes and Justus Vulteius] from Wetter, who are studying in Zurich, are paid the amount as soon as possible that the [four] Zurich students [who studied in Marburg] borrowed from Happel and other friends of theirs (Happel has a written record of these debts and would like to expedite the repayment of the borrowed amounts). The people from Wetter should then confirm the receipt of this money with a letter addressed to Happel or Johannes Pincier. The letter should be sent to Martin Bucer, who can forward it promptly and without much effort. It is also conceivable that the Hessian students or Bullinger could certify in writing that the former are gradually being paid the amounts of money they requested. This way, Happel could finally redeem the money he advanced [from the family of the two from Wetter], as he is in dire need of it. Johannes Fabricius Montanus owes 21 florins, 10 batzen, and 1 white penny; the deceased Heinrich Hindermann 16 florins and 8 batzen; Karl Schweninger 20 florins and 4 1/2 batzen; Hans Rudolf Funk 15 florins, 12 batzen, and 1 white penny. In total: 74 florins (each with 15 batzen), 4 1/2 batzen, and 2 white pennies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also to Bullinger's family and to all whom Happel met in Zurich.</p>

      <p>S. Behold, I send you this monstrous offspring of our Theobald, which he has long been in labor with, but has now finally brought to light. He would have brought forth even more of such if he had not been prohibited. I send it not to diminish the reputation of this foolish man, if he has any with you, but so that you may know where this zeal for novelties, allegories, sophistry, and contentiousness (Streitsucht), contempt for the ancient and recent Church Fathers, immoderate ambition and arrogance, and envy lead. As if it were not enough that our religion is attacked by adversaries openly, we must also help them with our new inventions, just as the one who set fire to the temple of Diana, to make ourselves known, as if to open a path to their favor, when we see that our madness has no place among sincere scholars.</p>

      <p>What will become of him is not yet clear. In several sermons, he has fiercely, not to say rabidly, agitated this cause, openly attacking the doctrine of his fellow believers, so much so that he was forbidden to do so by the assessors of our δικαστηρίου (court) and was forced to promise with a pledged hand that he would not do it anymore. However, he later said in a sermon that he could not believe otherwise, no matter what others babbled; he was not bound to any man, nor had he sworn or wished to swear to the words of Luther or the Augsburg Confession. However, because he had heard others say that he preached about pitchforks (that is, von mistgabeln), and others assert that he was of a disturbed mind, he said he wanted to resign from the office of preaching until the Lord restored and composed his mind; in the meantime, the best listeners should look for a better preacher; unless he was allowed to preach what his spirit, indeed the spirit of God, and his conscience dictated, he would not want to serve the ministry of the word any longer! He did all this without first consulting about his will with our senate and magistrate, at least to bring his colleagues of the same office into disrepute with the unlearned people (whom he sought to have as the most devoted with hypocrisy) - which happened. For it was almost a sedition (which some feared) or rather envy against the remaining preachers, who urged him to preach again eight days later. And he did so, not called by his legitimate magistrate, such as his bishop, or those lords who had previously hired him or in whose power this was.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>And to seem to think rightly, he arranged this disputation (affixing it to the church doors on a feast day), as if it were a difficult matter, and boasted in a sermon that he would dispute with his adversaries and wanted to win the prize; he would not lightly desert the ministry because of them. But three days later, the printer was forbidden to sell those copies any longer, and he was called to Kassel and asked by the prince's councilors to abandon that disputation and new opinion, and to preach in accordance with the Augsburg Confession. He replied that he could only do so against his conscience and would not do it unless prohibited. Therefore, as I hear, he was forbidden by the prince's vicar from public lectures and sermons; and he is in Kassel under the pretext that he wants to go to Wittenberg to confer with Philipp, as if his opinion were not clearly enough explained in his writings! But I suspect that he is there either to reconcile with the councilors or because he is going to Wittenberg to avoid some disgrace here. But whatever the case, may the Lord grant that our school and church be freed from such a restless, petulant, and arrogant spirit, and grant us peace and concord of faith through his beloved son! Amen.</p>

      <p>Besides, there is nothing to write, except to earnestly ask your humanity to ensure that the money owed to me by your people is paid to our young men from Wetter as soon as possible (either to me or to their friends, that is; that they write down what they have received, so that I can in turn honestly urge the payment here), for I am not without loss and trouble for lacking it so long. I wish that letters to me or Pincier from Mr. Bucer would be delivered. Here, he could send them to us shortly and conveniently. Fabricius owes 21 florins, 10 batzen, 1 white penny; the late Opysander 16 florins, 8 batzen; Charles Schweininger 20 florins, 4 batzen; Rudolf Funck 15 florins, 12 batzen, 1 white penny. Total: 74 florins (at 15 batzen) and 4 batzen, 2 white pennies. I ask that this sum be given to those young men, or at least that they or you testify in writing to me or Pincier that they will receive it wherever they wish, so that I can be paid here.</p>

      <p>Farewell with your whole family and all good and learned men, with whom I once had acquaintance and familiarity. Yours, H.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed friend and teacher. Zurich.</p>
