      <p>C[aelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter to you, venerable brother, is Nikolaus Mora, who stands out both in nobility and piety among the foremost of this region of the Rhaetians and the church restored by the gospel of Christ. He has some business in Zürich, but above all, he desires to see you and greet you respectfully. I do not write this because I doubt your kindness in embracing such men, but so that with this letter of mine, I might open the way for him to you, as he himself says, and so that you might understand what kind of man he is. From him, you will learn about my affairs and also about the state of this church. I wrote to you recently through another; I am expecting a response if you have not given it to that messenger. I would like you to keep what I wrote in that letter to yourself, although there was no need to remind you, such a man, friend, and brother. Farewell. May God grant that I may see you again soon. The brothers who are with us send their greetings. Chiavenna, September 3, 1553.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zürich church, lord and brother in the Lord to be respected. In Zürich.</p>
