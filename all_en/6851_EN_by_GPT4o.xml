      <p>Greetings. Just as there was a great variety of opinions among the Jews about Christ, the Son of God, when He lived among mortals on earth, so too, following your response to our brothers, which our superintendents, without your knowledge, have published in Latin and English, many opinions about you, His sworn and faithful disciple and minister, have recently arisen among those who profess the reformed religion among us, and various people have different views about you. May God grant that you have not willingly given our people any just cause for suspecting you wrongly, so that all may interpret your response with the same spirit in which you wrote it. However others may feel about you, I am fully convinced that if you had inadvertently fallen into any error in a human manner, you would, if kindly and humanely admonished, willingly acknowledge your error and gladly confess its occasion. But so that you may better and more fully defend yourself against what is alleged against you, relying on your usual and well-known candor, I will briefly report the opinions of our people about you. There are those who think that our Samaritans, who are lame in both knees (for we have many more of these than sincere evangelicals), have suggested many things to you contrary to the truth; and indeed, that they have been the authors or at least the persuaders for you to direct all your attacks against our poor preachers, while ignoring the vices of our chief ministers and others, who, because of the prospect of a donkey, have stripped so many learned and pious pastors of all dignities and thrown them into prisons, and exposed the flock of Christ defenseless to wolves, Papists, Lutherans, Sadducees, and Herodians. There are some who boldly assert that in your response there are many things that not only clearly contradict your own previously published books but also the writings of all evangelical pastors. There are even some among us who think of you, the most learned in all of Europe and with the best understanding of the entire Christian doctrine, the same as the Saxon preachers thought of their teacher Philipp Melanchthon; who, when Charles V attempted to impose interimistic and adiaphoristic impieties on all the reformed churches in Germany, defected to the interimists and adiaphorists with great loss of Christian liberty and truth (as they themselves testify in published writings), and later, with all fear set aside, returned to a better mind.</p>
      <p>Those who think most highly of you defend you in this way. They say that you thought nothing less than that your response, printed in Latin and English, would be spread among the public; that it was sent to our brothers, the most learned men, not with the intention of defining or establishing doctrines, but for the sake of literary exercise. But since it is beyond all controversy that many good men have been gravely offended by it now being published, I judge it advisable, both to remove scandals and to assert the truth, which you have bravely, piously, and diligently defended in so many published books, and to vindicate it from suspicion of falsehood, that you should testify openly and clearly, with all fear set aside, in some published booklet, whether you think that princes or ecclesiastical prelates, whom you call chief ministers, can, without offense to Christian liberty and manifest injury to the church, impose certain prescribed vestments and similar ceremonies, whether borrowed from pagans, transferred from the Levitical law, or invented or approved by the pope and used to foster idolatry, on the unwilling pastors of churches under penalty of deprivation and imprisonment.</p>
      <p>I have therefore written to you more boldly, so that you may have a clearer understanding of my mind towards you, while I wish your reputation to be safe and intact, and your doctrine free from all suspicion of error. July 23, 1566.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Yours, William Turner, physician, not averse to the reading of divine literature.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Heinrich Bullinger, his uncommon friend.</p>
