    <p xml:id="regest1">Had his newborn son baptized with the names Johann Heinrich, as he chose Bullinger and his brother Johannes as godparents, and recommends him to Bullinger's care. Mayor Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl was with a Bernese delegation at the king in France to, as it is said, obtain help from him against the Five Places. The reformed parish priests of Solothurn are said to have lost their positions. Thanks Bullinger for his diverse help and intends to come to the next synod in Zurich. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen, and a most happy and prosperous year to you and your entire household, esteemed teacher and honored godfather.</p>
      <p>On the twenty-first day of September last year, around the third hour of the night, my wife bore me a son, whom two honorable men lifted from the baptismal font in your name and that of your brother. Therefore, he is called Johann Heinrich according to your names. In this, I wished to express my trust, favor, friendship, and indeed my entire hope in you and your brother as a means assigned to me by God and bestowed in this world, so that in the future, if I were to depart from this world, my son would have a second father, teacher, and guardian in you alone, whom I commend to you, etc.</p>
      <p>The Mayor of Bern, Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl, with a banner and others, sought the King of France, which few knew, and has returned, and it is rumored that he sought help from the king against the cantons that strive to uproot the gospel, as is the talk among us and what is publicly acknowledged.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the people of Solothurn are constructing walls and building fortifications. Also, the evangelical preachers in the countryside have already been deprived and removed from their benefices and offices by the time of the Nativity festival. The majority of them have flocked to the lords of Bern. From this side, it is feared that my expectation with them has been acted upon.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I await your protection at its appropriate time. Finally, I am always mindful of your benefits bestowed upon me. I wish to express infinite thanks for them. May our God, who is the rewarder of all good things, strengthen and preserve you in your best purpose. With God's guidance, I will come to you at the next synod to be celebrated.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and please convey my greetings to Mr. Wernher Steyner, Leon, Doctor Carolstadt, and your entire family. Farewell again and write back, so that I may receive consolation from your letters.</p>
      <p>Given at Zofingen, the last day of December in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Distel.</p>
      <p>To the learned and faithful Master Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed teacher of the church in Zurich, etc.</p>
