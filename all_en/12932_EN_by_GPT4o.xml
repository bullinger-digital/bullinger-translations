    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The fact that Happel can only write briefly is due to the circumstances of the time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Herewith, these three [correctly: two] young people [Johannes and Justus Vulteius] from Wetter are recommended to the people of Zurich. One of the two receives a scholarship: Happel contributes twenty florins, and Johannes Pincier, or rather the brother [Eucharius] of Johannes Dryander, contributes nine more thalers. The latter had lent nine thalers to the [Zurich students] Johannes Fabricius Montanus and Hans Rudolf Funk in Leipzig. The people of Zurich should demand this amount back from Fabricius and Funk and give it to the scholarship holder. The money that the two other [Zurich students, Heinrich Hindermann and Karl Schweninger] still owe Happel should be gradually reclaimed from them, and the scholarship holder should only spend it for necessary and justifiable purposes. For the collected money, Happel should be issued a promissory note, which the people of Zurich should send to him, so that he can in turn send back the promissory note for the money he lent [to Hindermann and Schweninger]. Pincier will have written more extensively about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Prudence forbids writing about news. The people of Zurich will likely hear it from the mouth of the letter carriers. It is known that the Bohemians are completely on the side of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. It was further reported that the Elector defeated an army of 600 horsemen and seven companies in the region of Joachimsthal. It is also said that the army raised in Westphalia against Hesse fled when it became known that Landgrave Philipp of Hesse was preparing. The Landgrave has indeed awakened from a deep and long sleep. He is planning a new campaign and is happily recruiting everywhere. There should be enough money if those who have promised it actually keep their promise. May the Lord lead everything for the best.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Hessians commend themselves to the prayers of the people of Zurich. Bullinger should prompt Dr. Konrad Gessner to send Happel plant seeds from abroad. In return, Happel will assist him whenever possible.</p>

      <p>The fact that I write negligently and briefly, you will attribute to the injury and brevity of time, which has compelled me to dispatch myself with brevity.</p>

      <p>We send to you and commend these three good young veterans and ask you to be kind to them. One is a scholarship holder, to whom I ask you to count, in my name, twenty florins for necessary and honest matters, and in the name of our Pincier, or rather the brother of Dryander, nine thalers, which this good man lent to Fabricius and Funk in Leipzig, from whom you will reclaim that money and give it to the scholarship holder. To the other two young men, you will distribute the remaining money (which is owed to me) over time, and that too only for necessary and honest matters. From both, receive a promissory note in the name of acceptance and send it to me, and in return, I will send back the promissory note of your young men that is with me. But about this matter, I think our Pincier has written to you more diligently.</p>

      <p>It is not convenient to report on new matters, which I would like, and you will hear everything, I think, from our young men. It is known that the Bohemians support the Elector with all their might. It was recently reported to us that he again defeated six hundred horsemen and seven banners, as they call them, of foot soldiers in the Joachim Valley. It is well known that the soldiers gathered in Westphalia fled to our ruin and destruction when they learned that our prince was in arms. We all rejoice that our excellent prince has finally awakened from a deep and long sleep after the greatest labors and is planning a new expedition, recruiting troops everywhere. We have enough money or the sinews of war, if those who promised us keep their faith (as we trust). May the Lord turn the omen for the good!</p>

      <p>Farewell all of you and keep us commended in your prayers. You will ask Dr. Gessner, the most humane and learned man, in my words, that if he acquires or has any foreign seeds, he may deign to grant me some. In return, I will do what I can to provide him with service. Hastily from Marburg, April 18, 1547. Your Excellency and humanity's most devoted Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most revered lord and teacher.</p>
