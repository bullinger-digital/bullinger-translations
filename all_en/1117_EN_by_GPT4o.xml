      <p>I now send to you, most illustrious Bullinger, a matter (in my opinion) of great importance, and you will also consider it the same (if I know you well), and see how opportunely God has extracted these words from the mouths of our enemies, precisely at the time when we should be more cautious of their plots.</p>
      <p>I write the truth, do not doubt. I have a book with me, which is also circulating through Italy, and it is plainly true that it was approved by the Pope. Now it will be your task to publish everywhere this very thing that the architects of the Council of Trent are plotting. For truly they have in mind what you see written here. Also translate it into your language and, as I said, diligently warn all the brothers about this matter. I wrote to you eight days ago and gave an account of all my affairs, and at the same time sent 20 copies of a certain history, which is worth knowing. I strongly desire to return to you, especially for the cause of the council. I will make an effort to be able to leave here soon.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell and greetings to all the brothers. Pray for me. In Chiavenna, December 20, 1550.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
