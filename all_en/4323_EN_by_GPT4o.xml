      <p>Philipp, by the grace of God, Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc.</p>
      <p>Our gracious greetings beforehand.</p>
      <p>Worthy and well-learned, dear special one, what Duke Christoph of Württemberg has been written by some Jena theologians and has sent to us, of which, also what we have answered to Duke Christoph of Württemberg, we enclose copies herewith, in which you will find all sorts of writings of the Jena theologians and especially, that you are also mentioned, and that the Jena theologians cannot let the pious Philipp rest, even though he is dead, but secretly attack him, etc. We graciously request that you read such writings of the Jena theologians and provide an answer, as far as it concerns you and others in the Oberland, as you see fit, and send it to us. We intend to give the same to Duke Johann Friedrich of Saxony, the Jena theologians' lords, and to other places where it is useful, also to the Elector of Saxony. We also think it is not inappropriate that you write to the Duke of Württemberg and provide a good and necessary report on this matter. We wish to inform you of this and request your answer and remain graciously inclined towards you.</p>
      <p>Dated Komrach on the 20th of June in the year of our Lord 1560.</p>
      <p>Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, etc. signed.</p>
      <p>Also, dear special one, if you have any certain news from France or elsewhere, we would like to know it. We graciously request, therefore, that whatever news you have on this matter, you let us know. Dated as in the letters.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and highly learned, our dear special Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
