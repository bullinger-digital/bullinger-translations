      <p>God's grace and all good things, along with my friendly greetings and all willingness to serve, be with you above all, dear lord and father. Your letter, dated the 15th of this current month, has reached me along with the enclosed new tidings.</p>
      <p>I hereby express to you my high and great thanks for sharing them with me. And although it is also my duty to write to you about new tidings, there are no such new tidings with us, except that it is said by some (though I do not know for certain) that much is being discussed about the jewels and the sons of Lord Admiral (of pious memory) who have descended to Milan and whose sons are supposed to be sold to the sea, although others say the opposite. Therefore, it is my very friendly request to you, my kind and dear lord, that if anything concerning the matter or what has happened with the merchants' goods comes to you, you would share it with me; for what is being said about these goods and the journey to France, the bearer of this letter will be able to report to you well.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated the 19th of April, in the year 1575, in Glarus. Your ever willing servant, Matthias Bachofen.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, learned lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, servant of the Church of Zurich, my dear lord and brother. Zurich.</p>
