      <p>My entire willing service beforehand. Especially favorable dear Master Heinrich, an urgent matter concerning a proposed marriage has compelled me to write to Your Honor and to earnestly request through this messenger (who knows nothing of the matter and should not know anything) to inform me whether in your ecclesiastical court those who are related in the third degree of blood, that is, whose grandfathers were bodily brothers or whose grandmothers were bodily sisters, are allowed to marry each other or are permitted to have each other; likewise, whether the common Confederates or at least the Christian orders of the Confederacy have decided and agreed among themselves not to allow marriage in the second and third degree without significant and important reasons; as I have been informed that this is supposed to have happened and our preachers know otherwise. I ask you to inform me clearly and in German; for my son-in-law Laurenz Zollikofer's sister Rosina is engaged to one of our citizens and has been persuaded to marry him; but she is not over 17 years old and everything has happened behind the backs of the brothers and the closest relatives, and all for the sake of the vile goods; for she has six and a half thousand guilders of paternal and inherited goods.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my lords have forbidden both parties under severe penalty to proceed further with words or deeds until further notice. And the matter is entirely displeasing to our church servants, and therefore I have also been asked to learn about this from you. And yet everything is quiet for now; for the opposing party is also a great friendship and very well related to me. However, it seems to me neither fair nor honorable that such close members should be bound together in marriage due to the temptation of devilish greed. Whatever good I can prove to Your Honor, I am willing to do.</p>
      <p>Given at St. Gallen, on Thursday, in the year 1549. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>Do not tell Alexius about these letters, that they are mine; but open and read and respond to yours, likewise enclosed in the cover and addressed to my son-in-law, who pretends to send them from Augsburg. However, I denied that I would write now.</p>
