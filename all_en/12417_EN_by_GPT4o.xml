    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Blarer's wife [Katharina, née Ryff] only returned from Balingen the day before, Blarer unfortunately could not extend the proper hospitality to the promising [Johannes] Wolf, but he hopes to make up for this at a later date.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Even more eagerly than Bullinger, Blarer awaits news from his brother [Thomas] about the [Schmalkaldic Diet] in Frankfurt. [Thomas] has promised to write to Bullinger [No. 2384].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- At the request of Theodor [Bibliander], Bullinger should manage the money from [Konrad] Hofherr. Hofherr should not do this himself. Blarer will write to Bibliander regarding this. Precise bookkeeping is important so that Hofherr's prodigality does not harm others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Blarer will soon return Bullinger's writing "De sacramentis".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- He thanks God that [Agathe] Studler endured her execution with a Christian spirit.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- It is reported from Augsburg that Luther has died, that the [Second Regensburg] religious discussions have been annulled by the Council of Trent, and the colloquents have been summoned to Trent to obey the council's decrees.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [Georg] Frölich reports that [Johannes] Haller has returned well with his family to Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse writes [to Konstanz] about a new war that Emperor [Charles V] and others are planning. [Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle has responded so contradictorily to a letter from the Landgrave on this matter that he senses trouble. The Emperor is arming himself; allegedly he wants to attack [Arch]bishop [Hermann of Wied]. Granvelle has written to the Landgrave that the Emperor is not arming against the Protestants, which arouses suspicion. [This is to be believed], especially when one sees how the Emperor is dealing with the Archbishop to dissuade him from his [reformation plans]!</p>

      <p>S. It greatly pains me that we could not extend any courtesies to that very promising and learned young man, Johannes Wolf. My wife was away from home and only returned from Balingen yesterday, so unless I wanted to treat him very poorly, I could not invite him to our table. I hope there will be another opportunity to make up for this unfortunate situation.</p>

      <p>You eagerly await my letters, in which I would clearly inform you about what happened in Frankfurt. I am even more eagerly awaiting news from my brother Thomas, urging him to carefully narrate everything to me. He recently promised to write to you about certain key points of the entire affair; I keep reminding him to do so. I believe you will soon receive this information directly from him.</p>

      <p>Through Curio, I beseech you to manage the money as our Theodor Bibliander advised. I absolutely do not want Curio to be so careless and act as his own guardian. I will write about this to Theodor in the next message. It is very important that his accounts can be properly reconciled with Herbrot, so that his negligence (or should I say extravagance?) does not harm others and thus we do not err against public interests.</p>

      <p>Your book will soon be returned to you. You can expect it with peace of mind.</p>

      <p>We rightfully admire and cherish the Lord's immense mercy, as Agathe Studler endured her punishment with a Christian spirit and faith in Christ, overcoming it. Where sin abounded, He wanted His greater love and grace to abound even more over all sins.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>It is consistently reported from Augsburg that Luther has died, that the religious discussions in Regensburg have been annulled by the Council of Trent, and the colloquents have been summoned to Trent to hear the council's decree.</p>

      <p>Georg Frölich writes that Johannes Haller has returned safely with his family to Augsburg, etc.</p>

      <p>Landgrave Philip of Hesse writes to us about new wars that Emperor Charles V and others are seriously and entirely planning. Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, responded to some of the Landgrave's letters on this matter with such ambiguity that our people suspect some kind of trouble that our adversaries are nurturing with the Emperor. The Emperor is somewhat arming himself; it is believed that he intends to attack Archbishop Hermann of Wied. Granvelle has written to Hesse that the Emperor is not arming against the Protestants, which immediately raises suspicion. This is especially evident in the dealings with the Archbishop, as he is not eager; he has tried everything with the Bishop to dissuade him from his reformation plans. March 6, 1546.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, my venerable and very dear brother. Zurich.</p>
