      <p>S. Yesterday, our Joshua, the priest from Elcko, delivered your letter to me, which you wrote on June 5th, complaining that you had no other messenger at hand. However, he delivered it amidst my utmost occupations, as many other guests needed to be greeted and received by me, so I cannot now, as I would very much like, write everything to you as I wish.</p>
      <p>To our Calvin, the incomparable servant of Christ Jesus and most chosen instrument, I wholeheartedly congratulate on this blessed transition into heavenly rest after so many labors endured and his entrance into the joys of his Lord; now he has escaped all troubles. Meanwhile, I am exceedingly afraid that you too, lest these are omens of greater evils.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, my dearest nephew Heinrich from Ulm returned, firmly asserting that everything is calm in Venice and Italy. My relative Schär writes in these words, and that yesterday: In Württemberg it is quiet, and it seems a spark could ignite, and Hannibal von Emß has sent a servant to Trient; but immediately thereafter, the imperial majesty has issued a mandate in their hereditary lands, especially also in the Hochberg region, which borders Württemberg, that no one should allow subjects to be drawn to any foreign potentates and that the instigators should be dealt with, as indeed some of them have been apprehended, etc. He also writes that he will further procure a French catechism of Brentius for you. He has not been home for several weeks and found my letters concerning these matters only after his return; otherwise, he would have sent them now, as he also traveled through Tübingen. He sends you many, many services and all good things.</p>
      <p>Regarding the colloquy at Maulbronn, he mentioned that the Württembergers, after they returned home, have been completely quiet (yet each party has rights as before), but the Count Palatine is completely immovable. I have also received a letter from Augsburg and with it a copy of a command from the king to his court preacher, etc., send it back to me; likewise, a letter to our dear lord Dr. Rudolf Gwalther, which you will ensure is delivered to him, but not without my added and wished-for greeting, which I pray for a solid and eternal one for my singular friend.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to your holy and perpetual prayers before the Lord. The widow, whom you recommended, I have dutifully recommended to the praetor Huser with your note given to him, and I wish it is not too late; but yesterday I received everything first and would have completed it sooner if I had known earlier. Farewell, my venerable, dearest brother in Christ Jesus and most esteemed lord, with your entire household and all brothers and friends. All of mine greet you very reverently and lovingly, my brother with his sons, my sister with hers, and our entire family, a good part of whom are now with me. May the Lord preserve you for us as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Leutmerken, June 13, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, a friend in every way supreme.</p>
