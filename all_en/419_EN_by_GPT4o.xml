      <p>To God alone be the glory.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, January 28, 1549.</p>
      <p>Greetings and peace. I cannot sufficiently admire, dear friend and most esteemed master Bullinger, the negligence of some of your people, not to say their hateful sloth, who are so negligent in sending letters. I gave letters to the son of the old Binder to my close friend John Hooper: I also gave other letters to someone with a crippled hand, another of your citizens, a weaver by trade, if I am not mistaken, who now sells cloth here, to the same Hooper; in which, as there was no leisure, I included English letters sent to me from there, which I wanted him to share with you. Six days ago, I also wrote letters from here towards Basel to a certain citizen, Valentin Nu√üboum, to which I attached my letters written to your kindness, which I earnestly requested him to safely transmit to you. I also attached English letters to yours, which I entrusted to Mr. Hooper for translation. If none of these have reached you, it will be a misfortune, which I will avenge with the present ones: for I will briefly touch upon whatever is contained there.</p>
      <p>And at the beginning, the English letters written by us and sent by the crippled man contain this. Our king, in the month of September or October, sent several ships prepared to Scotland, to carry supplies to the workers and soldiers, who were attempting to build a castle as a garrison for some port (which they had seized by force) to prevent the enemy from entering. After the soldiers and sailors arrived there, they disembarked from the ships and attempted to capture a nearby city, named Dobar.</p>
      <p>However, at the first assault, when they were thinking of fleeing, they were recalled by the courage of their leaders; for about thirty of our men were killed, which caused the flight. Therefore, having tried the fortune of war a second time; the leader of the city was killed, and the rest, both citizens and soldiers, fled, leaving the city empty. Thus, our men took possession of it.</p>
      <p>But when they saw that it was not sufficiently fortified, and learned that a substantial Scottish army would arrive the next day, they took the spoils, demolished the walls, and set the city on fire, alas! Having thus successfully accomplished the task, they returned safely to their own people and ships with a great amount of gold, silver, and furniture, as well as a large herd of cattle, sheep, and horses. With this defeat, the Scots, having sent envoys, as it is believed, began to negotiate peace.</p>
      <p>And these were contained in the first letters: the second ones were about religious matters, how a three-day debate was held by four bishops; namely, the Archbishop of Canterbury and another doctor named Pfarher on the side of the gospel, and the Bishops of Worcester and Westminster on the side of the papists. However, nothing has yet been decided, nor is there any public preaching.</p>
      <p>But since I hope you will receive the same, I pass over the rest. However, I thought it not to be omitted, this one thing and truly wise response of our young king to the protector. After the debate was over, the protector approached the king in amazement, saying; "The Bishop of Westminster has greatly disappointed my expectations!" "He may have disappointed yours," he said, "but never mine."</p>
      <p>When the protector inquired more diligently into the reason, the king said, "I never expected anything else from him, but that he would smell of the Interim, who has been an envoy at the Emperor's court for so long, and that in this age." Certainly a worthy response from a young king, which I thought should not be kept silent.</p>
      <p>But to come to Richard, he asks that you kindly excuse his delay, as he will write at leisure. Business matters and absence from London still hindered him. For at the very first entry, he did not dare to go there with his wife and children because of the plague, which was raging there, and now he is entirely occupied with arranging his house. I ask that you commend me as diligently as possible to Mr. Hooper and Mr. Butler. Our Strasbourg remains as before. May the Lord grant that it becomes long-lasting and perpetual!</p>
      <p>John a Lasco was in England; I have received nothing from my people about his departure or death, which Richard would certainly not have kept silent about. Gabriel the tanner also reports that he has heard nothing similar. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours, John Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, residing by the Minster. Zurich.</p>
