    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommended Rudolf Gwalther to Capito; the latter is willing to take him under his wing. The letter bearers are advocates of the Waldensians; he considers their doctrine to be unobjectionable and asks for support of their cause. Minden has been placed under the ban; this could mean war. His house is affected by the plague.</p>

      <p>I have sent Rudolf Gwalther to Strasbourg; I have recommended him to Capito, who replied that he will most diligently show the young man, who has a liberal and pleasant disposition, whatever service and kindness he can.</p>
      <p>Here again are those whom you see in person, in the name of the Waldensians; you will hear from them how they are oppressed by tyranny. We have seen here their doctrines, which certainly do not deviate from Christ, and therefore it seems, for the sake of the Lord, as charity commands, that they should be assisted. They certainly need your efforts with that senate; here, I ask you to show yourself a faithful brother. I am brief, because you will learn everything in detail from these messengers. You will therefore have their cause most highly recommended. You may perhaps know that the judgment of the chamber has deprived Minden, a city of the evangelical league, of public peace; if not, take note. War is feared. The princes are consulting on what needs to be done; after this consultation, something will be done. My house is affected by the plague. Therefore, pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, the last day of October in the year 38.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his esteemed lord in Christ.</p>
