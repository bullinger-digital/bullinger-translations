    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller's friendship with Bullinger remains unchanged. He responds to Bullinger's latest letter. Description of the process of a visitation in the eight chapters of the Bernese countryside. Negotiations of the pastors with the council about the punishment of the Anabaptists in Bern. The clergy urges the elimination of the grievances in church and state as the actual causes of Anabaptism and demands equal treatment for Anabaptists and Papists; Haller encloses their opinion and asks for the opinion of the Zurichers. Haller cannot provide the copies of the documents requested by Bullinger about the wars led by Bern since the Reformation; some are no longer available, others are hardly released by the council, some may become accessible if Valerius [Anshelm] uses them for his chronicle; he has already reached the year 1519. Bullinger should send the Bernese not only a summary but the full text of the Zurich Confession of the Lord's Supper. The Bernese are suspicious of new unclear formulations that aim at agreement with Luther but endanger unity among the Reformed. Haller critically discusses the most important points and notes tendencies towards Lutheranism. He also wrote to Ambrosius Blarer, about whom there is a rumor that he has recanted and accepted a Catholic and Lutheran doctrine of the Lord's Supper. Haller is waiting for Bullinger's commentary on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians and Leo Jud's Passion story. Advocacy for the Bernese teacher Peter [...]. Greetings. He got along well with Otto Brunfels, who is on his deathbed.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Why do you doubt your Berchtold, dearest Heinrich? How could the suspicion ever arise in your mind that my feelings towards you have changed, when I have long trusted and opened myself to you as to no other mortal? I was expecting your letters both at our Martinmas fair, where Christoph Froschauer, our bookseller, had announced he would be present, and also from your envoy Heinrich Ron, through whom I had planned to conveniently respond, which the business of the chapters had so far prevented. But behold, unexpectedly, someone arrives who brings letters from you.</p>
      <p>First of all, let me inform you, noble friend. Since we visit our chapters, which are eight in the countryside, twice a year, the senate has decreed that the prefects from all around the countryside should attend their respective chapters to hear how they might mutually assist each other. But it has succeeded so well that nothing more desirable could have happened for the edification of the churches. We have observed this order: each parish priest first gives an account of his faith and doctrine, then others are individually questioned to see if they are teaching correctly. From the evidence of each, the zeal and learning of each one became apparent. The prefects were also questioned, since they each hear their parish priests, whether they themselves have or have received complaints against the doctrine of the parish priest. Thirdly, the same pastor indicated before everyone how he administers baptism and the Lord's Supper and teaches about both sacraments. Here again, others added their judgments, and we added ours where it was worthwhile. Similarly, it was inquired about the catechism, in what order each one observes it. Having heard these things, we turned our questions to the external economy of the churches, whether in each church the moral overseers, whom we call 'eegoumer', and the prefect perform their duties as they have sworn to do. Here we found the source of all evils, here the prefects were reproved face to face, yet with decorum, so that they might become more diligent executors of their duties rather than exacerbated. What was beyond our power, we reported to the senate. Finally, it was decreed by the votes of the brothers whether the one who had now given an account of himself and the church in all respects should be tolerated further in office. Thus we were able to most certainly explore by comparing, questioning, and objecting the talents, lives, and morals of everyone, the state of the churches, and the negligence or fidelity of the prefects. If you desire anything, let me know. For it is not possible for us to convene synods every year.</p>
      <p>Then at the end of August, as the Anabaptists grow stronger daily, the senate extorted from us a plan by which we might conveniently be freed from this dregs. They hoped we would agree to their execution, but it turned out otherwise. We showed the senate and the deacons the cause of this disease and heresy, namely, since some preachers indulge their bellies more than faithfully and diligently executing their office, it is no wonder that they universally slander us as false prophets and devourers of tithes. Then, when they see pomp, luxury, avarice, contempt of God, and neglect of His word in the magistracy and prefects, the simpler ones are easily persuaded by the leaders that those holding office are not Christian. Similarly, when oaths are made so easily, broken more easily, perjuries are not punished, and it is free to utter horrendous blasphemies, no one should be surprised that they twist the scriptures to say that a Christian should not swear at all. Thus, when they see the youth growing up neglected in all kinds of vices, whose baptism we assert with all our might, they are moved to deny it with all their might, etc. We proposed these things so that they would not hasten to shed the blood of the Anabaptists, while sparing the much more pestilent Papists, who are a perpetual threat to both the civil and Christian republic. Finally, we gave our advice, of which you have a copy here. But what can I say? We were compelled again to propose it to the deacons. Nevertheless, the matter was postponed against our will and that of the deacons until the eighth of November. On that day, the senate, the deacons, and 35 prefects from the countryside gathered. After hearing all the edicts from the restoration of the church, they finally agreed, after we explained the matter for almost two hours, to swear together, but not from man to man orally, to observe this edict and this external economy of the churches. The rest of the people in the city will swear, then in the countryside. Here the Papists fear for themselves, because while they have hitherto opposed the business of the Lord, they are to be considered perjurers if they continue to do so with the same freedom as before. We urged that a certain penalty be established for those who would not swear, namely that they should freely leave our land with their possessions, given, however, the return that both the Anabaptists and anyone else have, and they agreed to this in their council. For those who neither want to swear nor leave, no penalty has yet been decreed, although they cannot be excused from sedition (like the Anabaptists). For those who are already becoming perjurers, we could not obtain that a certain penalty be imposed, except that the magistrate reserved the right to punish them. Therefore, read and judge, let Leo and the other brothers judge, considering the state of our affairs and the character of the entire people. As soon as you can, send it back. For we have no other copy. Soon it will be executed before the people of our city, then in the countryside. These things have been done with us so far. If you desire anything in these matters, use your freedom towards me, and let Leo use it too.</p>
      <p>As for your previous letters, in which you requested many things to be copied about the wars that have taken place, I can obtain none of these from the secretary without the consent of the entire senate, which will not easily allow these to be transcribed. It is also enjoined upon the secretary under oath not to communicate anything that pertains to the business of the senate to anyone. The first reformation was printed by Froschauer with you. The account of the Grinderwald war is all entrusted to Silvanus in the last unrest. A copy of the letter written to Capellen is no longer available; it was written by a special scribe who does not want to have it now. The Geneva and Müsser train lies as (everything) in missives still behind my lord, also what happened in the last war. But if it comes into Valerius's hands as it must, he should take care to transcribe the chronicle, then it might be possible for me. He has now described the preacher's business, which has never truly come to light; for the three legal processes in Latin have lain hidden and locked behind my lord, since their burning no one has been able to see them. Now he is writing about the Lutheran business, how it began, also when and how Zwingli, the apostle of the Confederates, began the gospel in Zurich. Note, it is now almost the 20th year; it may perhaps be delayed until our year.</p>
      <p>As for what you write about Osiander and Melanchthon coming to Württemberg, I do not know what to suspect. You confess your faith here and there - beware, lest a third! - and you applaud some future concord. Nothing would be more desirable for us, but in the meantime, we are the last in this matter and are not instructed by a word of your confessions. We fear that we may be deceived by you, however prudent you may be. You gave a summary of your confession. Would that you had sent the true copy of the whole! For I do not know what rumor is stirring our brothers to be anxious lest we too subscribe, neglecting the churches and the open manner of teaching, to some new ambiguities, by which, while you seek concord between Luther and us, you stir up the greatest offense and discord in the churches. You confess that Christ is truly eaten and drunk in the supper by the faithful. I have taught thus far: Unless one has previously been fed by Christ, the heavenly bread, and thus by His flesh and blood, let him stay away from the supper. For thus outside the supper the faithful always have Christ present by the contemplation of faith, nor is He first eaten and drunk in the supper, but the faithful by this action of the supper testify with thanksgiving that they have already been fed by the death of Christ. Yet I would not deny that by words and sacraments our senses are refreshed or represented with what faith has long since devoured and held most present. You also condemn those who recognize nothing but bare signs in the supper. We indeed recognize signs, but if we asserted them to be bare, they would no longer be signs. For a sign is always a sign of the signified. Thus, as bread and wine are signs, so we recognize the signified as present in its own way. We do not recognize bare bread and wine in the supper, nor that Christ is first eaten and drunk in the supper, but that the eating and drinking are testified and confessed. Nor do we deny that by the operation of the Holy Spirit we are confirmed in faith and grow more and more in love through this action. What you mean by carnal servitude, I do not know whether I understand or not. Moreover, that Christ delivered nothing sensible here, but all things are intelligible, if I am not mistaken, are the words of the ancients, I would not propose to the church. Irenaeus: heavenly and earthly, Chrysostom: sensible and intelligible or spiritual, sacrament and the thing of the sacrament or the signified, Augustine: one food and drink of the mouth and stomach, the other of the soul and faith. In the meantime, however, the earthly assumes the name of the heavenly. Thus we can speak without danger before the church. In my judgment, however modest, it is not only to be considered that there is concord among the leaders of the churches. For it can easily be achieved by the ambiguity of words, so that we may agree on a new and third confession. But we will not easily persuade the churches that we have not deviated from the truth by even a jot. These, therefore, should come into consideration no less than that the learned agree among themselves. You wrote most openly in 1 Corinthians 11 about this matter, to which I easily subscribe, because they are both true and clear. However, when we say that Christ is eaten in the supper of the faithful, I will infer. Therefore, in the supper of the faithful, that food is offered, and thus Christ Himself, at least spiritually, and the external food will bring the internal, nor will there be a need for us to prove ourselves. But whoever was an unbeliever, by the spiritual offering under the sacraments, will become a believer. What is this but papism and Lutheranism? In the matter itself and in truth, I would not easily doubt that we could agree among ourselves, but the different manner of speaking makes the matter so intricate that nothing is more intricate. I hear that on the part of the Lutherans, Luther himself and almost more Brenz are feared, and on our part, Carlstadt and Miconius and a third person; all the rest are persuaded. Hence I thought it worthwhile to pour out my thoughts into your bosom for the sake of our old friendship and freedom, so that I might extort from you what the leaders of the Christian churches are thinking.</p>
      <p>I wrote a few days ago to Blaurer himself, that he might also declare himself with a single letter to us, since he has written to the people of Schaffhausen and to you, I do not know how many times. But we have received from the farthest Gaul, from Bourges and Paris, as a most certain rumor, that Blaurer has joined the Papists and Lutherans in the Eucharist. Take this in good part.</p>
      <p>As for the sermon, you write that you are dealing with Matthew, and that with the utmost diligence. Your study is pleasing, and the brothers expect nothing more, to whom you can be of the greatest benefit when, with your skill in explaining the scriptures, you tirelessly provide one thing after another. I have not yet had the first to the Corinthians bound. I will therefore wait for the second, since you write that you are engaged in it, so that it may be printed.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we commend Peter, the assistant teacher of our school, to you and Leo as much as possible, so that he may be commended by your senate, if necessary, to the Swiss who are now visiting the monasteries. He is a pious man and the very embodiment of integrity, who is oppressed by great poverty. From which he could easily be freed if things now succeeded according to his wish. What I send here, either return through this or through a certain messenger.</p>
      <p>Let Christoph also send Leo's Passion. Whom I want to be greeted above all with Pellican. May your wife also be well. Our Brunfels is almost at the point of death, a good man otherwise. We get along excellently. The patricians and all the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I think I have scribbled, I need not write more.</p>
      <p>16th of November, in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Yours, as little as I am, B. Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his always dearest brother.</p>
