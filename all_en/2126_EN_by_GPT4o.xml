      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Your letters were as pleasing to me, most learned and distinguished Bullinger, as any that have ever been most welcome, for they are full of duty, humanity, and love. Indeed, as I respond to them, I cannot commend you enough, so far am I from over-praising, and this is to be attributed not so much to my respect for you, which is not insignificant, as to the dignity, which is very great, of your affairs. It is certainly a mark of your singular humanity that you deem me worthy of your letters and friendship and so kindly place me among the number of your friends. It is not your interest to have gratitude towards me, but mine to have and express perpetual gratitude to you, since you have deigned to receive me, a man of no name, into your most holy and much-desired friendship, from which much honor and benefit also accrue to me, while nothing or little can accrue to you from me. This alone accrues to you: a true and faithful and perpetual friend, who, although he cannot benefit you, nevertheless desires to do so from the heart. Therefore, your son is to me both very dear and highly commended; I cannot fail him not only for your sake but also because by his own virtue, modesty, and manners worthy of a Christian and your son, he renders himself dear and lovable not only to me but to all. I regret that due to his excessive modesty and shyness, he has never availed himself of me or my resources, although I desire nothing more than to benefit him and gratify you. Know for certain that you and all yours are observed and loved by me from the heart; therefore, you can do nothing more pleasing, either you or yours, than to command me (provided I can in any way either benefit or at least accommodate you). Therefore, I beseech you to command; for I will most willingly obey and, with the most willing spirit, as far as the Lord permits me, I will fulfill what you have commanded.</p>
      <p>As for that friend, I do not indeed despair, since we must hope well in the Lord for all things. But yet the matter itself (to speak to you candidly, as I always do) not only does not give a spirit of good hope but even takes away the hope previously given; for our Martyr is most dear to the whole city, the senate, and the school authorities, since they have long had a good understanding of his most honorable and pleasant manners and his much and truly Christian doctrine, he would have already been restored to his former position, which he previously held here, if he and another, and add one of yours, had not vehemently resisted hitherto and still resist the man, and that for no other reason, which they openly allege, than on account of the sacramental matter, especially since books on this matter have been both published and given out by him. They wanted to receive him unconditionally if he would subscribe to the confession on this sacramental matter offered in the name of the city of Strasbourg to the Council of Trent. Since those words are not contrary to our and his correct opinion if rightly understood, as they favor themselves if wrongly and perversely understood, Martyr accepted to do so with this added clause, if those words are rightly and correctly understood. They did not want to admit it and finally urged the magistrate to at least ensure that Martyr would subscribe to the concord made between Mr. Luther and Mr. Bucer, that is, that Zanchi too (but, if it pleases God, which it does not) would be forced to subscribe. We have seen that bad concord, of which Mr. Bucer finally repented; among other things, it contains that the body of the Lord is eaten by the impious themselves (as I believe you have also read) lacking faith and repentance.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Martyr frankly refused and said he would not approve such a concord. The matter has been brought to this point, where you can easily see who and what is the impediment that he has not yet been restored to the place of the brethren. What outcome the matter will have, I do not know; I hope, however, that he will be restored without any confession or subscription. For I seem to see the minds of the senate and almost all the citizens, whatever the outcome of the matter, at least from the resistance of those three, we achieve this good, that many, moved by this matter, will read Peter's treatises and disputations on the Eucharist, by which I hope it will happen that many will perceive the truth of the matter, with God, however, teaching inwardly; for which to happen, the Lord must be entreated. Now you see, my most esteemed Mr. Bullinger, what hope those friends give me; let us therefore pray to the Lord to enlighten them with His spirit and teach them the true understanding of the word; for this purpose, I have recounted this to you alone.</p>
      <p>The greetings of your fellow students were most welcome; therefore, your dignity will return greetings to them all in my name. Sturmius, Dasipodius, and many other learned and pious men wish you safe and long-lasting health. May God preserve your church with all pious and learned men. Farewell, my most distinguished Bullinger, and love your Zanchi, as you do. My wife also sends you many greetings. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, December 28, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Girolamo Zanchi.</p>
