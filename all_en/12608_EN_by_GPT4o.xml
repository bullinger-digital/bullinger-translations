    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich would have written earlier, but there was nothing special to report. Even now he does not have much to report, but he does not want to let the [council] messenger [...] go without a letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Emperor [Charles V] is camped with his Italians and Spaniards in a difficult-to-access location, which lies between a swamp area, Ingolstadt, and the Danube. He is waiting for the 3,000 Dutch cavalrymen and 15,000 infantrymen who crossed the Rhine at Bingen. Near Frankfurt, the approximately 18,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 riders of the [Schmalkaldic League] will block their way.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The army under Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony, Landgrave [Philipp] of Hesse, and seven other princes is [only] half a mile from the Emperor's camp. They plan to build paths from brushwood and wood [through the swamp] to enable an attack.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- There are fierce skirmishes with prisoners and dead daily. However, the [Schmalkaldic League] is far more successful in these.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- On August 29, Sebastian Schertlin killed 200 of over 1,000 Spaniards in the village of [Gerolfing] and seriously injured the papal ally Alessandro Vitelli. Others were able to flee with the help of [Ottavio Farnese], Duke of Camerino. On the [Schmalkaldic side], two servants [Melchior Rhau and Georg Bruch] and a Saxon nobleman [Christof von Bodenhausen] died. Schertlin's stallion was fatally hit.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The imperial German Landsknechte inform the [Schmalkaldic League] of the Emperor's attack intentions. He is distrustful of them and does not let them participate in the battles.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Further news will follow. Bullinger should pray for the [German Protestants]. They are receiving a great deal of support and have about 9,000 cavalrymen and 60,000 infantrymen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Enclosed, Frölich sends a pasquinade [by Sixt Birck] and the Emperor's oath [with which he committed himself to the Empire in 1519]. Bullinger already knows about the alliance between the Emperor and Pope [Paul III].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The Zurich councilors should also be informed of these communications. If they had been significant, the Augsburg council would have reported on them themselves.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Just now, Hans Vogler [the Elder] arrives with Bullinger's letter [not received] and the "Cosmographia" [by Johannes Honter]. Many thanks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Bullinger is probably right in deciding to dedicate his commentary on Luke [not to the Augsburg councilors, but to Hans Welser alone]. To avoid offending Ambrosius [Blarer], who defends Welser, [Frölich spoke more positively about Welser], even though he still believes that the latter is unstable and hypocritical in faith, and it is therefore questionable whether he will be mayor again next year. However, the Augsburg councilors would not have been more worthy of a dedication, especially since, with one or two exceptions (Haller can confirm this), they completely lack government-capable men of the kind of a [Lucius] Aemilius [Paullus] and a [Marcus Porcius] Cato. The merchants pursue their private interests... In the [Great] council, however, there are many upright, albeit uneducated, men.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Due to the widespread complaint that the assistance of the Confederates is insufficient, the mayors [Georg Herwart and Simprecht Hoser] send an apology to the council of Zurich on behalf of the Augsburg council. They express that, on the contrary, they are very satisfied with the Confederates. In response to the Zurich inquiry, they further testify that many mercenaries from the Nine Places have joined the [Schmalkaldic League and not the Emperor].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- In the imperial camp, they mourn three Italians or Spaniards shot on Sunday [August 29]. The [Schmalkaldic League] planned to attack today. Frölich will probably learn more about this tomorrow.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Hans Wilpert Zoller was wounded by his lieutenant [...] three or four weeks ago, but recovered after just four days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Musso [Gian Giacomo de' Medici] will also encounter worthy adversaries in [Germany]! Schertlin proves to be very useful.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Yesterday, Captain [Balthasar Füger] made an advance with 60 men from the Ehrenberg pass and drove away the 200 Italians lying in front of the castle.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- Greetings to [Anna, née Adlischwyler], to the children, the mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater], to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], and [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God. Dearest lord and brother, I can easily perceive your desire for my letters, and I would not have delayed so long if there had been anything worth writing about. And although there is still little to report, I did not want to let this messenger come to you empty-handed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The Emperor, with his Italians and Spaniards, has positioned himself advantageously near Ingolstadt. There is a swamp behind him, the city in front of him, and the Danube on the side, making it difficult to approach him. Furthermore, he does not want to attack but is waiting for the Dutch troops. They are supposed to be 3,000 cavalry and 15,000 infantry, who have crossed the Rhine near Mainz at Bingen. Our forces, numbering up to 18,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, are not far from Frankfurt and are prepared to block their path or engage them in battle.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Our powerful army, in which the Elector of Saxony, the Landgrave of Hesse, and seven other German princes are personally present, is camped half a mile from the Emperor's position. They hope to make paths with brushwood and wood, over which they can attack the enemy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>There are daily large skirmishes against each other. Many are captured and killed on both sides. But (praise God) our side has not suffered any significant damage, but has always inflicted three times as much on the enemy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>On August 29, Mr. Sebastian Schertlin, along with others, found over 1,000 Spaniards in a village, of whom they killed over 200. The others escaped because their leader, the Duke of Camerino, came to their aid with 1,000 men. In this skirmish, Alexander Vitelli, a friend of the Pope, was almost mortally wounded. Two of our servants and a Saxon nobleman remained behind, and Mr. Schertlin's stallion was shot.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Germans on the enemy's side offer our forces free passage. If it were possible, they would join us, etc. Therefore, the Emperor does not trust them. He also does not let them out of his camp for skirmishes or other purposes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I will write to you about further developments. Praying to God earnestly for us. Everyone is comforted and trusts in God and the just good cause. We have an abundance of people. There is such a rush from all places that no one would have believed it. In my opinion, we have over 9,000 cavalry and up to 60,000 infantry on our side. And what pleases me most is that no one relies on this, but on God's power and trust.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Herewith a pasquinade and the Emperor's oath. You already have the alliance with the Pope.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Greet all dear lords and brothers for me. Please also inform my gracious lords of the council about these matters. My lords would have gladly written themselves if it had been particularly significant.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Just as I have written so far, Mr. Hans Vogler has come with your most pleasant letters. I thank you for the sent "Cosmographia" and other diligent efforts. I do not know how to repay it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>But I want to be a pious, faithful brother, as much as God (for which I pray) grants grace.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>You wisely write about the change of the dedication of your commentary on Luke. If I did not fear that our excellent Ambrosius might be offended by this, I would persist entirely in my previous opinion. For the man mentioned shows his hypocrisy in religion with many arguments. However, our entire city testifies that he is most inconsistent, so much so that many doubt whether he will assume the consulship next year. Nevertheless, I agree with you. Therefore, proceed with your plan. I would not want you to know how lacking we are here in men capable of governing affairs. We have a large number of merchants who care only for private matters. The Lord preserves this city with singular kindness. Once, inquire from Haller, our most pleasant brother, how many Aemilii and Catones we have. Inquire, I say, how many lovers of letters among the magnates. He will hardly show you two. As for me, so help me God, I hardly know a single one! All the others are unworthy of having your sacred works dedicated to them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>However, I would not detract from our senate, in which there are many uneducated and innocent men.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>I have sufficiently informed my lord about the bad rumors that are supposed to be spread about the honorable Confederates, although I have never heard from any person who complained about them, as they do nothing but good among us. Likewise, my lord is also surprised who spreads such words. Therefore, they write herewith to your lords and apologize, praising their faithful support, that the Nine Places are not against us, but rather many from them have joined us, as the lords mayors will undoubtedly not withhold from you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Three prominent Italians or Spaniards are said to have been shot by our forces on Sunday, causing great mourning in the Emperor's camp. Our forces intended to attack the Emperor in his camp today. How it went, I cannot know. But I will, God willing, learn tomorrow.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Hans Hilpert Zoller was slightly stabbed by his lieutenant 3 or almost 4 weeks ago, but he did not lie down for more than 4 days and was upright again immediately. I also know nothing else than that he is fresh and healthy. He will now see that he will rejoice in his life.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>The one from Musso with his Italian tricks will also find people here. Our Schertlin shows himself to be the most beneficial by the grace of God.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>Yesterday, our captain made a sortie at the Ehrenberg pass with 60 men and drove away 200 Italians who were lying in front of the castle, stabbing many of them. God has worked well in this matter so far. He will undoubtedly bring it to a good end. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet my wife and children, the mayors, the city clerk, and my Gwalther. In haste, September 2, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, G. Laetus, etc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my beloved lord and brother, in Zurich.</p>
