      <p>Highly and well-learned, noble, steadfast, prudent and wise, gracious, dear lords, etc. My entire willing service along with everything that I am capable of is, as before, ready. For the past three and a half years, I have publicly preached here in Zurich, among my other sermons, the Revelation of Jesus Christ, revealed to the holy apostle John, and have also written down the sermons, where many honorable people, local and foreign, have asked me to publish it. Thus, I have prepared the entire work, which comprises one hundred sermons, for printing and have dedicated it to my gracious lords and the council of the city of Bern. And if nothing is published or printed by you (as is proper) without being first reviewed and approved for printing by you, I hereby send you the entire work except for the last two sermons, which I will also send shortly, God willing, with a humble request that you review it diligently and as soon as possible. If it pleases you and those who would like to print it with you and keep the inscription, Mr. Christoph Froschauer would be assisted in a fair manner in the Apiary and with the handling, so that he may come to a good outcome.</p>
      <p>However, if you do not find any pleasure in this, I humbly ask that my book be returned to me faithfully and that my service not be taken amiss; for I always desire to serve and not displease my preaching lords. I have also included the entire matter of the whole work in the preface, which I have also had translated, so that one can see with less effort what is dealt with in the entire book. If I can ever repay you for this work, which you have with me here, with willing services, I will be inclined towards all and each one in particular. I kindly ask that you receive this my writing in good faith and always graciously keep me in mind. May God always keep you in His grace.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, December 20, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your always favorable H[einrich] B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned, noble, steadfast, prudent and wise appointed lords of the city of Bern over the schools and for the printing, his gracious lords.</p>
      <p>My copy to the school lords, December 20, 1556.</p>
