      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I give and express great thanks to you, most learned Bullinger, who honors me, unknown and unlearned as I am, not only with letters but also with pious, learned, and catholic gifts. I see, I feel, indeed I have your true ardent Christian love, with which you are aflame for all true enthusiasts, of whom in this age many are called, but few, as I would say evangelically with Christ, are truly chosen. I give you great thanks, I say, not so much in my own name as in the name of other brothers, many of whom are with us, inquiring about you and your holy writings, reading them assiduously, and venerating the gifts of the Holy Spirit poured out upon you. Therefore, go on, man of God, inspired by the divine spirit, to expound and elucidate the remaining sacred scriptures with similar faith, diligence, and skill.</p>
      <p>And those commentaries on the epistles of Saint Paul that you have completed, ensure that I have them, with our Peter most diligently counting the price. But what is the price, in coins for which it is sold? Otherwise, lest I seem entirely ungrateful, forgetful of gifts, and wholly inhuman, most humane man, I send this little piece of linen - for why should I dignify such a small gift with another name? - as a gift to your most chaste wife. I ask and pray that you consider it kindly and fairly. In the following year, provided Christ grants life, there will be a great cultivation of linen with us, and more will be sent to you by me, God willing.</p>
      <p>I have nothing worthy with which I can honor you, except the sincere affection of my heart for you, love, and moreover, constant goodwill and faithful prayer for you and your holy church to the Father, the giver of all good, so that you may benefit not only your own but also the catholic church in God. This is the burning desire of my heart, these are the groans, I testify to Christ, these are our sighs. This, I know, the Father will hear and will give, though with temptation, the outcome. If there are any of your or your colleagues' commentaries on the divine scriptures, whatever they may be, provided they are catholic, as they have been so far, though condemned by those recently born from the earth, ensure that my Peter buys them.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my patron and the delight of all students of sacred letters. What the pen wished to express here, I have cut short, lest I be heard as a flatterer.</p>
      <p>From our home, the second before Ottomar, in the year etc. 35.</p>
      <p>Bartholom√§us Bertlin, your disciple at your feet, where I humbly sit, listening to you even when not present.</p>
      <p>To the truly learned and truly pious Heinrich Bullinger, the most proven and venerable bishop of the Church of Zurich, his lord in Christ.</p>
