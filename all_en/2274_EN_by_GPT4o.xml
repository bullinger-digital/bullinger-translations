      <p>Greetings. This last letter was delivered to me by our excellent brother, Mr. Thomas Lever. I was not present at the time to assist him in finding suitable lodging. However, it turned out well that the Lord provided them with a host in my absence, one who could not have been better chosen. Both he and his companion proclaim that their needs have been met according to their wishes.</p>
      <p>Indeed, both are worthy of being supported by all good people in their exile, both with advice and comfort. One will soon depart for Strasbourg on certain business, but will return to us immediately. Thomas himself will rest, as he feels a little relief from his sorrow there.</p>
      <p>In my booklet, I have always feared that brevity might bring some obscurity. However, I could not avoid it; indeed, I was almost led by a determined purpose not to avoid it for other reasons. For I considered it my primary, almost sole, task to make the impiety of Servetus detestable to all. A full treatment of the matters I discuss would have seemed cunningly sought, which by its splendor would not so easily overshadow the not-so-impious doctrines. I do not perceive the gravity in style that you mention. On the contrary, I have made every effort, as far as possible, to ensure that even a novice reader can understand the thorny subtleties of Servetus without much difficulty.</p>
      <p>Yet I am aware that, although I am concise in all my writings, I have been more restrained here than usual. However, as long as it is clear that I have defended sound doctrine with sincere faith and right intention, this alone is worth more to me than any regret for the effort undertaken. But you, out of your love for me, your fairness, and your candor, judge kindly. Others criticize me more harshly, claiming that I am a master of cruelty and atrocity, that I attack a dead man, who perished by my hands, with my pen.</p>
      <p>There are also some who are not ill-disposed who wish I had never touched on the subject of punishing heretics. They say that all others, to avoid envy, have deliberately remained silent. But it is well that I have you as a partner in blame, if there is any blame, because you were my author and encourager. Therefore, see to it that you prepare yourself for the contest.</p>
      <p>You were informed by my letters that your book on Justifying Grace was returned to me some time ago. Furthermore, that work, which I hope will be useful to the whole church, cannot but be pleasing to me. Would that the skill of all readers matched your diligence. The preface reminded me that we should pursue what I previously wrote to you about. For although nothing more absurd can be imagined than the booklet of that Westphal, because we see the minds of princes corrupted by such slanders, and a recent sad example appeared in the King of Denmark, it seems to be our duty to counteract by whatever means possible. Moreover, a refutation coming from a private individual might have less dignity. Again, I see how difficult it is to obtain the consensus of the churches. Therefore, consider with your prudence if any not-to-be-regretted course of action presents itself.</p>
      <p>I gladly inspected the response you gave to the Scot. He had spoken with me about these matters before he came to you. As I had freely expressed my opinion in a familiar conversation, he did not press further, nor did he ask me to write anything upon his return. The substance of my words agreed with your writing; for I also discussed the hereditary succession of kingdoms in almost the same way. On the other point, whether it is permissible to assert the gospel by armed force, there was no disagreement at all. Regarding female rule, I spoke thus: since it deviates from the legitimate order of nature, it should be counted among God's punishments. Yet even in this part, God's extraordinary grace sometimes shines forth, as he reproaches men for their sloth by raising up women endowed not only with a manly but a heroic spirit, as seen in the illustrious example of Deborah. However, although nothing but mere confusion appears, I declared that I permit nothing to private individuals but to lament; for female rule, being poorly constituted, is similar to tyranny, which must be endured until it is divinely removed. If any movement arises for the sake of religion, I pronounced that nothing seems better or safer to me than to remain quiet until a special calling shines forth. Therefore, we should rather ask God for the spirit of moderation and prudence to help in the moment than engage in idle disputes. And in this part, I was more copious because I am not unaware of how much license even the best people allow themselves in turbulent times, while being swept away by storms, they are blind at noon.</p>
      <p>Blessed be the Lord, who has governed our tongues as if the matter had been arranged between us! The state of our church remains suspended. But I am forced to break off the letter because, since I have found these messengers whom I dared to trust, I have been so occupied with other matters that I could not extend the writing further, as I wished. Farewell, therefore, most distinguished man and brother truly to be honored in the Lord. Greet diligently in my name Mr. Gwalther, Pellican, and the other fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>My colleagues, Mr. Marquard of Vici and many other friends, greet you in return. May the Lord protect and bless you and your family forever. Geneva, April 29, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and distinguished minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, brother and fellow minister to be respected.</p>
