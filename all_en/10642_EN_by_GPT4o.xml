    <p xml:id="regest1">He is urged by many to continue his commentary work on the apostolic letters, even though his duties leave him little time for it and although numerous such commentaries have already been written, such as the lost ones on the Letter to the Galatians by Origen and others, the preserved ones by Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine, and Theophylact, as well as more recent ones by Lorenzo Valla, Lefèvre d'Étaples, Erasmus, Luther, Megander, and Johannes [Bugenhagen]. He gladly refers to the words and opinions of others, but it is not enough to merely string together collected material; the presentation must meet the needs of the time, the one-sidedness of earlier interpreters must be avoided, and above all, the honor of God and conformity with the Holy Scripture must be sought. He treats the four letters in context because they collectively contain the sum of faith: The Letter to the Ephesians teaches the true knowledge of Christ, which is defended against enemies in the Letter to the Galatians and summarized again in the Letter to the Colossians; in the Letter to the Philippians, the heavenly physician Paul offers medicine for the afflicted. He dedicates the commentaries to the four [people of Constance], not to flatter them, but to win over willing readers through their authority, which is based on their piety and wisdom as well as on the charity of their educated sister Margaretha Blarer. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To the most illustrious men, Ambrosius Blarer and Johannes Zwick, prelates of Constance, as well as to Konrad Zwick and Thomas Blarer, patricians and senators, brothers, Heinrich Bullinger sends grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>With what skill I have thus far expounded several of the apostles' letters, the churches know, in whose hands the divine Paul wished the judgment of prophecies to be. Indeed, being well aware of my own purity of faith and simplicity, I now begin to have good hopes from the approval of the churches, after men of great name, renowned for their piety and learning, as well as holy brothers and many others, do not cease to urge me to continue commenting on the remaining letters. Indeed, numerous public sermons delay me, as do various affairs. What is more, the scarcity and brevity of time not only steal me from myself but also greatly hinder my efforts. Yet they say that no opportunity should be lost, that whatever time remains should be seized and used well; moreover, they say that I cannot employ my efforts more usefully for the pious than by writing commentaries. When I object that learned and holy expositions of many, both ancient and recent, exist on the apostolic letters, they immediately conclude that it is clear that the gifts of God have always been diverse in the church and that each one has been given his own gift even today, which, unless we wish to be accused of wickedness, must be faithfully dispensed for the benefit of others, since we see that the ancients did this, who, although there existed five books of Origen on the letter to the Galatians and the tenth book of the Stromata, did not withdraw their pen from commentary. Indeed, it is known that the ancient church read the expositions of many at the same time, even of this (not to mention others) letter to the Galatians. For Jerome is the author who wrote that after Origen, Didymus of Alexandria, Apollinaris of Laodicea, a certain Alexander, Eusebius of Emesa, and Theodorus of Heraclea wrote on the letter to the Galatians. However, these have not reached our hands. For they have perished due to the injury of time. However, those written by the divine Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine, and Theophylact have come to our memory, to say nothing of others. Therefore, these exactors of our commentaries thought that I would not sin against the example of the ancients if, after the greatest gifts of the greatest men, I were to cast my two small coins into the treasury of the Lord, but that I would sin if I refused to contribute to the common good what the grace of the Lord has bestowed. They say that even today the annotations and commentaries on the letter to the Galatians by the most learned men Lorenzo Valla, Lefèvre d'Étaples, Erasmus of Rotterdam, Martin Luther, Caspar Megander, and Johannes Pomeranus have come to light, but that their diligence should not deter me from writing, but rather incite me, as I can be greatly aided by their diligent exposition.</p>
      <p>Finally, reason has overcome my obstinacy, the difficulty of the work with the diligence of both the ancients and the more recent ones. For I am not ashamed, as some are, to use well the words and thoughts of others. For what does it matter to refuse to accept the truth truly and simply proposed unless it is clothed in foreign and new attire? Since antiquity itself adds some authority to things and sometimes they are rendered more happily, purely, and aptly by them than they can be rendered by us today. But someone might say: It would be better to have devoted all efforts to the ancients alone, neglecting those recent treatises, who delight in weaving new garlands from the reworked wreaths of others. However, the well-known proverb is very common: the vote of the majority prevails. For no one has seen or learned everything. Nor are those foolish patchers to be approved, who heap up anything without judgment. For it is necessary that everything be said in its place. A word properly inserted in its place is a gem, to say nothing of thoughts. Different times require different order and treatment. What is more, different interpreters have aimed at different things. You may seek order in some, clarity in others, abundance in these, brevity in those. There are those who are weak in asserting but stronger in refuting. There are others who are not unsuccessful in handling commonplaces, but in expounding authors, that is, in rendering the mind of the author, they are most infantile, as it fits those to whom the saying of Gaius applies: "sand without lime," and that of Cicero: "loose brooms." You may see another interpreter who observes nothing but tropes and idioms in expounding the sacred, another who only compares languages; a third one contends against heresies and heretics, and these perhaps neglect what contributes to the edification of faith, the consolation of the afflicted conscience, and the exhortation to holiness and integrity of life. Now he who also superstitiously cares for these things almost neglects all the rest. But it was the duty of a diligent and complete interpreter to observe all these things. I do not say this because I have seen or expounded the sacred in our commentaries with this order and diligence, but so that certain morose and foolish people may see that those who carefully watch over the building of commentaries do not play an empty game today. For Scripture is a very ample field for talents. In which, however, those are only happily exercised who do not transgress the bounds of faith and charity; likewise, who seek the glory of God, not their own. Certainly, the well-known comic saying: "Nothing is said now that has not been said before." But if nothing is to be said hereafter unless it has not been said before, then indeed everyone must be silent. But who would demand this from a man? Therefore, everyone must speak, whose speaking is of interest, whose speech is sound and beneficial. As for me, I would rather fall back on the sponge and let my writings perish if they do not benefit the church, if they do not agree in all things with the canonical scriptures. For these rightly serve as the cynosure for all navigating through this strait. But God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is my witness that I have undertaken this work to help, not to obscure or slander, to criticize or mock the writings of others.</p>
      <p>Having given the work, I have decided to include and expound these four letters of Paul - namely to the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians - in this one volume, because in them the sum of the entire Christian religion seems to be most aptly set forth. Indeed, the first two and the last are of the same argument, but not written with the same thread and reason. For in the letter to the Ephesians, he simply sets forth his knowledge in the mystery of Christ, that is, what is the true knowledge of Christ according to the gospel. In the Galatians, however, teaching this very thing, he disputes especially against those resisting and wanting to impose Judaism for Christianity. In both, you see taught what is the Christian faith, what is the true religion or knowledge of God through Christ, but expounded differently. And the letter dedicated to the Colossians does not differ from that written to the Ephesians, unless you prefer to call it an epitome of this, just as the letter of Paul to the Galatians is an epitome of that written to the Romans, as far as the matter of justification is concerned. For what he discussed more extensively there about the calling of the Gentiles, he more succinctly compresses in the letter to the Ephesians. To these three letters, the letter to the Philippians is conveniently joined, because in it is contained wonderful consolation in afflictions, exhortation to the pursuit of charity, perseverance, and virtues, all of which are exceedingly necessary for those to whom the knowledge of Christ and the manner of justification by the grace of God have become known. For these are tested by various afflictions, sometimes led away from simplicity by either inertia or corrupt doctrine and heresies, so that some remedy against these diseases is needed, which indeed the heavenly physician Paul has prepared in that letter.</p>
      <p>When I was considering to whom, according to custom, I should dedicate these commentaries, my labor, the first thing that occurred to me was the firm quartet of your integrity, most firmly connected by faith, nobility, glory, and blood. I did not look in my dedication, as many are wont to do. For others wish to illuminate those by their labor to whom they dedicate their work, but I wish my work to be adorned by your authority, glory, and virtue. Others seek by dedications to win the favor and friendships of great men, they strive to bind them to themselves as if obliged to services. Many, skillfully composing encomiums of these, praise them for virtues which they wish them to possess, not without the crime of flattery. However, I had no need of these things with you, as you have always loved me more obligingly than I have ever deserved. Nor did I intend to make a profit or sing encomiums. I have not learned to flatter. Nor do you need a flatterer, who praises absent virtues, which he desires present, with praises and thus, as it were, infixes a spur and adds a goad. You yourselves, aided by divine grace, are sufficient for your own glory. Nor do you need any one panegyrist. For illustrious cities admire your sound doctrine, religious piety, rare senatorial prudence, distinguished wisdom and faith, also outstanding learning and excellent humanity, peoples proclaim these in you, churches rejoice over these, the impious envy these, the saints venerate these in you and wish you all good things. Moreover, your most chaste sister Margaretha Blarer adds to your glory, who, after virginal chastity and many and great services and benefits to the poor, that is, to Christ the bridegroom, has joined many and various other excellent gifts, also learning and proficiency in the Latin language, pious and dedicated to God in all things. You surely recognize the gifts of God. You are not unaware of how much your whole family owes to the church for the excellent gifts of God received. We have nothing that we have not received. No one should glory in the gifts of God received as if he had not received them. And what is given by the Lord is given for this purpose, that we may benefit as many as possible. Indeed, you strive to benefit everyone, to harm no one, you show yourselves beneficent and humane to all. Therefore, to this extent, bestow yourselves upon us, that under the auspices of your name these our commentaries may go forth to the public, that is, that by the authority of your name we may have more favorable readers.</p>
      <p>Your brothers, Leo Jud, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and the other colleagues greet you. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in the month of July, in the year of our Lord 1535.</p>
