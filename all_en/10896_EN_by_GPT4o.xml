    <p xml:id="regest1">Hans Peter from Bremgarten has complained about the inadequate payment for his services in the army of the Emperor [Charles V]. If the imperial troops defeat the King [Francis I] as expected, they intend to march against the Swiss Confederates. Only the Castellan of Musso has treated the [Swiss Confederate] mercenaries, of whom only 200 have remained, well. They plan to storm Turin. Johannes Bullinger does not need what his brother offers him. Jörg [Stadler?] is coming himself to negotiate a possible purchase. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Know, my dear brother, that Hans Peter from Bremgarten came home on Tuesday with his wife and told me that the Emperor treated them so disgracefully, it's not worth mentioning; he is out 3 crowns and 3 kreuzers. Furthermore, the common talk among them is that if they defeat the King (because he gives the Emperor victory with a hundred thousand men and more), they intend to march against the Swiss Confederates. This is true, as I have heard from others. No one has treated them well except the Castellan of Musso, and there are no more than 200 left with the Emperor. They plan to storm Turin. It is cheap in the camp.</p>
      <p>As for what you offer me, I do not need it, by God's grace, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding Jörg (as I thought, your brother-in-law), he is half and half. He could come in tomorrow and negotiate himself with them. He does not need to sell, except for cash and a bond letter, etc.</p>
      <p>Greet the people (the household), mother, Anni, and Heitzmann for me.</p>
      <p>I. yours.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
