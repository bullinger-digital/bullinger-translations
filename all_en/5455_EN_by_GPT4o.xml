      <p>Greetings. What I feared would happen in April and May, that the hesitation of the most illustrious prince would ruin both himself and the churches not only of France but also of other kingdoms, or at least put them in great danger, I now understand from your letters has indeed happened, to my great sorrow. The good prince did not want to appear eager and thirsty for human blood.</p>
      <p>But how much innocent blood has been shed in the meantime! What will be the end? And although nothing happens that I did not foresee, since the ways of the impious in France are well known to me from the ways of those in our own lands, who are enemies of our religion in Switzerland and Germany, and their remarkable strategies are known, yet I do not know if ever, even though I have experienced various labors and felt the most intense pains during these forty years of my ministry, I have been so deeply grieved with such heavy sorrow. Meanwhile, I turn to the throne of grace and implore mercy from the most merciful Father, and I continually urge the church entrusted to my faith and trust that the Lord, according to His grace and power, will not forsake us and His most afflicted churches.</p>
      <p>We owe Him all that we have and we know that He governs all things most wisely and justly with His holy providence. Let us therefore submit ourselves to Him, beseeching forgiveness, and that He may not repay us according to our merits. I pray that you, either through yourself or through Jonville or another brother, always write to us about what is happening in France, whether it be good or bad. I received letters from Basel written by Mr. Beza; however, I doubt whether he has returned to Geneva or to France.</p>
      <p>Wherever he may be, I wish him well and pray to the Lord that He may use his ministry, as He has done so far, for the advancement of the churches. I ask that you kindly greet him most amicably.</p>
      <p>I sent you a book written by Stancaro against you, Martyr, and me; I doubt whether you have received it, etc. Farewell most excellently, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus bless you! The brothers greet you; also greet your friends and brothers. September 7, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
