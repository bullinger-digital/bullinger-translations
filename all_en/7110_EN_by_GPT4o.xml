      <p>Greetings and Peace. I would recount the history, or rather the tragic narrative of the events of our lower homeland in more detail, most illustrious man, if I did not have this man, who holds it so precisely that no writing of ours is necessary. However, I commend him in the name by which the pious and Christians ought to be commended. If only there could be a place for him to live among you, if his circumstances allow it. I wrote this while on a journey, as the opportunity arose to accompany him to the first small town. I cannot write more now; for this writing of mine, however brief, presses upon me. I would also like you to commend both myself and him to Mr. Gwalter. Mr. Beza writes to you about our affairs.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>Written hastily on the journey, May 22, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your most observant, Crespin.</p>
