    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Hochholzer read Bullinger's letter [not received] with great joy, especially since the people of Aarau had heard that the Five Places not only demanded the burning of Rudolf Gwalther's "Endtchrist," but also the burning of the author, and even the punishment of Bullinger! This news filled Hochholzer with pain and fear, as he knows that it was in a similar way that the [Second Kappel War] came about. His fear grew when he learned that in Zurich and the surrounding area, all men over 14 years old were called to arms. Even though he knows well that rumors tend to grow over time, it was still clear to him that there was something to it, because he had learned about it from a reliable source. That he could now gather from [Bullinger's letter] that the excitement about Gwalther and Bullinger had meanwhile calmed down and the people of Zurich were not arming for that reason, filled Hochholzer with joy. The audacity and godlessness of the Five Places, who dare everything that comes to their mind, is truly great! Perhaps they hoped that some Zurich councils, as before, would oppose the truth out of fear of them and deliver the servants of the truth, the pastors, to the slaughter. But now Hochholzer promises himself better from the people of Zurich and hopes not to be mistaken. The time in which the pious are tested has begun. May the Lord show himself gracious!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] From Bullinger's letter as well as from Bernardino Ochino and Calvin himself, Hochholzer has learned that the freedom of the Germans and the [evangelical] doctrine is at stake. The sins of God's people are great. Comforting, however, is the thought that God will leave a remnant for the church that no one can snatch from his hand. That many are now turning away from God does not confuse Hochholzer, as he knows that such a trial must come. Now the chaff will be separated from the wheat. Only those who trust in God will remain, even if they lack all human help. Then God will come to the aid of his perishing church. The higher the pride of the godless Herod, the sooner and deeper his fall. Now the Antichrist is pushing it to the extreme. But the Lord is stronger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] During Ochino's stay in Aarau, Hochholzer took care of him as best as he could. It is evident in him how God protects his own. Now it is [the Confederation's] turn, especially since it is burning with the [German] neighbors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] May Constance remain steadfast. Many fear that the city, abandoned by all, might join the Emperor [Charles V]. What the Confederates would then expect, everyone knows. If only they would include Constance in their alliance! The extremely wise Zurich council will surely remain vigilant. Hochholzer already sees how the enemies are invading the Confederation and covering it with vile crimes!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The tragic end is imminent. The will of the Lord be done. With God's help, Hochholzer, together with all the pious, will defend the truth to the end.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to Bullinger's family, to Rudolf Gwalther, and to all the pious.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I read your letter, esteemed lord, with the greatest pleasure from the beginning. For it had already been brought to us that not only was the Antichrist demanding the burning of Mr. Gwalther's work by the Five Places, but also that Mr. Rudolf himself was being sought for punishment, and at the same time, some charge, I know not what, was being brought against you by them, by which you might be subjected to some penalty. I received this with the greatest pain, and I was already in great distress, having been taught by previous times. For when I considered the past, I found that the same prelude had been to our disastrous calamity, from which I judged that not a small storm would now arise. To believe this more firmly, there was the preparation for war, of which I heard, as they were ordered to be in arms at every moment (as the rumor was), all those in the entire jurisdiction of Zurich who had exceeded the age of 14. Although I was not unaware that rumors grow as they go, yet I knew there was something to it, since I had received some things from trustworthy men. However, we greatly rejoice that the matter has been calmed, and we receive with great joy that war is not being prepared by your people for this reason. Great is their audacity and impiety, who are allowed to attempt whatever they please to think. Perhaps they hoped that there were such in the magistracy, who, struck with fear of them, would block the way of truth and deliver the ministers of truth to slaughter, as they are not unaware was done in former times. But now I promise myself better things from the people of Zurich. May I not be mistaken! For there will be a time, and it is now, when the pious will be tested. May the Lord be gracious to us!</p>

      <p>As for the affairs of the Germans, as much as I understand from your letters, from Mr. Bernardino and Mr. Calvin, it is now a matter of the freedom of the Germans; a matter also of religion. Our sins are indeed great. My only comfort is that there will be some remnants of the church, however small. No one will snatch the sheep of Christ from his hand. That many are fleeing from the Lord offends me less, because I know that trials must come. Those who are of us will remain with us. The chaff is separated from the wheat. Now, now, the thoughts of many hearts are revealed. The pious have their refuge and comfort in the Lord. Human help is taken away, so that the Lord alone may come to the aid of his endangered church! The greater the insults and pride of the impious Herod, the sooner I do not doubt he will be destroyed. Now, now, the Antichrist is acting to the extreme; therefore, he exerts all his strength. But the Lord is stronger; in him who strengthens us, we can do all things.</p>

      <p>With Mr. Bernardino (in whom we see most evidently that the Lord protects and delivers his own), I was, as much as I could, showing him humanity. Our matter is now at hand; for the neighboring wall is burning.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Many wish for Constance to remain steadfast. They fear it deserted, following the Emperor's side. Then what we should expect, no one is ignorant. If only it would be received by our people! But your most prudent senate will be vigilant. The Lord will also watch over his church, to which we will commit the matter. Unless he guards the city, those who guard it will watch in vain. Now I think I see the enemies invading our borders, filling them with fires, plunders, rapes, and all crimes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The catastrophe of the story remains, which we will have to go through. Let the will of the Lord be done. I will most faithfully assert the truth with all the pious to the end, with the grace of the Lord assisting me. Our hope is not in victories, but in the Lord, the very rock of salvation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. We pray for the health of your whole household, for Mr. Gwalther with all the pious. In Aarau, February 9, 1547. I commend myself entirely to you as before. Most devoted to your humanity, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of Christ in the church of Zurich, always to be esteemed as a father.</p>
