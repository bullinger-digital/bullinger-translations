    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frölich rejoices over the excellent relationship that exists between him and Bullinger (who deserves the greatest esteem among all contemporaries). Bullinger's last letter sent to him in Konstanz [not received] gave him much courage, as it made heavenly bliss present to him. May they meet there again one day, even if they should no longer encounter each other here on Earth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Frölich has negotiated in Konstanz on behalf of the Augsburg council in the matter of Sebastian Schertlin and has made an honest effort. But it is hardly describable what problems have arisen for him from this. For example, he heard that some riders pursued him on his journey to Konstanz and inquired about him in the inns. Moreover, even the Augsburg council now reproaches him for his long absence, although he is acting on their behalf! This would not worry him if he did not know that the foolishness of people is to be feared. But with God's help, he hopes to return home safely soon. How will he be received? For Augsburg is not only occupied by godless mercenaries, so that all decent people must fear for their possessions, their lives, and their family members, but is also terribly plagued by the pestilence. Moreover, nothing more is to be expected from the council. Yet Frölich will return nonetheless. Bullinger should pray that he remains steadfast!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In Augsburg, Frölich will urge the booksellers to purchase some copies of the "Eidgenössische Chronik" [by Johannes Stumpf] from Christoph Froschauer in due time. As soon as possible, Bullinger should send him a beautifully bound and an unbound copy of this work. The associated costs will be reimbursed to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The people of Konstanz are ready to submit, but only under conditions that hardly allow hope that it will ever happen. They have nothing to reproach themselves for before God! It will be the task of the Confederates to support them at some point!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also to Johannes Haller and all other mutual friends.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] If Frölich had known that the messenger [...], whom he had hastily sent to Augsburg, would take so long to return with the written response, he would have come to visit Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] But finally, he has returned and reports (just like the letters he brought with him) of the rapidly increasing plague epidemic in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The imperial estates, but not the imperial cities, have unanimously given their consent to Emperor Charles V for the continuation of the Council of Trent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Last week, King Ferdinand, Margrave [correct: Elector Joachim II] of Brandenburg and his wife [Hedwig Jagiellon of Poland], as well as Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, arrived in Augsburg. The arrival of Duke William V of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, his wife [Maria of Austria], and Queen Maria is expected daily.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Everything goes according to the will of the Papists. Even the [Protestant] princes, including the traitors, are treated according to their rank. They are taxed and finely relieved of their money!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Emperor and King urgently demand aid funds from the estates against the Turkish Sultan Suleiman and even want an advance required for several years. Thus, one slowly but surely falls into servitude!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Frölich did his utmost for the freedom of Konstanz. Now it no longer depends on him! As for himself, he will now have to learn to live under servitude until God lets a better time dawn.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Greetings, also to Haller and all the scholars.</p>

      <p>Greetings. That we agree so well with each other, Bullinger, the most esteemed of all whom my age has seen, never fails to cheer me up! Your recent letter sent to me in Konstanz greatly encouraged me, as it reminded me of the heavenly and eternal seats of happiness. If it should never happen that we see each other again here, may we meet in the heavenly homeland! Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have represented the case of the excellent man Sebastian Schertlin here on behalf of the Augsburg council, and indeed most faithfully, but the troubles that arise for me from this are difficult to describe. I am informed that some riders, while I was traveling here a few days ago, followed my tracks and inquired about me in the inns. Meanwhile, I am informed that our council is very displeased with my absence so far, even though I am their envoy! I would indeed disregard such empty irritations if the foolishness of people were not to be greatly feared by me. I hope, with God's guidance, to return home soon. However, I am anxious about how I will be received there. For besides the fact that impious soldiers now occupy our republic and no good person has their body, goods, children, or wife safe, a great plague is rampant there. Moreover, I can promise myself nothing good from our council. Nevertheless, I will return with the Lord accompanying and guiding me. You, as you are accustomed to do, should call upon the Lord for the steadfastness of Laetus.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>After I have returned home, I will urge our booksellers to acquire some copies of your history from Froschauer in due time. I earnestly request you to send me two copies as soon as possible (one, if possible, elegantly bound; the other unbound). You will receive the money through reimbursement.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The people of Konstanz offer submission, but under such conditions that I have no hope of obtaining it. It is, in essence, only a purification of conscience before God. It will be your task to support good men with help at some point!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell and diligently greet my Haller along with all yours and mine.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have spent more days here than I thought, otherwise, I would have made the journey to you. However, I had to wait every hour for a response from Augsburg, to which I had sent a messenger quickly - which intercepted my journey to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Today, finally, the messenger returned to me, announcing the great rage of the growing plague in Augsburg, as the letters also declare.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The imperial estates, with the exception of the cities, have unanimously agreed with the Emperor to the Council of Trent.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Last week, King Ferdinand, the Margrave of Brandenburg with his wife, and Duke Henry of Brunswick arrived in Augsburg. The arrival of Duke of Cleves with his wife and Queen Maria is expected daily.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Everything is done according to the will of the Papists. Even our princes, among whom are traitors, are treated according to their rank: They are taxed and finely relieved of their money.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The Emperor and King urgently demand financial aid from the estates against the Turks, and indeed for several years. In this way, one gradually falls into servitude.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I have done everything I could for the freedom of Konstanz. Now it is the matter of others, not mine! I will learn to live in servile conditions until, if it pleases the Lord, a better light dawns.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Farewell. I sincerely wish my Haller and the entire circle of scholars to be safe. November 5, 1547. Yours, Georg Laetus, etc.</p>
