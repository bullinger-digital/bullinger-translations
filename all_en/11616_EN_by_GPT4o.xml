    <p xml:id="regest1">Has survived so far along with his family, as have the [city] pastors with their families; the plague has not subsided, although considering the population size of the city, one cannot speak of an actual raging of the epidemic; per week, sometimes 30, sometimes 20, sometimes 40 inhabitants die. Has nothing new to report from Basel and Bern, except that Beat [Gering], who was excluded from the Zurich clergy [in 1538] due to adultery, is said to have been appointed as a pastor [at the Minster Church] in Bern from Strasbourg; suspects nothing good, as Gering is exceedingly arrogant and of bad character, which he has pointed out to leading figures in Bern. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I am still alive by the grace of the Lord, most esteemed Vadian, and my family is well, indeed all of us here, the ministers of the word of the Lord, along with our families, are well. However, the plague has not yet subsided, and for some, it is still quite severe; although, considering the size of the city and the frequency of the population, no one can say that the plague is raging. Throughout the entire week, sometimes 30, sometimes 20, sometimes 40 pass away, and those who pass, do so with great faith and religion, so much so that those who watch praise God and fear less for the day. I have nothing memorable from Basel and Bern, except that they say Beat [Gering], who last year was stripped of his priesthood and ministry by the Zurichers due to adultery, is being called from Strasbourg to Bern for the ministry of the word, from which I fear some disturbances may arise; for he is a man of exceedingly arrogant and depraved character. I have warned some of the leading figures; but perhaps it is fated that they should have such a one. May the Lord be with us all and keep you safe for us. I will strive to repay my love and devotion to you as long as I live. Farewell. Zurich, 1st of October, in the year 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Joachim Vadian, the most prudent consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord.</p>
