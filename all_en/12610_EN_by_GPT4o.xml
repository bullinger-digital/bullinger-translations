    <p xml:id="regest1">It is still said that Martin von Rossem was recalled due to the threat to Friesland by the Danish [King Christian III.]. Some claim that [Maximilian von Egmont, Count] of Buren crossed the Rhine at Bingen and used the help of a Mainz canon with the nickname "Leuis" [Siegfried Hundt von Wenckheim]; others, however, say that he did not cross the river but occupied both banks. Consequently, the people of Strasbourg sent out scouts, who have not yet returned. There is fear of Buren's army. But until it reaches the Danube, much can still happen! [Matthias] Erb wrote that Buren intended to invade Württemberg. Others think he plans to move over the Hunsrück, as [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse did. Strange that no one opposes him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bernhard [Meyer zum Pfeil], [whom Myconius met by chance] explained [the reason they hardly see each other anymore] as his many obligations (probably due to the upcoming meeting in Aarau, to which he has already departed) and further joked that he never meets Myconius anywhere!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [Antoine] Morelet [du Museau], the envoy of King [Francis I.] of France [in the Confederation], sent a Frenchman [...] to the camp of the Emperor [Charles V.] and the Landgrave a few weeks ago. On August 31, he was back in Basel. He reported that Ingolstadt and the Spaniards there had made an agreement with the [Schmalkaldic League]. When Charles V. heard this, he supposedly decided to leave Regensburg with his army to attack the [Schmalkaldic League]. When the Spaniards in Ingolstadt heard of this, they confiscated two wagons of provisions from the [Schmalkaldic League]. Meanwhile, Charles V. reportedly declared war on the Landgrave through an envoy [...]. The latter then camped at a suitable location, and when he heard that 2,500 imperial cavalry intended to attack him, he drove them to flight with 3,000 cavalry. About 40 riders and some arquebusiers were laid down. The Landgrave lost only one man [Christof von Bodenhausen]. Prisoners dressed in velvet [Aurelio Ruffino and Bartolomeo dal Monte] confessed that the Emperor had promised to cover their attack, but he turned back as soon as he saw the enemies. A Strasbourg envoy [Heinrich Walther] confirmed this news and further reported that the [Schmalkaldic League] intended to attack the Emperor as soon as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Emperor rejected the declaration of war [the "protest letter" of the princes] and threatened the young noble bearer [... von Plato] with death by hanging instead of imprisonment. He would accept nothing from the Landgrave and his followers, over whom he has imposed the imperial ban! Will God tolerate such insolence?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The city clerk [Heinrich Ryhiner] reported that the King of Denmark is moving against the enemy. This had not been possible for him so far due to the resistance of some nobles and their trade relations with Holland, as well as a [peace] treaty concluded with the Emperor in Speyer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Allegedly, [Duke] Maurice [of Saxony] and [Elector Joachim II of] Brandenburg have tried to mediate between the hostile parties. Myconius cannot believe this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [The Francesco di] Castellalto mentioned by Bullinger is unknown to Myconius. He also does not know where Heiterwang is. Bullinger should have reported whether he was concerned about the [Alpine] passes and the Ehrenberg fortress. Myconius thought that everything on this side of the passes was safe and is surprised that the [Schmalkaldic League] is withdrawing their forces [from there]! Wouldn't it be time for [the Protestant Confederates] (who are afraid of what is not to be feared) to attack now? God might punish their fearful attitude! May he convert them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The [letter enclosure] will be returned by Myconius after reading.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [P.S.:] If the Five [Places] feel more obliged to the Emperor than to their Confederates, then they have probably allied themselves with "Jösli" [the Pope? the Devil?]!</p>

      <p>S. The rumor about Martin von Rossem remains that he was recalled because of the Dane, who threatens Friesland. It was said that [Maximilian von Egmont, Count] of Buren crossed the Rhine with the help of a traitorous canon from Mainz, nicknamed Leuis, near Bingen; now it is said that he did not cross, but occupied both banks. The people of Strasbourg sent scouts, who I assume have not yet returned. We both share the same fear about that army. However, you know, many things fall between the cup and the lip. Why shouldn't even more things fall between this army and the Danube?</p>

      <p>I gently reproached Lord Bernhard. He excused himself with his obligations and that I never meet him anywhere. However, he has given nothing since, perhaps because of the Aarau meeting, to which he has gone.</p>

      <p>On the last day of August, a messenger from both the camp of Charles and Hesse, sent a few weeks ago by the French envoy Morelet, arrived. He reported that Ingolstadt had sworn allegiance to our side along with the Spaniards there. Charles understood this and left Regensburg with all his troops to meet ours. The Spaniards, realizing this after our departure, immediately defected and retained two wagons full of provisions with their drivers. Meanwhile, Charles sent a message to Hesse announcing a battle. The good man chose a suitable field and awaited him, and while they were eating, he was warned that 2,500 cavalry were near, each bringing a gunner with a hook. Immediately, 3,000 cavalry were prepared to meet them, engaged, and drove the enemies to flight, with about 40 horsemen and some gunners laid down, losing only one of their own. Some prisoners, covered in velvet, reported that the Emperor had promised to accompany them, but immediately retreated upon seeing the enemies. Upon hearing this from the Frenchman, some believed it, some did not, and while they hesitated, a Strasbourg messenger arrived bringing the same news, with the addition that our side intended to attack Charles as soon as possible, with up to 40,000 troops. Unless the cunning one escapes, something will happen by Sunday. We must pray to our Lord Jesus Christ not to abandon us for His glory and the growth of the church.</p>

      <p>The most insolent Charles (whom the Lord hates) scorned the declaration of war, ordering the young noble to leave unless he preferred a noose to a chain. He considered Hesse and his followers unworthy, as they were excommunicated by him again and again, to receive anything from them. It is strange if God tolerates such arrogance any longer.</p>

      <p>Our scribe told me yesterday that the Dane is advancing with a very strong army against the enemy. He has been hindered so far by nobles who have lucrative trade with the Dutch and some treaty made in Speyer with the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have no certain news about Maurice and the Brandenburgian. A very foolish rumor has flown these days about both, that they are trying to make peace between the hostile parties, which I cannot narrate, lest I seem to give it any credence.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I do not know the name Castelalteri, and I do not know where Ayterwangen is. I wish you had added whether you feared the mountain passes and the Ehrenberg fortress. I had thought everything was safe on this side of the passes. And it is indeed strange that all our people have left and no one is left to guard the home! Why don't we finally go out? Do not the situation and the time call us? But we fear where there was no need to fear. I fear the Lord may turn that fear into our ruin. May He convert us and avert His wrath from us! May He attend to our aid, if we are His, so that we may be saved! Amen.</p>
