      <p>To the most pious, upright, and learned man, pastor of the church in Zürich, my most esteemed father, Matthieu Coignet wishes peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Since I have been honored and favored with such a great honor and duty (revered father) by you, that you have not disdained to write to me, I must also consider how I might best repay you, lest I be accused by you not only of negligence but also of ingratitude. For I will never allow myself to forget the humanity and paternal love of such a great man, as long as God grants me a sound mind in a healthy body. What then shall I repay you? With what letters, with what praises shall I celebrate your sweet and honeyed old age? I can hardly ever do so worthily enough, even if I had a hundred tongues and a hundred mouths, and a voice of iron.</p>
      <p>Such great benefits bestowed upon me, such a benevolent and inclined spirit cannot be adorned by the speech of any eloquent man, let alone by mine (who am just beginning to greet the Muses). I feel so bound to you that I cannot even conceive, let alone repay, the smallest part of your merits towards me.</p>
      <p>For I do not doubt that, although at this time, due to the weakness of my age and intellect, I may be less able to respond to you with duties and letters, yet in some part (for in all things it is impossible) at some time, by the grace of the best and greatest God, I may be granted the ability to do so. But whatever it is, I am certain that you will receive it with a serene countenance and equal benevolence, due to your humanity and singular kindness towards me. But lest I seem to interrupt you with my empty words rather than bring some joy, I will inform you briefly about my health and condition, as well as my studies, since I am persuaded that this will be pleasing to you. As for my health, know that I am enjoying the best of health by the grace of the best and greatest God, from whom I pray that you may always enjoy the same with his clemency and kindness, with the greatest joy of your soul. On the 3rd of August, I came to Heidelberg, where, as I hope, we will remain for some time until these civil wars become somewhat more peaceful and the academy in Paris is restored to its former state and flourishes as before, which indeed was once filled with roses and fragrant flowers, but now is left with thorns and brambles or rather none at all.</p>
      <p>This place, however, is flourishing and filled with the most learned men, which indeed compelled us to come here, so that we might not only learn the language from these regions but also acquire some erudition. I promise you that I will strive with all my might (as they say) to ensure that I do not appear to bring disgrace to my homeland, this academy, and its professors. My dearest father is still in Paris with the whole family, very, as I think, anxious and disturbed because of these times of the republic and the miserable state of all of France. But the best and greatest God, as he is accustomed to protect and preserve his own, will also rescue him from the teeth of these fierce wolves and place him in a safe place when it seems best to him, and I strongly suspect that you may see him unexpectedly in a short time, which, however, I do not know for certain. Some days have passed since I wrote to him; however, I do not know if the letters have been delivered to him because of the dangers of the roads. As for what you write to me, that if I can conveniently, I should greet him in your name through letters, that indeed cannot be done by me in any way; for I am so far from daring to mention you, that I hardly dare to inform him about my studies and health. Nevertheless, as soon as the opportunity presents itself, I will not omit any duty. The fears of war are now so great that hardly anyone dares to undertake a journey; for you know that everything in civil wars is miserable, which indeed has been brought about by the wickedness and contempt of the word of God by one man (who is the most wicked of all whom the earth has borne). Yet this consoles me, that our God is a firm protection and defense, and no one can attempt anything against his will, and to speak with Tibullus:... Who can bear arms against the gods?</p>
      <p>I will write no more. Take care (my revered father) that you and your entire family are well. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Heidelberg on the 7th of October.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and upright man, endowed with all kinds of virtues, minister of the church in Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, father. In Zürich.</p>
