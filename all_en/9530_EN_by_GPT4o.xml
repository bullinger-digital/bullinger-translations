      <p>Dear godfather, I have spoken with the old lord bailiff Pfendler, Herr Jacob Francken, who is also very sorry that he has been called away from you to another place. The opinion is: upon your request four years ago for another preacher, my gracious lords of Zürich took this Herr Jacob from a good benefice that he had held in Weningen and appointed him to Schwanden, hoping that they would provide him with better compensation in Schwanden according to their offer. But now, since nothing has happened and he must suffer want in these difficult, expensive times, having also spent what he had saved with you, my gracious lords are obliged to grant him another and better benefice so that he may be compensated for his troubles and provide something for his children. For my gracious lords well consider that if he were to pass away and his children had nothing, they would be left without support, as they would not keep them in the land but send them away at the first opportunity. Now, as my gracious lords have reconsidered, they wish to prevent this again, and he would have to pay for his well-being, which my gracious lords would not do soon. However, I thought he might stay with you if they were to grant him a decent benefice and income in Schwanden, like the one he is now called to, or like the one he left when he came to you. Herr Jacob would also accept this with thanks and, as before, serve you further, and all the more willingly, as he would not have to delay. He replied: "Who knows, if our Confederates from Zürich were to grant us something decent upon our request, what would happen; for he himself may well consider that it would be unfair if they were to deny him and his children a better fortune, etc." I inform you, dear godfather, so that you can meet their request more appropriately; for if they grant him a benefice (as is only fair), like the one he is now called to, I ask you, my gracious lords, to let him stay with us in our churches for the good; but if they do not do this, it is clear that they do not mean it seriously, as the benefice and church are well provided for and they do not have to spend a penny; thus, he would not be left to pay for his well-being, but they would dismiss him and send him to the place to which he is then regularly called, etc.</p>
      <p>I can well imagine that my gracious lords, especially Herr Ammann Schüler, would be somewhat displeased; this would be a fine compromise; for if they do not do this, they would be rejecting their own request, etc.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zürich, my faithful, dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
