      <p>S. We experience daily, most learned and esteemed Bullinger, the truth of what you write about Satan's snares and efforts against the students and beneficiaries of the church. I shudder when I think of this and when I recall in my memory the wounds that that ancient enemy has inflicted on the church with this one pursuit. This will indeed seem less surprising to us if we consider how hostily that irreconcilable enemy attacks our ministry and what disasters he brings upon it.</p>
      <p>He brings us this one benefit with his wicked efforts, that he reminds us to become more vigilant day by day and to pay more diligent attention, as the apostle exhorts us, first to ourselves, then to the whole flock, and especially to those who are being prepared as a kind of seminary for the church and ministry, who will either assist our labors while we are still alive or succeed us after we have completed our task and happily finished our course.</p>
      <p>Let us do what is in our power; the Lord will provide the rest. Let us take care not to knowingly and willingly share in the sins of others. Let us consider how dear that flock is to Christ, which he himself has purchased with his own blood, and what shepherds we appoint over it, as long as the care of it is entrusted to us and we are given the ability to procure its salvation.</p>
      <p>There is nothing to add to my previous letters. We have nothing more about Bindschedler than what has been written.</p>
      <p>I saw him very frequently in sacred assemblies. When he was summoned by us to give an account of the offense we had heard he committed, he defended his case more modestly than the other and, having confessed the offense, promised better things. The other one most impudently evaded until he saw himself clearly caught. You will hear about their studies from the testimony of my professors and colleagues from the rector. Tobler conducted himself most modestly and kindly, as far as we have discovered. Although there is a widespread rumor about the severity of the plague among us, it is not as great as is proclaimed, nor have the professors ceased to lecture publicly. Another school is closed because the children are being called back by their parents. From the Council of Trent, we have no other decrees than those that can proceed from that bloodthirsty spirit, who has been a murderer from the beginning. The impious communicate; but our leader is not unaware of those communications and plans; let them proceed as far as he will loosen the reins.</p>
      <p>But he has set limits within which they will be compelled to contain themselves. It is our task to fight against these Amalekites with prayers, with hands lifted to heaven like Moses; he who has conquered the world will undoubtedly conquer in us. If we are not superior in strength and power, we will certainly be superior in the goodness of our cause and in spirit, if the Lord wills to grant us constancy and courage worthy of our ministry. If we ask for this from him with constant prayers, it will not be denied to those who ask. Happy are those who have learned to live for Christ and to somewhat despise the fear of death with steadfast faith in him. All of ours greet you most lovingly, especially those whom you greeted by name. Greet the fellow ministers in the name of all of us and keep us recommended in your prayers. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, May 10, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Pierre Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zürich church, brother and most esteemed fellow minister. In Zürich.</p>
