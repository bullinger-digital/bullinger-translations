      <p>S. D. I received the letter you wrote on December 12th, most illustrious man and father in Christ, most revered, on the 15th of the same month, along with those things you received from a friend in St. Gallen, for which I reverently give thanks. I do not doubt that the Lord will soon raise up someone, beyond all expectation, to defend His church, which seems almost beyond hope. I fear that our people at the Baden assembly may trust too much in the cunning envoy, who has often deceived our people before with his honeyed words.</p>
      <p>Regarding the papal document that I translated and sprinkled with brief admonitions, as you advised, I completed it the same day your letter was delivered to me; for I sent that document to Mr. Martin Peyer, who lives in the countryside, so that he might arrange for it to be printed in Basel; however, I added nothing except what the words of that Rabshakeh extorted, using such moderation that I might rouse all Germans, both evangelical and papist, not to abandon our homeland and ancestral freedom to the tyranny of the popes, the French, and the Spaniards, betraying the faith given to the empire, etc.</p>
      <p>I return the news, which you also shared with us from St. Gallen, as you requested.</p>
      <p>I am also sending a German poem composed by me more at night than during the day, not because I think your humanity needs these trifles, but so that you may know what my thoughts and those of my friends are. Would that our people might be freed from the French alliance, lest they soon miserably perish with the robbers.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with all yours. Mr. Burgower and Mr. Peyer, along with all the brothers, send their regards to your humanity and your fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Written in great haste on December 17th, in the year of our Lord 1572. Your most devoted servant, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful overseer of the church in Zürich, his lord and father in Christ, most revered.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
