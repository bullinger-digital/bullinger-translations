      <p>In many ways, I owe you much, most esteemed man; both because you have always embraced me with the utmost benevolence and charity, and because you have not disdained to write to me so diligently and even frequently. For all of which, since I cannot return equal favor, I will nonetheless give the greatest thanks, and I will gladly and perpetually acknowledge that I am much indebted to you for your singular humanity.</p>
      <p>That I write to you more rarely, I wish you to attribute not to my negligence, but to the fact that more rarely (especially in these most turbulent times, when everything is ablaze with war, tumults, and slaughters) are couriers found who travel to you. For there is no man to whom I would more willingly write than to Lord Bullinger, whom I have always loved greatly for his utmost humanity, and whom I have greatly revered for his singular erudition, rare piety, and other outstanding virtues. For when I revolve in my mind, which I do very often, with what favor and grace I was received by you, how fraternally and humanely you treated me as an exile, and in what great happiness I seemed to live among you; nothing is more in my wishes than that, freed from these cares and anxieties, with which I am now overwhelmed, I might spend the rest of my time in Zürich as a pilgrim and private individual. Such thoughts occur to me daily, and there is nothing I would rather wish for. But I see that this cannot be. I was not born for myself: our church, which is most grievously agitated in these worst times and is unfortunately disturbed, vehemently demands my effort: I do not dare to desert the bride of Christ in peril; for my conscience would protest and accuse me of treason. New orators arise from among us, foolish young men, who, since they despise authority and do not endure superiors, wish the entire state of our church, piously established and confirmed and stabilized by the highest consensus of the best, to be utterly removed and eradicated: and they strive to fabricate some new form of church for us. And you would not believe with what applause this new face of things is embraced both by the people and the nobility.</p>
      <p>The people love changes and seek freedom; the nobility, however, seeks utility. These good men give both, and that abundantly. But so that you may better understand the whole matter, you will receive the sum of the controversy reduced to certain heads: 1. The civil magistrate has no right in ecclesiastical matters. He is only a member of the church, whose governance should be in the hands of ecclesiastical men. 2. The Church of Christ admits no other governance than that alone which is through the presbytery: namely, through the minister, elders, and deacon. 3. The names and authority of archbishops, archdeacons, deans, chancellors, commissioners, with such titles and dignities, should be entirely removed from the Church of Christ. 4. Each parish should have its own presbytery. 5. The election of ministers necessarily pertains to the people. 6. Goods, possessions, lands, revenues, titles, honors, authorities, and whatever else pertains either to bishops or to cathedral churches, and which are now rightfully due to them, should be utterly taken away and abolished forever. 7. No one should preach unless he is the pastor of some flock; and he should have a sermon only among his own flock, not elsewhere. 8. The infants of papists are not to be baptized. 9. The judicial laws of Moses pertain to Christian princes, and they should not depart from them by a nail's breadth.</p>
      <p>There are many other things of the same kind, no less absurd, which I will not mention; all of which, if I judge anything, do not contribute to the good and peace of the church, but to ruin and confusion. Remove authority, and the people rush into every crime.</p>
      <p>Remove the patrimony of the church, and by the same effort, you will take away not only good letters but also religion itself. But now I seem to be prejudging the matter.</p>
      <p>I greatly desire, most learned man, to hear your opinion and that of Lord Gwalter, Lord Simler, and the other brothers on these matters, which I would gladly follow as sound and agreeable to the word of God.</p>
      <p>For if your judgment were interposed in the whole controversy, without a doubt it would contribute much to the peace of our church. These good men loudly proclaim that they have all the reformed churches standing on their side.</p>
      <p>I will say nothing about the state of our republic: so far everything is peaceful; but it is to be feared that these internal dissensions may eventually lead to the ruin of the country.</p>
      <p>I send to your lordship as much English cloth as is sufficient to make you a gown. Use it, I pray, and for your humanity, consider it kindly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed man, and in your prayers commend me to God, I pray.</p>
      <p>In haste. London in England, August 15, 1573 Your brother in Christ, Edwin Sandys, Bishop of London.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man and his dearest brother, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Switzerland.</p>
