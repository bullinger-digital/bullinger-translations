      <p>Greetings. I cannot respond and write much now due to the hurried departure of Rasdorfer. His case was presented to the senate yesterday and was finally resolved today; he was accepted under the condition which I had kept suspended for him until now, but with great difficulty; however, the plan succeeded, since it was initiated by the Lord.</p>
      <p>If only Musculus's case would succeed as happily! There are those who still desire in that declaration of his that the explanation of the word "IS" by "signifies" is not explicitly stated, although he does state things that necessarily prove that "IS" should be explained in this way; otherwise, all the doctrines, which he himself asserted, would collapse. What makes them urge this is that they found in his commentaries a passage where he warns that this explanation should be avoided. Indeed, that passage seems very harsh to me as well.</p>
      <p>I am only informing you of this so that you are not unaware of our judgment. I will explain how reluctantly I retained this condition for Rasdorfer's arrival; for it will also be appropriate for you to know this. Adam Piper (whom you know) came here these days, summoned by his son, the schoolmaster of Burgdorf, who had been led by some to hope that this condition would be granted to him. He came expecting nothing else. However, when we understood by what means this had been done, and that he had come without our knowledge and that of the lords of Zürich, and that he was only following the amount of the salary, we ensured that he not only suffered a simple rejection but also a disgraceful one from our leaders, some of whom nevertheless tried to impose this poor man on this church. But the Lord dissolved their plan and promoted ours, which I hope will be very beneficial for the church.</p>
      <p>As for your advice, I have not yet disclosed anything to Apiarius. I recently wrote mine through some nobles, whom I suppose have been with you in the meantime. I wrote those letters before lunch; during lunch, I began to recognize them, as they had once been familiar to me in Tübingen with Dr. Volmar; but as they were leaving immediately, I could not change the letters. But I cannot write more now.</p>
      <p>Through the next messenger, I will write more to you and Dr. Musculus, whom I wish to be in the best health with your family and his. Farewell, most esteemed and beloved father.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 6, 1548.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, forever yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Bullinger, his dearest father and lord to be respected. Zürich.</p>
