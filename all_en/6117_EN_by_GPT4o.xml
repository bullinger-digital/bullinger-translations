      <p>I wrote to you not long ago, dear Bullinger, and I do not doubt that you have already received both letters. Since that time, we have received no news; but the domestic calamity, I mean Calvin's lamented health, torments us more and more, and I ask you, my father, with all your colleagues, to continue what you are doing, that is, to earnestly commend both the faithful servant of God to his Lord and this entire church to the faithful guardian of our souls. Furthermore, the Italian brothers of the Lyon church have urgently requested me to write to you about obtaining our Zanchi. To confess to you the truth, since in these matters especially, opinions and judgments should be free, I would have gladly refrained from this subject of writing; therefore, I only say this, if it can be done, that he be granted to the people of Lyon, there is great hope that his arrival will be most fruitful. For that city is like another Corinth, into which we see many even from those whose restless spirits our church neither could nor should bear, flocking. It is certain, therefore, that especially in that place, where they will be allowed to incline now to this side, now to that, with impunity, they will dare many things among their fellow countrymen, to whom I wish simplicity would always be pleasing. Unless someone is opposed to them, who can immediately restrain the curious with authority and arguments, we fear not in vain that the audacity of the wicked will easily become such that even the good will be endangered.</p>
      <p>I speak of the Italians; for as far as our own people are concerned, although they are human, I think, however, by the grace of God, they are so provided for that I hope the truth of Christ will remain entirely intact among them, whatever Satan may plot.</p>
      <p>But enough of these matters; for I do not doubt that the Lord will suggest to you and to the brothers of the Rhaetian churches and even to our Zanchi himself, of whose excellent will I have no doubt, what is just and beneficial for the church. Farewell, my father.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus preserve both you and your colleagues, brothers whom I hold in the highest regard, and bless all our labors! I cannot even bear to look at the writing of Brentius without feeling nauseated.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I am in better health than recently, although remnants of asthma remain. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Geneva, April 22.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed father, the truly faithful pastor of the Zurich church. In Zurich.</p>
