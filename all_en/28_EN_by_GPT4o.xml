    <p xml:id="regest1">Here they are, the [Bernese] students [Jonas Danmatter, Johannes Fädminger, Johann Knechtenhofer, and Abel Mühlhofer], whom Bullinger has already heard about several times and who have undoubtedly been expected in Zurich for a long time. None of the Bernese know what they have learned in Strasbourg so far (apart from Lutheranism).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Two [of the students] stayed for a few days with Pfister in the [Bernese Barfüsser College]. When he asked one of them after the meal how things were in Strasbourg, how many and what kind of professors there were at the school, and what studies he himself was engaged in, he received only a hesitant evasive answer. When they later discussed languages, Pfister had a Greek edition of the [New] Testament brought in and asked the student to read aloud, which he found difficult. Pfister only wanted to find out how Greek is pronounced in Strasbourg (Bullinger, believe him!). For the Strasbourg professors, as Pfister thinks, have a more doubtful pronunciation in this regard than all others he has ever heard from the scholars he otherwise knows. When he asked the student if he understood the text he had read and pressed for an answer, the student finally replied after some silence that he had not come to dispute. Thereupon, Pfister treated him a bit more strictly and sent him away. Such "polite" behavior the good boy has acquired in Strasbourg... Based on these explanations, Bullinger can consider how best to counteract this roughness or rather stubbornness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Jodocus Kilchmeyer has already reported on the Zofingen negotiation [with hbbw XIX, No. 2747, from January 11, 1547].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Pfister joins Kilchmeyer's request to the Zurichers not to send boys who are too old [as scholarship holders] to Bern, as the teaching in Bern [for more advanced students] is still inadequate. Pfister has to teach the basics of the three languages [Latin, Greek, and Hebrew] [all by himself]. Bullinger cannot imagine the great ignorance the school had to endure for years. Pfister could not find anyone in his class who was able to decline the word "Euterpe" without difficulty. Many summarized their studies by knowing how to say in a very Lutheran way what "This is my body" means.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings, also to Theodor Bibliander and Konrad Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Nikolaus Pfister to his Heinrich Bullinger, greetings. Here, most learned man, are our students, about whom you have often heard and whom, I believe, you have long expected. None of us know how they have been educated or in what studies they have engaged (except for Lutheranism).</p>

      <p>Two of them stayed with me for a few days in the monastery, and when I asked one of them after dinner what was happening in Strasbourg, how many and what kind of professors the school had, and what studies he himself had pursued, he responded hesitantly and almost dismissively to all these questions. Later, we fell into a conversation about languages, especially the Greek language. I ordered the Greek Testament to be brought in and urged him to read it. He read, but with difficulty. I inquired about his method of reading (see my audacity, to put it mildly) only to clearly understand how the Strasbourg professors pronounced Greek. For here, in my opinion, they pronounce it more crudely than all the learned men I have heard. I asked if he understood what he had recited. He was silent. I pressed on. Finally, he replied that he was not here for the sake of disputation. After he had uttered this, he was dismissed by me a bit more sternly. This is the civility that good young man learned in Strasbourg! However, I wrote this not for any other reason than so you might infer from this how to remedy this rusticity or, as I feel, stubbornness.</p>

      <p>Lord Jodocus has written to you about the Zofingen matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>He also advised you, as I do, not to send boys of more advanced age here, for our studies are still lacking. I am forced to begin with the rudiments in the three languages. You cannot believe how much ignorance and barbarism our school has been shrouded in for several years. In my school, I found no one who could decline "Euterpe" without difficulty. Most have focused their studies on knowing, in a Lutheran manner, what "This is my body" means.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell, most learned man. Bern, the day before the calends of February. Greet Lord Bibliander and Lord Pellican very much on my behalf.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a man distinguished for his sounder doctrine and notable for the integrity of his life, etc.</p>
