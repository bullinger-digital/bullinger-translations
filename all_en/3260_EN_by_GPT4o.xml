      <p>With the letters already sealed, behold, I receive letters from Habsperg, in which your relative is summoned by the marquis's envoys to RÃ¶tteln, where I too am called to go tomorrow morning. At this hour, having also written my letters, I send a messenger to the relative, and we will meet tomorrow, nor do I doubt that everything will be arranged for him in the best way. Hastily from Basel.</p>
