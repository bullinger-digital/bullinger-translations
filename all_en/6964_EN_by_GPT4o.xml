      <p>It is time, most excellent man, that I soon prepare myself for the journey and revisit the passes of the Alps under your command, which may the best and greatest God allow to happen successfully. If you would be willing (which I would humbly ask) to recommend me either to the honorable consul or to one of the brothers, indeed a great addition to my reputation, which among the foremost Rhaetians I have none at all, will be made. I will not travel alone, but with a leader, the Lord, who in the meantime can be present with my people here and return me to them unharmed. However, letters of faith and authority will be given by our most honorable senate, which Mr. Cellarius will sign and by which the Fabrician orchard will be assigned to the priesthood of Chur. Conveniently, in these letters, the people of Chur could be reminded, even with a hint, not to allow me to have a meager stipend amidst the high cost of everything, considering what I had to leave behind here for their sake. Unless this reminder is included in the present letters, no opportunity will be received henceforth to do this, and thus I will have to succumb to the most miserable fortune contrary to your custom. I beg you by all the gods, my most revered father, not to (which, however, may be done without your inconvenience) fail me in this matter. Nothing in return will be so difficult that it will not be a pleasure for me to endure for your sake.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man, and have me, wretched, entrusted to your faith. May the Lord keep you safe for us forever for the glory of His name and the salvation of the church. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. Russikon, December 16, 1566.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered patron.</p>
