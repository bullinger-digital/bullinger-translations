      <p>Greetings. Recently, dear brother, I did not respond to your letters; for I lacked the leisure. Now regarding the thousand crowns to be borrowed, I respond that I can scarcely acquire as many coins and I do not wish to promise interest to anyone against our laws. Let them handle their business through others than you and me; we are not moneylenders nor brokers of usury. The rest of your matters require no response. Now indeed our Dscharnerus offers me those brief letters of yours. At the beginning of the bundle sent to me, mention is made; if you mean the one you sent eight days ago, it has been returned to me; if you have sent another in the meantime, it has not yet been returned to me. But I write this at 7 in the morning; perhaps it will be returned later. I hasten to write this, lest business later prevent me from writing, etc. For several days now, I have received no letters from friends in Germany or elsewhere. The last were written in Heidelberg on July 18, indicating that Prince of Orange, with a well-equipped infantry and 4000 cavalry, had crossed the Meuse after capturing the very strong cities of Roermond and Venlo and was advancing further. On the other side, his brother, Count Ludwig of Nassau, was pressing on with his Huguenots; indeed, almost all of Gelderland and Friesland, and finally all of Holland except for the three cities of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and Delft, as well as all of Zeeland, were held by the Gueux; recently, Flushing was almost recaptured by treachery. For many Spaniards had already entered the city; but soon all were slaughtered. Meanwhile, I do not know what fortunate or unfortunate events have occurred; that delay and the slow progress of the war arouse my suspicion. If I learn anything, I will share it; if you have any news from Italy, share it in return.</p>
      <p>An uncertain rumor spreads that the Bishop of Constance has been made pope, I think Empser. If true, danger has been created for the Rhaetians. I do not believe it to be true. It is also said that the Venetians, at great cost, have bought peace from the Turks; others contend that they are still in arms, and that the Turks have taken Zadar, also called Zara, and have completely lifted the siege of Novi Castle, with the Venetians who were in that siege utterly destroyed; but the Venetians prohibit anyone from writing or spreading any news, good or bad.</p>
      <p>I am eager to know what is happening. What your Gregory writes about the slain son of Alba, I have not yet heard. It is said that the King of Navarre celebrated his marriage with the sister of the king on the 5th of this month.</p>
      <p>Hiemitt sends you Froschower some printed copies of the Roggenstock, thanks you kindly and greets you warmly. I have prepared it as well as I could so that they come to you clean; I have kept the archetype and given it to Mr. Johann Jacob Wick. If you want it back, it shall be returned to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your household and all our friends and brothers, whom you will greet in order.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 8, 7 in the morning, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
