      <p>Greetings in the Lord. The reason I do not write to you during this clamor of war is because of Myconius, who is incredibly delighted if he has the opportunity to write to you, and whatever has been written to me so far, I have shared with Myconius so that he may write to you, and he has solemnly promised to do so. He asks me daily about new matters, and if I have anything, I immediately bring it forth. He is a good old man and rejoices over small things, to whom I willingly comply in all things.</p>

      <p>Alsace, Sundgau, and Breisgau are completely calm. Nobles inquire daily among us about what is happening with the Hessian army.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>They are most afraid for themselves and do not know where to turn. They curse Emperor Charles V, who attempts to instigate such a war in Germany; through which he seeks to either completely destroy Germany or subject it to the yoke of servitude.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Basel, July 31, 1546. Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, Rudolf Gwalther, and Johannes Fries, etc.</p>
      <p>To his dear Heinrich Bullinger. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
