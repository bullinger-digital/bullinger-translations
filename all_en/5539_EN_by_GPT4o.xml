      <p>S. The rumors are so varied and vain that, although I would often like to write, I am finally filled with shame and do not dare. This is how things stand now, and as I perceive, the same happens to you; for you cautiously omitted in your letters what others have indicated to me from your mouth, indeed from writings sent to you, by which you could have greatly delighted me, namely the splendid victory of the Condé's forces against the Guises. I see, therefore, that you are wavering and hesitating between hope and fear, and I wish I could remove all doubt from you with my words! However, I can affirm that the same is preached among us; yet no one dares to affirm it for certain. Everyone hopes and wishes it to be true; I wish that soon either you could confirm this to me or I to you! I can affirm this to you as certain, as reported to me by the treasurer Emanuel, who heard this in Neuchâtel from the chief of the Savoyard legates, that out of 28 well-equipped Spanish ships, only three escaped and arrived tattered in port. They complain not so much about the men and other things lost as about the ships, which (as they themselves said) served to defend the Christian world and could hardly be repaired at great expense. Meanwhile, I have received nothing at all about Adresius; I do not distrust the man, although he is human and also subject to human vanities. Nothing has been done in Neuchâtel; the matter is postponed until April.</p>
      <p>I gave your letters to the returning consul; he thanks you and promises to remember the matters you wrote to him about. Meanwhile, he asks that you do not take it badly that he himself does not reply; for he cannot due to his occupations.</p>
      <p>And I can certainly affirm this to be true; for he bears a very laborious office, and it is a wonder that he is not soon exhausted by it, as he is otherwise more than sufficiently weak. I have spoken with Mr. Rudolf Hermann myself; he complains bitterly about the importunity of his father. He wanted to nurture him with him; but he himself did not want this and, not content with his own sustenance, he has incurred large sums to be paid in inns and many other things of this kind. Meanwhile, it is the opinion that he promised me, he wants to go himself to Zurich, and if he never wants to stay with him, he will at least give him an annual allowance, which can be expected honorably; he had also previously offered this before the dean of the Langenthal chapter; you can inform him of this on my behalf.</p>
      <p>I am still working on forwarding your letters to Geneva; I hope to find a messenger today. Otherwise, I have nothing to write now, except that many friends greet you and pray for your health, that the Lord may keep you safe with us for a long time. I do this as well.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 15, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and perpetual comrade to be honored.</p>
