      <p>I received from you, most esteemed Lord Bullinger and dearest brother in Christ, through Father Myconius, a gift both splendid and most welcome, namely two Decades of sermons outstanding in eloquence and sanctity, which I embraced with a holy kiss. If only I could someday express my gratitude to you for such a gift, if only I could presently give thanks worthy of it. But that will indeed be too late and too little, not to mention too narrow, because our writings are secular, which in no way can be compared to your sacred ones; this is truly hindered by the innate infancy within us. Nevertheless, we will do what we can in both respects, and we will hope that your kindness will interpret everything (as usual) with candor. Therefore, I say that I was greatly delighted by your gift; for first, you have again testified to your goodwill towards me, which I have always loved and esteemed highly; then you have provided me with various delights, by which I could be refreshed and rejuvenated.</p>
      <p>For who would not read with the greatest pleasure these sermons, so eloquent and full of consolation, on the highest chapters of our orthodox faith? Especially in this confusion of all things, in this victory of the world and the impious. And indeed, without flattery, I speak sincerely and candidly, as soon as I inspected the title of the book, I silently approved your intention; but when I first read the preface, then the sermons themselves, and began to understand your plan better, then indeed I extolled it with glory and praise. May the most merciful God grant that you also share the remaining decades with us shortly; for to me and those like me, who have neither the leisure to read the monuments of the holy fathers nor the means to purchase them, they will be of the greatest benefit. Therefore, my most esteemed Lord Bullinger, I cannot but give you immense thanks for such a gift of goodwill and piety. I will pray to the Lord to compensate on behalf of myself and the entire church.</p>
      <p>Farewell most prosperously in the Lord Jesus and always keep me (as you do) recommended to you. To your most honorable wife and most virtuous children, I wish all good things. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Basel, on the 25th day of the month of April, in the year 1549. Yours entirely from the heart, Johannes Hospinian.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent theologian, D. Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the city of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
