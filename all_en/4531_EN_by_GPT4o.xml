      <p>Article against a bishop in Chur.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the article letter, which was established in Ilanz by the common Three Leagues communities and the upper ones, as it reads word for word, especially concerning the secular authority and the bishop's office, remains in all its powers and articles, and all articles and decisions that were added to the first article letter shall be null, void, and powerless; for they were established and arranged without the knowledge and will of the community. Secondly, as everyone knows, from the beginning to the end of his tenure, what great goods he has wasted in Rome, from which goods he has taken and used, it is well remembered from the common God's house goods and possessions. Furthermore, it is now evident that he has withheld alms from the poor, for whose sake the greater part of the foundation was established, and therefore the poor are comfortless because of him. Moreover, one daily sees his scandalous life, unchaste in fornication without any fear of God, also the unprincely practice in commerce and usury, for which it is greatly necessary to take account of him in the presence of his sworn oath. Thirdly, as has been seen, the bishop in this dangerous time has allied and conferred with the bishop in Como, who, because of the Pope, whose legate he is, is our sworn enemy of the Confederates and Leagues because of the Messer, and furthermore, he has also opposed the issuance of the day service in several places and has made himself partisan. Therefore, it is necessary to take action against him and to arrange the issuances in places and ends where it is considered good by the common God's house people.</p>
      <p>[Fabr.] Written by a boy, but in such a way that it can be understood.</p>
      <p>If the matter were to lead to war, I am still of the opinion to break some evil cross-practices with this: it would not be inappropriate to summarize all the dealings in a short sum (but very briefly and understandably, so that a simple person could also grasp it) and therefore send writings to the communities in the Three Leagues; it would be good to shut the mouths of the malicious and to help more willingly. And since the simple are continually deceived with the claim that one does not want to keep letters and seals (this is plausible among the papists), they must be informed that the question is not whether one should keep letters and seals, but whether they are kept or not, and if they are not kept, whether the Five Places have the power to impose the penalty on the Glarus people that they are obliged to remove the preachers from the land; and since the Glarus people want to show this to impartial judges and desire justice, it should be pursued and not denied to them.</p>
      <p>These things are not to teach you, but because I know the simplicity of our people in the villages and the cunning of others, so that they do not grasp lengthy things, and do not understand brief ones unless they are very clear. However, if the matter is safe, such writing is not necessary.</p>
      <p>But also the articles of the treaty must be urged; this has much influence among the simple, etc. I wish, however, that it is safe; all good people among us fear this procrastination.</p>
      <p>But today I also heard from the chief tribune, who is very familiar with the abbot in Pf√§fers, who says: they will take the law well once, if it cannot be otherwise. But afterwards, they will do what they think is good, etc.</p>
      <p>Be vigilant and do not believe too much, which many good people desire and wish with all their prayers along with me.</p>
