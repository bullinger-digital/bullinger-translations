      <p>Greetings. There was a meeting here the day before yesterday, in which the matter of the Quadriis was presented, as he had already stayed here in the bishop's castle for a whole eight days, and it is amazing how he approached everyone and indeed each delegate separately. But see the wonderful providence in human affairs.</p>
      <p>His petition, which he presented in writing at the meeting, came into my hands by a miraculous chance, if that is to be called chance and not rather divine counsel. The day before our lords appointed their envoys, including the mayor, to the other council envoys who were to come to the meeting, they instructed them to oppose the undertaking of the Quadriis with force. Thereupon the council of the Quadriis found that in his petition he did not mention any special school or monastic order, but only indicated how he, richly endowed by God's grace, had no children; however, there are many young men in his homeland who are greatly neglected due to the lack of schoolmasters; he wanted, to honor God above all and for the good of his homeland, to maintain a schoolmaster at his own expense. But so that this might have more strength and authority, he asked their highness (for he dignifies them with such a title) to give their recognition here, etc., thereby they would serve God above all, but also the imperial majesty greatly, etc. Behold, what a cunning little fox! He thought he would achieve it all in one stroke, and certainly this matter would not have seemed unjust. Therefore, all the delegates had to be informed about the machinations of this man.</p>
      <p>In summary, the matter was brought to such a point by the grace of God that it began to be suspect to our people, and in such a large assembly there was no one who took up the cause of the Quadriis to defend it. However, this matter was postponed to future general and large meetings, to a council day. Thus, he now indeed departed with the matter unresolved.</p>
      <p>The schoolmaster, as we understand from the envoy, whose services he also sought, but in vain, is a Spaniard, etc. The rumor about that dragon was not entirely unfounded, but as it happens, when everyone adds something, it also grew through lies. Augustinus a Salicibus, a man worthy of trust, reported to us in the presence of both consuls and other good men that it was seen, but only by two and indeed separately, whose descriptions, however, do not differ. It was not so surprising that this happened to them, as thirty years ago a certain native, who is still alive, killed a worm of enormous size sunbathing on a certain steep rock with a cannon shot, whose decay was so pestilent that the poison following the wind took away a man's sight and so swelled the rest that his life was already completely despaired of; however, he, dragging his half-dead limbs, finally reached home and showed the place to his people, and after a few days that worm was found dead, etc. What is brought from Rome, you have from these letters written in Italian, which you will give to be read by Mr. Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>The summary of them is this: the Roman nobles are hindering the creation of a new pope and wish in the future to have something of the pope's authority diminished, and these things are plausible. For Rome, as I hear, is divided into 50 districts or more; to each district, however, a single tribune is assigned (they call the tribune a capirione). These have not been read to have all agreed in one as recently in hatred of the pope, etc.</p>
      <p>At Pontisella, the letters of Mr. Leodovico Lavater, your son-in-law, have been delivered.</p>
      <p>The matter will be his sole concern; now he cannot write because of the grape harvest, but he will write soon. I would gladly send to Mr. Gesner what he expects from me; but I have no one to whom I can conveniently give it. As soon as I have found a suitable person, I will write and send what is to be sent, although I do not yet have anything about the ibex horn that I can promise for certain. All of ours, Mr. Consul, Mr. Philipp, Pontisella, wish you well.</p>
      <p>Convey our greetings to all of yours.</p>
      <p>Chur, September 18, 1559.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant head of the church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
