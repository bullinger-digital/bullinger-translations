    <p xml:id="regest1">The poor health condition of Hospinian's brother [Christian], who stayed with him and his wife [...] for six weeks, is certainly known to Bullinger; according to the doctors, there is hope for recovery, but [Christian] should preferably not continue working in the school; therefore, Hospinian urgently requests to call [Christian] back into church service [to Zurich]; God alone knows how grateful he would be for that, and he would gladly like to show his gratitude to Bullinger someday. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>I believe you are aware of my brother Christian's health condition, most esteemed Bullinger, since he has been dealing with it for four months now and stayed with me along with his wife here for six weeks. I would indeed have much more to share with you about it if either time or our affairs allowed, but since neither you have the leisure to hear everything nor I to write it, I will only remind you of those things which seem least to be passed over in silence. If my brother himself could have done so due to his health, he would have written to you about everything more extensively and better than I. There is indeed good hope both for us and the doctors who have taken on his care that he will soon be restored to his former health and return to his scholastic duties. However, when we consider the nature of this illness, it does not seem to us that we should allow him to remain longer in the trivial school.</p>
      <p>For we must fear that if he recalls his old trouble from these more than tedious labors and falls again into this most serious illness, there will be no room for care afterwards. Therefore, I beg and beseech you, my Bullinger, to arrange, as you can, that in due time my brother is called back to you and appointed to some ecclesiastical office, in the administration of which he can be somewhat quieter and more tranquil than in instructing the wild and unruly youth of this age. If you will have gratified us in this matter, you will experience how welcome your service has been to us. Indeed, with what mind I am towards you and the other brothers of Zurich and all your people, He knows, to whom alone the innermost parts of hearts are open. For my nature does not allow me to declare my will to anyone with the flattery of words, but I prefer to make known by deed and actions what I am like towards each one. And would that you needed my help in some matter! You would undoubtedly see such zeal towards you as perhaps you have not expected from me until now. But I hope the Lord will someday offer me the opportunity to make you more certain of my will.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep us commended to you.</p>
      <p>From our Augustinian college on the 5th day before the Ides of May in the year 44.</p>
      <p>My brother Christian, with his wife, sends you his most dutiful greetings along with your whole family. In my words, you will greet Mr. Pellican, Megander, Bibliander, Erasmus, Binder, and others. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Hospinian.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man in sacred and profane letters, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, acting as archbishop at the renowned Zurich of the Swiss, his lord and brother in Christ, always most esteemed.</p>
