    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger's letter [not received] was a great comfort for Enzinas. Even though he knows well that the [Protestants] are not to blame for the current situation, he is (as could not be otherwise) very concerned about the church and the community, and feels the need to discuss it with others. However, he knows that the heavenly Father will not abandon the remnant of his church [cf. Isaiah 1:9; 41:14], even if the number of enemies should continue to grow.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He was pleased to hear from Bullinger about the imperial forces being driven into flight. But he would have been even more pleased to hear that their leader [Emperor Charles V] had fallen. For as long as he lives, there is no peace for Germany, even if he were to seek refuge in the remotest interior of Africa.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Despite the cold, the Bohemians [the troops of King Ferdinand I] are reportedly moving towards the borders of Saxony and Meissen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Swiss should take to heart the thought from Euripides [correctly: Menander], who said that one should stay at home and remain free if one does not want to give up one's fortune. They should also be aware of the cold season and not react hastily. May they rather successfully resist the tireless enemy by waiting!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Enzinas will write to Theodor [Bibliander] if he finds the time. He has not yet received a reply from him. The "Historia [vera de morte] Diazii" is in print. As soon as it appears, Enzinas will send [copies of it] to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Enzinas had seen notes on the first three sessions of the Council of Trent at Bullinger's. He would like Bullinger to send them to him at the first opportunity. Enzinas is willing to pay for their transcription (by a student) and promises to send Bullinger these in printed form along with some other texts currently in print on the same topic.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings to all of Bullinger's colleagues.</p>

      <p>S. D. I read your letters with great pleasure, which I can truly say were a great consolation to me. For although I know for certain that nothing evil or greatly to be feared can happen to a brave man except for guilt, from which we are all free in this entire cause, yet when I consider such grave and dangerous wounds to the church and the republic, I cannot help but groan from the heart and lay down all these agitations of my mind both before God in perpetual invocation and also with dear friends in letters or conversation. And I will indeed think that man cowardly who is not deeply affected by such great public dangers. However, no one can be affected unless he thoroughly investigates the whole cause and carefully considers the wills of the men by whose judgment these matters are conducted. It will always remain fixed in my mind that the eternal Father will be present for His church and will preserve its remnants to the end, even if the number of enemies increases and human defenses diminish.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, it was very pleasing to hear what you announced about the imperial forces being put to flight, although I would have more gladly heard that their leader had been removed, for as long as he lives, I do not see how firm peace can be restored to Germany, even if he seems to have been driven to the farthest Garamantes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I hear that the Bohemians have moved against Saxony and Meissen and, undeterred by the injury of the cold, have begun to cruelly ravage the borders.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>If only the Swiss would also prudently consider what was most gravely said by Euripides:... and not fear the impending storm of cold and approach the matter more sharply and swiftly. Would that they could restore to us by delaying what the adversary indeed eagerly tries to destroy. But God still lives, who will not allow such immense cruelties of the adversaries to go unpunished.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I would write to Theodor now if time permitted; but I have not yet received a response from him, whose letters I indeed greatly desire to be refreshed by. The "Historia Diazii" is under the press, which, once completed, I will send to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I saw at your place the first, second, and third sessions of the Council of Trent, which I ask you to send to me at the first opportunity, even if at my expense they are transcribed by some student, with the condition that shortly after they are published in print, I will send them to you along with many others of the same argument, which are now being printed, for the completion of which booklet we only desire these three sessions.</p>

      <p>Farewell and greet all the brothers by name with my words.</p>
      <p>Basel, the calends of November 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Francis Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest friend and brother. Zurich.</p>
