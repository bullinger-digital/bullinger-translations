      <p>Praise be to God, 1553, on the 28th of August in Lyon, etc.</p>
      <p>My humble and entirely willing service is always ready for you. Venerable, gracious lord, I received your friendly letter through your cousin, for which I am most grateful, with the offer to be indebted to you and yours, etc. Since then, it has not been possible for me to write back to you because of the fair. You will also have been informed how your cousin has fared, a year for 25 crowns; we have struggled hard to place him with a cloth merchant; for they do not like to employ Germans; they also want more money than others. However, I know of none who is employed here for less than 25 to 30. If I had been informed in Zurich, I would have sought a master for him before the fair; he must, however, have patience for a while until he grasps the language, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, venerable, especially gracious lord, regarding recent news, I am unfortunately unable to write anything good, except that once again 4 pious persons are to be burned this week. May the Lord, our faithful God and Father, strengthen them with the power of His Holy Spirit. In recent days, I have been with them, but I have found them steadfast, and the closer the hour comes, the braver they are. It is impossible to believe, for those who do not see it, how the Lord God comforts them and how valiantly they fight. In summary: the king has allowed the wolves over the sheep; how it will end in time, we will leave to the Lord.</p>
      <p>From England, the cardinal, our enemy, writes that the queen is to have the disgraceful mass reinstated and the other, who was chosen as king, expelled; others say otherwise, that it is nothing, so that I do not know any real basis, hoping you have more reliable news. I hope to learn about it from you in 4 weeks when I return from Piedmont. May God grant me His grace; may He always keep us in His protection. Amen. With a request to greet all your good lords and friends, Hans Ratz and your household. Please do not take my poor writing amiss, I have done it in haste, etc.</p>
      <p>Hans Liner, your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly learned lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his gracious lord in Zurich.</p>
