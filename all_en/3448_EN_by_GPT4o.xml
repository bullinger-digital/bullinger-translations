      <p>Most illustrious and learned Lord Bullinger, having found a little leisure and the opportunity of a reliable messenger, I did not want to neglect to greet you with this single note. I beseech you to consider my most ready and sincere spirit towards you with a fair and paternal mind, with which I have always regarded you for your supreme learning, and I have abundantly told your son, who was with me in Pathmos with the bearer of this letter. I still offer you that readiness, which I pray you to accept with a serene countenance.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>Given hastily... on the 3rd day before the calends of January 1557. Yours sincerely, Paul Skalich...</p>
      <p>To the most renowned man Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>From the count's coins...</p>
