      <p>Greetings. The envoys complain about your, brother and co-father, importunity; for they send letters both from you and from Solothurn. They ask that I bring you back with words and reprimand you.</p>
      <p>But if the matter has been conducted as you write, and I do not doubt that it is so, there is no reason for me to reproach you, as I would have done the same here in a similar case. But I will await the outcome of the matter; the situation is very displeasing.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I cannot write more now; for the business of the whole day has exhausted me, and a headache is worsening towards evening. Take these things in good part; otherwise, if the Lord wills, I will write more.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the honorable councilors and Philipp and Pontasella, etc. January 13, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I pray that you faithfully ensure this letter is delivered to Mr. Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, his dearest lord and brother. Chur.</p>
