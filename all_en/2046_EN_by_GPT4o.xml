      <p>S. P. When I recall (and I do so very often, most excellent men, and by far the most learned of our age), with what humanity and ease you received me, whom you had never seen before, how kindly, courteously, and amicably you treated me, how sincerely and usefully you advised me, furthermore, when I place before my eyes that most pleasant companionship granted to me among you, I greatly congratulate myself on my good fortune and am seized with the utmost admiration for the virtues and graces with which God has endowed you above all mortals, whom I have indeed been allowed to see. For your exceptional learning, inexhaustible and more than human eloquence, and incredible knowledge of both human and divine matters ought to be acknowledged by anyone, provided they have any remnant of an uncorrupted mind and sound judgment, as confessed by your works known to the whole world; yet I do not know whether anyone who has not seen and thoroughly known you can sufficiently appreciate your character, candor, and entire life. Truly, your most pleasant countenance and presence affected me beyond what anyone could believe. And although I have always considered you the greatest and most excellent men of our age, you now seem much greater to me from what I saw and heard in person, and when I contemplate you more deeply, you seem like a certain salutary miracle, descended into this most corrupt age of ours by the singular favor of the divine. For in your perpetual modesty, invincible constancy of mind, and most prudent counsels, the hope and spirit of all good and pious people find rest. Therefore, I sincerely pray to God that He may preserve you for the public good, to which you were clearly born and have lived thus far, for as long as possible. But enough of this for now. I truly, most excellent men, who now rightly come to be called my patrons and fathers, confess that I owe you much for your singular favor and kindness towards me and for your uncommon benefits, and I acknowledge myself perpetually obliged. Would that I could someday express some gratitude of my spirit towards you or some of your dear ones in deed. Indeed, I would do nothing more willingly in life than to gratify you in any way. Claudius Frontinus, my chaplain, also gives thanks to your goodness and piety. For we returned to our homeland cheerful and will never regret this journey, especially for the sight of you, to whom we have wholly given ourselves in clientship and commendation. You, distinguished men, cherish your old age and live life cheerfully and pleasantly; for thus it will be longer. Do not value the scribes and Pharisees barking at you everywhere more than a broken sandal. Indeed, the esteem of your name is greater among all the best people than what those or any others can obstruct with their barking. Envy, as he said, aims high, it flies over the lower things.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious men; may Christ preserve you unharmed for us and our common studies for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Given at Nozeroy on the 10th day before the calends of November in the Christian year 1553.</p>
      <p>Gilbert Cousin, most devoted to you and most eager for your name, autoscediavi.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and incomparable men, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Gessner, Rudolf Gwalther, Johann Jakob Ammann, Johann Fries, and the other most faithful teachers of sincere theology and good letters in Zürich, their most observant servants and patrons.</p>
