      <p>I wrote a letter to you at the end of February; I hope it has been delivered. On May 11th, I received letters from Bullinger and Lavater, and yours, Gwalther, on the 18th of the same month. The Queen of Scots escaped from prison around the same time. A bloody battle was suddenly fought between the papists, friends of the queen, and the protestants, supporters of the king. She, while the battle was raging, was observing everything from a hill on a swift horse; but when she finally saw that victory had gone to Lord James and his men, she fled with a few to England; for she preferred to entrust herself to the English rather than her own Scots, and I believe it was safer. She is now at Carlisle, in a fairly fortified place, and will soon reside in the middle of England, as I hear. On July 13th, Lord William Turner, a good doctor and an excellent man, died in London; Lever preached at his funeral. I have written this single letter to you and indeed briefly; for I doubt whether these, in such great tumults of affairs, will reach your hands, therefore I did not want to write more at present.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name all my friends and especially Lord Simler, Lavater, Wolff, Haller, Wick, Vonlich, Zwingli, etc. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Hastily at Ludham, August 4, 1568.</p>
      <p>Yours as much as he is, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>To the most learned men and most upright friends, Lord Rudolf Gwalther and Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
