      <p>London, December 17, 1549.</p>
      <p>That you receive such rare letters from me, most esteemed lord and godfather, I ask you to attribute to the calamity of our times and the vicissitudes of our affairs, rather than to any forgetfulness of your truly wonderful clemency and humanity; which both reason and charity command and enjoin me to keep far from me. A great fear had begun to seize us, a great dread had invaded the minds of the pious, as to what success the still budding religion of Christ in England would have after the fall of the Duke of Somerset, who is still held captive in the Tower of London. We have nothing certain yet about what will become of him.</p>
      <p>We hope that his life will be spared. May God grant this for the glory of His name and the benefit of the church: although we see many dangers looming over him, we hope and believe for better things. Indeed, we easily believe what we wish for. Nothing is changed in our religion, nor do we hope it will be changed hereafter. Although the ship is dangerously tossed on all sides, God, however, providently holds the helm, and raises up many supporters of His word in the councils of the royal majesty, who defend the cause of Christ vigorously and fearlessly. The Bishop of Canterbury rightly understands the business of Christ concerning the supper, and is now very studious of me. He has some articles of religion, to which all preachers and lecturers of sacred theology are compelled to subscribe, otherwise they are not granted the faculty of teaching, where he thinks purely and religiously and in the Swiss manner about the Eucharist. We desire nothing greater in a man than a masculine and strong spirit. He fears too much for his fortunes (as do all the other bishops here). There are six or seven bishops here who understand the cause of Christ concerning the supper as dexterously and piously as can be desired; and what prevents them from reforming their churches according to the norm of the word of God is only the fear of good men. Altars here in many churches have been made into tables. The public use of the Lord's Supper is far from the form and institution of the Lord: Although it is administered under both kinds, yet in some places the supper is celebrated three times a day. Where they once celebrated the mass of the apostles in the morning, they have the communion of the apostles; where they had the mass of the Virgin, they have the communion which they call the communion of the Virgin; where they had the high or solemn mass, they now have the solemn communion, so they call it. They still keep those vestments and lights at the altars; they always sing the hours and other hymns in the temples which pertain to the supper, yet in our language. And lest the papacy perish: although the priests are compelled to abolish the Latin language, they always diligently observe the same tone and music which they were accustomed to in the papacy. God knows with what dangers and troubles we are involved here because of such men.</p>
      <p>Excuse me to the lord consul about the cloth, and also to lord Butler. Three months have passed since I entrusted them to the journey, but they are detained in Antwerp. However, they will soon be brought to you, with God's favor, and perhaps before these reach you. I have just come from a lecture; therefore I kindly ask you to interpret the brevity of my letters. I am compelled to a public lecture twice a day. Tomorrow and the day after, to the glory of God, I will complete the 6th chapter of John: thus far we have dealt with holy John. For another lecture, as the most suitable subject for our age, I teach Daniel, and I am now engaged in the 3rd animal of the 7th chapter; in the elucidation of which subject your dictations and notes on Daniel provide no small amount of benefit.</p>
      <p>Most esteemed lord, for your immense piety towards me, take care that all your notes, especially on Isaiah, are copied with all haste, and send them to me most diligently. I will fully pay the expenses: you do not know how wonderfully they promote the glory of God.</p>
      <p>If I can be of any use to the church of Christ, and my smallness can be of service, I confess and will confess as long as I live, with the help of the sacred name, that I owe it to you and my lords and brothers in Zürich, whom may God always keep safe for His own sake. Furthermore, if you have anything that you are about to commit to the press, dedicate it to our most excellent prince, King Edward VI. In this matter, you will also advise lord Bibliander, our common godfather, and lord Gualter, most learned men. If you satisfy my wishes in this part, you will greatly promote the glory of God. Believe me, all the English who are free from papal tyranny and Roman deceit rightly understand the supper. There are various other reasons which prompt me to request this from you, which I am currently silent about due to the danger of the journey. Live, fight with that ancient serpent.</p>
      <p>Behold, your reward is abundant in heaven. You will greet lord Bibliander with his family, lord Gualter with his family, lord Pellican with his family, our most faithful lord Butler with his family, and all the other Zürichers, always most esteemed by me. You will tell lord Guaßner, my best friend, that he has a Welsh lexicon and some writings in the Cornish language, commonly called Cornwall, on the way.</p>
      <p>Yours now and forever, John Hooper. My wife and your goddaughter Rachel, with Martin and Joanna, also send their greetings to your excellency with our lady and godmother, your wife, and lord Bibliander with his wife, our dearest godfather, with all the others.</p>
      <p>Rachel is endowed with a most fortunate memory and retains everything that is said to her very easily, and understands Latin better than all other languages.</p>
      <p>To the noble man and most faithful friend, lord John Butler. In Zürich.</p>
