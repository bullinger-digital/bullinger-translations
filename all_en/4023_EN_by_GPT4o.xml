      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write (reverend father in Christ).</p>
      <p>Everything here is in a state of murmuring due to the death of the King of France, who, as you know, passed away on the tenth day after he received his wound (if I remember correctly), having previously betrothed his sister to the Duke of Savoy. Those among us who have some judgment are convinced that his death was not only beneficial to the church but also to our regions. What was the purpose of this new military preparation, against which these troops were armed? A Venetian galleon, on which they had spent several tons, as I hear, was sunk; they consider this a portent and therefore have reviewed all their subjects. Nothing is coming from France, which is surprising.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I asked Doctor Philipp if he had anything to share with me; he replied that the only news was that nothing new was coming from the court. The treaty lasts for five years after the death.</p>
      <p>I foresee many things now, about which I will communicate with you through a certain messenger. There are different opinions about the new king; some say he is not very hostile to our religion, but he may have advisors who are not quite fair. O admirable God, what is more unexpected than this death, what is more evident to testify to divine providence, etc. The Melser sendhüten with all molchen (to 6 servants) should be lit and burned; Mels lies before Sargans. There was a meeting here; they deliberated about the edict that the governor in Milan has issued, prohibiting under penalty of life and limb that no one should allow the Pünten or Confederates to receive grain, cattle, or other food; also about gathering a new force of horse and foot. Nothing has been finally decided by our side; they refer to the Confederates, who are also affected by this. Our hand is concerned about the Valtellina.</p>
      <p>These are the things now, which are indeed of no importance, but so that I would not write nothing. Farewell, most illustrious man, for as long and as happily as possible with all your family.</p>
      <p>Chur, July 24, 1559.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the church in Zurich, his much-honored lord and patron. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
