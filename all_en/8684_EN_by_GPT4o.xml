      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most renowned theologian, Zwinger sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I wish for you to remain safe and sound for the republic for as long as possible. Peter Ramus sent these to me from Paris and, by the right of friendship, commanded that they be delivered to you quickly and surely. I am sending them through a fellow citizen of yours. If you wish to respond and cannot find a more concise or certain way, I will ensure that on the first possible occasion we demonstrate our loyalty in this matter both to you, whom all good people honor for your merits, and to Ramus.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, and lovingly greet your sons from me.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the Ides of October 1571.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord.</p>
