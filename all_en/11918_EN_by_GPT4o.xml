    <p xml:id="regest1">On March 13, [the Bernese pastors] received the decision from the council that instead of appointing a fourth pastor in place of [Peter] Kunz, a second deacon should be appointed, who could later advance to a pastoral position; Ritter requests assistance and distrusts [Simon] Sulzer, who once introduced Kunz to Luther and Bucer; Theodor [Bibliander] could influence [Beat] Gering, who is uncertain in his stance, through a letter, and Bullinger should inform Ritter whom [he and Bibliander] recommend; the position of a deacon, which the newly appointed would have to take at least temporarily, is not insignificant and is associated with a good salary.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Since it was not permissible to delay any longer, on March 13, we approached the council and asked what we should do, whether we should look for either a minister or a deacon or both to fill the position of Kunz.</p>
      <p>The council responded that it had long been decided that there should be only three ministers and two deacons; therefore, since we have three ministers and only one deacon, we should look for a deacon, but one who is pious, learned, and of some reputation, so that if any of us were hindered by business or illness or were taken from the living, he could succeed in his place. Now I ask you to assist with your advice and help; but first, hear my opinion: I have very little hope in Sulzer, since he has been the source and nourishment of the entire fire until now, who obtained friendship for Kunz with Luther and Bucer through forged letters, and who even led Kunz to death with these innovations. But if you have the mind to write to him, advise him kindly to spare the church, which he sees abhors the pursuit of novelty, etc. Then I would prefer that you deliberate specifically with Theodor and that Theodor write to Beat. For he is troubled in conscience, since he did not succeed in what he attempted for the favor of the people of Strasbourg, and he sees the steadfastness of the people, furthermore, he is deprived of Kunz's patronage. I hope that in this matter he will strive to comply with Theodor. Likewise, inform me of what you agree upon and whom you judge worthy and useful for our church. There is hope that if he were endowed with some authority, he could in time succeed in Sulzer's place, and Sulzer could be entrusted with the profession and teaching of sacred literature or be ordained as the fourth minister; for nearly in this order was Beat called. But if not, the condition of the deaconate is such that he can bring not a small benefit to the truth in it. On Sundays, they have a sermon after lunch; then, if any of us is absent or hindered by business or illness or death, he will succeed in the place. The stipend is also good, 80 guilders of our currency less 2, 35 measures of spelt, 5 measures of oats, 6 measures of wine; if only a good brother could pretend to be a deacon for a short period of time. You, with the other brothers, apply diligence and assist; respond to this message as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Bern, March 14, 1544.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely, etc.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and good friend.</p>
