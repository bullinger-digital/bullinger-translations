      <p>Greetings from the Lord through our Savior Jesus Christ. I have indeed written a rather lengthy letter to you today, most kind and beloved lord and esteemed father, in which I have extensively described what was done at both synods; for I know that you expect such things from me, and I would indeed be sinning against my faith towards you if I did not diligently inform you of all these matters. I have also written about some other things, as you see; however, since it is necessary for me to discuss my affairs with you and to reveal my mind to you, I wanted to submit these things privately so that you alone might have them and share them only with those whom you think it appropriate. It will be your task to consider everything favorably and to recognize my most benevolent and devoted spirit towards you; for I speak to you as freely as to my own heart.</p>
      <p>I have recently understood from one of your letters how you are being urged that I should remain here, and how the church might not lack me, upon which I also partly understood that your mind is so inclined that I should stay here, upon which you also wrote to my lord treasurer that my lords are considering my payment, etc. I can well imagine that you do all this with good intentions and out of Christian zeal; however, as I understand this, I cannot leave my mind unopened to you. You know what my lords have promised, written, and assured me, by which I hope they will let me remain; for I cannot and will not let go of the promise, and I do not hope that you can or will advise me to do so, since you well know what my vocation entails and with what agreement I have departed from you. I do not hope that I am or would become useless to this church if I were to stay longer; for, if God wills, I will not be useless to any church; but that the church might not lack me is too much. Yes, if there were no others, I would relent; but since they are now partly better provided through Musculus, Jodocus, etc., and can also be better provided through others, whether they are now learned men from the exiles or from their own, whom they also have well, they can indeed do without me.</p>
      <p>And although much is thrown at me, I can still answer everything before God and the world with a good conscience, and I will do so if necessity demands it, and I will not be swayed by what this or that person says. It is enough for me before God that I fulfill my calling, in which I have served God faithfully as much as I could, and have achieved, with God's help, that I hand over a peaceful church to whoever comes after me, if God wills. And therefore, since I am here alone as an apostle, I desire to remain here, and I also ask you and other my lords that you let me remain here and do not wish to bind me here and impose good-natured roses. I do not make much of a living here, say neither yes nor no to anyone; for what need do I have for much quarreling? I leave it to my lords of Zurich, who give me letters and seals; they alone uphold me in this. Therefore, since the time is approaching and perhaps something will be dealt with in it, I ask you in time to assist and advise me, as I assure you of my goodwill, and advise how I should conduct myself so that I may remain comfortably with what has been promised to me.</p>
      <p>I also ask you to excuse me to those who are unaware of my vocation and therefore (who I hope have deserved better) criticize and disparage me; for if I foresee that I should not be treated as has been so clearly promised to me by many, even in writing, or that there should now be any dispute about it, I might have considered something else.</p>
      <p>But so far, as I hope, I have been faithful to God and my lords of Zurich, and I will continue to be so, and I also ask you to ensure that faithfulness and promise are kept to me as well.</p>
      <p>And if you wish to provide this church even better, then act as others do, that others may be called in the future, who can be found, and I may be relieved of my obligations to my own. For it would be regrettable for me, and it would not be good if I had to resist and oppose, which I would certainly do if I saw that I was being pushed, and I had to pay for my faithfulness and obedience. Therefore, I wish to understand your counsel and opinion shortly; for I simply intend to remain according to my lords' recognition, letters, and seal. Do the best and let me be commended to you. I will certainly earn that from you with all faithfulness. May the Lord be your shield and protection; to Him, along with your dear household, you are faithfully commended; they all greet you faithfully on behalf of my wife, myself, and my children.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, April 7, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours forever devoted, Johannes Haller.</p>
