      <p>Greetings. The letters written in June were finally returned to me a few days ago, from which I gather that a suspicion of some discord has arisen in you regarding me, although you partly attribute the blame for the long silence to our affairs.</p>
      <p>However, so that I may not let you remain in doubt about this any longer, let God himself be my witness that my mind towards you remains sincere and candid, unchanged in the slightest, but has persisted in faith and respect for you unblemished to this hour and, God willing, will persist forever; so far from it is that any rancor or distraction has settled in me from the friendship once begun. What happened with Jonah could have been done a little more gently and timely to avoid thoughts of sudden expulsion, which seemed more cruel or wicked than the matter itself taught. But all these things are buried and are not of such importance that they should be recalled to memory. I am and will be towards you and all pious men as I have always been. Regarding my Jonah, nothing of the sort was known to me before he came to Zurich. Sultzer hosted him in Basel for almost a year in his house and promised nothing but great things about him in his letters, which indeed still exist today. If he behaved badly, Sultzer will be considered to have deceived both me and him. At the end of May, I sent you letters concerning Jonah's matter and enclosed a crown to satisfy the one who claimed that a chalice had been taken from him. But since there is no mention of this in your recent letters, a certain conjecture occurs to me that my letters were suppressed and not presented to you. Therefore, I am sending another enclosed crown here, to calm the mind of the complaining man, if it has not already been done. I hear that he, whoever he is, has instituted a remarkable vehemence against Jonah, namely wanting to make his reputation known to the whole world and to brand him with perpetual disgrace, as if no place for response or recompense had been left to us.</p>
      <p>The laws have left us something even against the biting and slanderous, which perhaps can restrain insolent anger. But let these clouds pass. As for the affairs by which I am now, verging on old age, distracted, they are indeed significant. Added to this is bodily illness, namely the stone, which now attacks me for the third time with such force and still torments me, that I do not believe more intense pains can be inflicted on human flesh. May the heavenly Father through Christ bear in me what is impossible for human patience; for I know that I am thus exercised by God, the faithful Father, so that I may never forget His omnipotence, but become better. But truly, what about you? Oh, oh, most distinguished man, if you have earned either little or no gratitude over such a long period, there is nothing more for me to complain about, who, having been involved in a profane republic, have been forced to offend many, but only bad men, not only in word but also in deed. Hence perhaps I am in danger for so many years, tossed here and there, nor am I yet safe from the snares of the impious. But you, who have faithfully extended the nourishment of souls to yours for so long, watched over them diligently, and manfully drove the wolves from the folds, planted and preserved Christian concord, are you not only worthy of double but a hundredfold honor, yet suffer slanders even from those to whom you have extended every kind of service? Surely, indeed, you should consider this a very certain augury that some great evil threatens your people, which, however, may the best and greatest God avert. Be secure, relying on your skill and innocence. If anything more serious has been committed against you, which you cannot bear, a thousand doors will be open to you; you will always feel me to be your brother. For I know what the fate of exiles is and how much I owe them through Christ.</p>
      <p>Finally, I do not want to flatter you any longer with the hope of transferring your speeches; such a burden of affairs is imposed on me that I can scarcely carry half of it. The more I strive to emerge from this labyrinth, the more I am immersed, although I move every stone to dedicate this last time of life to tranquility. The Lutherans, as they seem to be born from mud, disturb everything and become more unrestrained day by day. They rave against every religion and are not even consistent with themselves. The Wittenbergers write against Matthias Illyricus, shout against us especially the Zwinglians, publicly declare from the pulpit that there is nothing spiritual in the Lord's Supper, but that it is a carnal meal; whoever does not think so will suffer perpetual fires with Judas. Duke Augustus of Saxony acts effeminately, caring neither for religion nor country. Not long ago, he imprisoned and treated miserably his preacher, who had said that he unjustly retained the electorate. The Landgrave of Hesse is entirely devoted to hunting; the sons left by Duke John Frederick are more Lutheran than Luther himself, who are not known to me by face, but are said to be perpetual boys. About Duke Christopher of Württemberg, I hear something good, albeit secretly, that he is of our party and regrets not a little having agreed to the most foul league, for this league, called the Rhenish, is instituted only for the preservation of the kingdom of Satan. As the Württembergian begins to perceive this, he would gladly withdraw. I see everything tending towards decline, but the grace of the Lord remains forever. Farewell and greet the fellow believers with the councilors, the chief scribe, and the whole circle of learned men most diligently in my name. October 12th, in the year etc. 54.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Georg Frölich from Lomnitz, etc. To the highly learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful leader of the Christian community in Zurich, my beloved lord and brother, to be delivered.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
