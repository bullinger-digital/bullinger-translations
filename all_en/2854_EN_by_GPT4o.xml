      <p>S. P. Throughout this entire year, most honorable man, we have been laboring here to translate the New Testament of our Lord Christ into such a language that can be useful to all of Lower Germany, and this according to the edition of Robert Estienne, printed in large format in Paris in 1550. After, with the help of Godfried Wingius, who lives with me, I completed our translation, we compared it with our Micronius and even now with P. Delenus, ministers of our now-dispersed German church in London, using the same autograph and meanwhile consulting other Greek exemplars and various Latin and some German, Swiss, Saxon, Brabantian, French, and English versions. For we, because the works of unknown authors are often subject to suspicions, wish to publish ours under the name of that church and also of Lord a Lasco, who has already sent me his observations on my Testament. But this has largely resulted in my friends, even the most esteemed ones, not being able to give their efforts to writing in the meantime. Therefore, I sincerely ask you not to take my prolonged silence badly.</p>
      <p>Lord a Lasco has now written to us that Lord Calvin not long ago received truly benevolent letters from Sigismund, King of Poland, which has greatly delighted us, considering it likely that he and a good part of Poland do not abhor Calvin's doctrine, which has also been indicated to us here more than once from other sources. May the Lord grant that that kingdom be finally liberated from the tyranny of Satan and papal impiety, and be imbued with sincere religion, so that it may not in any way be infected by that fanatical plague of the Lutherans, who are no less hostile and threatening to us than the highest papists and Anabaptists themselves, if not more so. I have now advised Calvin, while writing on the sacramental matter, to abstain from obscure forms of speech for various reasons, which are not worth recounting to you, and I earnestly ask you, as much as I can, that both you and Lord Bibliander also advise him of this. For you know much better than I how much danger is inherent in those forms of speech.</p>
      <p>I could indeed discuss many things with you now, if I did not think that our Micronius would write to you more extensively about all the matters that are happening here. Therefore, I refrain and will now make an end. Godfried Wingius greets you, although unknown to you by face. Please greet for me Lord Bibliander, Lord Pellicanus, Lord Gualter, H. Zwingli, and Johann Wolf very respectfully; also greet Lord Gessner very affectionately for me. Farewell, most honorable man, in Christ the Lord, to whom I commend you and your ministry, that He may make it fruitful, from the heart.</p>
      <p>Norden, Friesland, 9th of March, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, Johannes Utenhove.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, truly to be respected as a friend and brother. In Zürich.</p>
