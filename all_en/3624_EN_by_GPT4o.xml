      <p>Greetings. I excused the business matters that have prevented me from writing; I also hope to set out to you shortly and that we can discuss many matters. I do not know what Mr. St. Laurentius wrote to you about those letters which you wrote to me, which I have always interpreted in the best way. You will write to me through this person, whom I am sending to the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>My wife sends her greetings to you.</p>
      <p>You will greet our mutual friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, June 23, in haste.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
