    <p xml:id="regest1">Advocacy for Rudolf Schinz, who has become unable to work due to an accident and has asked Comander to approach Bullinger; Schinz requests permission to return to Zurich to continue his trade with wooden bows, or if this is not possible, for financial support. Comander has sent the letter and the confession of the Lord's Supper negotiated in Basel [First Helvetic Confession] to Johannes Travers [cf. No. 1465], they do not possess the other mentioned booklets; in addition to Bucer's Latin letter [to Comander, BucerDS VIII, No. 8], which Bullinger received from Bern, Comander also has a letter from Bucer in German [BucerDS VIII, No. 9f], which he can provide if needed. He admits that he has not read either version completely and wonders why such a clear matter is being obscured. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, Leo [Jud], and [Johann Jakob] Ammann.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. With us stays Rudolf Schinz from Zurich; he asked me to write a letter to you on his behalf, dearest Bullinger. A new misfortune has befallen this poor man, adding to all his previous miseries, as he was attempting to walk along a nearly impassable cliff; he fell off the path and struck his side against the rock, suffering such a calamity that he is unable to earn his living through his labor. He asked me to write on his behalf and to request two things from you as his most faithful patron: first, that you obtain for him a return to Zurich so that he can settle his affairs by selling the wood or ash bows he has prepared, with the benefit that he can satisfy his servants and creditors and not lose his labor - otherwise, if he is forced to stay away from his homeland for longer, both he and others will suffer losses -; the second request: if a safe return cannot be secured for him, that he at least be supported by some subsidy, gift, or alms from the lords of Zurich, so that he does not have to perish entirely or be forced to beg for alms, until he can earn his living through his labor once he has regained his former health. I have delivered the letter and the confession concerning the matter of the Eucharist made in Basel to Travers. We do not have the other booklets you wrote about. You received Bucer's letter from the Bernese, perhaps in Latin; he also added a German one for me, quite long, described in detail, in which he praises Luther so much that he almost surpasses the apostles. If you desire it, I will send it to you. To confess the truth frankly, I have never read either the Latin or the German version in full; I am so weary of these lamentations. For I am greatly amazed that such great men wish to obscure a matter that is clear, true, and known with so much effort. You will find me most ready for any commands. Farewell. From the court of Rhaetia, on the Nones of March 1541. Greet Pellican, Leo, and Ammann in my words. Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in piety and doctrine, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the church in Zurich, his lord and much esteemed friend. Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
