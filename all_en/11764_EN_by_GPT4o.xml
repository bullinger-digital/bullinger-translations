    <p xml:id="regest1">The brothers [in Zittau] are disappointed that they have not received at least a small greeting in response [to No. 1654]; daily they receive instruction from Bullinger's commentary on Paul's letters and from other of his writings, recently also from his commentary on Matthew - two copies are available, more are expected - as well as from Pellican's Bible commentary and from the works of Zwingli and Oecolampadius. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocent life from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>It can hardly be expressed how deeply affected your most devoted brothers are, dear Bullinger, for not having received any response. We do not desire lengthy letters; we are not unaware of the many duties that the ministers of the word of God have in Zurich, we ask for a very brief greeting. You teach us daily, indeed we hear you as if speaking in your most Christian commentaries on the letters of Saint Paul, and likewise in other books: On the Authority of Holy Scripture, On the Origin of Error, On Both Natures in Christ, On the Eternal Covenant, On the Office of the Prophet. We are also taught and now understand the Gospel of Matthew from your annotations. We have two copies in this city, we expect more. Master Konrad Pellikan also teaches us in his seven volumes on the books of the Bible, and the most holy martyrs and men Huldrych Zwingli, Johannes Oecolampadius do the same in their works. We ask for a small letter from you.</p>
      <p>Farewell with Master Konrad Pellikan, Leo Jud, Caspar Megander, and Bibliander and the whole church of Zurich. Many brothers greet you, especially Onofrius Strategus, Celestinus Hennig.</p>
      <p>Given in Zittau, on the eighth day of the month of February in the year 1543. Oswald Pergener, city clerk, etc.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man Master Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most ample church of Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
