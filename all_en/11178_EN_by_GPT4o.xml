    <p xml:id="regest1">Will at least write him this short letter and asks for his understanding that [the people of Zurich] did not receive him more kindly during his visit; assures him that their connection has been strengthened by the achieved agreement, and sends him the promised book [„De scripturae sanctae authoritate“, HBBibl I 111]. Recommends the letter bearers.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>These men departed more hastily than I would have wished, Myconius, esteemed in the Lord, yet I wanted to send you these few words for many. First, although we showed you little or no hospitality when you were with us, you should not interpret this as if we love you less than before. For we love you in truth.</p>
      <p>You will attribute something to our occupations and concerns. Secondly, I do not want you to promise yourself less from me than before. If the matter itself seems to have somewhat separated us, the agreement, in which we all concur, has bound us together anew with the closest bond. Therefore, let suspicions cease. Finally, what I promised, I send here, two books addressed to the King of England. I send these as a symbol of friendship, and I wish you very well. Please, I beseech you, commend these young men.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 4th of June, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
