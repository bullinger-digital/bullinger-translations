      <p>We have heard things about you, which we would prefer to be false rather than true. May the Lord promote the glory of His name and destroy the followers of Satan with the spirit of His mouth!</p>

      <p>What to hope for from Strasbourg, I do not know. However, we hear that many have better hopes for Constance. The Lord knows who are His; we earnestly ask you to pray diligently for us as well.</p>
