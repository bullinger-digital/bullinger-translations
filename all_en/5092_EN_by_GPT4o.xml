      <p>Greetings. All your items (reverend father in Christ) have been delivered to us in good faith; I will share them with friends at the first opportunity. Today I have completed my first booklet, and therefore you will forgive me if I am brief.</p>
      <p>Froschauer has promised to publish it, and thus advised me to hurry, which I did, writing day and night; I hope he will keep his word; but still, if he is busy, he would have an excuse unless he prefers to consider the church's interest over mine. I would humbly ask you to inspect the book yourself; but I know your commitments.</p>
      <p>Now at least I ask you to read the letter, which is very brief, and understand the argument from it, and if you judge the material beneficial for our churches, urge Mr. Froschauer, otherwise, I would not want to impose my trifles on anyone.</p>
      <p>In this booklet, I mainly dealt with the matter of the sacrament against the ubiquitarian doctrine among other things. But I applied the brevity that was appropriate for this type of argument.</p>
      <p>Mr. Wolff has the booklet; I am now sending him the last pages. As for your labors, I can easily estimate what kind and how great they will be.</p>
      <p>But behold the impudence of a man more than canine. In the presence of Mr. Philipp, a colleague, I asked (since he himself complained much about the immodesty of the people of Zurich), whether Brentius had also drawn his pen against Bullinger, then he denied it, and when I pressed the man and said that I had this from the report of good and trustworthy men, he exclaimed with these words: "No, it is not true; believe me, believe me, I know" etc. But today the consul came to me and complained about the vanity of Vergerius, who was not ashamed to boast in Lindau that he was going to the Rhaetian assembly in the name of the Rhaetian council: he claimed to be the chief councilor of the League. These things were reported to our people by a senator from Lindau, who affirmed that this happened in his presence. The matter of Isabella is long; I will write soon.</p>
      <p>These are not entirely honest pieces; I have seen many in the main pit before, the [... main pit] surrounded with similar pieces. You will receive everything that has been done concerning the bishop, provided the consul, as he promised, sends it to me in time for it to be copied. We have obtained all this: That his clerical servants are excluded from the common council (by this very act he made everyone subject to him); also that he shall be obliged to give an account when the church requires it; also that he shall give and take justice before the church. This goes to the point: last assembly, which was held in Chur, he publicly declared before the Two Leagues in a heat to the church: "I am your overlord and you are my subjects." But when he let these words fall, he was immediately told that he would not live to see the day. Some spoke so roughly: they would not have priests and beggars as overlords, of which his people would have gladly silenced these words, and he had bought them back for a large sum, and I would not have traded them for a large sum. He has now been made to understand that he is not lord in the church. etc.</p>
      <p>I hoped that I had finished with many troubles and those immense labors and would finally return to my studies. But what can I say? Another calamity has befallen us, namely the Anabaptist one.</p>
      <p>For some Anabaptists recently held their meetings in a citizen's house at the St. Martin's market or fair here and detained two of our people. There were also two strangers here who claimed that Ferdinand had given orders to his people to take action against the Anabaptists with fire and sword; therefore, they felt safe nowhere and wished to retreat to Rhaetia.</p>
      <p>And without a doubt, unless something is done in time, they will cause some harm in these places in such a state of disorder. Therefore, we had to publicly dispute; but by the grace of God: our victory was clear, and their stubbornness was evident to all. Now they are imprisoned; one, who has already been admonished several times and caused many disturbances to the republic, will be banished; the other is our bookseller, a rather simple man, but otherwise pious and well-read, of whom there is good hope that he will accept instruction. They attracted him with many tricks because they had a suitable man through whom they could spread books among the peasants here and there. The other is a butcher, a man in debt, of many words; he learned the butcher's trade in Zurich or served there for a long time, his name is Tardy. Observe him, so that he does not settle with you if he has no place here. Therefore, there is always something to do.</p>
      <p>If Froschauer completely refuses to print my booklet in time, urge him to at least send it to Bern for printing. Many good people, including those from Glarus, urge me to have it published soon; for it serves their cause greatly and helps to confirm them in good. The title of the booklet is: "The Old Faith."</p>
      <p>I read the letters of Mr. Coignet written on November 7, and in them, he wishes to know what was done in our assemblies; therefore, it seems my letters were not given to him. I was with the bookseller in prison today, but all my attempts were in vain.</p>
      <p>He relies on Erasmus's Paraphrases; I have not yet read the passage. But otherwise, they appeal to scripture, now against the scriptures to men.</p>
      <p>He himself has already read your book, but in the meantime, he has been drawn to this sect. I am sending the records.</p>
      <p>The matter of the bishop not being allowed to sit in councils and actions anymore is not included in the decision; therefore, the consul gives the account, it is a recognition of the common Three Leagues, and as soon as the church confirms it, it is not necessary to include this in this decision; for this reason, there is a special decision of the common Three Leagues etc. Hercules from Salices is coming soon.</p>
      <p>I greeted him in your name, read the news.</p>
      <p>He himself wishes you well and says he has written to you.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, he told me this secret: between Philipp and the Venetians, there is some unknown discord. Philipp accused the Venetians of seeking the friendship of the Rhaetians; the Venetians replied that Philipp had first attempted this through envoys, the Philippians denied it; therefore, the Venetians will send someone to find out the truth in our alliances etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the church of Zurich, his lord and patron.</p>
