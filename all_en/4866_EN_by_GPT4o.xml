      <p>S. D. I received the note handed to you, dear brother, as you were departing for Biel; I am waiting to see what else you will write. Now, however, I have this to say.</p>
      <p>A year and a half ago, there was a minister in the Glarus region, a simple man, Johannes Schleher, one-eyed, not a bad man at all. He was accused of certain things that were brought forward against the articles of peace.</p>
      <p>His wife was also accused of having uttered some importunate and blasphemous things among the neighbors. Because of these matters, that Schleher, looking out for himself, left Glarus and has now lived with us for about a year and a half, supported by the generosity of the church, otherwise he has not preached anywhere, etc. Meanwhile, he is accused at the assemblies of the Five Cantons, not just once.</p>
      <p>The good man was advised to be careful and not to go to those areas where the Catholics exercise dominion. Nevertheless, the poor man recently went to the Baths of Baden, where he was again advised to look out for himself diligently, etc., but in vain.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when he came to Wesen eight days ago, he was captured and taken to Schwyz. When our most honorable magistrate heard this, he immediately wrote to Schwyz asking for the reasons why they had arrested him. The response was that he had behaved indecently by preaching, furthermore, he had injured the honor of some with slander, and there are some who want to accuse him legally; they will therefore act as the matter requires. Therefore, the treasurer Sprossius was immediately sent to assist his case, etc.</p>
      <p>What will happen, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>Some suspect that he will be executed; for they rage and gnash their teeth against Christ and us, his worshippers. The envoy of the King of France sent to me in Solothurn what he received from France: a letter from Ivo, Bishop of Chartres, stating that the King of France should not only be crowned in Reims, but wherever the king wishes; he added a letter from the Senonensis praetor; you know Ivo was renowned 500 years ago. He also sent a supplication and confession of all the faithful scattered in the kingdom, asking the king for freedom of religion and sincerity. He adds that the king's counselors recently conferred with the Parisian parliament about the cause of religion, free voices were heard; but what was decreed, he does not yet know, but is waiting.</p>
      <p>In the court of Navarre and the Prince of Cond√© and others, the gospel is openly preached in Paris; the cardinal, bishops, and clergy are gnashing their teeth. I see that we must pray to the Lord most earnestly, that He may be present with those in peril, etc.</p>
      <p>When I share with you what I have received from friends, I do not want you, when sharing the same with others (which is certainly free for you to do as far as I am concerned), to mention my name or that of the king's envoy or others. I trust you with this; not so with others; there are certain reasons why I write this to you, whom I wish to be well in Christ. You will have this in common with our Matthias, whom I wish to be well and in good health.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 11, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer, citizen of Winterthur, my most esteemed and dear lord and brother. Winterthur.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Thomas Blaurer.</p>
