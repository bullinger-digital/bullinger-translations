    <p xml:id="regest1">Considers the victims of the plague fortunate, as they have escaped God's vengeance, which is manifestly imminent. Reports from Münster speak of new disturbances [by the Anabaptists]; from Austria, it is heard that [Suleiman I], with the support of the Tatars, has subjugated Moldavia and killed its inhabitants; Transylvania is also defenselessly exposed to him; it is said that near Rhodes, the Turks have scattered the fleet of the Emperor, the Pope, and Venice, with Andrea Doria barely escaping; Vadian writes that near Naples, the sea has receded and fire is breaking out from the earth nearby. Refuge is found only in God. Bullinger sends greetings and wishes to know more about the hinted conflict with the university.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I see, most esteemed Myconius, that anyone who departs to the Lord, inflamed by the plague, is blessed. Not only for the reason that enjoying the supreme good, God, is the highest happiness, but also because the times today are such that it is more preferable to die than to live. Everything proves and demonstrates that God is prepared for vengeance. Wretched are those who are not removed from this vengeance through death.</p>
      <p>You are not unaware of what some have attempted again in Westphalia among the Münsterites. From Austria, rumors report that Moldavia, which is part of Wallachia, has recently been captured and subjugated by the Turkish emperor, with all the inhabitants slaughtered. It is said that he had 60,000 Tatars under his banners; for he has bound the most immense king of the Tatars to himself by treaty and has him ready at his command. The Transylvanians are preparing their necks as if for the sword to come in the spring. For who is there to take up their cause for defense? Our princes are preparing arms against innocent and Christian blood. In these days, the imperial, papal, and Venetian fleet has been scattered by Turkish ships not far, they say, from Rhodes. Andrea Doria barely escaped the hands of the enemy. Several of his ships were sunk. Our Vadianus writes these days that the sea has receded a great distance from Naples and does not return, from which an intolerable stench threatens a deadly plague to all. He adds that in Apulia around Naples, fire is erupting from the earth and devastating the fields more than horribly with fire. Behold the mighty hand of God! I truly believe these to be the beginnings of sorrows.</p>
      <p>I could write many calamitous and portentous things of this kind, but let this be the end. Therefore, if the Lord has taken yours from the midst, or rather if he has called the shepherd with all, I believe it is well with you. Would that I might enjoy the same fate with you! But if it is not granted, the hand of the Lord must be awaited. He lives, he lives, who has redeemed us; he will not forsake those who call upon his name. Let us therefore be cheerful in the Lord, who is our rock and refuge. May he preserve you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours. Greet Grynaeus, Otto, Gast, and the others. I wonder what it is that you wrote about the university. Write, I beg you, and continue to love me. December 3, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his dear brother, Myconius. To Mr. Myconius.</p>
