      <p>Greetings. I hope, my father, that the letters I sent to you when I was about to embark on my journey have already reached you. Now I inform you that I have safely arrived in this city on the 29th of the previous month, and two days later the synod was commenced, which I hope will be successfully concluded by the middle of next week. In it, the letters from your college, read aloud, so delighted the entire assembly of brothers and the princes present at the meeting that nothing could surpass it. I hope to soon be the messenger of a very full and delightful response, at which time I am compelled to defer the narration of many and great matters due to being so occupied and burdened with so many tasks and concerns that I have scarcely been able to greet my friends. Our Viretus, whom I was confident I would enjoy seeing, was taken from us just as he was about to embark on his journey to us. Also, in England, Count Bellovacus, the only brother of our hero the admiral, has died, and in this man, you can scarcely believe how great a loss all the French churches have suffered, which I increasingly wish to be most commended to you and the other brothers. May the Lord preserve you there.</p>
      <p>La Rochelle, April 8.</p>
      <p>What Mr. Lochman counted for the messenger, I will repay as soon as I return home. But you, my father, commend this my return, which will be full of dangers, more and more to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Your B[eza].</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church and my most revered father.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
