    <p xml:id="regest1">Can only report very briefly: Has introduced the [Protestant] Lord's Supper [in Worms] after several councilors, who had previously prevented this, died of the plague; however, does not know what the opponents are now planning. Asks for intercession and encourages Bullinger to continue publishing. Plans to write again soon.</p>

      <p>I wish you health through Christ, most learned and dearest Heinrich.</p>
      <p>When this messenger came to me, I wanted to write much to you. But so many burdens, both domestic and ecclesiastical, fall upon me that I can scarcely speak. Nevertheless, so that I do not send nothing to you, I want you to know this one thing.</p>
      <p>For so many years I have preached the gospel of Christ with the diligence that I could through the Lord, yet the celebration of the Lord's Supper was prohibited by the magistrate, until the Lord corrected us with the most severe plague in these months, and also removed some of the tyrants from the council, who until now have left no stone unturned to prevent the progress of the gospel. Then, not being idle, with Christ urging me, I prepared the Supper for my church with (I hope) a happy beginning and distributed those heavenly gifts according to Christ's institution with great desire and reverence from all. No one opposes me. But because I have experienced Satan's deceit more than once, it is to be feared that the adversaries may harbor something in their bosom and have proposed to mature their plan sufficiently before they reveal it.</p>
      <p>I therefore ask through Christ, our common savior, that you commend me to the prayers, faith, and love of your people, so that God may confirm what He has worked in my church, for that Lord's Supper would be overturned again not without great offense to all, which I certainly do not hope. Therefore, do what befits you, and always continue to share your labors with us through writings; for many are helped by your works.</p>
      <p>Farewell, from Worms, in the Lord, October 20, 1539. Leonhard Brunner, minister of the word among the Vangiones.</p>
      <p>I certainly have serious matters to write to you, but today I do not have the time; however, I will seek a messenger with whom to send the rest.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and true herald of piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, teacher and dearest brother in Christ, in Zurich.</p>
