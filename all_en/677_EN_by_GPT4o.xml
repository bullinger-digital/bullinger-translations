      <p>S. D. To your letters, venerable compater, I respond briefly with this: Firstly, regarding the declaration of your agreement with Calvin, you will understand from the public letters what we have commonly agreed upon; I think you will be content with our agreement, for I do not see that you require anything else. In the doctrine itself, just as we did not previously criticize anything, so neither do we now.</p>
      <p>The preface, which seemed to contain nothing impious but something doubtful, has been satisfied and resolved. I see that you were somewhat moved by our response and understood it as if we were criticizing something in the doctrine itself, of which we are not aware. Eberhard is now writing in the name of everyone publicly. I have spoken about this matter with D. Hagius, as you instructed; I presented him with the German version. He has his own plans, which, however, are irrelevant; he approves of the agreement and sends you many greetings. Quaestor Haller is now in Baden at the assembly; we expect his return at any moment. I sent letters to Calvin from Laelius addressed to him and also wrote about our agreement; I am now awaiting a response. All those who reported to you that we had accepted the treaty here were false; indeed, the opposite has happened, and this matter is better than ever before. For all the laws and constitutions concerning this matter have been renewed, augmented, and published on September 8th throughout all the churches of the entire dominion, and nothing of the previous rigor has been relaxed. There are some idle people who fabricate such rumors to incite these most illustrious cities against each other. D. Hagius advises that if there are any who spread such things, they should be apprehended and the authors of such rumors should be inquired from them. It seems that those who wish to see these excellent republics fall into that foul treaty are fabricating these things. But they will achieve nothing here. Therefore, I bid you to be of a secure mind and I am sending you the form of the public mandate now promulgated, which, when you have read it, return to me; for I have no other copy. I both admire and deplore the levity of the people of Basel and Schaffhausen; they will bear a fitting reward. I hear little about the assembly held in Freiburg by the new confederates. The pensioners went there with great noise and applause; but they returned with much less jubilation. They say that not everything went according to their wishes; the money was not present. They also report that all the rumor spread about the English invasion of France was false or at least not as significant as the rumor was; but these things were fabricated, if in any way our republics could be compelled to accept the treaty by the magnitude of the danger. However, the Lord has granted that, while this is happening, the constitutions are renewed here, as you see. In ZÃ¼rich, we hear of a new cohort and faction of barbers and that public dances are indulged, which greatly afflicts me, both because of the levity of the act itself and because of the offense. But Satan attacks and vexes us from all sides. May the Lord look upon His elect! Meanwhile, our two students have returned. They highly praise the humanity and benevolence shown to them by all of you.</p>
      <p>We give the greatest thanks we can, especially to their host, D. the provost, the venerable old man, to whom we will send the remaining sum they still owe; for it was hardly appropriate to give thanks before settling the debt. I heard some time ago about certain crowned ones who did not complete the just weight, as reported to me by my brother; I therefore immediately wrote to D. Ammianus, that if there were any such, he should send them back; I would ensure that the head of our college would substitute better ones. But he neither sent them back nor responded at all. It is certainly not my fault if unjust ones were sent; for I send those whom I receive in their name; nor am I such a haggler that I would weigh each one to see what is lacking for each, nor is this customary with us. However, in the future, I will ensure that I either receive better ones or let the head himself send such ones who cannot be accused of any sordidness.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I found Bachofian. I informed her of her parent's death, as you instructed, and that everything was properly taken care of. She gives you the greatest thanks and sends many greetings to you and all yours.</p>
      <p>If you have not read D. Viret's letters, from their length, if you have deigned to look at them, you have understood how much trouble those people cause us, which is enough for me that you know. I thank you for sending them back soon; for I now need them.</p>
      <p>It would seem entirely advisable to me that, with your Declaration published in Latin, it should also be published in German, so that at least our own people could judge and be more easily tamed by recognizing the truth; for I know that certain troublesome people, driven more by hatred of persons than of doctrines, will not cease to slander this agreement, whose mouths would be shut by a common publication; for when your confession against Luther was published, it was also pleasing to publish it in the Latin language, so that foreign nations, whose consciences were wounded, could be healed. The same should now be done, since you have entirely decided to publish it, to which we do not entirely object.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that you write nothing about D. Laetus. Do you not know that he is in Baden? For he wrote to me from there. Please send him these letters if you understand that he is still there, or present them to him yourself when he comes to you, as he promises in mine.</p>
      <p>We are expecting the second volume of your decades; please do not delay completing such a useful, divine, and entirely ecclesiastical work. There is nothing new with us except those things that are not unknown to you; it is superfluous to write about them. Therefore, farewell. Greet your wife and the whole household from me and my wife. Greet your wife and the whole household from me and my wife. Musculus and his family greet you with all yours, she has not yet given birth. Tobler and Bindschedler, certainly diligent and modest young men, also send you many greetings and commend themselves to you. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Bern, September 14, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Johannes Haller.</p>
