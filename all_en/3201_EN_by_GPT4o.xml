      <p>S. I rejoice that the delegation to the French is proceeding, and if the arts of Satan had not been known for a long time, I would indeed wonder that the thought could occur to anyone, even one professing the gospel in appearance, to delay the most holy work, in which there is absolutely no loss, no matter how it turns out, but very much gain. I have not yet seen the Bernese delegation nor have I been able to meet with yours; but I will make an effort to meet. The people of Ensisheim add affliction to our English, who try to intercept those coming through their territory, intending to bring the just judgment of the Amalekites. Meanwhile, they are forced to deviate from their journey and make their passage through the margrave's territory to reach us. It is horrible, but such is the usual insolence of the impious, that they even take extreme measures against the innocent and holy, and those not subject to their dominion, so that they may become more proven and confirmed. As for the people of Bruges, they have responded that there will be a place for two families among them, but no more due to the town's narrowness. But in my opinion, they could be most rightly advised if the Kungsfeld Monastery, which is more than half empty, were granted to them for habitation. However, those who must work so hard will take counsel on this matter, so that they may find a nest somewhere for the wandering.</p>
      <p>Let us continue to help them with serious prayers to the Lord and with whatever efforts we can. Farewell in Christ Jesus with your wife and all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, the day before the calends of June, in the year 1557. Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>My mind forebodes some evil, as I do not understand why the Bernese envoy has not arrived by this day, on which I wrote this, fearing greatly that if he does not appear, even those who are present, yours and the Schaffhausen one, along with ours, may be hindered. But perhaps the Lord will provide better things.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
