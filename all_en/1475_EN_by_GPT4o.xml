      <p>S. D. I received your letter this evening, dearest godfather in the Lord, from which I understand that you have read my booklet titled: "Wie weit ein Christ schuldig sei Gewalt zu leiden" (How far a Christian is obliged to suffer authority) and that you approve of the subject, the brevity, and the sincerity of the treatise. You add that it is to be feared that it might be misused by overly fearful magistrates, and at the same time, you ask me to address this with another similar writing, titled: "Dass der Obrigkeit nicht zustände, ihre Untertanen zur Abgötterei zu zwingen oder zwingen zu lassen" (That it is not the duty of the authorities to force or allow their subjects to be forced into idolatry). I understand well; I would not knowingly present even the slightest occasion for anyone to sin against the gospel of our Savior Christ and the salvation of the subjects. I adapted my writing for the faithful in Augsburg, from whose letters I understood that there are many there who, when reproached for participating in papal ceremonies against their conscience, immediately burst out with: "What should we do? We are poor, captive people, we must suffer authority." Then I thought about the council and institution of the magistrates of Augsburg, who are now professedly papal or, if you prefer, imperial, and who think day and night about how to subject the people to the priests. While thinking about this, it did not occur to me what the evangelical magistrates of the world, who accommodate themselves to the world, not to the kingdom of Christ, might take from my writing, those who have been evangelical so far, so that they might somehow find a precept and a pretext for their defection from the evangelical doctrine. However, whatever it may be, I do not disapprove of your concern nor do I reject this subject, which you judge to be useful and necessary. In the meantime, however, please patiently accept what troubles me. This subject must be adapted to our magistrates, who have not yet defected from the profession of truth. For what is the point of writing to those who have been placed in power by the Emperor because they declared themselves supporters of papism even when our people ruled? Our people behave in the cause of Christ in such a way that I strongly doubt whether they have ears of patience to accommodate necessary admonitions.</p>
      <p>For it is much easier for them to demand patience from the subjects, so that they may endure the impious communication of papism for a time under some unknown hope, than to demonstrate the constancy of resisting the efforts of Satan worthy of evangelical magistrates.</p>
      <p>They are very reluctant to be occasionally reproached by their preachers, whom they cannot call Swabians; what do you think will happen to me? But let it be, let me face whatever danger there is, what should I do with the printer we have here, who is so negligent and at the same time poor, that he cannot respond to my efforts? I wrote dialogues about the Council of Trent, which I think you have seen; I could not obtain their printing here. I sent them to Basel; there they were detained for over 13 weeks before the consultants and deputies concluded that there was no danger if they were printed. Afterwards, I submitted writings on the division of the Decalogue because of the Interimists vexing the church of Augsburg and on the unjust force to be borne by Christians.</p>
      <p>I was forced to make an agreement with the printer and bear the cost. You can easily imagine how unbearable this condition of working by night is for my affairs. By the grace of the Lord, I have the spirit to assist, as much as I can, the afflicted matters in the church and the cause of Christ, for which I groan day and night and implore the mercy of our most merciful Father. But I am hindered in many ways, and whatever it is, my impetus is blunted.</p>
      <p>Believe me, dearest brother and godfather, we will experience how few there are who sincerely and faithfully mean the gospel of Christ. As for the magistrates, I promise us nothing other than that a story is told to the deaf in all matters that are said and written to remind them. The Lord, who stands in the midst of the mighty, has given the pen, with which they are to be prescribed, into the hands of the Emperor of the Turks, not to inscribe with ink on paper, but etc. Nevertheless, as I said, since you ask me to briefly and clearly explain the proposed subject about the magistrate, which you yourself could treat much more easily and better and more effectively among your people, I will do what you ask, as much as I am aided by the grace of the Lord. In the meantime, see how you can counter the most impious decisions of the Council of Trent on the Eucharist with a similar manner of writing. You have a ready and equipped printer, and if you are willing, you can easily accomplish such things. Farewell very well, dearest godfather. I am writing dialogues in which I discuss what is in our doctrine for which we are called heretics, then what is in papism, for the sake of which we have defected from the papists, that is, whether we are rightly called heretics and schismatics by the papists, and while writing, this thought occasionally occurs to me, what are you doing? to whom are you writing? who will print it? Thinking about this, I desist, then forgetting these things, I write again. May the Lord grant the grace to continue and to assist the struggling faithful, to whom, as all things are destined by the Lord, so from us too is owed whatever strength and resources there are. Farewell again. Please lovingly greet the lords and brothers, Mr. Theodor, Mr. Gwalther, Mr. Pellican, the most pious old man, your sons-in-law, Mr. Butler, and the whole household. All of mine, my wife and children, greet you. Bern, November 18, 1551.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, your godfather in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dearest godfather in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
