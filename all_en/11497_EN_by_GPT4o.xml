    <p xml:id="regest1">Considers it unlikely that Konrad [...] was killed, as he did not belong to the robbers; he has heard nothing about the maid. Emperor [Charles V] has unexpectedly not come to Heidelberg and Speyer, allegedly because the Palatine court preacher is Protestant. In Regensburg, they are preparing for the Reichstag to take place. He does not think much of the comet [seen in Worms], as Grynaeus is silent about it. Several princes are said to have accepted the Augsburg Confession. The [Worms] colloquium has now begun after all; they are initially negotiating about original sin, for which the Protestants are well prepared, and they expect a short duration of the talks. Due to lack of time, he cannot report on the agreed formalities, but he is confident. Copies of the letter from the Swiss Confederates to the Imperial Chamber Court have been sent to Germany and are receiving much attention. There is talk of a new king. From France, it is heard that [Francis I] has died. He would like to know if the letter from Grynaeus [No. 1441] has arrived. This letter is also intended for Theodor [Bibliander], to whom he cannot write separately.</p>

      <p>Greetings and a peaceful mind.</p>
      <p>There was also a rumor here about Kunhart that he was killed while being led as an accomplice of robbers. However, he had confessed here that a year ago a young man was killed by his people and had seven crowns with him, of which he received his share, but he was not present with the robbers. Indeed, I immediately thought: "Therefore, Kunhart was not killed by them." There is nothing about the maid that I have heard.</p>
      <p>The Emperor was expected by the people of Heidelberg for a long time, but in vain, similarly by those of Speyer; for the Palatine had prepared up to two hundred wild animals for his arrival, and it was forbidden to sell anything brought to the market. But it is said that he turned back because he heard that the Palatine had an evangelical preacher; now, however, it is unknown where he is.</p>
      <p>The Reichstag has not yet been announced, and it is known that many in Regensburg have prepared themselves in such a way that if it does not proceed, they would be reduced to begging. A form of a comet is circulated here, which they say has appeared; but since Grynaeus has written nothing about it, I disregard it.</p>
      <p>There is also a rumor with us that the Palatine, the Brandenburgian, the Cleves, and the Cologne have subscribed to the Augsburg Confession.</p>
      <p>About the colloquium: Our people, after no way could be found to have a sound discussion, prepared to leave with all books closed. And behold, suddenly a new spirit besets the adversaries, so that they want to meet. On the thirteenth of January, the oath was given to the notaries and substitutes; the following day, the colloquium began. The beginning is about original sin. About this matter, Grynaeus says, the brothers are so well instructed that he hopes the ignorance and impiety of those people can easily be brought to light. He thinks the discussion will last a day or three, as it was started under the arrival of the Emperor, so it would be dissolved sooner if he came there. For it is known that whatever they do is deceit; for all their efforts tend to expel Christ with all his kingdom.</p>
      <p>Although I could write something about the manner of the colloquium, my current occupations do not allow it. The Senate of Strasbourg sent that formula to our people.</p>
      <p>Indeed, everywhere I note that the grace of Christ has been strongly present with our people so far. I also hope the same for the future; they are so united and also eager that one cannot doubt the presence of the Lord and there is certainty about the confidence of the cause.</p>
      <p>Besides this, regarding the common letters of the Swiss to the chamber, the situation is as follows: They have been written and sent to Saxony, to Meissen, to Hesse, to the Brandenburgian, to everyone; no one has not requested them, and there is great hope that it will be an example to uphold the freedom of Germany.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I would write about the new king, if I did not assume that you have already been informed about it for a long time.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor from France that the Frenchman has died. Finally, let us consider how good and pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity. Whenever Grynaeus writes, he greets you diligently and especially you. I sent his letters to you with our envoys; you do not write whether they have been delivered. Farewell with yours in Christ. The letters are to be shared with Theodor; I was not able to write to both.</p>
      <p>In haste, Basel, January 19, 1541. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
