      <p>S. I have nothing to add to my previous letters except that the Prefect of Lausanne now writes differently from what I recently wrote to you, namely that the King of France has subscribed to the decrees of the Council of Trent.</p>
      <p>He writes that this was requested of him and that the queen worked hard for it to happen; but he postponed the response for three years; for since he has suspended the admiral's business and many other such matters for three years, he will also not respond to this matter before three years.</p>
      <p>But whether this is true or the previous report, I do not affirm for certain. There are many who think that a very serious war will arise between the Spaniard and the Frenchman; for the Spaniard is trying to use force against the Queen of Navarre because of religion; but the Frenchman has taken her under his protection. I have not yet heard anything about our captured Genevan mercenaries.</p>
      <p>I fear the real culprits have escaped. However, it seems to me that my lords find so much that those who were previously well disposed towards peace and worked hard for it are now slackening and do not want to engage with the Duke anymore. But if everything still goes awry, time will reveal it.</p>
      <p>May God send everything for the best!</p>
      <p>These things hastily, February 14, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your friends and brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours.</p>
      <p>I hear that Sulerus is traveling again in the Margraviate and is dealing strongly; but you might know better.</p>
      <p>I would wish him well in the Margraviate, if only he were in Basel with them. Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and compatriot, to be honored with perpetual fidelity.</p>
