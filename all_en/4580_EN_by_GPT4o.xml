      <p>S. I will write to the lords about what I have learned regarding the change of the kingdom.</p>
      <p>Francis died on the 5th of this month in the evening; his brother Charles, of good character, succeeded him. The administration of the kingdom was entrusted to his mother and the King of Navarre. All good people hope for more peaceful times.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to the lords, the most honorable council, and all friends, and love us. Solothurn, 15th of December.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that the inhabitants of the Val d'Angrogne have been oppressed by the Duke of Savoy.</p>
      <p>I have also learned that Philibert, Margrave of Baden, upon returning, occupied the monastery called Herrenalb near Stuttgart and imprisoned eleven magistrates from the neighboring villages, four of whom have died. Therefore, the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, as the defender of this monastery, has enlisted two companies and four hundred horsemen against the margrave. Wolfgang, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, joins him, and his relative, the Duke of Bavaria, will not abandon him. Some hope that the Elector Palatine and the Landgrave will act towards reconciliation.</p>
      <p>If you learn anything about this and other matters, please inform me.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich. Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
