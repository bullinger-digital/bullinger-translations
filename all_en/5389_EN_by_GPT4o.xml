      <p>S. D. I believe you have received my letters, which I wrote a few days ago and sent to Bern to be forwarded to you through Haller; in them, I indicated what response I received from the nobleman von Hallwyl, and I advised what seemed advisable to me at the time. Meanwhile, it is reported as certain that the Pope will request 4000 Swiss, as if he wants to use them for the protection of his body and the Roman seat; however, they will be led, as the more prudent predict, to France against our people. If the French send money and choose leaders for themselves promptly, there is no doubt that they will have many more soldiers than these.</p>
      <p>In the last expedition, few from the Five Cantons and none from our people went with them; for all favor Condé and his people. Many wonder why Condé does not also request soldiers; but perhaps our people are lacking money, or perhaps they prefer to fight with their own soldiers rather than foreign ones, which also seems to be the most prudent. May the Lord be with our people and strengthen them.</p>
      <p>We hear that our people have won and that the Guise forces have been defeated; this is reported in various ways, and we have not yet received anything certain.</p>
      <p>We are expecting your letters at any moment, in which everything will be fully explained. Nothing at all is heard about the Swiss who left under Frölich.</p>
      <p>The Landgrave recently sent a messenger to me with letters; he indicates that a meeting of the princes will soon take place, in which the rejection of the Council of Trent will be discussed. He therefore asks me to hear what the Swiss cities professing the gospel have decided and responded in this matter. He also considers it necessary for the Swiss professing the gospel to send aid to Condé, if the papists send troops to Guise. From this, I take the opportunity to urge him to also, together with the evangelical princes, send aid to Condé, since they see cavalry and infantry departing from the vicinity to Guise.</p>
      <p>You know that the people of Bremen are in the utmost danger. Our Albert has been expelled.</p>
      <p>Soon a rebellion arose.</p>
      <p>Once it was settled, our people began to prevail; therefore, the Lutheran ministers left, and soon a good part of the senate followed. They tried in vain to attack and overpower the city with treachery; now they spread strange, even monstrous, slanders against Consul Daniel and the citizens. Finally, they were also outlawed by the Imperial Chamber in Speyer.</p>
      <p>May the Lord deliver them from evil!</p>
      <p>I wrote hastily and did not reread.</p>
      <p>Farewell very well. July 7, 1562.</p>
      <p>Greet the friends and brothers; all of ours greet you. Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
