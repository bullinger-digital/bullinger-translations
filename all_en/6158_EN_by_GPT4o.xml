      <p>The plague still rages among us, most excellent Father Bullinger, so that the day before yesterday in this small town 20 perished. Thus far, within the span of three months, about 400 have died, and there is still no end; therefore, you have reason to commend us to the prayers of your church. Added to this is the fact that by decree of the Governor of Milan, it is no longer permitted to export grain from the Duchy of Milan to us; for they fear a shortage of provisions because of these almost continuous rains throughout the entire month of May. Thus, it happens that famine begins to follow the plague, and perhaps even war.</p>
      <p>For in Milan, soldiers and cavalry are being gathered against whom, may the Lord have mercy on us... I, with my family, by the singular grace of God, am well.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and you too with all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Your Friderychu greets you.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, the first of June, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Zanchi.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church and the best father. Zürich.</p>
