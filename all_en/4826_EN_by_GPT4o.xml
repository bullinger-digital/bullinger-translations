      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>In Rhaetia, serious disputes are arising. The very cause seems to be hidden Servetianism. Therefore, they argue against the creeds of Athanasius and Damasus and wish to free the faithful from these, etc. Five principal brothers, leaving the others aside, sent Michael Angelo to us and to Basel with very suspicious questions. We wrote to the synod, which is now being held in Chur, clearly explaining the matter, so that the dangerous situation may be addressed in time.</p>
      <p>We also dissuaded those brothers who sent the envoy from their pursuit of new things and schisms. We are now waiting to see what has been done.</p>
      <p>The Landgrave sent a messenger to me with letters concerning various questions. He offers all his efforts and shows himself faithful in the cause of religion, just like the Elector Palatine. From his court, I received letters these days indicating that the Saxons are trying everything to draw away the Palatine, but he remains steadfast and has harshly rejected the solicitors. Farewell forever with all yours.</p>
