      <p>I will inform you, Sir, of what you command.</p>
      <p>I will miss this man very much, whose work could have been useful to me, but I do not begrudge him better things. He has a very troublesome wife, who harasses him day and night, whose obstinacy cannot be overcome in any other way than if he is recalled, etc. Mr. Hercules asks you, Sir, to kindly transmit these letters to Mr. Martinengo on some occasion.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
