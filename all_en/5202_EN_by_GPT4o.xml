      <p>Mr. Bullinger, by sending this present gentleman bearer, I have indeed wanted, for the friendship that I will bear all my life to virtuous people who resemble you, and to you, to give him this address to you, which will not only be to give him more credibility and faith in the news he will convey to you from me and of my goodwill towards you. Therefore, relying on his word, which I ask you to believe as my own, I will pray to our good God to preserve in you the good health, virtues, and graces that He has so happily planted, along with a long and prosperous life. Written in Saint-Germain-en-Laye this 3rd day of March 1562. Your very good friend Louis de Bourbon.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
