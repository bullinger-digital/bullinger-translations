      <p>May the grace of Christ be with you. I received your letters, most learned brother in Christ Bullinger, along with the sermons on the Lord's Supper, and they were faithfully delivered by our prince, to whom they were first presented. I give you eternal and perpetual thanks for your not singular, but Christian kindness, which you have shown for many years towards a man of little worth, not to say most undeserving. May the gracious God repay your piety most abundantly into your bosom for these and other benefits, I pray most earnestly.</p>
      <p>I would mention news; but I fear they may be outdated; thus, everything changes daily and gradually, and you still have your angels who report the marvelous successes, disasters, and changes of the monarchies of Germany, especially those of Duke Maurice and Albert, etc. If you are unaware of these or if there are some doubts, you will learn the certainties from Hospinianus, who has them from the prince.</p>
      <p>I am also sending you the agreement on justification, if you do not have it, of the Prussian churches, as well as the judgment, responses, and confession of the theologians of the University of Württemberg on this matter. There you will see how shamefully some have stumbled in the harbor of our salvation. O God, be gracious and merciful to us.</p>
      <p>Likewise, I am sending the contention on the communion of the impious, which we long believed to have been expelled from our church against Angelandrum by the efficacy of God's word; it resurfaces again through Doctor Jacob Andreae, the preacher from Göppingen, who is a visitor to our prince from the church council of Neuenburg. You will see the arguments are indeed polished, but invalid.</p>
      <p>If only you would respond sometime. I am now laboring so that he may understand what Dares Entellus is, etc.</p>
      <p>In a few days, I will have a colleague from the duchy, Andreas Althamer. Who and what he is, I do not know; for if he is the one who has reconciled the Biblical Forest and the discordant passages of Scripture, and has persisted in the final propositions of his booklet, I will not agree with him at all; for there he obscures Christ's institution and interprets the words of the Lord's Supper carnally. If he intends to dispute with me, as such corrupt minds are wont to do, I hope with the gracious help of Christ, the Son of God, and the word of truth to refute his arguments, etc. All that I send, I beg you to return as soon as you can, brother in Christ to be respected, so that I may have copies; for from them I must gather the arguments of the adversaries. Farewell with these. Greet all the brothers in Christ, especially Gwalther, Bibliander, and the others. Tell Pellicanus to prepare himself, which he undoubtedly does no less than I, for the contest; for we both stand ready against the last enemy, the most cruel death, which we will easily overcome through him who first conquered it.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell with your family, and pray for us. The rest from Hospinianus, etc. Riquewihr, hastily, on the first of August, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, distinguished in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich.</p>
