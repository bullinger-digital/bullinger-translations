    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter and his goodwill towards him and his fellow students. Shares a selection of news that Bullinger is surely eager to hear: Landgrave [Philipp of] Hesse was in Marburg almost the entire winter; his daughter [Agnes] married Maurice of Saxony, the son of Duke Heinrich the Pious. Duke Heinrich of Brunswick published another writing against Philipp, who immediately prepared a response to preempt [the Imperial Diet at] Regensburg. Philipp arrived in Regensburg with the exiled Duke Albrecht of Grubenhagen and riders on March 27. Rumor has it that Duke Heinrich allied with the Bavarian princes after Philipp's arrival, and he is said to have made a great noise in front of Philipp's lodging; Philipp also had Heinrich's servants captured, who confessed to arson; his companion at the Imperial Diet, Count [Dietrich IV] of Plesse, also has prisoners who confess the same and even wanted to kill the Count. [Margarethe von der Saale] is said to have had a child. Tragically ending cases of drunkenness in Marburg. Wolf is taught by Lonicerus and uses Themistius, Melanchthon, Agricola, and Hermogenes for his studies; he is making good progress, especially in Hebraic studies. Rudolf [Gwalther] accompanies Draconites to Regensburg; Wolf has handed over Gwalther's works and his letter to Bullinger to Froschauer and has also taken care of the dispatch of Pollius’ [“Opuscula”] and the settlement of debts. Regards.</p>

      <p>All your love from all sides is evident in the letters I received from you recently when I came to Frankfurt; it is not unknown to me, but still welcome and desired, for I do not think I can be affected by greater pleasure than that which I derive from your singular kindness and your favorable disposition towards me and my companions.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is no doubt that you expect many new things, from which (since there is such a great disturbance of affairs and such an abundance of new matters that I do not understand what ought to be written to you from all of them) I think it right to write those things which I have partly seen and known, and partly learned from those who were present at the events. First: The Prince of Hesse was in Marburg almost the entire winter and gave his daughter in marriage to the son of Duke Heinrich of Saxony, Meissen, etc., who occupies Leipzig, a very wealthy prince, and after the wedding was celebrated there, the younger Duke Maurice, the groom, returned home.</p>
      <p>Then, when the Landgrave was in Waldeck, another pamphlet was delivered to him, written by Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, in which he attacked him with strange slanders and insults. He immediately worked day and night before his departure to respond, so that if an agreement were made at Regensburg, he would seem to have issued his final defense to the public and to have responded last to the insults made against him; for I also heard from some courtiers that he himself worked very hard on this work.</p>
      <p>Having completed this, he set out from Marburg with Duke Albrecht of Grubenhagen, who is an exile at the court of Prince Philipp, and, if I am not mistaken, with eight of his courtiers and 150 horsemen, but when he was about to leave the borders of his region, they say he had 300 horsemen and arrived in Regensburg with them on March 27.</p>
      <p>Then a rumor reached us in Marburg that Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, upon hearing of the Landgrave's arrival, had gone as quickly as possible to the Bavarian princes. Others say he made a great noise passing by the Landgrave's lodging. Whatever this is, whether true or not, it matters little. What I certainly know is that the Landgrave has some incendiary robbers who confess to being hired by Duke Heinrich's servants to bring this disaster upon Germany, and besides these, Count von Plesse, who went to Regensburg with the Landgrave, has the same confessions; for they not only plotted to destroy his domain with fire but also to throw him himself into the fire and a lamentable conflagration.</p>
      <p>It is also heard, though it should be kept quiet, that in Hesse the new wife of the prince - not a wife, but a concubine - has given birth to a daughter. I saw another pregnant, and I think she will soon give birth or has just given birth.</p>
      <p>So far, you have, Father Bullinger, what pertains to greed, fornication, adultery, robbery, and arson; now receive what pertains to drunkenness: I have indeed heard from men of proven faith that Count von Lüningen was suffocated by drinking and a student (if I am not mistaken) from Marburg, drunk, fell headlong from a horse into the mud and was found dead there with his feet turned upwards. In Marburg, I would also have more examples of drunkenness to avoid, but neither does the time allow it nor does your humanity seem to expect a longer letter from me.</p>
      <p>As for me and my studies, I wish you to hope for me, as you are accustomed, no differently than for a young man who tries to satisfy the expectations of his elders about him to the best of his ability, for I am now setting out for Marburg and returning to my studies. There, I use Johannes Lonicerus as my teacher in Hebrew, as well as in Greek.</p>
      <p>In philosophy, I have already bought Themistius and the compendiums of Philipp [Melanchthon] in ethics and physics, in logic Rodolphus and Hermogenes, which my mother has already sent from my library. I will take care, as I began at your urging, to make not a mediocre progress in Hebrew, which I hope will be most useful to me. You, however, with your wonderful and ready goodwill towards me, will try not to frustrate the hope I have begun, for I do not doubt that you, a man so upright, so constant, and so friendly to all students, will omit what will be excellent for me both useful and honorable.</p>
      <p>Our Rodolphus, together with Draconites, has been asked to go to Regensburg. I gave the letters written to you by him to Froschauer; for his sake, I especially came to Frankfurt, to commend his works to Froschauer and to inform Johannes Pollius of the copies sent in his name, and finally, what is most important, to ensure that everyone's debts were paid.</p>
      <p>Now, my Bullinger, father most worthy of all respect, may you fare most happily, surviving for the students into the year. I beg you to greet your family, especially your wife and mother, whom I have always found to wish me the best.</p>
      <p>In Frankfurt am Main, in the year 1541, on April 10. Yours, Johannes Wolf.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his uniquely esteemed father.</p>
