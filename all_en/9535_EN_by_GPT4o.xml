      <p>S. I received everything you recently sent, most reverend father, and I thank you for all your labors, which you have been pleased to undertake for our sake. I appreciate that you have perhaps dismissed that prodigy as unworthy of the light; if only such conflicts did not now flourish among the Engadiners, who would give effect to this prodigy. Unless God composes it, you will soon hear such things that will give you cause to think: "Why did this prodigy not come to pass?"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, what has been written to us from Rome and Venice, we send to you. Mr. Haller will also give you other letters from Mr. Lentulus, from which you will learn what he asks of you and Mr. Rodolph Gwalther. I ask, if it finds favor in your eyes, do not deny him this service, so that this book, which will be useful to many, may finally be published. Gantner persists in his intention and promises correction if he is first restored, but he does not feel rightly enough to be restored. - Mr. Campell, a veteran soldier of Christ, a most learned and pious man, recently sought and received leave and discharge in the senate and will depart from here at the next fair. Do you wonder about the reason? There are several; but the chief is the utmost contempt of God, which reigns here, and the ingratitude of men, who have so despised this holy man that he can no longer remain, as he has almost no sheep who can hear him. Some younger men, to whom he has hitherto been an object of ridicule and contempt, lie in wait for him, etc. About the rest, another time.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, January 2, 1574.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their greetings to your eminence.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your reverence, Tobias Iconius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most illustrious bishop of the Church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich to the pastor at the Great Minster.</p>
