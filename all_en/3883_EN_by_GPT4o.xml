      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding your complaint to us, most kind Bullinger, about our laziness in writing to you, you seem to do so with good reason; however, there would be a place for us to justify ourselves before a fair judge. For why should we bother you, overwhelmed as you are by the burden of affairs, with useless and moreover unlettered letters, especially when there is no just cause? The two letters we received from you, full of the best hope and consolation, were indeed welcome to us, from which we understood that God, having mercy on His church, has given at least some opportunity for respite.</p>
      <p>Indeed, they have given us no small incentive to pray to the most good and great God, that He may wish to support and protect it with His good spirit. The books you sent to our library, to Leodegar, to Jacob, and to me, we have received, and for this we give you great thanks, since nothing else is permitted; if only an opportunity would present itself to deserve well of you and yours; you would feel that the benefit was not placed upon the ungrateful. Now nothing remains for us but to pray to the Lord that He may wish to hold this beneficence in gratitude.</p>
      <p>As for the letters to Mr. Vergerius, etc., know that we have received them, but have not yet sent any to Tübingen; for we have been without reliable couriers. For if we entrust them to the carters, it is over for them due to their drunkenness and forgetfulness. There was hope that the prefect of the castle of Thayngen would come to our bean market, who could have conveniently transmitted them there; but no one from the castle was present. However, as soon as a reliable messenger presents himself, we will take care to have them delivered.</p>
      <p>Regarding your writings to be offered to the Duke, as you write, I immediately consulted Mr. Martin; he offers his services, provided the matter can endure some delay; for he is summoned after the Easter festival by the legate of France, the Archbishop of Vienne, to the Diet of Augsburg. Therefore, he can easily oblige you in this matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live long unharmed for the church of Christ. My fellow ministers greet you, especially Jacob, who wished me to thank you in his name as well. I wish Theodore, Martyr, Gwalther, and the others well.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, March 3, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, my uniquely esteemed lord and brother.</p>
