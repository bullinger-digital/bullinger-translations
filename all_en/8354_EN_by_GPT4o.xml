      <p> S. May the Lord bless your bath and bring you back safe and sound! Today I received your letter written on the 11th of this month. From it, I joyfully understood that your affairs are in a good place. May the Lord increase all good things with His blessing! I also understood what you mentioned from Mr. Campelli's letters about the affairs of the Venetians. Having made a pact with the Pope and the Spaniard, they are said to have never pursued the evangelicals more savagely; therefore, they will seem worthy to God, whom the Turk also presses and brings into order, although it is regrettable that the defender and propagator of the most vile idol Muhammad continues to break forth with victorious progress. But even under those impious victors, as once under the impious Roman Empire soaked with the blood of martyrs, He will preserve the Christian truth safe and sound, to which these allies, themselves stained with the blood of the saints, yield no place in their realms. The just Lord will someday purge their rust and most vile blood with the heat of His wrath and fury. Among other things, I see you are very eager for what I have about the peace of France; therefore, I am sending the letters written by the princes to the King of France about peace, which I spoke of recently and which I did not send then, but now I do, with the condition that you return them wrapped and sealed when you return home. I have added a note given to me by our Gwalther on August 14th, containing the most recent and true things about peace among us. </p>
      <p> From Heidelberg, it is written to me at the beginning of this month that the emperor at Speyer accuses Johann Sylvanus and some preachers of the Palatinate of conspiring with the enemy of the empire and supporter of the anti-Trinitarians, the Voivode, King of Hungary, and wanting to defect to him; therefore, they have been thrown into prison by the Elector Prince and are suspected of Arianism; Adam, the city preacher, has fled. These are certainly unfortunate, but if true, they are worthy to be punished and severely punished for their blasphemous impiety. We await the outcome of the matter. I understand well that the Reichstag has no greater cause than money, money, money to be offered to the emperor from the empire, etc. The Turk constantly empties his purse, to whom he has almost become a tributary, etc. </p>
      <p> Farewell. </p>
      <p> I wrote quickly on August 18, 1570. </p>
      <p> On August 15, my brother, happily living in Capella, at the age of 75, passed away to the Lord, etc. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. </p>
      <p> Greet all your bath companions faithfully for me, etc. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church of Chur, now bathing in the baths of Pf√§fers, my honorable lord and dearest brother. </p>
