      <p>Greetings. Shortly, as I hope, you will receive more detailed letters from me. However, having found a trustworthy man through whom I could send you Servetus's book, I did not want to miss the opportunity. If I am granted any relaxation, I will show in a short booklet what a monster he was, so that the wicked (as I hear is happening in Basel) may not continue to slander, and so that the ignorant may not murmur. Farewell, most excellent man, and brother to be sincerely respected by me, along with your family and colleagues. May the Lord always protect and guide you. Geneva, 22nd of November, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger</p>
