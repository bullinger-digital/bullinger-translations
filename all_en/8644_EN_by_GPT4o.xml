      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write at the moment, dearest brother, except that I have received all your letters sent to me, including that of Mr. Lentulus, whom I am very sorry to hear is ill. May the Lord restore him to us.</p>
      <p>There was no need for those letters of recommendation. I knew that the magistrate favored your people and that your fears were unfounded; for those scribes have their own character, as usual, always consistent with themselves.</p>
      <p>Neither did that good man, who was acting as an envoy, come to me, nor was there any need. As soon as I discussed the matter with some trusted individuals, I understood that the situation was not as dire as it seemed. Ganthner and Marius, unless restrained, will cause some trouble; but perhaps they have not yet matured, etc. You will pray to the Lord to be with you and the good cause, and because He punished Korah, Dathan, and Abiram and defended His ministry, may He also now be with His ministry. My son-in-law completed the work he began, not without great effort. In the meantime, while he was working, he was afflicted with gout; but he labored nonetheless, and the Lord was with him. I hope this work will bring much benefit to the churches that love the true or orthodox faith. I also, so as not to be idle, adorned another's work as much as I could. The booklet I am sending is a remarkable little work by an author unknown to me. However, he entrusted this work to me, sent from a famous city far from here, without revealing his name.</p>
      <p>He asked me to publish it if it seemed worthy of the light. It pleased me so much that I scarcely found another of this argument equally pleasing. Therefore, I wanted to share this with you, my singular friend and dearest brother. I pray you consider it favorably, and farewell.</p>
      <p>It is written from Bern and St. Gallen that the king of Fontainebleau has granted Blois for a conference with the evangelical princes, and that the marriage of the king of Navarre and the king's sister is certainly concluded, while the marriage of the queen of England with the king's brother is fictitious. If you have any certain news from Italy, please share it.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. May your wife also recover, and may the Lord bless her! Greet in order all those you know, all our people, the honorable consuls, Campell, Pontasella, Bonet, Gregor, etc.</p>
      <p>August 24, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Our Aernius Altdorffianus greets you. To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
