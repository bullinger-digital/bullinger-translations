      <p>Greetings. Your letter, venerable lord and godfather, dated May 15, was delivered to me today along with those you directed to the treasurer. Since he is not in the city but has gone to the toll stations, I will keep the letters with me until he returns.</p>
      <p>Mr. Lienhart Meyer's matter stands as follows: The people from the community of Grenchen appeared before my lords, requesting another preacher according to common practice. However, my lords hesitated because they did not want to give them the assistant from Sur, as they heard he was quarrelsome and arrogant, and they were unsure of what else. In short, they have stirred up the flames so that great displeasure has grown against him, and my lords sent us a note to elect another, but not the assistant from Sur, at the mentioned place. Consequently, another was elected, and the good man withdrew. I cannot say who was given to the community in this manner. I have written all the dealings to Gervasio, advising him to speak with the treasurer and decline if he also comes to Lenzburg, and likewise with other of my lords, who might travel to Baden with the governor. Meanwhile, you can also inform me whether I should hand over your letter to the treasurer or perhaps send it back to you.</p>
      <p>Regarding recent news, I have this: Firstly, last Saturday, Mr. Baschion Schertli returned here from France and informed us that the king is fully prepared for war against the pope and is eager for war.</p>
      <p>All the princes, while he was at the court, left the court, preparing themselves for Italy. The king does not want to leave Parma; the Count of Mirandola and others are already inside, etc.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he has shown himself friendly and has also written to my lords through him. Regarding the Turks and other news, he brought a certain report with him, which follows here word for word:</p>
      <p>News of the year 1551, May 6. 1. The Turkish armada has sailed past the Gulf with 157 ships and is heading straight for Villefranche, not far from Nice. 2. The pope has sent 4000 soldiers to Bologna. 3. The emperor's envoy is in Siena and is seeking troops to the utmost. 4. The king's envoy is recruiting soldiers on Venetian territory. 5. Don Pedro is in Parma with 2000 soldiers. 6. Don Ferdinand has sent 100 sacks of grain to Rome to sell due to the high prices there; Duke Octavio is said to have overthrown them and brought them to Parma, besides providing the city with provisions and other supplies, paying the troops. He is also preparing day and night. The pope has also excommunicated him along with Duke Horatio. 7. Don Ferdinand has taken a castle called Riboyres, belonging to the Duke of Ferrara, and placed 500 soldiers there, and the Duke of Ferrara is preparing vigorously. 8. The king's representatives from Spain and the prince from Savoy were expected in Milan on the 10th of this month for certain, so that all of Italy is in turmoil. 9. Our galleys in Marseille are being prepared with great diligence; the ships in Brittany, Normandy, and Rouen are also supposed to sail to Marseille.</p>
      <p>Given at Chambéry.</p>

      <p>This is what Schertlius had. Meanwhile, he says the emperor is excellently concealing his enmity towards the French. Further, this week letters have come to me from Augsburg, dated May 14. There they write: 1. That the emperor was very ill but has recovered in God's name. 2. That the prince's journey to Spain was hindered because Andrea Doria, who was supposed to accompany him, was attacked by the Turks at sea, and help was sent to him from Genoa, through which he barely escaped. Now the common saying in Augsburg is that he wants to move on. 3. That they wrote from Bologna that the pope's nephew arrived there on April 23 with many leaders to recruit soldiers against the king of France because of Parma. 4. The rumor is that the emperor wants to go to the Netherlands. 5. Maximilian has had a young son born in Spain; when this was announced in Vienna, they fired all the guns in joy. However, the next morning, some news came from the Turks that all joy was forgotten. 6. In Augsburg, all the walls and bastions are collapsing and falling, especially the mountain near Luginsland, so that they do not foresee anything good for themselves. 7. A book of wonders has been published by Mayor Herbrot, in which he recounts all his dealings, how he handled the city of Augsburg and how he turned his coat according to the wind. It is a poor, shattered government there, God have mercy.</p>
      <p>This from Augsburg. Also, the embassy from Sweden is still waiting for an answer. Duke Christoph has left. Meanwhile, Dietrich Marcell writes to Musculus that the prince has already left for Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, merchants from Augsburg were here, coming from Lyon, saying there is peace between the pope and the king of France; for the king gave the pope such an answer: he cannot tolerate the emperor having Parma, therefore he took it into his own hands; he does not want to take it away from the church; the pope should be satisfied with that. Also, the viceroy of Naples has captured Horatio, Octavian's brother.</p>
      <p>Today, merchants from Ulm were here, saying that the prince has left for Augsburg, and when he came to Landsberg, he quickly turned back and returned to Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Regarding Meidenburg, it is said that Margrave Albrecht of Brandenburg, when he marched on Meidenburg, was determined to conquer it with great seriousness; but they have resisted him so much that of his 500 horses, only 16 are said to have survived, and he barely escaped with 4 horses. Among the slain is said to be Ruoff von Rischach and a Count of Zorn. Lazarus von Schwendi was captured by the Meidenburgers, but they were robbed of him before they could bring him into the city. All the enemies are said to have retreated a mile away from Meidenburg, and the Meidenburgers are now lying in their camp.</p>
      <p>Duke George of Mecklenburg is still alive, must feed himself and other captives at his own expense; whatever they do otherwise from the nobility, they must redeem everything with grain, bacon, and other provisions, not with money. They are brave; God strengthen them. Amen.</p>
      <p>The lord of Heideck has reconciled with Duke Maurice, has become an officer in Leipzig; I would never have trusted him.</p>
      <p>The electors are supposed to have a meeting in Koblenz, but I do not know why or if it is certain.</p>
      <p>I also hear nothing from Nuremberg about what is being deliberated there. If you have anything, let me know; so much for recent news.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter, Johannes Piscatorius, has come here to see if there is any service available, but there is not; he complains of his poverty and misery in Stein, saying how much good you have promised him, he trusts in your kindness; he has come here hoping he might find better opportunities here than with you. But it has not been possible; therefore, I commend the good man to you, as he is also a Zürcher. Accept this for now. I have written it by candlelight; he wants to leave early tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Lastly, I ask you. My brother has my commonplaces, which I copied from yours; in them, I am missing in the 2nd volume two articles on prayer and sacraments; therefore, you could do me no greater favor than to lend him that volume for just one week, so that I do not lack anything from such a great treasure. Farewell excellently with all yours, whom you will greet from me and mine, along with all the lords and brothers. Farewell. Bern, May 28, 1551.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and venerable godfather.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
