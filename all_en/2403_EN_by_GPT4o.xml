      <p>S. P. Your letter, dearest compater, was very delightful to me, and I thank you for continuing to be so concerned about me. I am also very grateful for your concern about Mr. Hooper; by the grace of God, he bears everything with a steadfast and courageous spirit, even the threats of death. I know your letters will be very pleasing to him, as he has already indicated to me several times; I beg you, by Christ, not to deny him this. If I receive your letters, I will easily ensure they are delivered; for so far, by God's grace, he has always been able to write to me and receive my letters. Just make sure your letters are delivered in Strasbourg to Mr. Burker or Mr. Johann Garner, pastor of the French church.</p>
      <p>So far, I am well enough and endure this calamity as bravely as I can; the Lord will help and support my weakness. The prayers of good friends and sweet consolations are needed; therefore, I earnestly beg you not to neglect me. As for news, there is nothing I know that you cannot learn from the merchants who return from here to there.</p>
      <p>Please convey my greetings in my name to my excellent compater, your most chaste wife, Mr. Gualther, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, and their wives. Mr. Cechelles and Valerand Poullain send their greetings to you, and he sends you this booklet, from which you may learn about the constitution and entire order of our little church. If there is anything in it that you think should be advised, it would be most gratifying to him, and I beg you to do so by Christ. I commend myself and my children to your piety and most holy prayers. Farewell. Frankfurt, September 22, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most loving compater, Anne Hooper.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, compater and venerable friend. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
