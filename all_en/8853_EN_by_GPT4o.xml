      <p>God be with us, dearly beloved son. I wrote this enclosed letter late last night, intending to give it to Schlatter tomorrow; however, since you have come and brought the veal roast and the little kid, for which I sincerely thank you and Susanna, may God grant that you could eat it with us, etc., I have given you the money, the ten pounds, and the bottles of wine; if he, as I suspect, left it completely untouched and did not drink from it, then it is intact and good.</p>
      <p>Susanna and you should drink it together. Tomorrow I will see if I can send you fish through Schlatter. At the moment, I have no new news, except that in Lyon an eternal peace is said to have been proclaimed between France and England, and the Duke of Montmorency is being sent by the King to England to court the Queen of England on behalf of his brother, etc. I have preached myself so tired that I cannot write more and am otherwise always weary.</p>
      <p>On Good Friday, Zurich, April 4, 1572.</p>
      <p>God greet and protect you all. In haste, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
