    <p xml:id="regest1">[The people of Geneva] have urged [Guillaume] Farel to travel [to Zurich and other evangelical places] to seek support in light of the persecutions in France and the situation of the Genevan church. Refugees arriving in Geneva report that believers throughout France, especially in Provence, in Orléans, Angers, Dijon, Romans[-sur-Isère], and Grenoble, are being imprisoned or even executed; particularly painful is the arrest of [Charles de] Sainte-Marthe, who was supposed to bring [the Latin school in the Rive monastery] to new prosperity; after so much has turned for the better in Geneva, this is a severe setback. The moment would be favorable to rebuild the church, but suitable people are lacking, and Viret's own strength is not sufficient. Therefore, implore them to advocate for the return of Calvin, who is uniquely suited for this task. Additionally, they should ask [the Genevan council] to make efforts with the same zeal as for Calvin, also for others, especially for [Elie] Coraud, who was expelled under disgraceful circumstances. Recommends to them the Genevan church, on whose condition much depends.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. We have earnestly urged our brother Farel to undertake the journey to you, to present and commend to you the cause of the brothers who are in danger in France for the sake of religion, as well as the cause of the Genevan church: how we might assist them, unless aided by your prayers, efforts, zeal, and diligence, we do not see. The dangers to which the wretched brothers are exposed, the cruel tyranny raging against them, the sad news we receive daily from France, hearing of some destined for slaughter by impious men, villages to be destroyed and utterly overthrown, others cast into chains, others burned alive, I would recount at greater length, were they not more known and certain to Farel than to require our letters, who can narrate each detail to you with the utmost fidelity. Hardly a day, indeed not even an hour, passes for us without hearing the complaints, dangers, and torments of afflicted brothers, from those who have escaped from the hands of enemies and have taken refuge in Geneva, as in a harbor after shipwreck, the safest asylum of all the pious. There is scarcely a place in France that has not been invaded by cruel persecution. For besides the Provincial brothers, whose tragedy can neither be recited nor heard with dry eyes, we have learned that many in Orléans, Angers, Dijon, Romans[-sur-Isère], and Grenoble have been thrown into prison, and some even subjected to the ultimate punishment, as we have learned from eyewitnesses and the most certain testimonies. But there is no one, although all are most dear to us, whose imprisonment has caused greater sorrow to our hearts than that of Sainte-Marthe, a man of much learning and piety, whose work we hoped would most happily restore the Genevan college, which had so miserably collapsed and been scattered, and restore the good letters, which after the expulsion of the brothers lay neglected and in dust, to their former splendor, at this time when God has so pitied the deplorable state of that church that the fruits and success of the gospel far exceed everyone's expectations. But it seemed otherwise to the Lord, lest anything be entirely blessed, who wished us to have no solid joy in this condition of mortality that would not be marred by some portion of sadness. The affairs of the Genevans were proceeding most happily and were daily receiving greater increase: but this misfortune greatly hinders our efforts. Everything is now in our hands; now is the very moment and most opportune occasion to restore all that had collapsed. But there are lacking men commendable for their learning and piety who can accomplish this.</p>
      <p>The magistrates and the entire populace are finally intent on consulting for the best of the republic, removing offenses, factions, seditions, and other such pests of the republic to be relegated to wicked ravens, restoring the ministry of the word to its honor, properly instructing the youth, repairing hospitals and hospices, which had collapsed through the work of factious and impious men: but there are very few who assist and promote their pious efforts, while there are not lacking many who rather attempt to disturb and hinder, and envy the tranquility of the churches. Hitherto the Lord has not moderately favored our labors. But there is no one whose shoulders are equal to sustaining such a burden, much less mine, who am so weak in mind and body that it is a wonder I have been able to endure thus far. I have persisted as I could, but unless soon there come those who will take this province upon their shoulders and assist the struggling, I greatly fear that all the fruits of our labors will perish, and unless the Lord had wonderfully supported me and added strength, I would long since have succumbed to the imposed burden, overwhelmed and submerged by so many and such great affairs. Therefore, I implore and beseech you all through Christ the Lord, to take up the care of this church, and not to consider it entrusted to your faith any less than those over which you preside, and to make an effort that Calvin, the former pastor of that church, recalled by the votes of all, and most desired by all, and with anxious sighs, be restored to it, than whom no one living today can do more in it and to whom all things in it are more known, so that at the same time the church may be consulted and the ministry of the word restored to its honor, unless you wish to appear to have cast off the care of all churches, and to be traitors to Christ and the brothers who implore your help, which you cannot deny unless you lack all sense of humanity. But I have always learned to hope better things of you all, which is why I again adjure and beseech you by all that is sacred to lend a hand to this severe business at the earliest opportunity, and not to disappoint our expectation of you, and at the same time to write letters of exhortation and admonition to the honest: that, just as in recalling Calvin they testified to their pious affection for the ministers of the word, and condemned the impiety and perfidy of those by whom the brothers were so disgracefully rejected, with no regard for the religion of the law, so they may continue to do in other matters as well, and have some regard for ecclesiastical discipline, and the offenses scattered throughout the world, especially in Coraud, who was treated in such unworthy ways after imprisonment, in consolation of their blindness, relegated to exile, with no regard for his poverty, infirmity, and miseries, and the labors by which the good man had almost exhausted himself. Write everything that seems to you to contribute to the glory of Christ. There is no doubt that they will gladly embrace your counsel in all things. Farewell, most beloved brothers and revered fathers, and be mindful of that church whose blind misfortune drags many to ruin, whose success and progress is spread far and wide. Geneva, the twenty-seventh of April.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Pierre Viret.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
