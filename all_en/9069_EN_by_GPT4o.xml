      <p>My greetings beforehand. Faithful, dear godfather, as these laurel berries happened to come into my hands, which were just caught and thus became fresh for me, I have sent them to you; asking you to kindly accept them, etc.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, it has come to us how our faithful, dear confederates from Bern have initiated a general search throughout the entire country and have sent the exiled bandits, who are in Geneva and elsewhere, so that they might be better received. I would like to know if it is indeed so; for many among us think it would be a good and Christian work to do this in all evangelical places, and they would be eager to initiate similar searches, as I have now understood from some good-hearted people. Therefore, if you know anything about it, let me know; so I could better motivate the good-hearted.</p>
      <p>For the moment, I have nothing further, except what I have noted in the previous letter. Herewith, you are entrusted to the faithful God. My wife and my children send you friendly greetings.</p>
      <p>Given at Glarus on the 15th of October, in the year 72. Johannes Hugo of Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the venerable master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, my faithful, dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
