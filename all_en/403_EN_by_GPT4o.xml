      <p>Grace from God, etc. This week I have written to you twice. First, I sent to Marx Stapfer the sermons of Blaurer on the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which are truly very suspect to me and not pleasing. I wish he would refrain from such nonsense; for he particularly, in my opinion, explains poorly and not insignificantly when he should explain the mode of either the communication or the presence of Christ. This would not be tolerated here at all. However, if he refrains from this and explains it sensibly (therefore not crudely, as if little depended on the mystery, as some do), I would gladly have him here; for otherwise, I do not know how we will proceed if we are not otherwise provided for. I fear greatly that we will ultimately end up at an impasse; for no one wants to consider what great lands, what severe disputes are involved, what great effort, attention, and work it requires. Everything is left to go, nothing counts but suspicions and calumnies; they govern our church more than true diligence. Besides, it is thought that everything is well provided for, everyone praises God for unity, but does not look to the future.</p>
      <p>If they think they want to burden me, they burden us enough, if they load it onto me, which I neither know how to bear nor provide for, other than that I stand in constant fear partly because I cannot do what I should, and partly because I cannot do it without the help of another learned and understanding man. Therefore, I will not bear it, and God grant, whatever everyone says, that I should and must stay here, I will not let myself be brought into the clutches in any way, since I can well manage with God and all honors. I know, as long as I am here, my lords will be harshly criticized, that they are lying about a single learned man. They... partly because of the cost and partly because they think it is not necessary, and also because they have not all succeeded well so far. Besides, the church and the great administration have not been helped. In summary: if I thoroughly assess the state of this church, it is not well. I beg you for God's sake for help, advice.</p>
      <p>Writing to some of my lords, impressing upon them how necessary it is for them to look for a learned man.</p>
      <p>I need not say more; the more I say, the less happens; for they all think, as soon as I speak of it, I do it so that I can leave with better reason, which, although it is partly true (for why would I not want the church to be provided for after me), yet I am so much more concerned with the welfare of the church that, even if I had to stay, I could not or would not know how to stay if we are not otherwise provided for. I do not blame Mr. Josen or Dr. Wäberum; they are both true, dear brothers to me, but as for the matter, I leave it to you to consider whether this office can be provided for by preaching alone. Therefore, helping and advising how to proceed with the matter.</p>
      <p>Xystus writes to me from Augsburg in such a way that I understand well that he is not yet inclined to move there. Therefore, it will be necessary to look for another schoolmaster. Eberhardus is unwilling, and it is no wonder. Public lectures are, by God's grace, in a free course; only in theology could it be better. Nicolaus reads Lucian, also Hebrew grammar of Munster and Isaiah; he is a good grammarian and diligent as well. Eberhard reads Theology, now the Epistle to the Romans, also he will now begin to read an author publicly, either Horace or Valerius Maximus.</p>
      <p>Telamonius reads the dialectic of Philipp also very well, is gifted, also reads arithmetic and the Sphere of Johannes de Sacrobosco on Tuesdays and Saturdays. So they examine and assess at all Lent, that these studies are well conducted and we do not have unlearned boys. I wish you had the means to send some of yours, one or two, here; it would have brought much favor and willingness among my lords, so that they would be more inclined to promote the studies.</p>
      <p>As far as the trivial and lower school is concerned, it depends on having a good schoolmaster.</p>
      <p>Now, after Xystus, I know no one more suitable than your Sebastian at the Fraumünster. I have spoken with him myself before; he has not thrown it far.</p>
      <p>Write to him also with this; I ask you to speak to him and handle it as you think good and useful for our church. Benedictus Martinus from Marburg will probably come at Easter, who, when neglected by ours, succeeded Caspar Rodolphi. His erudition is sufficiently attested to us, but we fear he will bring his Lutheran spirit with him and cause us new unrest, therefore we would like to address the matter in time. Honor God and help us and let me know soon regarding Sebastian, what I should do.</p>
      <p>In the second letter, by Gyslinger's mother, I have sent you Calvin's booklet on the Interim. I send you herewith an image of the Interim, given to me by a good fellow, who secretly engraved and printed it, leaving out the other poems with the name; do not pay much attention to it, what you think. The wickedness of the world must be understood, whether opportune or inopportune, yet that it all builds.</p>
      <p>I also kindly ask you, since you have collected and gathered many good things concerning marriage matters, to help me with some; for the merciful court burdens me greatly with the excessive, wild, crooked matters. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday we must sit from morning until 11; I do not know how to handle it all.</p>
      <p>I am also now greatly concerned about the synod; I worry it will proceed strangely. Now I want to have it on the cart as long as I can. A game is brewing over the Lausanne people, which I fear will result in a harsh dismissal for them. They can do nothing but calumniate on both sides, to prevent any gratitude from one council to another. If you take their side, you get involved with them in the game and will never be right; if you do not take their side, they accuse and slander us of neglecting our duty. I am completely full and tired of their nature.</p>
      <p>Treasurer Haller and mayor of Wattenwil are now in Zofingen. Hagius and Fenner Witenbach send you many greetings, as does all my people, also your wife and child. God be with you at all times.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 14, 1549.</p>
