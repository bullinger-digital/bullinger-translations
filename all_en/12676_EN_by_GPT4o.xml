    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Lavater has inferred from Bullinger's letter [not received] the reasons for his prolonged silence. However, he also suspects from the letter that Bullinger is angry with him because he had asked him for advice on the matter of the Lord's Supper.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He has realized himself that he does not want to change his religion. He also does not believe everything that is said. The [Strasbourg clergy] only demanded that he not reject the Basel Confession [i.e., the First Helvetic Confession] and participate in the Lord's Supper in accordance with it. They did not demand that he abandon the faith of his homeland. However, he has always denied that the [First Helvetic] Confession is identical to the Wittenberg Concord; for how else would the last dispute between Luther and the Zurichers be explained? But enough of that.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Strasbourg teachers have decided to inquire with the Zurich [clergy] by letter. Lavater does not know whether this has already happened or not. In his response, Bullinger should not appear irritated. Lavater would like to study in Strasbourg until the end of winter. Then the whole matter will come to an end!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] He is now living with [Matthias] Zell, who took him in for the sake of Bullinger and [Konrad] Pellikan, but is therefore being opposed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Lavater likes Bucer, even if this is not mutual, because others are preventing Bucer from doing so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The rift between the Zwinglians and Lutherans now seems truly relentless...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Lavater will send his father [Hans Rudolf] an expense report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] There is nothing more to report. May the Lord preserve Bullinger for his church! Greetings to the parents [Hans Rudolf and Anna, née Reuchli], to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler], to the children, and to the whole household.</p>

      <p>S. P. D. Your letters were most welcome to me, most esteemed father, from which I understood the reasons for your prolonged silence, which you have maintained in recent times, and your well-being. However, from the same letters, I could suspect that you are displeased with me because I thought it necessary to consult you on the matter of the Eucharist.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As for me, I have been able to understand well enough that my religion should not be changed, nor am I one who believes everything that is said without judgment. They only demand that I do not reject the Basel Confession, but that I take the Eucharist instructed by that faith. They did not openly want to be the authors of changing the religion of my homeland. But I have denied and continue to deny that the Basel Confession is the same as the Wittenberg Concord. For if we approve of the Basel Confession, what would these disputes mean, what the fight that recently occurred between the Zurichers and Luther? But I leave these matters; we have given an account of our faith.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It has been decreed by the teachers of our school that they should write to you about what your plan is concerning us. Whether they have sent letters to you, I do not know. I wish to respond with them, so that you do not act too harshly, so that I may benefit from this school. God will bring an end to these matters after the winter!</p>

      <p>I have changed my lodging. Mr. Zell, with singular benevolence towards you and Mr. Pellikan, has received me into his house. However, he will be compelled to endure great envy. But he tells me to be of good cheer; he does not fear these things at all, as he has endured more serious ones.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I love Bucer, although he does not love us at all; but I think this is entirely due to the instigations of others.</p>

      <p>I now see that the rift between the Zwinglians and Lutherans, as they are called, is truly relentless...</p>

      <p>I will soon send my father an account of the expenses I have incurred this year.</p>

      <p>I have nothing that would be of interest to you. May God deign to keep you safe for the well-being of His church for a long time! Do not disdain to greet my parents, your most honorable wife, your children, and the whole household in my name. In Strasbourg, October 16, 1546. Yours sincerely, Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant Antistes of the Zurich church, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron. In Zurich.</p>
