    <p xml:id="regest1">Schuler has not written for a long time because he intended to refresh the old friendship with a visit to Bullinger, but also due to a lack of messengers and many obligations. The Memmingen church is doing well. Together with others, he signed the [Wittenberg] Concord, as Luther's view of the presence and offering of the body and blood of Christ in the Lord's Supper is not far from theirs and does not contradict that of Oecolampadius and Zwingli; to protect the churches from further disputes, they have agreed on the most important points - so that it was easy for Memmingen to join -, and he is convinced that neither the essence of the Lord's Supper nor the trust in God is endangered. Otherwise, he is doing well, his wife is pregnant, the children are healthy, and he gets along well with the council. He is currently with Bucer in Isny and would have liked to travel further to Bullinger, but must return to Memmingen due to his health and business; the letter is meant to be a start to renewing their friendship. He asks for love and generosity, sends greetings, and awaits Bullinger's response. [Postscript from Martin Bucer:] However his undertakings are understood by the people of Zurich, he loves them and wishes them strength from God; since the Concord is receiving great approval in Germany, he hopes that the sincerity of his motives will also be recognized in Zurich. Denmark and Norway, where the bishops have been removed, have become evangelical; Johannes Bugenhagen has traveled there to reorganize the churches. Greetings. Bullinger should stand up for the truth in the Bernese matter.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ, our Savior.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>For almost a year now, my incomparable friend and brother in the Lord, Bullinger, I had planned to visit you and converse with you in the Lord to my heart's content, thus reviving our old friendship through mutual discussions and rescuing it from the neglect of oblivion. And because I had decided to explain everything to you in person, it happened that I have not communicated with you through letters until now. Moreover, there is rarely an opportunity for a messenger, and many and varied duties of the church entrusted to me stand in my way. But since I am still unable to respond to my plan in action, overwhelmed by the magnitude of the benefits you have bestowed upon me, I am compelled to at least inform you of my affairs through my letters.</p>
      <p>Regarding the state of my church, things are going well, considering the present times. I and my colleagues have subscribed to the Concord, not out of favor for any man, but led by love for the truth, as we clearly see that Dr. Luther, concerning the substance of the matter, is not alien to our view regarding the presence of the body and blood of Christ and its offering, in his own way, which certainly neither the blessed memory of Zwingli nor Johannes Oecolampadius ever denied. Since there has been much strife over the manner of this presence, to the great detriment of the churches, but agreement on the substance of the matter, we were not only not burdened but even compelled to give place to this concord begun in the Lord, even in the church of Memmingen. I am aware that your love has moved every stone to ratify this concord. That you have not yet succeeded with some is due to their obstinacy, not your Christian diligence. But continue, my dearest brother, to show yourself to us as you once did to the common brothers gathered in Basel in the Lord. Let the church, acquired by the blood of Christ, be more important to us than to allow it to be shaken by such an unavoidable contention. I cannot see, by God, how the nature of the Eucharist, and thus faith in the promises of God, can be endangered. If we wholeheartedly assent to this conceived concord, it seems more advisable to me to die than to disturb the church of Christ so greatly in that one matter where we can come together without loss of solid truth. Satan devises enough deceptions daily to break apart true love, planted in the Lord, and uproot it. May the Lord finally grant that the whole world recognizes Christ as all in all, that everything depends on Him alone, and that the same Christ, by His Spirit, uproots all scandals completely, so that His name is revered throughout the world, etc.</p>
      <p>As for the condition of my body, I am somewhat well. My wife is pregnant. The children are healthy. There is good agreement between the council and me. In temporal matters, I desire nothing, as long as I have the necessities of life.</p>
      <p>While I write this, I am in Isny with our dearest brother Bucer. And although I wanted to visit you on this journey, my health and the burden of business have ordered me to return to Memmingen. Let this letter, therefore, be the beginning of renewing (if anything threatened ruin) our friendship. In the future, I will be more frequent in my visits if I see that what has lapsed due to my fault with you has been restored by these my letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell, incomparable friend, and continue to regard me with your usual love. You know, my Bullinger, what the nature of charity is, namely to bear errors with an even mind, always to hope for better things, at least in a brother. My wife, along with your mother and children, sends you many greetings. Farewell again in the Lord, and may the Lord grant that this my letter puts the pen in your hand, so that I may see, by your own autograph to me, that your old friendship is not yet completely (and that by my fault) erased.</p>
      <p>Given in Isny, July 19, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>Greetings, my Bullinger, in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>However my labor and efforts for the concord of the churches may be received by some there and spread to many churches from here, I still honor you all in the Lord and wish that Christ may reign more powerfully in you day by day. Thanks to Christ, this entire concord of ours is gaining beautiful strength in the rest of Germany, and yet I hear of very few who are more hostile to us. The Lord will grant that your churches also recognize that we have acted in this cause as piety in Christ demanded.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>The entire kingdom of Denmark and the kingdom of Norway, with all bishops abolished, have joined us. Pomeranus has gone there to establish churches.</p>
      <p>Greet our Pellican and anyone else to whom my greeting would be welcome.</p>
      <p>In our cause with the Bernese, I beseech you to support the cause of truth.</p>
      <p>To the man of great learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zurich, dearest lord and brother in Christ.</p>
