      <p>S. D. See how generous and liberal I am, my dearest and most esteemed Myconius, I am sending two letters in response to your one. I thank you for your diligent writing; in the previous days, as you see, I wrote earlier, meanwhile, I received nothing from Augsburg except these few lines dated August 6:</p>
      <p>"The emperor is in Munich. Before he was ready to depart, the Lord's Supper was held here in the parish of St. George; a large crowd attended, many of them foreigners, especially the English embassy, which is here with 12 horses. The crowd eagerly attends the word of God.</p>
      <p>They are not proceeding further than to deliberate on the 9 articles" etc. This and nothing more.</p>
      <p>I wish what you report from the account of Mr. Schertli from Leuven and Antwerp were true.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, something might break if it happens; for the godless, fierce tyrannical behavior cannot be endured for long.</p>
      <p>The plague, unheard of in its cruelty, destroys many in Chur. Many good men have already passed away, among them Mr. Johannes Blasius, the minister; Mr. Johannes Comander has recovered from illness.</p>
      <p>I think the matter of WÃ¤denschwyl will now be settled to our advantage in Baden; I will know this thoroughly in 3 or 2 days, and I will let you know as well.</p>
      <p>I have shown no hospitality to your son; for today he announces both his departure and his arrival; but you know otherwise how I am disposed towards you and yours. Mr. Vergerius is staying at Mr. Pellicanus's house and is now translating my writings on justification into Italian; he sends you many greetings. Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>In great haste. Zurich, August 20, 1550.</p>
