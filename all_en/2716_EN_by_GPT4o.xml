      <p>Greetings and Peace. Although, most humane of men, there is almost nothing that I could write to your humanity, I wanted to rather entrust something to my letters to you, however insignificant it might be, than to provide an occasion for some sinister suspicion about me, lest you think I am neglecting the duty of writing out of forgetfulness or some negligence. Therefore, know from me, if you have not already learned from others, that our most illustrious prince is entirely focused on settling with almost all his adversaries as amicably as possible. For this reason, he has finally allowed the Nassau case to be decided by the arbitration of the most illustrious princes of the Palatinate, WÃ¼rttemberg, Cleves, and Trier, and perhaps some other orders of the empire, and has agreed to their judgment to pay six barrels of gold over nine years to preserve that county intact, where once not a single request was made. Such is the treachery or even the avarice and flattery of the counselors and jurists that, for the sake of their own benefit, they do not reconcile the princes, do not settle and resolve disputes, but rather exacerbate them against each other, prolong and nourish them, and even revive those that have been put to rest. If the inconveniences that follow from this fall upon their heads, we would not be forced now to contribute two and a half florins for each cask of wine and one obol for each measure of beer, in addition to the old excise, as they call it, and 6 1/2 florins for each cask of wine to the prince, who is otherwise not a tyrant, and indeed for 14 years, if not perhaps in perpetuity. For it was previously only approved to be paid for 8 years, for what was spent on his discharge, but now six years further, to help with the Nassau matters, etc. These are the public matters; there is nothing to write about private matters. As for your young men, the reason I might write less in the future could perhaps be Finsler, who wrote to me during the last fair the following words enclosed in parentheses, full of petulance, to say nothing more serious: (Christoph Froschauer will pay your humanity, most learned master, 3 florins 9 albus according to the tenor of my two promissory notes, which he will receive from you and deliver to me. I free my faith, as I promised you in person, which no good or honest man would say I broke. I would indeed have enough occasion to remonstrate with your humanity. But because I am more prudent in writing than your humanity was, like a noble and generous horse, I neglect such barking and only give you the greatest thanks for your benefits bestowed upon me and offer my service, if there is any, to you in return most willingly). Indeed, this is the gratitude that the benefits bestowed by me have deserved, that he boasts that the noble and generous horse neglects my barking because he is more prudent than I in writing, he does not dissimulate so much as to shout enough that, unless he feared for himself, they would not have gone unpunished. But I forgive him this bitter and unworthy comparison of his, unworthy of a disciple and guest, who admits the benefits bestowed by me upon him, and I attribute it to his arrogant imprudence and ask you to inspect my letters to you, whether you find any of my barking in them. For unless I am mistaken, I wrote nothing more bitterly about him in particular, indeed I interceded for him as well as for the others, so that you would not take them according to your right, and indeed, if I had wanted to exercise the pen against Finsler, if I had at least touched upon how he behaved at Sultzbach, even drunk, of which I have Hyperius and his other compatriots as witnesses, I believe you would not have let him go unpunished. Furthermore, if I am to be compared to a dog because I incidentally write to you what I desire in your young men, so that you may know what remedies are needed to restore their health, indeed I am foolish, who persuade myself that you require this very thing as a faith owed by me and that it befits me to have such faith, and if I do otherwise, I incur the blame and suspicion of perfidy. Farewell well and keep me commended to you. Given at Marburg, September 5, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and best man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of God in the church of Zurich, his esteemed lord.</p>
