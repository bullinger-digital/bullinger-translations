      <p>Venerable, dear and highly trusted sir, I hereby send you a pasquinade about the most holy death and departure from this time.</p>
      <p>And I also inform you that today I received a letter from Strasbourg, stating that out of fear that the Emperor himself might come to the city to enforce the Interim, they have reconciled with their bishop and have granted him permission to enjoy four churches there, reserving the rest for their preaching. They believed the Emperor was already on his way, as he had intended to set out, and 600 Spanish horses along with four companies of landsknechts were enlisted to accompany him, with these horses already having arrived at Hausen near Speyer. But six days ago, they wrote again that they were withdrawing back to their camp, and he intended to spend Christmas in Brussels and only come up at Candlemas. Thus, those in Strasbourg have renewed hope that the priests will be held back with the Interim and their nonsense, seeking one reprieve after another. In summary, there are good plans in place, if only there were brave people and men available.</p>
      <p>May the Almighty come to our aid; would to God I were with you for an hour; you would hear wonders. I could not keep it from you with... all honor and goodness.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel on the 18th of December in the year 1549. Your willing Sebastian Schertlin, knight, wrote this.</p>
      <p>To the worthy Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
