      <p> Greetings. I am not accustomed, nor should I be, to bother you with idle letters, my venerable and dearest Bullinger. However, if I receive any news amidst these whirlwinds of all things, I perform a mutual duty, since you, with such faith and diligence, do not conceal from me anything that friends write to you about these matters. Three days ago, Mr. Georg Murer was with me, a man well-known to many princes and privy to many secrets, who, among many other things that you have long known before, also mentioned this: That some lords have defected from the Weida and have again submitted to Ferdinand, seeking his protection and shelter; this is the reason why Ferdinand is raising troops there, so that he can provide support to the aforementioned lords, otherwise they would soon be attacked again. He also pointed out to me how the Pope has been earnestly warned by many kingdoms, England, Scotland, Poland, Sweden, and many others, that he should not provoke unrest with his council and should not rashly engage in execution, or they will put all their resources into it and cause him a disturbance that will be very burdensome for him. The news from France about the Duke of Guise, how he acted so murderously, which we had also heard about before, he also knew with many others, and also said that in Dolosa, 200 men were appointed as a guard for the believers; among them, one had shot at the preacher but missed, yet hit a nobleman and shot him through the head, so that he remained dead, for which the perpetrator was captured, and yet, when they wanted to interrogate him about the murder and inquire about his practices, he was pardoned during the night, so that he was found dead. Also, that there was a great commotion in Ling; for the bishop had forbidden the singing of psalms and the Lutheran books, for which the craftsmen and guilds had gathered and wanted to know from the bishop who had commanded him to do so, etc. He earnestly begged for forgiveness and revoked everything; otherwise, it would have gone very rough and badly, etc. He also pointed out to me that the imperial city of Wangen in Allgäu will soon fully submit to the Gospel of Christ; for those in the daily council are very willing, and the mayors are inclined towards the matter, and they also have a very fine, skilled preacher, named Sebastian Sterck, who announces the Gospel of Christ most purely. In the meantime, however, everything concerning the Lord's Supper is demanded according to Luther's opinion and the oracles of the Augsburg Confession. I send what Rüger wrote to me, so that you do not think they are entirely trifles, the rumors about the moving mountains that have been circulating for some time, which are easy to conjecture what they portend for this deplorable age. He wrote yesterday that Caspar am Hof, a notable adversary and a great instrument of Helvetic discord, has been removed by death. You, my most esteemed and best brother, fare well with all your family and fellow ministers and other excellent and learned men, whom you will honorably greet on my behalf, commending me to the Lord with diligent prayers. April 10, 1562. To the most outstanding man in piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a friend and brother as esteemed as he is by far the dearest of all. Zurich. </p>
