<letter xml:id="file12817"><summary><p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Myconius should ensure that the enclosed letter is delivered to Bucer in Strasbourg by the next reliable messenger, by entrusting the writing to a mutual friend, the Basel city clerk [Heinrich Ryhiner] (whom Bullinger also sends greetings to). </p><p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Vadian writes [not received] that Giannettino Doria, an official of Emperor Charles V, was stabbed during a bloody riot in Genoa. The instigator of the uprising, Count Gian Luigi Fieschi, a supporter of Pope Paul III, has been arrested. He confessed that he wanted to take Genoa and hand it over to the Pope. This was reported by a man who returned from Milan. Should the news be true (and may it be so!), the Pope will probably also learn that the Emperor has descended to the River Styx [at the border to the underworld] and learned from the Roman emperors Nero, Domitian, Diocletian, and Julian how to eradicate the Gospel! </p><p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Things are going badly in Ulm. The Spaniards and Italians are behaving as one would expect from them. God have mercy! The Emperor was supposed to enter there yesterday, but is reportedly ill. </p><p xml:id="regest4"> [4] On Saturday [January 22], Bullinger received the letter from Myconius [No. 2761] through the Zurich messenger [Melchior Schlosser]. On the same day, the Zurich authorities drafted 6000 [correct: 4000] and 2000 men for the banner and the company, respectively. Additionally, the bailiwicks [of the Common Lordships] Thurgau and Sargans, as well as the areas allied and obligated to Zurich through the Burgrecht [in the Zurich countryside], will probably provide another 2000 men. [For the banner] Bernhard von Cham was appointed captain, Andreas Schmid as banner lord, the old [Rudolf] Schwyzer as standard-bearer, [Itelhans] Thumysen as captain of the shooters, [Hans] Holzhalb as ensign of the shooters, and Heinrich Lochmann as [shooter] standard-bearer. For the company, Seckelmeister Heinrich Rahn the Elder was appointed captain, Heinrich Kramer as ensign, Rudolf Lochmann as standard-bearer, and Balthasar Keller as shooter. Today, the guards and the quartermasters, as well as the captains for the pikes and halberds, will be elected. Captains are also to be appointed for Stein am Rhein and other places. </p><p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Greetings, also to Johannes Gast. </p></summary><body><div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1"><p>Greetings.
