      <p>S. From your letters, I understood that you received only two cheeses.</p>
      <p>I had added a third, square and oblong, and there were three in the box; I will easily understand who intercepted it. Such things do not deserve thanks; I wish I had the opportunity to gratify you in a greater matter. What you wrote about your son was most pleasing to me.</p>
      <p>Regarding peace, I dare not affirm anything yet, as the deputies are involved in this and the greatest difficulties present themselves. Whatever the Lord sees fit will be good and just.</p>
      <p>The Emperor finally proposed five articles according to the usual formula at other assemblies: first about religion, second about the contribution against the Turk, third about currency, fourth about the peace and tranquility of Germany, and lastly about the imperial chamber. The Elector of Trier is in Augsburg, the Elector of Cologne is expected shortly, as well as the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg; no mention is made of the others. The King of Poland is wasting away; the Elector of Brandenburg is paralyzed and in his seventies, the Duke of Brunswick suffers from quartan fever and the royal disease, so there is little hope for their lives. Greet Mr. Martyr, Mr. Gwalther, and friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, March 14.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
