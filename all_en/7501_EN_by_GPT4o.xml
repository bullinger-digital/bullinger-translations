      <p>Your letters, written to us through Mr. Thretius, our colleague, were very welcome to us for many reasons. For besides the fact that they abundantly declared your singular and truly fraternal goodwill towards us, which we have often observed, they also strongly confirmed many in the orthodox opinion. For when we understood that Mr. Josias Simler, a man renowned for every excellence, had promised his service to the church at the urging of many others in refuting the blasphemies of heretics attacking the foundation of the Christian religion, we indeed conceived great joy from this. For we are certainly convinced that he will handle this argument, as all others, with the greatest benefit to the whole church, especially our own, so that we do not doubt that, as not a few from the primary nobility also return to a better opinion by the grace of God, this work of yours undertaken for the church of God will be of great help to many for repentance. Therefore, we give the greatest thanks we can both to Mr. Simler and to you, most esteemed brother in Christ, for in all your many and great occupations, with which you are always engaged, you have such regard and care for us that you think no labor should be spared, provided that you may win as many as possible from even the most distant nations to Christ. Since we cannot at this time testify to our gratitude for such great services to us and our mutual goodwill towards you, combined with due respect, in any other way, we diligently pray to God that He may keep you safe for a long time for the glory of His name and the propagation of His church. Moreover, Mr. Thretius, our colleague, will report everything to you more fully about the state of the Polish churches and our assembly...</p>
