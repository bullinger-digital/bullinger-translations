      <p>Greetings. The cause is very serious, most learned Bullinger, which urges and compels us to write to you, and all the more so because we are certain that your efforts will not be lacking in such a holy matter. However, there is no need to recount this cause in lengthy letters, since our Beza has explained it to you in his letters as much as is necessary and has simultaneously reminded you of how we implore your help in it. Therefore, with these our letters, we wanted to testify to you that the common opinion of all of us has been presented to you by Beza, to whose requests we also wanted to add ours, so that you might understand with how much zeal we all care for this cause. You will therefore consider what you can do in it, and what you trust you can obtain from your magnificent senate. It is said that your pious consul, who has served as an envoy for the Sequani, holds much favor and authority among them. This hope has led us to promise ourselves some assistance from your side as well. You will learn the rest from Beza's letters.</p>
      <p>But see that the inscription does not deceive you. For when Beza wrote simultaneously to you and to my colleague Valerius, he mistakenly added your name to the inscription of the letters that were sent to Valerius in these words: To the distinguished servant of Jesus Christ and my most revered father, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Z端rich church in Z端rich.</p>
      <p>On the contrary, he inscribed Valerius's name on yours. But when he sent the open letters to us, we discovered the error, which you will easily excuse. Indeed, while I was also absent from Lausanne, this messenger was sent to me with the brothers' letters, in which I was asked to write this to you in the name of all of them. For I came here at the request of my people, because we hope that soon the envoys of both cities will come to cleanse this church of papal filth. Pray with us that the Lord may grant this. The brothers have given money to this messenger, so that if it is necessary to send a public message, he will provide what is needed. If you incur any expenses, the brothers will repay them, as they all unanimously commend this cause to you. Farewell, most excellently and for a long time. Orbe, December 29, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Peter Viret, in the name of the ministers and professors of Lausanne.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and most excellent servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Z端rich church, brother and most esteemed colleague. In Z端rich.</p>
