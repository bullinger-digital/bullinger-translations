      <p>I am very sorry, my lord, that I must write to you about other matters concerning the Queen of England, namely that she is still alive, although all the courtiers of the King of France, indeed the king himself, believed her to be dead.</p>
      <p>However, Lord Stafford, a noble Englishman, who had left here because of this death, has returned, as he found a courier on the way who indicated that all these things were false and that she had never been pregnant, but had only pretended. Thus, we were deluded for fifteen days (which I indeed lament).</p>
      <p>Regarding the riots that occurred here, I will write little to you (for I do not believe that you are unaware of them). Five who were called three times by the crier did not appear, but were nevertheless condemned to death. Five more are still detained in prison, aware of this matter, whom I do not hope will be spared. All of these conspired against the city officials and the French (whom they call foreigners); but the Lord thwarted them.</p>
      <p>Regarding the peace between the Emperor and the French, nothing is said except that on both sides they have gathered for this matter. May God preserve you, my most esteemed lord, and always guide your tongue and hand to the glory of His name and the confusion of His enemies! Farewell. From Geneva, June 5, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Séchelles.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and excellent man, Lord Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
