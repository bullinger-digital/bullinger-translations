      <p>S. D. I sent Mr. Philipp the Latin Bible; he will approve of it, I am sure, and will receive it with joy; for it is an elegant and clean book. Please greet him most kindly in my name.</p>
      <p>He returned from Frankfurt and had quite a successful time at the fair; he brought with him several German booklets, one by a certain Joachim of Magdeburg, who wrote "The Old and New Christ"; he claims that Luther and his followers preach the old Christ, while Berengar invented a new one and the Sacramentarians announce the new Christ. You could say the whole book is a cartload of insults.</p>
      <p>He also brought Philipp's defense against Staphylus and Anius of Cologne, only 3 pages. He brought another apology by Justus Menius, a minister from Leipzig, against Illyricus and Amsdorff. The Saxons are spitting at each other.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt that this is happening by God's just judgment; meanwhile, many are offended. It is rumored that the sons of the deceased Elector are supporting these brawlers and rabid quarrelsome dogs, while other evangelical princes are seriously demanding that these brawlers be removed. What will happen, we will hear another time.</p>
      <p>The Muscovites are said to have invaded Livonia and the neighboring areas, devastated many towns, killed many villagers, and taken even more captive. The Bishop of Ljubljana, when he wanted to leave the new Roman Emperor at Tonaverd, fell down the stairs and died. It is also said that Illyricus is now dead.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of WÃ¼rzburg in Franconia was shot dead in front of the city on the Main by the bridge, along with his chancellor and several others with him. It is a very terrible story.</p>
      <p>The English have prepared a powerful fleet at sea near Calais to wage war against the French, to prevent them from sending ships to aid the Scots, and the English are attacking the Scots with force, having taken on 4000 Germans and also dispatched them from Antwerp. The Scots wanted to besiege Warwick; but they have fallen out with their allies, the French, who are in Scotland against England, and have retreated. King Philip is also supposed to attack the French with force, so that he may help the Scots less. Others speak of peace.</p>
      <p>Share this with Mr. Friedrich von Salis, whom you should also greet.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all of ours, especially the councilors. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 29, 1558.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that my son has not come to Padua, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, my godfather and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
