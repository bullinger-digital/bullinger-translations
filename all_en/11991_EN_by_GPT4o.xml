    <p xml:id="regest1">Erasmus Fabricius [Schmid] and in his name also Bullinger recommend the young bearer, Schmid's son [Ulrich?], who will stay with a Geneva merchant, whose name Bullinger has forgotten. Bullinger has already written to Calvin twice regarding the French boy recommended by Calvin [No. 1914 and 1924], but since he did not respond, the letters probably did not arrive; with much effort, Bullinger was able to place the boy with the city clerk [Werner Beyel], although this costs 16 crowns annually, and [Beyel] wanted the money to be handed over by no one else but Bullinger, so Bullinger gave his word in trust of Calvin's letter and now asks Calvin for the payment of the money, for it is customary that half [of the agreed maintenance fee] is paid soon after the beginning [of the apprenticeship]; if the merchant finds a trustworthy messenger, he should send eight crowns along with the money that the boy [Christoph] Froschauer owes for the purchase of books worth nearly two guilders, and he should also give the boy some behavioral guidelines, for he is negligent, inconsiderate, and arrogant; Bullinger has already admonished him. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. The most learned Calvin, Erasmus Fabricius, a faithful and learned minister of our church, asks you, and in his name, I also ask you to have his son recommended to you. He will stay with a merchant in Geneva.</p>
      <p>The name of the merchant has slipped my mind, but you will be able to learn it from the boy. And although he has good hopes for him, he still wanted him to be recommended to you. You would do a favor to the father if you encouraged the boy's master to treat him with good faith. He will feel that the father is not ungrateful. Regarding the French boy whom you recommended to me in your letters in May, I have written once and again: since you have not responded, I suspect my letters have not reached you. With utmost faith and diligence, I have strived to have that boy received into the house of our city clerk. For there is no one who writes purer German than he.</p>
      <p>He has been received, but on the condition that I pay sixteen crowns for his maintenance for the year. For he wanted the money to be paid by me alone, and he said he would not accept other guarantors. I pledged my faith relying on your letters. Therefore, it remains for you to free me. He has also acquired books for himself which he needs for school.</p>
      <p>The price amounts to nearly two gold coins. Now it is customary among us to pay half of the maintenance fee soon after the beginning. Therefore, unless it is inconvenient for the merchant, I would wish for him to send 8 crowns, where he finds a faithful messenger who would bring them to me, along with the money owed for the books to Froschauer. Furthermore, you would do a most necessary thing if you wrote to the boy, to be more diligent and manageable.</p>
      <p>The city clerk, Werner Beyel, his master, complains that the boy is negligent, inconsiderate, and of a haughty spirit. I have admonished him as part of my duty and hope he has ears for advice. Farewell, my most learned Calvin, and love me. All the brothers greet you, Megander, Pellicanus, Bibliander, Gualtherus, Gesnerus, the father of this boy E. Fabricius, and the rest.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 20th of July, 1544.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. Johannes Calvin, his dearest brother in Geneva.</p>
