      <p>Christophorus, by the grace of God, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria, etc.</p>
      <p>Greetings in the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior. Your letters, Reverend Sir, in which you commend to me the young Johann Philipp, son of Ulrich Philipp, Baron of Hohensachsen, etc., and request that I receive him into my household, I have gladly received. This is partly because I have long desired an opportunity to do you a favor, and also because I am pleased to have this occasion to greet you. Indeed, I had certainly decided to visit you in person on my journey and to see your church and republic, but it was not possible due to the fear of the plague raging in the region and city of Zurich.</p>
      <p>As for the present matter, it is such that, as I am traveling for the sake of studies and am under the authority of the most illustrious Prince Elector Friedrich of the Palatinate, my parent, it would not be appropriate for me to undertake this without his consent and command, even if I greatly desire it. However, I hope to achieve with his Highness that the Senate of Zurich and you may understand through this small service that I at least wish well to your country and to you. In the meantime, I commend myself to your prayers and those of your church. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Geneva on the first day of January in the year 1567. To the Reverend Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, etc.</p>
      <p>Christoph, the young Count Palatine, on behalf of the young lord of Saxony.</p>
