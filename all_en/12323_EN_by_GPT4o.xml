    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's letter [not received] was very welcome to Hochholzer, especially as it shows Bullinger's efforts for the church in [Aarau]. The [Aarau] schoolmaster Christian [Hospinian] has been recalled [to Zurich] according to a decision by the Zurich council, which Hochholzer regrets, as he thereby loses a dear colleague. However, his pain is alleviated by the better prospects for his colleague. - Hochholzer thanks Bullinger on behalf of the [Aarau] people for his efforts. Bullinger should continue to be well-disposed towards them (especially as the number of [Zwinglian-oriented] believers decreases day by day); and since they cannot repay Bullinger's efforts, they commend him to the Lord. - What Bullinger wrote about the Bernese church servants is entirely true. The one [Ulrich Trog] whom they [recommended as a successor for Hospinian's schoolmaster position] is exactly as Bullinger suspected and as all are whom they want to promote. That person has not yet been received by [the Aarau people]. It is also uncertain what will happen. Hochholzer has made himself unpopular with many [Bernese] in this matter, as the Aarau people considered another candidate for a while [...] (who soon proved unsuitable due to inadequate language skills), even though they already knew that the Bernese would send them the aforementioned candidate. - Meanwhile, Hochholzer received Bullinger's letter with Bullinger's and [Theodor] Bibliander's recommendation for [Christoph] Piperinus. But since Bullinger himself admitted not knowing Piperinus personally, inquiries were made and it was found that he was still too young and suspected of lacking abstinence, which is why he was not accepted. Bullinger will surely not take this amiss. So no successor has been determined yet. Why the Aarau people do not turn to the [Zurich] people, Hochholzer does not know. They do not want to or dare not. Bullinger knows what danger comes from the Bernese. Hochholzer must meanwhile experience that the [responsible people in Aarau], who appear powerful, are in reality weak. Meanwhile, [the Bernese] are diligently trying to spread their pernicious doctrine in secret. They also hoped that Hochholzer would be recalled [to Zurich] and were already making plans to prevent any possible successor from [Zurich]. They hate everything that comes from Zurich. Hochholzer sees several dangers still coming his way. - Otherwise, everyone is well. Greetings from [Johannes] Zehnder and Gabriel [Meyer]. The outcome of the matter will show whether they remain strong. Greetings from Hochholzer's wife [Agathe, née Näf]. Bullinger should forgive the unintended length of the letter.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I received your letters, esteemed lord and father, which certainly could not have been more welcome at this time, not only because I had long been eagerly expecting your letters, which I did not dare to request from you, but also because you care for us and our church. Many have learned with much sorrow that Christian, our schoolmaster, has been recalled by the decree of your most honorable council. I am quite saddened to be deprived of the most pleasant companionship of a dear friend and godfather. However, since he is called to a better position, the pain is largely alleviated. He was diligent and faithful; I judge he will continue to be so.</p>
      <p>You further testify, according to your usual kindness, to your benevolence and singular dedication towards our church, which we easily recognize both in other matters and in this business. I affirm this about our people: they have recognized your usual benevolence and have received it with a very grateful heart. They have also instructed me, in the name of all of them, to thank your kindness for such great dedication towards us, and we ask you to continue to have us recommended to you, and not to disdain to assist us with help and advice (and I ask this all the more diligently, as I experience the number of true believers decreasing more and more every day). And since we have nothing to offer in return (for we confess that we owe everything to you), we will commend you and all yours to the best and greatest God with pious prayers, beseeching Him, who is the rewarder of all good, to repay you worthily for your great dedication towards His church and to preserve you long for us and all the faithful.</p>
      <p>What you wrote about the ministers of the Bernese is very true. The matter is exactly as you suspected. The one they worked for is exactly as you conjectured and as all are whom they want to promote. He has not yet been accepted by our people; it is uncertain, however, what will happen. I certainly know that I have incurred the hatred of many in this matter; for I do not cease to resist both publicly and privately in the office entrusted to me. When it was necessary to act quickly (for I had learned that another was about to be sent), we mentioned another; he, being found a novice in languages, was not to be accepted.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I received your letters, in which you recommend Piperinus to us. He cannot but be highly recommended, not only for his learning but also for your and Master Theodor's recommendation. But since you say he is unknown to you, some inquired about him from certain people, who say he is a learned and sincere man, but not very advanced in age, of a freer life, loving the celibate life, and suspected of incontinence. For these reasons, they do not want to accept him. Otherwise, they would very gladly grant this to you, and more freely (as it is in reality, I write nothing feigned), because I am persuaded that you will not take it badly. We have no certain candidate in the election. They either do not want to or do not dare to ask you. From the Bernese, there is the danger you know. Meanwhile, I experience how many are weak who seemed very strong (I do not write this to accuse anyone, but to indicate how many dangers are at our doors). The roaring lion is present, bearing with the greatest displeasure that this opportunity is being taken from him. I experience in reality that it is very true that everyone who trusts in man will be confounded. The Lord is our hope. They are diligent in sowing tares, attentive to every opportunity to spread that pestiferous doctrine, which spreads more widely every day and with greater danger and detriment, the more secretly they act. For they were already listening with such expectation to hear that I was being recalled, that they dreamed either that I was called by you or would be recalled; and therefore, lest another be chosen by our church, they had consulted among themselves and decided who would be appointed in my place. Some pursue with hatred whatever is from Zurich; yet, God willing, I will not yield from here unless called. I see that I will soon have to undergo struggles and dangers. I will bravely endure them with some faithful brothers. However, I will ask the Lord (lest I presume too much), who makes both willing and able, not to allow me to be tempted more severely than I can bear. I also trust in Him, who is faithful, that with the temptations He will make such an outcome that I can endure. To Him be honor and glory forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>In other matters, we are well; praise the Lord! Master Zehnder and Master Gabriel send their greetings, who, what they are like, the outcome of the matter will show. My wife sends you many greetings. We wish all your affairs to be safe. Farewell in the Lord and continue to have me recommended as before. I have been more lengthy than I intended; but you will forgive.</p>
      <p>In Aarau, on the first of November, in the year 1545.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness,</p>
      <p>Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, his most esteemed lord and father.</p>
