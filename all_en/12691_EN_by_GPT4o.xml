    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Blarer recommends the excellent young Johannes [von Ulm], the nephew of Blarer's brother-in-law [Heinrich von Ulm], who lives at Griesenberg Castle. Johannes is the son of Heinrich's [deceased] brother Hans Jakob von Ulm, who resided in Teufen with his wife [Barbara, née zum Tor], who is not the boy's mother. The promising boy attended the Konstanz [Latin] school for about two years under [Matthias Schenk]. Now his uncles want to send him, along with the equally recommendable Augustin [...], in [whose household] he has lived for several years, to study in Zurich. Bullinger should take care of both of them! [Barbara, née von Ulm], the wife of [Jakob] Röist, is Johannes’ [half]sister and loves him for his intelligence and character. She will arrange accommodation for the two. Bullinger should assist her with his advice. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Greetings to Bullinger's family as well as to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], and Gwalther. Also, [Konrad] Z[wick] and [Thomas] Blarer, who is grateful for Bullinger's friendly generosity, send their regards. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] [P.S.:] Blarer should warmly recommend the two boys also on behalf of Zwick and [Thomas] Blarer. But enough now, he knows he can rely on Bullinger! </p>

    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] In the ongoing [Schmalkaldic] War, one must trust in God. If [the Schmalkaldic League] had not had so many [different] military leaders, they could have achieved something long ago, for example, if they had pursued [the enemy] on the first day of the bombardment of Ingolstadt, which the Landgrave would have liked and for which he also rode to the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] and the other war councils. But God seems to want to resolve the matter at another time. So far, the [Schmalkaldic League] has suffered minor losses in all skirmishes, while the enemy has suffered significant ones. All enemy incursions have also been halted. The day before, several enemies were killed. There is hope for divine protection. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Besides what [Thomas] Blarer has already told Bullinger and what [the Konstanz council has already reported to the Zurich council] about the skirmish at Langenau, Blarer knows nothing new. The situation must change because [due to the onset of winter] they can no longer remain in the field. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> [7] Some suspect that the Emperor [will withdraw over the pass at] Ehrenberg [to Italy]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest8"> [8] Blarer is waiting for Bullinger's report on the day [of the Four Protestant Places]. </p>

      <p>I commend to you this excellent young man, Johannes, the nephew of my brother-in-law at Griesenberg, from my brother Hans Jakob von Ulm, who resided in Teufen, although he was not born from his wife. He is so pious and wonderfully diligent in his studies that he has given us great hope for a future of good fruit. He stayed here in our school under the master for a full two years or a little more, if I am not mistaken. Now his uncles have decided to send him to Zurich with another equally pious and studious young man, Augustin, with whom he has lived for several years, so that they may devote themselves to good and sacred letters, as well as the study of languages. I hope they will do this as successfully as I do not doubt they will diligently! If you can help them in their endeavors (and you can do a lot), I earnestly ask you to do so kindly, also for my sake. The young man's sister is Röist's wife, although she is from a legitimate marriage. She loves him very much for his good nature and purity of character. She will now see where they can conveniently live and reside there, using your advice in this matter, which I know you will give willingly.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Greet your household with Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, and the others. Our people send their regards to you, especially Zwick with my brother, who praises the kindness and generosity of all of you wonderfully. Farewell, my venerable Bullinger. From Konstanz, October 26.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>My brother and Zwick have also asked me to commend these young men to you in their words! They love them greatly for their unique piety and dedication to letters. But I know well enough that you need no spurs in this matter, as you, being the best, are accustomed to helping all good people in whatever ways you can. Yours, A. Bl.</p>

      <p>From a letter of the Landgrave recently to a good man:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>"Regarding the current war situation, you may believe us that we place our trust solely in God, whose cause it is, and we have unwavering confidence that He will direct it to the honor and glory of His name. If there had not been so many leaders on our side so far, we would certainly have achieved something long ago. For example, if we had pursued the enemy on the first day we bombarded Ingolstadt, as we would have liked and for which we rode to our dear cousin and brother, the Elector, and the war councils, we would undoubtedly have accomplished something significant. But God perhaps did not want it at that time, but intends to arrange and bring it about at another time, according to His gracious will. So far, in all skirmishes, we have suffered the least and the enemy the greatest damage. All incursions the enemy has undertaken have been halted. Yesterday, thank God, we also killed some good men of theirs, and we hope in God that He will keep His hand over us," etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We have no other news that I know of, except what you have said about my dear brother, and what has also been written to yours from Langenau, that some of ours were killed there, and then skirmished with others. The situation must now change every day. It will no longer be possible to remain in the field.</p>

      <p>Some think that the Emperor will take the retreat through the pass, as he cannot otherwise get out.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I am waiting to hear from you at any moment about what was dealt with on the day.</p>
      <p>To the exceptionally pious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, incomparable friend and brother.</p>
