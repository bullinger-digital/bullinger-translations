      <p>Greetings. I was reminded late about the departure of the courier. The time for writing was indeed inconvenient for me, especially after dinner when I am not as well as I would wish. This is almost customary for me.</p>
      <p>But today something else was added. The letter you had informed me about had already been composed by me. However, I had delayed writing to you privately until a faithful messenger was available to deliver it.</p>
      <p>Now, I did not want to pass up the opportunity presented, even though it was not entirely as I wished. You will again see whether the Bernese will be pleased with this new preface edition. For I have no doubt about you and your colleagues. I seem to have followed your outlines, only adding my own colors. Moreover, you remember what I recently wrote to you about the two chapters. I am convinced that there will be no one there who does not wish for the additions. It is of great importance that others do not think we have cunningly omitted something, or rightly desire what must absolutely be expressed. The third correction in one or two words will have no more difficulty. I know that the whole matter is so entrusted to you and the other brothers that I fully acquiesce in your judgment. Therefore, I will consider whatever you decide to be the best. I also think it is not unclear to you what I am seeking.</p>
      <p>From here, I hardly dare to announce anything new. So many vain things are spread daily. This much is certain, we are not far from various dangers unless the Lord intervenes. It is well that Christians can live securely because they can die securely. The Frenchman is so insane that you would say he wants to fight with God like a giant. Meanwhile, the constancy of the martyrs is remarkable. Something that had never happened to the king before, someone voluntarily destined himself for sacrifice, so that at least he could freely speak three words for Christ before him, as he hurried to witness the fires.</p>
      <p>I am not writing to Lelio, and perhaps he has not yet returned to you. If he were there, I would wish he would meet with the bookseller about the money for which I am a guarantor, as I previously instructed. He complains that the indication is unjust, but our man denies it. I am caught in the middle. But because I have pledged my faith for the payment, I am called upon.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most honorable and distinguished brother in the Lord, together with all the fellow ministers, whom you will greet diligently in the name of all of us. May the Lord preserve you, be with you perpetually, and use you for the glory of His name. Amen.</p>
      <p>Geneva, August 13, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the excellent minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, dearest and most esteemed brother and fellow minister.</p>
