      <p>Greetings. Together with your most delightful letter, most illustrious man, I received many days ago the book which you have now published, and I give great thanks for it, and I will give even greater thanks later, as I have no doubt, when I have read it, which I have not yet been able to do.</p>
      <p>For such is the diligence of our bookbinders that, although I handed it over to them immediately upon receiving it, I have not yet been able to retrieve it from them. From England, I receive nothing else but that everything is falling into worse condition. Johanna (Jane), once queen, while being executed, died most bravely and religiously, which also happened to her parent and husband. Thanks be to God that they remained in the confession of true faith. It is indeed most sad and strange to say how many in that kingdom, whom you would have judged most steadfast, we see today wavering, indeed faltering. May God have mercy on His people and at least preserve the remnants of that church! The Archbishop of Canterbury, along with the former Bishop of London and Latimer, have been taken to Oxford, where a parliament (as they call it) will now be held; for it has been proclaimed there, unless they change their counsel. As almost everyone conjectures, by the decree of those assemblies, the pope will be restored, and these holy men will be killed. May God grant them faith, constancy, and courage in Christ! I do not doubt that He will do this, as He has continually strengthened them in the gravest temptations thus far. Meanwhile, as you do, help them with the prayers of the holy church; for those who do not feel themselves pierced by the swords of the impious in their brothers are not to be considered as members of the body of Christ. I could scarcely write this due to grief, and I can scarcely proceed further. May God bless you, your fellow ministers, and your holy church. Strasbourg, April 3, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Bullinger, most faithful minister of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
