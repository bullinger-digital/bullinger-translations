    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller, [Huldrych Zwingli the Younger and Hans Wilpert Zoller] arrived safely in Augsburg, after being honorably received by the council and scholars in Konstanz. [Ambrosius] Blarer had provided Haller with letters of recommendation to [Jakob] Herbrot and [Wolfgang] Musculus. In Ravensburg, the travelers found a rebellious citizenry. The [Ravensburg] preacher [Konrad Konstanzer] preached fervently and learnedly; however, in Memmingen, where they arrived the following day, Haller heard that this preacher was a drunkard and lecherous. In Memmingen, they were well received, especially by Gervasius [Schuler], who was very pleased with Bullinger's letter [not received] but pretended not to know about Haller's appointment. Generally, Haller had the impression that Schuler was not very fond of the people of Zurich, but rather was close to Bucer. - Finally, they arrived in Augsburg to the great joy of Frölich, but probably less so to the scholars. Musculus received Bullinger's letter [not received] in silence and muttered something. Then he said that Haller had been appointed only at the request of [Frölich] and the mayors [Herbrot and Hans Welser], without his and others' knowledge. This made Haller very concerned. Haller therefore asked Frölich for advice, who was very annoyed and advised him not to be impressed by Musculus. They had not told Musculus about the appointment so that he would not try to prevent it. - [Musculus] complained that first pastors from Wittenberg, then from Zurich, thus from two [theologically] opposing churches, were appointed, endangering peace. He ordered Haller not to preach about the [Eucharist] before his induction into the Augsburg doctrine. Haller will send Bullinger the [church order] for his opinion. He replied that he did not care about formulas, but only about the truth; Musculus remained silent. Haller believes that he is not [welcome] to Musculus. Bullinger should inform him how he should behave. Musculus is a true imitator of Bucer and does not express his personal opinion. - The other pastors (there are many, but only a few learned) do not want to offend Luther, and like Balaam, they express themselves against their conviction. Haller has a good impression of the citizens; Mayor Welser seems to be well-disposed towards [the three people from Zurich] and received them splendidly. Sixt Birck, who is hated by many because of his veneration of Zwingli, made an especially good impression. Bernardino Ochino, a learned Italian preacher, whom Bullinger may have met in Zurich, preaches among others to the Fuggers in Italian. He came from Strasbourg after leaving Geneva due to the poison scandal. [Michael] Keller preaches in Kaufbeuren and will return [to Augsburg] within a month. - Haller was promised much by the council; we will see what comes of it. In the meantime, he is staying with Frölich. He cannot report more because he will only preach on November 22. Everything else will be told by Zwingli [the Younger]. - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. We arrived in Augsburg with a successful journey. First, we were honorably received in Konstanz by the scholars and the council, even with honorary wine. Mr. Blarer recommended us to some citizens of Augsburg, including the consul Herbrot, and among the scholars, Musculus. Later, when we arrived in Ravensburg, we found everything in turmoil: rebellious citizens and a place open to all blasphemies.</p>
      <p>There, a certain Conrad, who was previously there, preaches diligently and studiously for Christ, if only his life matched his doctrine; for I heard in Memmingen that he is a drunkard and completely indulgent. The next day we arrived in Memmingen, where we were treated no less honorably than in Konstanz, both by the scholars and the council. Mr. Gervasius was entirely kind to us, so delighted with your letters that he was always with us and even accompanied us for a while. However, he strangely concealed my appointment, as if he were unaware and as if you had written nothing to him about it. I think he does not particularly like it, nor does he love the people of Zurich as he pretends. I asked him about the state of his church. He said he does not care about our quarrels; everything is calm and peaceful.</p>
      <p>However, I fear that under this peace some Bucerism may be lurking. Then we came to Augsburg with great joy for Frölich, yet below the expectation of the scholars. Musculus, reading your letters, fell silent and muttered something to himself. He seems to be the only one who will oppose me. For he openly told me that I was called without his knowledge and even without the knowledge of other consulars, only at the urging and efforts of the archigrammateus and this year's consuls (yet I was already received by the entire council when I arrived); this matter caused me great concern, so much so that I doubted the legitimacy of my calling. Therefore, I approached Mr. Frölich and sought his advice. He was very indignant with Musculus and said that I should not care about this man's tricks; for this reason, I was called from Zurich without his knowledge, so that if he had known, he could have prevented it.</p>
      <p>First, a minister was sought from Wittenberg, now from Zurich, two very different and extreme churches, and thus their peace is disturbed.</p>
      <p>He also ordered me not to preach about the sacrament until I become accustomed to the ways and formulas of speech they use (which I will send to you now or shortly, so you can advise on this matter). I firmly said that I would not do this, that I do not care about any formulas of speech, but will preach the truth simply and purely, especially about the sacraments, whenever the opportunity is given; yet I did not come to disturb the church, but to gather in the truth of faith. To which he said nothing. He is silent. In summary, I believe I do not please him. He has shown little benevolence and favor towards me so far. Therefore, my dear Bullinger, I ask you to inform me how I should conduct myself with this man. He is the very image of Bucer and almost a monkey of Bucer. He praises him alone, always has him on his lips. He does not dare to pour out what he thinks before the people.</p>
      <p>The other ministers (of whom there are many, but few learned) would think well if only peace were made with Luther, whom they do not want to offend. Yet they speak the curses of Balaam, teaching what they themselves do not want. The citizens seem to me much more sincere than the scholars. Consul Welser received us magnificently, a humane man, and I do not doubt he favors us. Sixtus Birck seems the most humane of all, hated by many because of Zwingli's name. There is also another man in Augsburg, Bernardino Ochino by name, an Italian, whom I think you have seen in Zurich at some time, a pious and learned man, who fled from Geneva's poison to Strasbourg, and from there to Augsburg. He preaches in the Italian language. The Fuggers and other merchants, who love the Latin (Italian) language for Christ, listen to him. Mr. Cellarius preached among the Kaufbeureners. However, he will return within a month.</p>
      <p>The council promises me much. However, it is noble to promise, but rustic to fulfill. They have decreed that I should have lodging at the archigrammateus's place, who voluntarily offered himself to provide this service to me.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more about my affairs now, because I have not yet preached. On the 22nd of this month, I will preach for the first time. If there is anything else, Zwingli will inform you.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell. Augsburg, November 20, 1545. Your most devoted</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his uniquely esteemed lord and father.</p>
