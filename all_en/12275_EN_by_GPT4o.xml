      <p>Greetings in the Lord. A messenger from Wittenberg was with us these days, bringing a book from Rivius to Oporin, whom I diligently questioned about all the matters happening in Wittenberg. I could not gather anything from him about a response from Luther against your booklet, and I believe Luther has not written anything nor intends to write. But he said this: The booklet of the Zurichers is prohibited throughout our territory. The penalty is the loss of all goods. Many wish to read it, but it is not available. Duke Maurice has done the same in his territory. The Lutherans fear the splendor of the truth. They dread something unknown. He further said that Luther shook the dust from his shoes and left the church of Wittenberg because they do not wish to do penance. Vices indeed flood among them, and there is some contention between Luther and Mr. Hieronymus Schürpf, who is entirely papist and still celebrates the saints' feasts in his house with his whole family. Pomeranus followed, and many others follow Luther, not to adhere to him, but to persuade him to return and not to despair of them entirely. He is staying with the Bishop of Merseburg. With this example, he wants to show himself to be a true apostle of Christ and tries to follow his footsteps.</p>
      <p>Myconius has been restored to his former health again. At the Diet of Worms, the Nurembergers and the Augsburgers had a very bitter dispute over trade before the emperor, and they almost exhausted the emperor with their dissensions; thus, he also learned the deceptions of merchants. Almost nothing has been done about composing a concord among the ecclesiastics. May the Lord have mercy on us! We seek the corruptible and meanwhile lose the eternal! They say in Nuremberg the German Mass has been completely abolished; which I can hardly believe, although a certain merchant among us has constantly affirmed it.</p>
      <p>However, I highly praise that your council has hosted a banquet for the citizens; thus, spirits unite and are made more eager to undertake anything. Megander's death will be pleasing to the followers of Sulzer, although it is most sorrowful for you.</p>
      <p>I did not see the student who brought the letters. For at that time, I was in our countryside with my brother, who was suffering from a long illness, and upon returning, this man never appeared, whom, if I had been at home, I would have recommended to the learned, with whom I am familiar.</p>
      <p>Moreover, if I cannot surpass your generous spirit towards Gast, I will nevertheless strive, as much as I can, not to be found ungrateful for the benefits received. However, it is strange that the third volume was presented incomplete to the students. I cannot pass over this: Some accuse the ministers of the Zurich church of being constantly entertained by the French envoy.</p>
      <p>I will say what the matter is: None of the ministers has ever spoken to him; I remain silent about being entertained at a banquet. Lepusculus intruded once; I do not know whether poverty was the cause or something else. I have nothing to do with those people, even though, when he was a refugee among us, he was often a guest of his. I know well the customs of our citizens, who would wish for nothing else and would implore the gods for our conversation with the French, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, long safe with the best men Theodor, Pellican, Fries, and Gwalther.</p>
      <p>Basel, 27. 1545. Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
