      <p>[...] and with considerable effort and work, he has managed to secure a livelihood and yet has no inheritance, he has for a long time been willing and still is, to use his livelihood for pious purposes, such as the maintenance of godly church services and schools. And in this, out of many Christian considerations and reasons, he has always had his special thoughts and inclinations towards your church in Zurich, as you will undoubtedly have understood from him himself. I have never wanted to advise him against such his pious intention and godly goodwill, but have always approved of it. As far as the burden is concerned, which he intends to impose on me, I would not be unwilling to comply with him in this; but I know what belongs to such matters, and also, what my frequent and various businesses are, which I cannot put aside, and what obstacles, difficulties, and hindrances may arise and occur in this case for an executor. Therefore, I find myself not a little burdened to take this burden (cui ferendo impar esse possem) upon myself; for I am concerned that such obstacles might arise for me, that it would not be possible for me to execute his will, that if something of the kind should occur and a lack of execution should appear, one would want to attribute it to me and recover it from me or my heirs overnight. That would be very and extremely burdensome for me. However, since the aforementioned Doctor Waydner mentioned in his above-mentioned letter that he has arranged matters in such a way that the greater part is ready for execution and the rest will not be particularly troublesome, I have, therefore, written to him, the doctor, these days about this matter without hesitation, and requested him to send me a copy of his will, so that I can examine it, and then, after finding the matters, respond to him with a proper answer and not refuse him what is possible for me to do. Since this matter also concerns you and your church in Zurich, I did not want to withhold this friendly opinion from you; for if I could serve and be beneficial to you and your church in the Lord, I am still ready and willing to do so to the best of my ability and hereby commend and entrust myself to you in the Lord. Mr. Nikolaus Brem sends you his greetings and service through me. Dated Frankfurt, March 24, 1553.</p>
