      <p>Greetings. I received your letter; however, Marius, about whom you wrote, has not appeared anywhere, perhaps he will come another time. Just so you know, we are in good health by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>From France, we have no news, except that everything is stable and that the Reichstag has been postponed from May to August. For certain reasons, the coronation of the king is delayed; it will take place at the appointed time. There is an effort to ensure that all those who are committed to the Pope do not have a seat in the king's council, and that a national council is held. - The Emperor is supposed to call for a Reichstag to discuss the Council of Trent; because the Germans do not want a papal council. This displeases the papal Emperor, who would very much like to have the crown from the Holy Father and is negotiating through the new Emperor's cardinal. The misfortune has deceived us with fools, etc.</p>
      <p>However, some lords are falling away from him to the Weiden, and there is concern that there will be war from Hungary. It is certain that a strong fleet is equipped by the Turks on the Sicilian Sea, etc. Perhaps those who always want war will have enough of it.</p>
      <p>God have mercy. - A count in Burgundy, who calls himself Ortenberg, has cunningly taken Elikurt, belonging to Montbéliard. Therefore, Württemberg is preparing for war.</p>
      <p>The authorities of the County of Burgundy forbid taking the count's side. - It is said repeatedly that many in five places are at war against Glarus.</p>
      <p>May the Lord either convert or overthrow those who desire war and grant peace and security, etc. The letters from Frankfurt have not yet arrived, etc.</p>
      <p>The Lord be with you and with the brothers.</p>
      <p>May Gallicius be safe, etc. April 11, 1561.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the Church of Chur, esteemed and dear lord and brother. To Chur, to Mr. Hans Schmid, pastor at St. Martin.</p>
