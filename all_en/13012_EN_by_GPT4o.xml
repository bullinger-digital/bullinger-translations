    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received], which he answered with a letter [No. 2955], to which he enclosed five Batzen and entrusted it to the young Ambrosius [...]. Has Bullinger received the letter and the money?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In the matter of Hans Schöner, little can probably be achieved due to the current turmoil. Blarer has not yet sent his and [Bullinger's] letters to Augsburg, but will do so as soon as he is sure that Hans Welser has returned from his spa treatment in Pfäfers. God willing, Schöner's matter will have a happy ending.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Maximilian [Seemann] is once again recommended to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Bishop of Konstanz, Johann von Weeze, should rather keep all his fame to himself! Several Swiss Confederates and people of Konstanz revere this monster more than Christ himself!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The favors of the people of Zurich towards the people of Konstanz were almost too much of a good thing. Yet the latter have nothing to complain about! May God reward the people of Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The council of Konstanz has approved Bullinger's opinion [No. 2941] in the marriage matter of [Jakob Kundigmann] and granted him the divorce.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Enclosed, Blarer sends back the letter of Emperor Charles V [from June 27] and the response of the Swiss Confederates to it [from July 9]. It would indeed be astonishing if God were to subject everything to the Emperor! The Swiss Confederates rightly distrust the imperial flattery.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The day before yesterday, six houses fell victim to a raging fire. Affected is also the house of Thomas Buchmann, the brother of the mutual friend Theodor Bibliander. Blarer's house was spared. He writes this also to his wife [Katharina, née Ryff], so that the rumors do not frighten her. Bullinger should forward [her] the enclosed letter to Baden.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings, also from Thomas Blarer and Konrad Zwick. Request for prayer.</p>

      <p>I received your letters, to which I responded again through the young Ambrosius, who, if I am not mistaken, delivered the 5 Batzen (coins) enclosed in our letter. Please write as soon as possible whether you have received those letters along with the coins.</p>

      <p>In the matter of Schöner, I truly doubt what we can achieve amidst these disturbances. I have not yet sent our letters to Augsburg, partly due to other inconveniences, but mainly because Welser is still at the spa, which is called Pfäfers. However, I will send them as soon as I learn that Welser is in Augsburg. If the Lord favors our Schöner, all other issues will not matter.</p>

      <p>I am grateful for Maximilian and once again commend the boy to you.</p>

      <p>Our bishop, with all his boasts, can keep them to himself. There is no shortage of people, both from your side and ours, who worship this beast more than Christ!</p>

      <p>The kindness of your people towards ours was truly excessive! Yet, they have nothing to complain about. May the Lord graciously repay everything.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Your judgment in the matrimonial case was approved by our council, from which the husband also obtained a divorce.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I am returning the Emperor's letters along with your letter and I am grateful. I would be greatly surprised if the Lord were to place everything in the hands of the Emperor. The writings are flattering, but it is not without reason that you are wary of the tracks, etc.</p>

      <p>The day before yesterday, a voracious flame consumed six houses, and among them, almost entirely, the house of our distinguished friend Theodor's brother. I am writing here to my wife, so she is not tormented by false rumors, but knows that all our belongings, thank God, are safe. I ask you to send these letters to Baden as soon as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell, my dearest and best brother, and love us eternally in Christ Jesus. May your household, along with all brothers and friends, be well. Our people, my brother and Konrad Zwick, greet you. Farewell again and again. From Konstanz, July 23. Commend us to the Lord. Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>To his Heinrich Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
