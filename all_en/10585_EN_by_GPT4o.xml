    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's commentary on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians and reports on his preaching activities. Hopes to meet Bullinger in Zofingen. Complains about difficulties in letter delivery. Bullinger should show the letter [Megander's] to Leo [Jud]. The messenger is reliable. Asks Bullinger again to come to Zofingen.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You overwhelm me with perpetual and countless gifts, benefits, consolation, education, and other gifts bestowed upon you, dearest Heinrich, by the Lord, so that I can never sufficiently reflect on them, let alone give thanks or repay them. I will ensure that I review the Second Epistle to the Corinthians as soon as possible, as it has always seemed to me the most difficult due to the variety of topics. I wanted to discuss the first one in a sermon, but Megander anticipated me. However, since I have taken Mark in hand, I will discuss the one to the Hebrews weekly. You have certainly made it familiar to me, which I once shunned due to its difficulty. Oh, in my younger days, how poorly, indeed not at all, did I approach it! Even if I wanted to, I can no longer due to age and business. Nevertheless, I remain in the cart. Who will finally free me from this burden, for which my shoulders are so unequal?</p>
      <p>But about these things, if the Lord would grant me even this one happiness according to my wish, that I could chat with you in person. But you will understand from the common letters what we have decided about the meeting. In short: If you do not come to Zofingen, I will stay at home. Megander will handle everything more successfully than I. For I would not move a foot because of the confession of the Eucharist. But if you decide to come and inform me of this by messenger, and if I should allow myself to be led there on horseback, which I certainly might need, I would not stay away. For if I do not meet you now, all hope of seeing you is taken away, even if I often imagine many Bullingers present with me. But what should I write?</p>
      <p>I hear that you entrusted letters written to me to M. Johann Zähender from Aarau. He did not send a single line; he entrusted them to the secretary of the small town, as he had daily news at hand, but as I hear, he gave them to a certain rustic, a host in Töringen. I have received nothing. Meanwhile, my people urge me to find out what I had written to you in secret. I think the devil is in it. Dear friend, do not give up a letter unless you know for sure whom you have trusted. I much prefer that messengers bring me letters, only that they are not handed over to any pastor. Meanwhile, write again, if it has not slipped your memory, what they wanted.</p>
      <p>As for the previously intercepted ones, urge Leo to believe they should be read, which he has received in the meantime, although I believe they have long been read by you. I have heard a copy of them, but certainly, if the spirit is as the words sound, I rejoice that the man's modesty is so great.</p>
      <p>You truly have here a messenger, a merchant of the city, a most faithful man, to whom you can safely entrust what you wish. The other, a messenger from a certain Diesbach, is otherwise unknown to me.</p>
      <p>In short: I would prefer if you came, and not on the chapter day, but if you came to Zofingen, then otherwise I would not visit any chapter in Aargau. If only God would grant me so much and long health, that I might speak with you, I would be relieved of many things by you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Forgive the foolishness of one writing so foolishly.</p>
      <p>The eighth of March in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his brother to be always respected.</p>
