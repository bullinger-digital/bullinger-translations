      <p>S. D. The Bishop of Rennes writes to me that the response of the electors of the empire is awaited regarding the matter of the council and the imperial diet, upon which the resolution of the emperor depends. He himself was the arbiter of initiation or the mystical parent of the newly born son of the King of Bohemia. In France, there were provincial assemblies; in some, they decided that the governance and administration of the kingdom should be owed to the King of Navarre, or if he refuses, to the Prince of Condé: no ecclesiastics, or those bound to the pope, should be part of the king's council; I remain silent on what is against the Guises.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Condé was absolved by the king, his council, and the Parisian parliament. I do not approve of what has been tumultuously done in some cities of France without the authority of the magistrate in removing images. Next week, on the upcoming Monday, the 7th of this month, the delegates of the Five Cantons will meet in Lucerne to deliberate on the matter of the people of Glarus [EA IV/2, 170.]. My wife and family send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love us.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, April 1st.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the word of God in Zürich.</p>
