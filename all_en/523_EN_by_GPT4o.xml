      <p>Greetings. How delightful was that recent gathering of learned brothers for me, who greeted me in ZÃ¼rich, that I eagerly await your council's decision regarding my purchase. Therefore, I could not refrain from reminding you, through whom your councilors wanted to inform me, so that, as far as it can be done, I may timely learn of the council's will. For this also adds to my business desire; after I returned to Thurgau, I found letters in which Baron von Bolwiler, the royal prefect, wants me to appear in the city on the 18th of the month through a deputy attorney, who will receive the king's judgment on the confiscation of my goods. Therefore, it would be advisable for my plan if I had a certain place to reside before this day, which I could use as a pretext (if there are any) against the adverse opinions of my judgment. However, most holy Bullinger, I do not wish to trouble you with anything too importunate, only that you ensure I receive a response quickly, either by offering or by sending a certain hired messenger. I should not have involved you in this kind of duty, whom I know to be occupied with the most sacred province of teaching and writing, but even foreign concerns and often lighter ones are usually accepted for the sake of friends, and here the rashness of friends asking foolishly prevails. Such is also what I now ask, that you do not disdain to console...</p>
