    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer and his brother [Thomas] thank Bullinger for the [„Brevis ἀντιβολή“ against Cochläus], which they have not yet read in detail. Many hope that the response to Luther's [„Kurtz bekentnis“] will not reopen the old wound; the instigators of this writing will have to justify themselves before God; may the modesty [of the Zurichers] benefit the churches; perhaps one should plan for both a short and a longer version of the response. The dispute among the Bernese church servants pains Blarer; may the Lord calm the minds, so that [the church] does not become the mockery of the enemies of Christ. Sends a copy of Luther's [„Kurtz bekentnis“], as the [Augsburg] mayor [Hans] Welser intended one of the two copies sent to Blarer for Bullinger with the wish that the sender remains secret and the [Zurich] refutation thrives in a Christian and friendly manner. The overworked Blarer unfortunately could hardly attend to Bullinger's young messenger. Request for Bullinger's prayers and greetings. The friendly mention of Musculus in Bullinger's [„Brevis ἀντιβολή“], discovered by chance, has pleased Blarer.</p>

      <p>We, my brother and I, thank you very much for the examples of your response; we have not yet had the time to read it, but the taste of it is already pleasing in a wonderful way.</p>
      <p>Many are excessively concerned about the response to Luther, fearing that the old and poorly healed wound might reopen untimely; but let the authors of these troubles see how they justify their bloody plans to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I hope your modesty will greatly benefit the churches. What if the response is doubled: One shorter version, which satisfies the simple - but meanwhile fastidious reader and is also marketable -; and another longer one?</p>
      <p>But you know better about everything. It pains my heart to see the ministers of Bern in such conflict; may the Lord, by His command, soon calm and successfully resolve everything, so that we do not become a mockery to the enemies of Christ due to these internal seditions. I am sending you a copy of Luther's confession; our consul Welser sent two, and he instructed me to send one to you and to convey his many greetings in his name; however, he wishes for important reasons that no one finds out that he sent you the booklet. He writes at the end: "A fine, Christian, friendly response should not be done badly by many learned and unlearned." I am so tossed about by business at this time that I could hardly offer any service or benefit to the good young man, barely even greet him. Therefore, I implore you by Christ not to attribute this to neglect, much less to contempt towards your messengers; I will make amends abundantly when the first opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>Always commend me to the faithful Creator through Christ the Son in a Christian manner. Greet your entire household with the ministering brothers. All of ours send their greetings to you, especially my brother.</p>
      <p>I am very pleased with the friendly mention of our Musculus in your response, which I happened to read by chance. I will soon read everything in order and diligently.</p>
      <p>May Christ preserve you, my venerable and very dear brother. It stands and remains standing in the old right forever and eternally.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Bl.</p>
