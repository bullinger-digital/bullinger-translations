      <p>Grace and peace of Christ be with you. Pious, faithful, dear Master Heinrich.</p>
      <p>I want to inform you about our new bailiff in Knonau, that we can only understand that he is willing and rightly determined to uphold his duties. He has offered himself to us in a friendly and willing manner and has especially spoken and promised to us, namely with those from Rifferswil, Mettmenstetten, Knonau, and with me, that he will ensure that my lords' mandates are upheld, that vices are punished, and that he will support us bravely and faithfully. His offer, life, and conduct so far have truly not been bad. We expect all good things from him and hope that you will also hear nothing but loyalty and bravery from him. Therefore, it would be our desire and friendly request to you, that you might, if you have the time and it pleases you, write a friendly letter and encouragement to him, so that the man may continue to act as faithfully as he has shown himself to us and otherwise. And we, as much as we are able, will also continue to teach and live here in office faithfully according to your command. Assuring you of all loyalty and bravery towards us. With this, may God with His grace be with you at all times.</p>
      <p>Given on the 10th day of April in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>He has also spoken especially with the prior of Kappel. Likewise, he deals faithfully with the pious Heinrich in Affoltern, etc.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Pfiffer, servant of the kitchen in Maschwanden, your willing one.</p>
