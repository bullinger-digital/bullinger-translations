      <p>S. Although I have not received any letters from you in this difficult time, most reverend lord, it is still my duty to write to you about how our people are conducting themselves. Recently, I wrote that our envoy, contrary to all order and custom, has summoned his mercenaries here under the authority he falsely claims for himself.</p>
      <p>Many gathered; but he could achieve nothing from them (as I hear). Three were unanimously elected to sharply rebuke the envoy for his audacity, which Mr. Consul Willius did most diligently, sparing nothing of his foolishness. He excused himself, saying he did not act with ill intent; he only wanted to test whether he should hope for a new outbreak. He humbly asked for forgiveness, promising to act according to custom in the future. The custom is that first, if he wants or seeks anything, he should address the magistrate of this city, and through him, everything should be disseminated with the involvement of the bishop. Now he boasts that more has been promised to him and even asked Mr. Carolus not to neglect anything; for if he seeks command, he will be appointed over the army. He also moves every stone through his friends to ensure that soldiers are not denied to him by the people; he claims that Condé has become a treaty-breaker, etc. - Meanwhile, the letters of the envoy of Condé have remained hidden until now.</p>
      <p>However, when we urged that the communities should not be deprived any longer, so that the true reasons may become known, it was answered that this is done with good counsel; for a decree from the Swiss is awaited. We did not want to remain in the dark any longer. I requested letters and prepared several copies by my own hand, which I will send to various places before our envoy seeks and requests, and to add more authority, I also obtained from Mr. Consul that he writes a few words and seals them with the city's seal, so it is clear that it is not our fantasy, etc. If the envoy then requests anything, it will be permissible to bring Condé's request back to the senate for reconsideration. - Our people have decreed the penalty of death and loss of all fortunes if anyone departs; the same has been done in many other evangelical places. It is said that the Upper League is turning a blind eye; for Captain Sebastian is already leading the conscripts and transferring them to the neighboring Uri. Whether this is true, I cannot easily say; however, I think it is sufficiently established that they are worse than the others.</p>
      <p>Count Hannibal obtained from our people the annulment of the proceedings against Ascanio, while two other proceedings continued the opposite; this is a great joy for the count.</p>
      <p>Farewell. October 5, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
