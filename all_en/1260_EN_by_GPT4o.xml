      <p>Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father through Christ, our common Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letters, most distinguished man, were very welcome to me for many reasons, especially because I received them from you, a man whom I honor, love, and respect for the singular grace of God, which shines forth in you to the admiration of all, and for your tireless zeal in promoting piety and restoring the ruins of the Church of Christ. They would have been much more welcome if the misfortune of such a great man had not moved you to write to me, but they were timely, as they alleviated my great sorrow with present comfort; for what you recount could uniquely soothe and moderate this grief. For only the certainty of faith, the knowledge of salvation, and that firm hope of the promised blessedness in Christ enable us to rejoice at last for the man who rests sweetly in the Lord, as soon as we remember how immense a burden of cares and labors he bore while he was with us, which, as you know, the administration of the republic, the study of the medical art, and even the groans of the struggling church brought upon him daily. Yet nothing was so difficult, so burdensome, that he did not undertake it with a cheerful and courageous spirit, as long as any hope of salvation remained, so that divine mercy, having finally pitied the man exhausted by his relentless labors, took him from the world, where, once freed from all tyranny of cares, threats, and calamities, which await us hourly, he might enjoy eternal rest and partake of all those heavenly goods which in Christ, the triumphant God and still man, he testified and confessed with immortal monuments until his last breath. For often, while sick, he called me, well aware of the spirit with which he had pursued me and I him; often I went to the man of my own accord, knowing that my presence was not unwelcome to him; not because he needed any consolation or confirmation from me, but because, due to his learning and piety, he would sweetly converse with me, and I would listen to his most learned speeches and rest in his humanity as long as fate allowed. If in the meantime any passage of Scripture full of consolation came up, he would immediately, with hands joined and eyes lifted to heaven, give thanks to God the Father for His beneficence shown to us in Christ, and he was troubled that he had not retained all such passages in memory. Among other things, he desired me to read to him the chapters of the discourse which Christ had at supper, about to face death, and also the 8th, 9th, and 10th chapters of Paul's Epistle to the Hebrews. When I did so, good gods, with what gravity and learning he had discoursed on the eternal priesthood of Christ. You would have heard a swan song, most learned Bullinger. Sometimes, moved by the indignity of the matter, he inveighed against the abhorrent abomination of the sacrificers, so blasphemously profaning the priesthood of Christ. Yet thus dying, Vadianus was entirely himself in asserting true religion and detesting the false, so that in his eloquence, learning, and prudence, you could desire nothing more than a slightly stronger voice. He bore all the torments, which were greatest from the tension of the nerves through the armpits, with patience worthy of a Christian man. He craved cold water with insatiable thirst, which he had delighted in since childhood; when it was denied to him, lest it cause greater torment, he was most piously turned to the most health-giving fountains of living water in John 4 and Isaiah 55, and there he would quench the lips of his thirsty spirit with the most abundant draught. He was little concerned about the restoration of health, having neglected earthly matters from the very beginning of his illness; for the wise physician had sensed that this kind of illness was joined with death; yet he did not reject medical aid. Therefore, he arranged his household in time; he enjoined the consular men with the utmost earnestness to have the Republic of St. Gallen as highly commended as possible; he bequeathed the treasure of his books to his fellow citizens by will, and even now, at this hour, as I write this, I am called by the magistrates to select a suitable place to dedicate to the public library, which treasure we hope will be enriched more and more daily by your most learned works.</p>
      <p>He was greatly desirous of seeing the third volume of the Fifth Decade; but envious death anticipated him. Yet we do not doubt that he now beholds this truth, which you teach in these books, not in a riddle, but face to face. After he had ceased to speak entirely at the end of his life, he testified his faith by a nod and, fixing his eyes on me, strongly proclaiming Christ, our sufficiency, and grasping my hand with his right hand in the manner of either a stipulator or a farewell, he most gently fell asleep in Christ. Here are tears.</p>
      <p>But I will cease, lest the wound reopen. What our homeland has lost in this ornament, and I will add also the Christian republic, there is no need to lament more at length with you. On the shoulders of this man, as on the safest ford, rested almost the entire safety of our republic. Therefore, I fear that with this head laid to rest, those whom the authority and reputation of this most prudent man have hitherto suppressed may break forth.</p>
      <p>But the hand of the Lord is not shortened, to whom be glory forever. As for your letters, which you mention, I have most dutifully pursued them out of my respect for you. The widow, a most honorable matron, immediately made available all the letters, from which, as from an Iliad, I collected, as far as I know, all of yours, except that I heard from a maid that many were burned by Vadianus, namely those which his prudence perceived to be exposed to danger.</p>
      <p>I do not know whether any of yours were among that number. Those I found, I have taken into my trust, to send to you as soon as I find a suitable messenger; for it does not seem safe to entrust this kind of writing to any wanderers. The remaining business you have with the Pole, I have understood not obscurely from your two letters sent to Vadianus last; for he, hindered by infirmity, was unable to read. By his command, I read them, and he replied that he had taken care of the whole matter with the utmost diligence. Therefore, as soon as I receive anything certain about this matter, I will inform you, and if in any other matter I can do anything with my effort, I will refuse nothing. Farewell, most learned Bullinger, the second hope of our Helvetia. May God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, long preserve you safe for us and His church throughout the world. I earnestly ask this through the most sacred graces, that you deposit some part of the friendship that was mutually between you and Vadianus with us, however unworthy, which we may possess almost by hereditary right. You have in return those who pursue you with the utmost sincerity of mind. The fellow ministers of our church, ministers Mr. Schlappler, Christopher Fortm√ºller, Antonius Zilius, bid you and the other doctors of the church, the best and most learned men, Theodor, Pellican, Gwalther, and Frisius, etc., to be well.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, April 29, 1551.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kessler of St. Gallen, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop at the renowned church of the Zurichers, his esteemed lord.</p>
