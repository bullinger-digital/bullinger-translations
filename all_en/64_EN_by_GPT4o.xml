      <p>When the opportunity presented itself to inform you of my condition, I wanted to write these things to you, my dear Mr. Bullinger, since I owe you so much, and because it would be most pleasant for me to hear about your well-being. I went to Bern and delivered your letters to Judocus, who assisted me with great enthusiasm. But, as you could understand from my previous letters, there was no vacancy at that time.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I went to Basel, where I found neither friends nor, if I may speak freely, almost no Christians; for the Lord will provide me bread from heaven. These are the things I can write; perhaps I will write to you again from France.</p>
      <p>I have translated your book into the French language; I hope to publish it within a few days.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, my dear Mr. Bullinger, farewell; greet your wife and the church of your house in my name, and may peace be with you all.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the eighth day before the Ides of March.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ Jesus sincerely, P. Naillosius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, my dear Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
