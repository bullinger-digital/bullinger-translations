      <p>Not long ago, I wrote to you, venerable man, that the councilor Schudi unexpectedly and unpreparedly summoned me to a discussion about matters of religion, about which there is much debate among many. In this meeting, several leading figures of both his and our religion were present along with the councilors. When you were informed by me about these matters, you requested that I communicate my response to you in writing as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>I am gladly prepared to comply with this request. Therefore, I am sending you my confession of faith and response concerning the three articles we discussed. If I have not spoken well or do not hold orthodox views on divine matters, please correct me and apply your refinement. Furthermore, it would be long and tedious to enumerate how our affairs stand here. However, the bearer of this letter, named Balthasar Heer, a very sincere and pious man and a most faithful supporter and promoter of the gospel among us, will explain everything to you in order, truthfully, and in detail. I beseech you to kindly lend him your ears; he knows how to inform you accurately about everything.</p>
      <p>Trust him, and if there are secrets, you can safely entrust them to his care; for he is a prudent and good man, who could rightly be called a pillar of our republic and the evangelical cause. For this reason, I refrain from writing much about these matters now.</p>
      <p>Finally, I wish to ask you to inform me through the courier whether the assembly of the Parisian doctors (for discussing matters of religion) is confirmed or not. Dated August 26th in Glarus.</p>
      <p>Fridolin Brunner, minister of the word in Glarus, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the learned and esteemed man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor among the people of Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
