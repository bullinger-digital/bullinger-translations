      <p>S. I received your letter written on the 4th of this month, and it was most pleasant to see that you are confirmed and healthy and that you have received my letters. From France, they write that on the last Thursday, a citizen in Lyon, while the sacrament was being carried in a procession, threw it to the ground and said to the priest: "You impiously present a man-made god to be worshipped," and then some priests were killed by the agitated crowd. I suspect the same has happened in other places.</p>
      <p>From Spain, it is written on the 21st of May that the city of Ceuta, which belongs to the King of Portugal in Barbary, is besieged by the Moors; there is a fine harbor there.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Brunswick has left the court of Philip, lest anyone invade his lands in his absence, and it has been arranged in Spain that he is not content. In Seville, countless people have been captured for the sake of religion, and the prisons are not sufficient, and there are many in all maritime places. On the 20th of May, Philip left Toledo, heading to Aranjuez and Madrid; he treats all creditors poorly, offering them only five instead of sixteen and very uncertain. I will need to offer and seal ten for a hundred, and there will be those who complain and think they are being wronged because something is deducted from the spoils. Most of the money promised to the Swiss by me will be present here this month, and I will be able to act with Greek faith with open hands. Greet all friends.</p>
      <p>My son gives thanks for the German booklet. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 11th of June.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich. Zürich.</p>
