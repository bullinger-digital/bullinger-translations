      <p>S. I hear that the envoys of the cities have returned from such a pious mission: but I have not understood what they have obtained or accomplished. I give thanks to Christ the Savior that He has moved the hearts of all, not only of the pastors, among whom you were not the least, and the rest certainly did their duty, but also of the senators and even the common people, to help the pious brothers in whatever way they could, both through prayers to the Lord and by other means among men. Indeed, I congratulate all on this piety, this most holy zeal.</p>
      <p>I cannot forget such services, without humbly asking the Lord to reward the good as He usually does with the best. Thus, without a doubt, it must continue in the church, so that the members of the body of Christ should more diligently pursue each other with mutual services, so that what has been gained may be preserved and new things acquired. How I wish you, who can, would give thanks on my behalf to the churches that have acted so zealously for the pious.</p>
      <p>Haller began vigorously, what have you not done? Simpertus [!] more than we would dare to ask: Sulcerus both at home among his own and in letters to others did everything. What can we ask from the senators that has not been accomplished, indeed beyond what we would ask?</p>
      <p>While these things are happening among the pious churches, Christ acts wonderfully among the pious: minds are strengthened more and more, pastors encourage, the common people almost lead in readiness and eagerness. The more the papists threaten, the less the pious fear. They consider it a great thing if it is the will of the Lord to suffer for Christ and the gospel.</p>
      <p>It is so far from the pastors abandoning their station that others must be added daily, as the number of the flock increases. If some seem to be partly with us, partly joining us, but do not fully commit themselves to Christ, and protect themselves by other means than open confession of Christ, though they seem few, yet both the pastors and the stronger ones work with the greatest zeal to strengthen the weaker ones and to bring them to depend entirely on Christ. The progress is remarkable: may Christ increase the number, faith, and gifts to the pious. Many hopes shone for me of the uncommon progress of the gospel, but I feel that someone with amazing cunning is overturning the plan. What happens in preaching, the same happens in books. For as the books of the pious edify beyond measure, so also the impious ones destroy wonderfully. Someone gave me certain writings of Cratoald and Caspar Schwenckfeld to read, to draw me into their party. How many impious things I read with much cunning and deceit there! The printer did not add his name.</p>
      <p>And for a few hours, as it is said, the German Theology was read, which I suspect to be the work of the most lost man David Joris, Boinus, and such pests. Oporinus seems born to bring everything into the open without selection, so that everyone may follow what they want and as they want. He published such an impious work. How impiously Germany is being led astray, that instead of the theology of the true doctrine of faith and revealed by the Holy Spirit to the prophets and apostles, contained in the sacred scriptures, an Anabaptist delirium is held. And what is the purpose of Plato's politics and Dionysius's delusions? To completely lead away from God: to lead to mere contemplation. But ours comes to the Father through Christ. May Christ avert these evils. Indeed, it would be expedient to prohibit such impious things, which I do not doubt you and yours abhor, as is quite evident. For what you did not allow there, was published here.</p>
      <p>What was done at Frankfurt, about those things we discussed with you, we have heard nothing, except that Tossanus was there with Prince George.</p>
      <p>May Christ Jesus grant true peace and holy concord. Farewell, my dearest Bullinger. May Christ keep you and yours, as I pray to the Lord, desiring to be helped by your prayers. Greet, I pray, the pious colleagues, the whole holy assembly of pastors and teachers. Especially the pious envoy, but first the fathers who sent him. May Christ always favor them. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Neuchâtel, July 28, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Farel.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent servant of Christ Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, brother and fellow minister, to be greatly respected. In Zürich.</p>
