      <p>Greetings. It would be my desire, if you had a particularly beautiful deer antler that you could spare, that you might send it to me one of these days, whenever you conveniently can. I would have it prepared in my, Heinrich's, and your name and have it gifted to a place that would also be pleasing to you, etc. Since you have a little book, in which the order of beggars and the Rotwelsch grammar, which was previously mine, but I gave it to you, I would like you to lend it to me, so that I can send it back to you soon, etc.</p>
      <p>By God's grace, we are all well, may God increase it, and there is nothing new. I do not know what has come from Baden, as I have not gone out except to the church to preach.</p>
      <p>God be with you all. etc.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
