      <p>Greetings. I could write nothing due to the multitude of tasks. At least I wanted to indicate that I have received your most welcome letters. What I have from the letters written in Milan about the defeat of the Emperor's army by the Barbarians and at Traguardo, I have recited to this excellent brother.</p>
      <p>They have repaired the fleet in Genoa and have returned to Barbary with great hope. The Lord is the judge. Farewell forever. ZÃ¼rich, 24th of September, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius, my most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
