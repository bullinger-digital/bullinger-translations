      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you twice yesterday; I sent one letter through the steward of Küngßfeld to my brother who is bathing at the spa, and I am sending the other now along with this one. I was thwarted by the arrival of Tumisius with the message, which otherwise, if he had not come, would have been sent to Zurich today. You will find out what is happening among the Valaisians.</p>
      <p>Today, the son of Mr. Dryander brought me your letters and those of Mr. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>I give both of you my utmost thanks for your loyalty and diligence. I read the English letters with great pleasure and am returning them through this Tumisius, your fellow countryman; I also shared them with Mr. Musculus.</p>
      <p>Among other things, you write about the document from Jena, which I should keep until I see the document from the Prince of Hesse; but I have not seen the one from Jena, as it was not included in the bundle of letters. However, I do not know if perhaps Dryander has it, who is not present as I write this. That Bohemian Waldensian was here; you will learn this from the confession of the theologians of Württemberg, which I sent to you with yesterday's letters. Your warning was appreciated by Musculus.</p>
      <p>What, I ask, is Vergerius planning? We do not quite understand what he is contemplating; we see that he gets along very well with the Lutherans, but we cannot judge the rest so well, except that his meddlesomeness has long been suspect to us. I will address other matters in other letters; therefore, I am brief here. Farewell.</p>
      <p>All those whom you greeted send their regards in return, especially Steiger, to whom I showed your letters. I think Frisching will respond herself.</p>
      <p>Farewell...</p>
      <p>Bern, July 22, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
