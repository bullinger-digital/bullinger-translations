      <p>God and all good things to you, especially dear lord and brother. I have well understood the contents of your letter. It is a special joy to me that my letter may soon reach Bern, especially because of Haller, as he urged the response so much.</p>
      <p>I sent the copy the day before yesterday to a good brother, Funkli, in St. Gallen; he himself came here yesterday and stayed with his stepfather in MÃ¼nsterlingen for a few days, so he has not yet seen the copy in St. Gallen; otherwise, he would have brought it back to me. You must have one from other people; it seems strange to me, the last thing before.</p>
      <p>Regarding those from Basel, I was particularly pleased to hear that they are in agreement with you. I thank you for your faithful diligence; but I would still like to know what the substance of the response was; for you have never written to me about it, neither now nor in previous letters, and yet I think it cannot be a secret; it will otherwise come out freely.</p>
      <p>For the letter, the Lord thanks you. Bear with me that I trouble you so; if I can, I will also serve you unreservedly.</p>
      <p>Regarding the exchange, you did not understand me correctly, or I did not write correctly; I did not want to send 100 florins to Basel, but rather that a merchant in Zurich would pay me 100 florins; I wanted to charge him where he would certainly be given the same amount back in Basel; otherwise, it is not safe now because of the spoon.</p>
      <p>I would always like to write you news, nisi non esset tanta mortalium vanitas (if it were not for the great vanity of mortals). At the moment, I have nothing certain.</p>
      <p>Our exiles have been together, and Hans Muntprat came to them from the city, made a long speech, and wanted to persuade them to return to the city; then they would certainly come to a good agreement. But they will not be released; they must swear to religion and other things and act like other people. If they do not do this, do not seek mercy, and submit to all this, they will have to lose all their possessions and goods; they should now think of nothing else than that within three or four weeks they will not be safe or tolerated anywhere in Thurgau or in the entire Confederation, neither among the evangelicals nor the non-evangelicals; so much has been achieved. But not one among them is willing to submit to this, although it affects my dear brother the most. But God will not abandon us and will relieve all burdens.</p>
      <p>I also hope that these are just scare tactics, to see if they can be brought in; for the common Confederates have probably not yet decided on this, as no day has yet been held in which they have dealt with this.</p>
      <p>I also hope that even if others do it, the evangelicals will not do it in their territories, as it stands.</p>
      <p>The bailiff himself also said to one of the exiled citizens, who was not of the council, and also to Lude Hurus, that they should be sure that nothing would happen to them, etc., as they are obedient, and if anyone has anything to say to them, they want to be of one mind. He comforted them very well; one gave him a little cup.</p>
      <p>They want to open the royal regiment in Constance these days, how it should be held there, and all things. Therefore, we think Muntprat wanted to deal with ours in such a way, to see if they could also be brought in; for they fear that if they do not come in before, they will not want to come in at all after the opening, as everything will be so difficult. May dear God have mercy on all the pious!</p>
      <p>They wanted to send over these days to fetch wine in a ship at a hospital courtyard called Halta, near Meersburg.</p>
      <p>Everything was ready, and the shipmen had already eaten and wanted to leave; a message came that they would not be allowed to take any wine; the port was not yet cleared, etc. Thus, the one from Landau also says he has not yet received any orders from the emperor or king regarding the port. It is a wonderful thing everywhere.</p>
      <p>On Sunday evening, I saw a copy of the emperor's writing to the common Confederates regarding Schertlin. He complains greatly of the disloyalty, that those from Constance, for all his loyalty and complete friendship, show him such thanks and have dealt with him so disloyally, and it is truly pitiable that people treat each other so banally.</p>
      <p>One from Lindau took a wife in Ravensburg and had himself brought there, had to confess beforehand, and the priest asked him if he also believed in the Interim, and if he had said no, he would not have been brought in. Ecce novum fidei articulum et tredecimum (Behold, a new article of faith and the thirteenth). Everyone greets you. Salveat tua domus cum omnibus fratribus et sororibus (May your house be well with all brothers and sisters). Commend us to the Lord in your holy prayers. January 16, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his own. In Zurich.</p>
