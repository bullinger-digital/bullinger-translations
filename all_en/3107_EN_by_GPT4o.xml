      <p>S. I write nothing; Zwingli will be a living letter. At this moment, I am coming from the council and have pressed your matter; yesterday I waited all day, but due to the multitude of affairs, I could not be admitted.</p>
      <p>The summary is: they do not want it to be printed here; they suspect some disturbances, especially since Froschauer does not want his name added to the book. Therefore, I am sending back the entire work. We ask you to consider our efforts favorably; for it was not our fault that it could not be published here and under the name of this city. Regarding other matters.</p>
      <p>The Geneva affair greatly troubles us. Never has the situation been more on the brink of proceeding to war or some disturbances; for the exiled Genevans have been allowed to seize all the goods of the Genevans that are within the borders of the Bernese dominion, if the Genevans continue to seize their goods, which they still have in Geneva. Therefore, everything seems to point towards war and disturbances, unless God prevents it. We are not allowed to write anything to Calvin or others, lest we seem to betray the republic.</p>
      <p>In Bern on the day of Charles. Farewell and forgive the tumultuous and also very indignant writing.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Refusal to print, January 28, 1557.</p>
      <p>If there were no lurking danger, it would have been printed in Zurich; for nothing has been sent here from them so far. The danger of printing this book is evident from Gualther's Antichrist.</p>
      <p>and that Froschauer particularly wanted it to be printed without his name in Bern by Apiarius.</p>
      <p>No benefit arises from it except for the private benefit of Apiarius, who desires to print it to make a profit. Private benefit should not be preferred over public and thus expose the entire republic to danger. Especially since from the German Bibles and the deisp... it is clear that the Apocalypse is not counted among the canonical books, of which Zwingli is indeed believed to be the author, whose exposition of the Apocalypse does not agree with this, as it asserts it to be canonical, and therefore no danger should be undertaken for such a book.</p>
      <p>These are the reasons Mr. Zwingli reported to me from the mouth of Mr. Haller, why the Bernese council did not want to consent to the publication of the Apocalypse.</p>
