      <p>Greetings. I received and read your letter, man in Christ Jesus, both beloved and esteemed, with a certain singular pleasure of the mind, giving thanks that you lovingly corrected me in my error, in that I thought the disputes among the learned began to be questioned for the first time at the diet held here in Worms, when I hear from you that it happened earlier in Speyer and that its author was a certain Albert, surnamed von der Than, undoubtedly somewhat elevated due to his nobility. You further wish that the Christian republic could be beneficially advised even at the cost of your body and all your goods, a good and commendable wish, if it proceeds from a true heart. I would wish the same, not only with the loss of my goods but also with the temporal life of this world, which is soon to be left behind, I call as witness the one whom you, who delights in being called as a witness of sincere truth and proceeding from a sincere heart, but hates simulation and hypocrisy. But those whom you call new evangelicals in your letters, I do not quite understand, whether you mean those who, in this troubled time approaching the end of the age, being reborn from above (as Christ said to Nicodemus), have begun to see the kingdom of God, that is, to know the mysteries of the divine scripture and to cleanse it from human impurities and restore it to its native splendor, or those who, from a vicar of I know not whom, five hundred or at most six hundred years ago, as if enchanted, began to drink from cisterns, leaving the fountain of living water, miserably defiling the sacred scripture of the Old and New Testament and seeking their own, not those of Jesus Christ, as Saint Paul says about such false teachers to the Philippians, hence they should rather be called new than those of ours today. The vices also, which you ascribe to them, although they sometimes, as men, fall too much, being overly concerned with richer stipends, so that they may honestly support their legitimate wives and children in Christian marriage. This is more to be forgiven than if they were to squander it on harlots as yours do.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that you reproach them for laziness, when there is no lazier, and add, more ignorant of divine scriptures, people in the whole world than yours, I appeal to your conscience here. I have taught to solve the arguments of adversaries with fire, sword, and water alone.</p>
      <p>Then you add in your letter to me that indeed those new ones of ours say in their public congregations in our churches, and you do not add what they say. If you had written that they say about our churches, I could imagine from the subsequent words: "One God, one church" etc., that they say your churches are not churches; then also from the sacred scriptures I could say what the catholic or universal church is, of which in the apostolic creed, and what particular ones, of which there are innumerable in the Christian world, and what about these and that.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, and I seem to myself to feel piously, I will patiently hear your opinion in this too and, according to Paul's admonition, will test everything and then embrace the good. Meanwhile, until you have declared yourself, I suspend my judgment here.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily in Christ Jesus, whose voice as his little sheep you may hear alone, not of a stranger, but flee from him as far as possible, even if such a one whose feet the Caesars are accustomed to kiss. Again, farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>From my house, November 24, in the year 59.</p>
      <p>Your brother in Christ Jesus from the heart, Wolfgang Waidner, doctor.</p>
