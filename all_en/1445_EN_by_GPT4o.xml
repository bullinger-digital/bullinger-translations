      <p>S. I send back to you, dearest lord and godfather, your advice on the matter of the council, as well as what you have gathered about not swearing by the saints, and I give you great thanks. I expect your letters daily and hope for something new in them. We have some news here, which I assume you are already aware of. Nevertheless, I will note a few things so that my diligence cannot be missed.</p>
      <p>The people of Magdeburg have made an agreement with Duke Moritz and have a truce for 6 months, thus relieved from the siege; praise be to God! The Emperor is supposed to move to Innsbruck in a few days; cavalry are stationed at Hall, and they have already arrived in Augsburg to remain there. He is very obstinate; to all his princes who have dealings with him, he gives curt answers: they should leave him in peace; he has other things to do now. The envoy of the King of France, who was at the court, he has dismissed and gifted 1500 crowns, saying: he had not expected such a deal against his king. From Saxony, Hesse, and the Hanseatic cities, envoys have been with the Emperor regarding the two captured princes; they stayed at Donauwörth for 3 weeks, waiting to see if they would be released, and were finally interrogated; what answer they received, I do not know. The captured Elector requested to know the names of the envoys and messengers; they told him it was not necessary now; they hoped to speak with him personally soon; then he would see who they are. The Emperor sends much artillery and ammunition to Italy. The Turk is advancing strongly in Hungary, Ferdinand against him. There is said to be great discord between the Emperor's and Ferdinand's governments. Nothing has been heard from Maximilian for so long that it was thought he was captured or lost; but these days news has come that he has arrived in Genoa. The Abbot of Weingarten travels around the Upper Swabian cities, abolishing the guilds everywhere, establishing an oligarchy: that is what is said here.</p>
      <p>From Geneva, Calvin writes to me these days, among other things, quite significantly: "It is horrendous to say how much the Frenchman now rages, the atrocity has progressed further than we feared, and there are merely some preludes. Everywhere the pious are dragged to the stake, and by edict, the ordinary judges are ordered to burn those who have been found to have either thought like us, shown any favor towards us, sent money to their relatives, or possessed books. Moreover, parents are forbidden under severe penalty to plead for their children. There are many such things. If we can do nothing else, at least it is ours to help our suffering brothers with the support of our prayers."</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have nothing at present, except that my lord sends 50 crowns to those of Grüningen for their fire damage through this messenger. Regarding the meeting of the 4 cities, I have greeted many of my lords in your and my lord Mayor Lavater's name; I believe, however, if it had not been rejected, it would not have been rejected again. Farewell, with greetings to all yours and the most esteemed brothers. Bern, 26th October 1551.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
