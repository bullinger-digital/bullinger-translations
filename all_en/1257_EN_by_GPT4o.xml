      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have applied all diligence in seeking a position for the Italian commended to me by you and Celio, but I ran in vain to all the merchants, who unanimously responded that they did not need his services, as they have wives and children at home who know very well how to finish hats, and our tailors are diligently insisting that a foreigner, who perhaps knows better how to practice this art, should not settle among us, according to the old proverb "The potter hates the potter."</p>
      <p>The good man is heading to Strasbourg; there perhaps he will be better advised than with us.</p>
      <p>The death of Vadianus grieves all the pious; but who will fight against God, who has called him to Himself after many labors completed, to rest and eternal joys. He will give His church someone excellent in similar dignity and doctrine, who will console the afflicted. The plague of the Lord is at the door; the Turk threatens our necks. The Hungarians are struck with great fear, the Bavarians do not know where to turn, and it is no wonder, because they feel the Lord will fight against them for the innocent blood they have shed for many years. There is a huge Turkish army in Buda, a great cavalry, making incursions into nearby cities. King Ferdinand lacks money, and he has alienated the princes and the people. What will he do with an unwilling army, who would rather see the Turk win and the king perish, than the king victorious.</p>
      <p>The pestilential plague troubles us little. There are internal inflammations, which cause people to burn with fever, to rave for a few days, and then, having barely recovered, they soon breathe their last. And this evil comes because of our ingratitude towards the word of God and His ministers.</p>
      <p>The church in Strasbourg is still doing well and is steadfast in asserting the truth of Christ. The Papists, although they are fierce and shameless, dare not do anything for fear of the people, hiding at home and contemplating various things.</p>
      <p>Johannes Swikerus of Sickingen has called an excellent man to himself, whom he wishes to keep with him despite the protests of the bishops, to preach the doctrine of the gospel to him and his household. Near Ebernburg Castle, he has given him a church, in which he preaches most steadfastly. Farewell. Basel, April 28, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>Myconius preaches again, the excellent and ailing old man. The plague claimed 8 today.</p>
      <p>To the honorable master Heinrich Bullinger, priest in Zurich, my gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
