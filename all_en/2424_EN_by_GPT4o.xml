      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. Since you have been so concerned, my lord and brother Bullinger, always to be revered in Christ, for my health and well-being, as I gather from your letters, I could not refrain from informing you of my current condition and the state of my body. Having driven away the fever, I am now advancing at a slow pace, though not further than to the church, which is scarcely ten paces from the house I inhabit. I am not sufficiently strong in my hands and feet, therefore I do not yet declaim standing, but rather observe while sitting. All the physicians unanimously recommend the baths at Kellen, which are certainly cold and only heated by fire. If the divine will does not remove me from human affairs after the winter months, I would rather come to you, where the waters are naturally warm. Then I would greet you with the other brothers; may the Lord's will be done. Amen. A persistent rumor is spreading that the French have been defeated by the Emperor's forces; but this rumor is only spread by those who are supporters of the Emperor.</p>
      <p>Discord has arisen between the ministers of Christ and the papal priests in Strasbourg and has not yet been completely settled; the magistrates, who somewhat favor the papists, indulge them too much during the holidays. Sedition is feared. Dr. Wolfgang Wissenburg and Sultzer have studied the matter in Strasbourg and, upon returning, were with me. I truly pray to the gracious God, as is incumbent upon all the pious, that Satan may soon be crushed under the feet of good men, etc. Farewell in these matters.</p>
      <p>Hastily from Riquewihr, October 12, 1554. Greet all the brothers by name, especially your family.</p>
      <p>Ours greet you, especially that King, who is present while I write these things, etc.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Erb.</p>
      <p>Greet also the old Jacob Schmid, our Fabricius Anchises, and parent, in our name.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, etc.</p>
