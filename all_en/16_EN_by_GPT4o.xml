    <p xml:id="regest1">The political situation remains critical. There is nothing new. Although people's plans can change quickly, he has not written without reason about threatening difficulties. Even a fighter's strength eventually wanes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">After the rejected [relocation] of the council to Trent by Pope Paul III, Emperor Charles V is rightly angry. If only he were as ill-disposed towards the papacy as he is towards the pope himself! Perhaps there would soon be a decent reformation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">The emperor urges the imperial estates to find a temporary solution until the general reform by the council and demands that they appoint some peaceful and politically experienced men for this task, but only a few, because he ultimately wants to decide himself. They are to take on this matter and work out something over which Charles V is to have the final say, as if the reports submitted by the imperial estates also need to be approved by him at his discretion. Will this agreement preserve the pious Church of Christ?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Frölich has nothing more to report. He entrusts himself further to God and Bullinger's prayers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings, especially to Frölich's dear godfather Johannes Haller, Rudolf Gwalther, Konrad Gessner, Theodor Bibliander, the venerable Konrad Pellican, Johannes Wolf, and Johannes Fries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">A poet, [Thomas Naogeorg], has composed a satirical poem of 1,270 verses against Johannes Pedioneus, the author of the slanderous book about the [Schmalkaldic] War. Frölich urgently asks Bullinger to find a printer for it. Since it is not a defamatory but a scholarly poem, it will surely sell well and be well received by many. Bullinger should comment on this. If he deems it advisable, Frölich will send a copy to Gwalther or Gessner. Bullinger should also report whether he was shown the book by Pedioneus and the response to it that Frölich sent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Another greeting.</p>

      <p>The republic is now as unstable as it has been for some time. I know nothing new. If I have previously written to you about the impending difficulties, believe that it was not without reason, although human plans can easily change. Even a fighter's strength is sometimes denied.</p>

      <p>The Pope refuses the Council of Trent. Therefore, the Emperor is rightly angry with him. If only he were as ill-disposed towards the papacy as he is towards the Pope. Perhaps we would soon have a pious reformation.</p>

      <p>The Emperor urges the imperial estates to establish a way of living in the church until a common reformation is eventually achieved through a council. He wants them to appoint some peaceful, pious, and politically experienced men (though few in number, which he also promises to do himself) to oversee this matter and to draft something that he can ultimately either accept or reject, as it is entrusted to him by the imperial estates at his discretion. Will this agreement adequately provide for the Church of Christ?</p>

      <p>A certain very learned poet has written against Johannes Pedioneus, the author of the slanderous book about the German War. It is a poem of 1,270 verses. The genre of the poem is iambic trimeter scazon. I earnestly ask you to speak with a printer and see if he is willing to undertake the task of printing it. It is indeed a very learned poem and not injurious, so it should be marketable and well-received by many. Write back what you think. If you consider it advisable, I will send a copy to Master Gwalther or Gessner. Also, write back whether the book by Pedioneus and a certain letter sent by me were presented to you.</p>
