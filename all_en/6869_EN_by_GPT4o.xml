      <p> Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, I have received two letters from you, to which I have not yet responded, because I had nothing worthy of your knowledge. Italy is closed to us because of the plague, which certainly rages here; for every single day it takes away ten (at the very least), sometimes sixteen, sometimes eighteen, sometimes twenty, and among them the strongest. Consider, however, how small this town is. About four hundred have fled; in such small remnants, it rages so greatly. I am surrounded on all sides; for not even the street is immune. Unless I am preserved by the singular counsel of God, I will hardly escape in such a plague, especially since I visit those who call me. In the temple, I console the afflicted, I awaken the torpid, as much as I can; for everyone frequents the temple, even those who have either escaped or whose houses are infected, but they occupy their own place somewhat apart from others. I rest in the divine mercy, who has sustained me from my mother's womb, whose mercy I have experienced so many times; for He who drew me out of the pit can also save me now, if it pleases Him; if He calls me from here, this too is His holy and just will. To you, my reverend father, I give immortal thanks for all your benefits to me. This one thing pains me, that no suitable opportunity has yet been offered to testify to my respect for you. May the Lord be your reward, who may preserve you safe for a long time for His church. What you write about Sara Zoller dying so unexpectedly, struck me; for she seemed to be a particularly chaste and honest matron, and also pious. They were very anxious about which way to return, lest they be infected by the plague; they thought they should hurry, lest they linger on the road. But there is no counsel against the Lord. Here, now, about four hundred have died. There are still many people in the church and around the streets. Consul Tscharner fled immediately with his whole family; Ambrosius still lingers. - You wish to know my judgment about the doctor; but I was not so familiarly acquainted with him. He had a dispute with me about the duty of a Christian man in time of plague; for I detest that incredible barbarism of the Italians. But in the meantime, we cultivated friendship on both sides with mutual letters; in meetings, he is very courteous. I cannot write more. I have nothing at all from Italy. If you inform me about Hungarian affairs, you will do a pleasing thing. May God preserve you with all yours, whom you will kindly greet from me, especially Lavater. I commend myself to your prayers. Farewell, reverend father in Christ. </p>
      <p> Chur, August 12, 1566. </p>
      <p> Yours, Fabricius. </p>
      <p> Since I wrote this, the plague has seized a maidservant and has shown itself in two places, etc. I pray the Lord to have mercy on us. To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich. </p>
