      <p>Greetings. The uncertainty of rumors makes me write less frequently; there is also the illness, which has been troubling me since the beginning of January, and furthermore, the rarity of messengers. It was affirmed here ten days ago or more that the forces of Montmélian clashed with those of Morges in Provence and were superior in many respects; 4000 were missing from the adversary's side, and this was confirmed by some nobles of Savoy here to Lord de Mülinen, as I have heard from his account. A few days later, it was said that this was nothing. Likewise, there was some skirmish made by German horsemen with the king's forces, and ours were also superior; but I cannot affirm anything certain about this. The latest talks are about Condé, who is heading towards Lyon. The Genevans write nothing, and what they sometimes write is not reliable enough. This delay is troublesome to me; for I fear it may be harmful to our people, indeed also to us. I have not yet been able to obtain that almanac, about which I wrote recently. The scribe, who was supposed to translate it into the German language, lost an entire sheet in the street, and it could not be found again, so our people were compelled to request a copy of it again from Neuchâtel through their own messenger. It was decided in the council to send copies to Zürich and Basel. If I can obtain it, I will share it with you. Thus, you have all that I know now; when I receive more, I will write more.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you. I have not been at Steiger's for several days because the illness has kept me at home; however, I hope to be better soon.</p>
      <p>I pray for the well-being of all yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 7, 1568.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
