      <p>God be with you. Dearly beloved son, due to my numerous writings and heavy burdens that I must bear, you are the first to assist me with your Balthasar, about whom I have previously written diligently to Glarus for the second time. Now I must write 3 letters, one to M[ichael] BÃ¤ldi, F. Schuler, and Mr. Hansen Hugen. Quis unus omnia haec sustinuerit? Yet I will do my best according to my ability. Utinam grati homines illi essent et agnoscerent ipsos collata beneficia. What I received today from Chur, I send to you herewith signed by my own hand; I would be pleased if you could manage to bring it to weigh, you show it or send it to Mr. Hans Conrad Ulmer in Schaffhausen, but that he returns it to you; greet him for me. If you cannot do it conveniently, then let it be; it is not of much importance. I do not believe that everything is proceeding so correctly and that the victory is so great; but if it is, then we will have Tockey back in hand; there they also won a house and lost land, people, and goods.</p>
      <p>May God grant good times. I write this in utmost haste. It has also come to my lords, how things stand in France, quite well, and what the king has written to the Duke of Savoy, that he finds the evangelicals of the kingdom prepared; now he finds otherwise, admonishing him to be friendly towards the evangelicals and not to let himself be incited against them, etc. Note, it will only be read before the council tomorrow.</p>
      <p>God be with you and your household. Greet Susanna and Elisabeth for me, Mr. Hans Peyer, Mr. Hus... etc.</p>
      <p>Written in haste on November 2, 1571.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
