    <p xml:id="regest1">Welser thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received] and the response [of the Zurichers] to Luther's [“Short Confession”], the [“True Confession”], which rehabilitates the true believers. - To his annoyance, he has heard how the city of Überlingen refuses [Marta] Blarer her annuity, which was also discussed at the [city council in Worms]. The woman married and became Protestant. Überlingen has remained the only Catholic imperial city and therefore refuses to pay her, which is not appropriate. In his opinion, she should submit a supplication to the imperial cities in Worms, so that they urge Überlingen to pay her the annuity. For if the man [Erasmus Schmid] were to try to collect [the annuity] in an inappropriate manner, it could harm the [Protestant] cities. Welser therefore intends to write to the [Augsburg] envoys [Matthäus Langenmantel, Melchior Scherer, Marx Pfister, Jörg Hopfer, and Dr. Nikolaus Müller known as Maier] in Worms, so that they take up the matter. - He has asked Ambrosius Blarer to forward the 32 articles of the [Louvain] theologians (which Emperor [Charles V] has declared binding and which are intended to restore the papacy) to Bullinger. May God thwart these plans and support the Gospel.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ, our Savior, with the offer of my willing service, I send to you, dear lord and brother of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, beforehand. I have previously received your letter - with a booklet by Martin Luther - a response to his unchristian booklet; for which I thank God, the Lord, who has given you such grace and heart, and subsequently thank you for your work. For it is enough for every believer who seeks nothing more than the truth of Jesus Christ. For in sum, the sacrament of Jesus Christ must be received spiritually in the power of faith, which comes from above, which the sacramental bread cannot give or help with, other than that it is used as instituted by the Lord of the Supper, to proclaim his death until he comes.</p>
      <p>I have heard how those from Überlingen are withholding the annuity from the Blarer woman. And it seems to me that even the honorable cities have heard of it; they are acting unjustly. It is not appropriate to be obstinate and withhold from others what is theirs, even if there were a doubt or unity. She has freed herself from burdens, married legally, and committed to the Gospel, acting entirely Christian, even though those from Überlingen - who alone among all imperial cities have remained to accept the Gospel - have a different, papal faith. What does it matter that they do not want to pay the honorable woman and compare her with others? They have even less reason to refuse such things. My advice: let the honorable woman submit a supplication to all the imperial cities now in Worms, with a recounting of the story, requesting them to give a recommendation to those from Überlingen, so that she is paid and not forced to sell such annuity. If the same were to seek to bring it about through an inappropriate way, whereby the other cities might also expect disadvantage, they have reason to hold on to it even more. So I will write to Worms, that my lords' envoys should help promote it for fairness.</p>
      <p>I have sent Lord Ambrosius Blarer 32 articles (to be read as decided by papal theologians; which one should firmly believe and hold; such that the imperial majesty also mandates - which is nothing other than that the miserable papacy is reinstated in its error and dignity, the Gospel of Jesus Christ pressed behind the door) with a request that he send them to you immediately. I hope, then, to God hoping, he will break their plans, have mercy on us, and let his most holy Gospel - God grant, whatever they plan against it - remain with us wretched ones, where we believe in him by grace.</p>
      <p>With that, I commend you to the grace of our dear Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Given on the 10th day of May in Augsburg in the year 1545. Your willing Hans Welser.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, highly learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, leader in the word of Jesus Christ in Zurich.</p>
