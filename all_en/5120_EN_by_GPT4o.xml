      <p>There is one thing in which I wish to have your advice promptly; however, I will use it in good faith, so you need not fear, even if you give it freely. In this disruption of the Lausanne school, there are some who wish to introduce Castalio there. Although I know nothing about him, I do know that he is held in the utmost hatred by the people of Geneva. Since almost all the ministers side with the Genevans, he will not have peace among them, and as they are narrow-minded, they will not want to serve the church together with him. Therefore, I am pressed on one side by the fear of these evils, and on the other by the necessity of maintaining the school.</p>
      <p>I would indeed like to appoint German professors there, and we also have some whom we could appoint there; but neither can our people, who are there, agree with the French, and the necessity of that function, to which someone must now be appointed...</p>
