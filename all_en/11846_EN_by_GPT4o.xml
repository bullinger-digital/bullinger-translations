    <p xml:id="regest1">It does not bother him - in contrast to his relatives - that the right of inheritance for the sons was not stipulated in the marriage contract [for the marriage of his son Samuel with Küngold von Schönau]; he trusts that there is no deceit behind it and hopes that, having come this far, an agreement will be reached. [Küngold] can be sure of Wyttenbach's financial support; the wedding date suits them well; they will arrive on Sunday [November 4] and will start their journey back home on Tuesday; he does not want to bring a carriage for the dowry, as bed frames and troughs tend to get damaged during such transports. He sends greetings to Mayor [Diethelm] Röist and the bride's family and regrets causing the busy Bullinger so much work.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ our Lord. Amen. With the offering of my friendly greetings and all the good within my power beforehand.</p>
      <p>Highly learned, especially beloved, honorable lord and brother, I have once again recognized your loyalty and earnest dealings in your writing. I express my utmost thanks to you, knowing that I cannot repay such in any way. However, my body and goods shall always be at your and your family's service.</p>
      <p>And as you write regarding the article, that the advantage for the sons is not stipulated, it should not trouble me. I trust well (from the high confidence I have in you and the honorable kinship) that there is no deceit or fraud involved. However, my relatives are very troubled and displeased, and they had expected that it would have been stipulated in some measure and without any danger, as such is unheard of among us. But since the matter has come this far, I have so much hope in the honorable kinship, that when we come together, they will meet us with all fairness in this and other matters; for it would indeed be ridiculous to break it off over such. Now, truly, I am not so much concerned about the goods as about future unity and peace. Therefore, I ask you to seek ways and means once more, that such dispute and concern may be averted.</p>
      <p>Regarding the 10 guilders, I feel well that the honorable kinship wants to manage the good daughter well at that place, but that should not trouble me.</p>
      <p>If she progresses well (as I hope), she will be able to expect this and other kindness from me. Regarding the date of the agreement, as you have set it, we will, God willing, appear; but I assume we will come there for lunch on Sunday and attend the church service on Monday and depart on Tuesday, as far as we can. Regarding the dowry, I am not inclined to bring a carriage down, as bed frames and troughs tend to get damaged during such transport. We have such things cheaply among us; yet whatever she deems good, I will provide.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God send His divine grace herein, that it may serve His honor and the salvation of our souls. Please convey my regards to my honorable lord Mayor Röist along with the honorable kinship, and also express all goodwill and greetings to them. I regret not a little that I cause you so much trouble and work, as I know well that you are burdened with many other more necessary affairs.</p>
      <p>But the Lord, our God, may He be your reward. Herewith, you and your honorable household are faithfully commended to God.</p>
      <p>Given at Schafis, on Sunday before Gallus 1543. Yours entirely willing</p>
      <p>Niklaus Wyttenbach.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of God in Zurich, his honorable lord and brother.</p>
