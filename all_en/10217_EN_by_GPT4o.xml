      <p>In the most holy epistle of Paul to the Romans, the preface of Heinrich Bullinger to Berchtold Haller, preacher of the church of Bern.</p>
      <p>The best things, most learned Berchtold, are often thought to be obscure and difficult, which offends the minds of students, causing them to either abandon their efforts or approach with little enthusiasm, imbued with despair. Yet, in all honorable disciplines, especially in sacred literature, the best things are the most clearly explained. For it cannot be that anything obscure comes from God Himself, who is truth and the clearest light. All obscurity and difficulty in divine matters arise from us, that is, from our laziness, then from neglect of idioms and figures of speech, and finally from not observing the context of the discourse. Our laziness makes us knock less eagerly at the doors of divine wisdom. Yet, if anyone lacked understanding, according to the apostle's word, it should have been asked of God without ceasing. But neglect of figures of speech and languages makes the simplest expressions seem perplexing, even monstrous. In this matter, no one can sufficiently explain how superstitiously we seek a knot in a bulrush. Moreover, if the thread of the discourse is not held, it is no wonder if the writings of prophets and apostles, indeed even the most eloquent rhetoricians, seem to be the ravings of fanatics, into whose meaning no one can penetrate. Indeed, Paul's epistle to the Romans is the richest testimony of this matter. For although the Christian school has never had anything better, nothing more polished, simpler, or purer, since the entire power of the gospel is explained not so much copiously as clearly, it has nevertheless come to be considered difficult, so much so that there are those who do not read it and believe it cannot be rightly understood by anyone. As if the Holy Spirit had proposed some Boeotian riddles to the world. Yet they have brought this obscurity and despair upon themselves through their own fault, laziness, and neglect. For as one rightly said: "You carry this night with you. You complain that the author is thorny, but your feet have thorns, not the place. You are in the sun, and the light itself is darkness to your night-owl eyes." For who, I ask, would find it credible that the apostle, who wished to benefit all, especially the unlearned, with hands, as they say, both feet, voice, and pen, was of an Aristotelian, that is, cunning, deceitful, and envious mind? For he wrote to Alexander the Great, who was angry that he had published esoteric books, that they were indeed published and not published, for no one would understand them unless they had heard him. Rather, it is most certain that the apostle Paul adapted the character of his speech to the churches, as he was a debtor to both the learned and the unlearned, and thus wrote learnedly and clearly, but in his own manner and idiom. Even if this is now new to us, it was very well known in those ages and was indeed a completely ecclesiastical and common style of speaking.</p>
      <p>We discuss these things more fully with you, dearest Berchtold, because of those who complain that we ineptly use rhetoric and grammar in sacred matters, whenever we observe the context of the discourse and examine the types of expressions to explain sacred things according to the common manner of speaking. These are utterly perverse people, who, if any light is brought to their obscure minds, prefer trifles to plain things. For they reject simplicity in sacred matters and, with a certain perverse opinion, believe that no one truly theologizes unless they tear apart things simply said with many and various meanings and entangle them in a marvelous way, discussing religion so thornily and intricately that not even they themselves understand. This foolishness, that finally is the impulse of a stunned mind, is to them the illuminated spirit. They say we use rhetoric in sacred matters and seek the canons of orators, namely τὸν ἐν ψακῇ μύρον. But they do not see that the manner and custom of speaking is not sought from the precepts of rhetoricians, but the precepts from the diligently observed natural manner of speaking. For if they saw this, they would soon understand that those who observe the context of the discourse in sacred matters do not observe canons, but the natural manner of speaking, without which no one will successfully engage with authors, both profane and sacred. Nor are we the first to observe these things in sacred matters or to teach that they should be observed. For Saint Jerome has handed down many things of this kind in the exposition of the prophets. Aurelius Augustine, the most eminent of theologians from ancient times, also wrote a book on Expressions. In his work On Christian Doctrine, book 4, chapter 6, he says: "I could, if I had the time, show all the virtues and ornaments of eloquence in the sacred writings," etc. But we do not seek embellishments, paints, Demosthenic or Ciceronian eloquence, but pure and clear simplicity, speaking not at all from the common, but from the pure custom of speaking. This, my dear Berchtold, I explain with this commentary of mine to the eyes of students with what they call 'crass Minerva,' so that there is nothing that deters candidates of more sincere theology from the most holy author and the best and no less necessary work. Nor am I unaware that there are not a few commentaries on this from both ancient and recent times, which are so far from being despised by us that we use their works more, wherever necessary. For it is most shameful, especially for young people, to peck out the eyes of crows. Meanwhile, who, I ask, forbids individuals to prophesy? They wrote for the learned, I for the unlearned and the mediocre. The Almighty has various instruments in His church, which He uses for the glory of His name and the instruction of His church. There are also various gifts of the Holy Spirit. For God has given all things to all for edification, but not all to anyone.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I propose these things of ours to be judged for the glory of God's name and the advancement of His church, indicating most simply the figures of speech and the context of the discourse, which are not the least cause of obscurity, with thanksgiving to be given if something better is revealed to another. These things, however, whatever they may be, I dedicate to you, Berchtold, so that you may share with me the arrows of slanderers, as you have been the greatest cause of this work of mine. Meanwhile, continue, as you do, in the Lord's work, so that you, who first announced the word of the Lord to the renowned city of Bern, may fight the good fight to the end.</p>
