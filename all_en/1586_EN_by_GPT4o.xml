      <p>Greetings and grace from the Lord. I have nothing new to write, my father, and if I had anything, I would prefer you to learn it from Mr. Calvin rather than from my letters. I am truly glad that he has undertaken this journey, and I do not doubt that the spirit of the Lord has driven him here so that you may discuss the most serious and sacred matters in person. As soon as you understand what they are, I seem to see with what expression you will receive him, and with what eagerness and great mental effort you will handle this entire matter before your most excellent and upright council. Therefore, it is not at all necessary for me to add even a single word. I only say that if the circumstances of our school had allowed it, nothing could have happened to me at this time more pleasing and delightful than this one journey: and so, although absent in body, I will be with you in spirit and thought. May the Lord Jesus grant that such pious and holy efforts may soon bring some fruit to the whole church. The hearts of kings are in your hand, Lord: may you finally bend them so that they may seriously acknowledge you as the supreme King of kings. But if that cannot yet be obtained from you, who have established times and moments, at least may you ensure that, until you decide otherwise, your church may breathe a little, and that tyrants, even unwittingly, may serve you by chance. This I ponder with myself, my father, and with you too, if I am not mistaken, and I truly believe it will be so.</p>
      <p>I sent you that little book of yours long ago, translated into French, and I wish to know whether you have received it. All of ours send you their precise greetings. Moreover, my wife specifically asked me to greet you and your most excellent wife along with your entire family in her name, which I promised to do. Behold, I fulfill my promise, and I also commend myself to you, my father, and to your prayers and those of all the brothers. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you. Lausanne, 5th of the Nones of March. Théodore de Bèze, truly yours.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
