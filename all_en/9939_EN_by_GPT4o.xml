      <p>S. Because I write more frequently to my brother, I write less often to you, most esteemed lord and relative; for I know that you share everything in common. Nevertheless, I thank you for your response regarding Schmidel; it was excellently crafted. I also thank you for making honorable mention of me in your preface and of my calling to the Augsburg church. It would be surprising if those idle men dare to oppose themselves henceforth.</p>
      <p>We hear that the Palatinate is planning to hold a certain synod in Frankfurt; may it not give rise to greater disturbances!</p>
      <p>I have nothing new from France at the moment; we are waiting to see what our envoys will accomplish. Meanwhile, our Coligny has set out for Geneva, but will soon return here.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, this noble baron from Kunewitz, baron in Ostra, wishes to be commended to you. He spent some time in Lausanne and, together with a certain prince, stood as godfather to my son at his baptism. He is traveling to Italy; in passing, he also wishes to see and speak with you, especially. He is a learned, pious, and well-educated young man and has an honorable company with him. Due to the illness that attacked me again after the Easter festival, I was able to do less for him than I would have liked; I pray that you will have him recommended. As for my affairs, I think they will undergo some change due to the recurrence of this illness. The lords see how difficult it is for me to perform my duties, even when I seem to be in good health; some of the brothers are also weary of having to bear my labors for so long. Therefore, some remedy must be sought to address these matters, and there is no more immediate one than for me to resign my ministry and for another to be appointed in my place. I have begun to discuss this matter with my brothers and will also discuss it with the lords after I have used the mature advice of friends; in the meantime, I would gladly hear your counsel as well. There are many other things that move me to do this, about which I have written a little to my brother; for not everything is to be written. I pray to the Lord to assist the church, which has enjoyed good peace under my ministry, and to continue to extend that peace. I will write more about these matters another time. Now, farewell and greet all yours, who are also ours, in my name. Our people also greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 21, 1575.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>After I wrote the above, Baron la SerrannÄ™ brought me your letters. I am glad that his brother has been received by Mr. Gwalther, and I thank you for your efforts. I will communicate the news to the lords; however, neither of those you mentioned is currently in the city. I thank you for these things.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I cannot refrain from sending you those Aphorisms of our Hasler, in which he tries to prove from Aristotle that he rightly understood the unity and trinity of God; he wants to clear himself so that we believe he also thinks rightly. But what is more foolish than to seek such things in Aristotle? I send them at least so that you may see some specimen of his arrogant mind and so that I may understand what you think of such a philosopher. I fear that more serious disturbances may arise in this church because of this man; for with such charms, he bewilders the minds of the chief lords, so that they are convinced that there is nothing more learned than this man anywhere, and he also has supporters among the ministers; but all who are more learned and know something strongly abhor his mind.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, my singularly esteemed lord, relative, and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
      <p>"Hasler's Theses. Mr. Haller's confirmation in office anew and freedom."</p>
