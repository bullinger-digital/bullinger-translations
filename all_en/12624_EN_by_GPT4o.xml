    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer thanks Bullinger for his letter [not received] and hopes that his letter delivered by [...] Armbruster [No. 2572] has also arrived safely. However, Armbruster only set off [to Zurich] yesterday. On September 6, the council of Konstanz sent news to the people of Zurich. Blarer has nothing new to report [since then]. He often lacks messengers. However, he does his best.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Unlike Bullinger, Blarer has neither heard nor can he believe that some [Schmalkaldic League members] would unconditionally agree to a peace [with Emperor Charles V]. At most, Blarer would do his part to prevent such a thing. There are already weak ones who fear for their skin. But the brave would sacrifice everything for the sake of freedom and salvation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- What Blarer wrote about [Leonhard Holzhalb], the [new] governor of Frauenfeld, [with enclosure A], should not be to his disadvantage! It is certain that [Holzhalb] protects the Jews and has advocated for their [temporary] admission to Güttingen with a letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The council of Konstanz received news the evening before, which Blarer could not yet learn because today the market and the church festival are taking place in Konstanz and everyone is very busy. The news will certainly be forwarded to the Zurich council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Things are not going well for the [Schmalkaldic League]! Perhaps it must be so, so that any victory can be attributed solely to God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Some of the chamber councilors in Ulm seem more inclined towards the enemy than the [Schmalkaldic League]; for example, the Augsburg [chamber councilor Konrad] Hel, whom they otherwise do not trust and yet have now entrusted with important tasks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The warning about [a possible recapture] of the Klause [Ehrenberg by the Imperial forces] has been ignored. In Ulm, some chamber councilors [of the Schmalkaldic League] even bet 100 guilders that [Francesco di] Castellalto could be found somewhere. And even if he were found, the matter was not considered urgent, especially since [the Schmalkaldic League's capture of the Klause] was achieved with only a few soldiers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Certainly, a lot of effort is being made! But only a few actions follow! If Blarer could not count on God, he would have reason to despair, for it is hardly believable how negligently things are being handled! Nevertheless, it is believed that God will turn everything for the good, even if one must pay for the omissions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Blarer is pleased that the people of Zurich are also sending preachers to Augsburg. The people of Konstanz would provide more if they themselves were not lacking pastors. After all, they have sent three: [Johannes Schnell] to Sonthofen, [Johannes Jung] to Leutkirch, and one [Martin Wetzler] with the Konstanz soldiers. May God send more laborers for his harvest!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Bullinger should pray for everyone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- [P.S.:] Blarer returns the Lage F [correct: f] of Bullinger's commentary on John [correct: commentary on Luke], which he received in duplicate.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- [Enclosure:] Blarer did not get around to forwarding [Bullinger's] letters to Augsburg, but will do so the following day. It is important that everyone learns of Bullinger's report on the mercury. The [people of Konstanz] have [indeed] received reliable news that the Pope has ordered the poisoning of wells. May God soon put an end to this evil deed!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- [Enclosure A:] Shortly before the day in Baden, the [Konstanz] bishop [Johann von Weeze] moved from Meersburg with his resident Jews to Güttingen in Thurgau. The Jews stayed there while the bishop retreated to his castle in Arbon. However, the population does not want to grant the Jews accommodation. The latter, however, managed to have the new governor [Holzhalb] request permission for their stay in Thurgau at the assembly in Baden. When this was granted, he wrote to the people of Güttingen that he did not want to impose the Jews on them, but would be greatly pleased if they were accepted. One of the Jews [...] later recounted how the governor received a silver cup as a gift for this. This greatly damages his reputation! The Jews have indeed moved back to Meersburg with their belongings, but said they would soon return to Güttingen. It would be appropriate if the Zurich council ensured that the Confederates did not begin to provide shelter to the despisers of Christ! Not only are there already enough baptized Jews! What if, in addition, the unbaptized corrupted the baptized! Blarer felt obliged to report this matter to Bullinger. However, for weighty reasons, the source of this information should not be revealed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- It is also reported that the new governor [of Thurgau] had himself led to Münsterlingen with drummers and pipers. There, violinists joined in, playing music because the governor wanted to have the girls dance on this occasion. The old guild master [Thomas] Hütlin, exiled from Konstanz, led the dance. Even if some claim that everything was conducted honorably, this causes a scandal, especially since the governor comes from Zurich, dancing has not been done in Münsterlingen for a long time, and the times are certainly not suitable for dancing! The governor of Münsterlingen, [Martin Trösch] from Uri, in any case, did not let his daughters dance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- [Enclosure B:] A citizen of Konstanz [...] testifies to having read the governor's letter [to Güttingen]. From this, it appears that the Jews from Meersburg were allowed to stay in Thurgau during the governor's two-year term.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Additionally, a boatman from Meersburg [...] told a citizen of Konstanz [...] that the Jews had given the governor 100 crowns as a gift. This creates much suspicion, even if Blarer doubts the rumor. However, the story with the silver [cup] is likely true, as an honest man [...] learned this from a Jew [...] himself.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Especially trusted, dear lord and brother, I have received your letter. I hope that mine has also reached you, dated the 6th or 7th of September, by Armbruster (whom I thought had moved on Tuesday afternoon, but I hear he only left yesterday, Tuesday). However, I know nothing else; for my lords have postponed all dealings with yours until Monday. I often lack messengers, as I mentioned before; otherwise, it would not be my fault. You mention that some of ours would like peace, which I truly have never heard a word of. I also cannot believe it. People are, moreover, always eager everywhere, even if the matter does not look good; for they hope that the best will be found later. Nevertheless, you did well to remind them. For I myself, as far as possible, will strive that they do not contemplate or accept any peace on such unjust terms.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Many people are weak. If it were up to them, it would be feared they would look far and wide before they stretch out their rogue hides. But noble spirits will risk their property, life, and everything, and even lose them sooner than their freedom and solid salvation, which would be entirely at stake if the adversaries gained control.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>What I wrote about the proconsul of Gynopedia, see that it does not harm me! He certainly advocates excellently for the Jews. Whatever he defends, it is certain that Guttingen wrote that whoever shelters them does him a service and favor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I think my lords also received some news last night. I truly do not know what. But I think they will write to yours. Today is market day here and the church festival in Konstanz, so everyone has much to do, and I have not been able to learn anything yet.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It seems carelessly on our side from a human perspective. But I believe God wants it that way, for He will direct the victory in such a way that we will have to thank Him and His hand for it. Otherwise, we are truly sold and betrayed!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>There are people in the chamber council in Ulm, where it is evident that they wish the enemy better than us, and especially those from Augsburg have Doctor Hel sitting there, whom they themselves do not trust in other matters. He must help handle all these great, important things and blinds other people.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>There was timely warning about the Klause; but everything had to be in vain. And some of the chamber councilors in Ulm, who discussed everything, completely dismissed it and said they would bet 100 guilders that Castellalto was nowhere to be found. Otherwise, it would not have been necessary. They took the enemy's artillery with them, even though they had only a few people.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Oh, this thing goes far! People warn, shout, write enough here and there, but truly, truly, if I did not place the game in the wonderful hand of God and direct my trust solely to Him, I and many other honest men would have to despair entirely according to all human actions that are being practiced. You could not believe how carelessly it is going. And yet everyone is generally well comforted in God. He will certainly have mercy on us and not let us be put to shame before this enemy. But the carelessness will punish itself, for we are ourselves guilty of the loss of great goods. And (Furthermore) one should not comb fools with clubs!</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>That you are going to send some ministers of the Gospel to Augsburg, it was a pleasure to read in your letters. We would also send more if our church had not long desired one or two more ministers. And yet we have sent three! One with our soldiers. Another to the village of Sonthofen. The third to Leutkirch. We must earnestly pray to the Lord of the harvest, that He Himself sends workers into His harvest.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Pray for us, my more than dearest and best Bullinger, that as the world threatens its own destruction more, we may strive with more confirmed spirits in full trust in the Lord of the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Greet your household with all friends and brothers. Ours greet you and commend themselves to you respectfully. Farewell again. 10th of September 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I send F of your commentaries on John, for I do not know by whose imprudence the book you sent was duplicated. However, it may be that someone else desires what is redundant for me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>I will send the letters to Augsburg tomorrow, as I could not today. What you indicate about Mercury (Quicksilver) is worthy for everyone to know. There are certainly reports coming to us that the Pope has ordered the poisoning of the wells. May God soon put an end to this murderous villainy!</p>

    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Know, dear lord and friend, that shortly before the day held in Baden, our bishop of Meersburg, along with his Jews whom he maintained there, fled to Güttingen in Thurgau with all their possessions. Afterwards, the bishop moved to his castle in Arbon, but the Jews remained in Güttingen. The common people were very dissatisfied. They thought the host should not be allowed to accommodate the Jews in this way. But they have intrigued so much through the new governor that he brought it to Baden, where they wanted to be, and it could be done. And the governor wrote to Güttingen that he would not impose them on anyone against their will, but if they stayed, it would do him a service. However, one Jew later let it be known that they had given the governor a silver-covered cup. This makes a bad reputation for him. For it is already rumored badly that he desires to shelter such public blasphemers of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Although they have now returned to Meersburg with their possessions, they have said they will return soon, etc. It would be good if the Jews were not sheltered in a Confederation and it was forbidden to the governor, if it can be achieved with your lords. There are now too many baptized Jews. We must not let the unbaptized also ruin ours. I did not want to withhold this good opinion from you with a request not to reveal to anyone that I have reported this to you. For there are many reasons why it is difficult for me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Also, the new governor came to Münsterlingen with drums and pipes. Fiddlers also came there. They played music. The governor wanted to have a dance with the girls, as there are no more dance women there. The governor of Münsterlingen, who is from Uri, was not well pleased. He did not want to let his daughters dance, etc. Our old guild master Hütlin, who is no longer allowed in the city, was also outside and promoted the dance. It caused great scandal, especially since the governor is from Zurich. They say the others were more honorable and serious. But you should not tell anyone. There has not been dancing there for a long time. Moreover, it is not dance weather now. It pains me deeply and other honorable people too, when such things happen under the name of Zurich, which is dear and valuable to us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>The Jews in Meersburg have obtained a freedom from the governor for two years, as long as his office lasts, that they may safely live and move in Thurgau during this time, etc. A good citizen here has read the letter. The letter also shows that he granted them such permission with the approval of the Confederates; which indicates that he freely requested it, as it was issued for his time.</p>
      <p>Also, a boatman from Meersburg told a citizen from here, whom he ferried over, that the Jews had given the governor 100 crowns as a gift. This brings much gossip and suspicion, although I do not believe it with the 100 crowns. But with the silverware, of which I wrote to you before, I know well that a Jew himself told an honest man, from whom I have it.</p>
