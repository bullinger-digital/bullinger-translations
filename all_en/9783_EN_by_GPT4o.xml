      <p>God be with us! Dear lord and brother, I thank you for sending me both descriptions, the Latin and the German. The Johannes Buchhorn, whom you mentioned in your German description, is a desolate, wicked fantasist, was a preacher in Thurgau, and as he could not do anything, he was recommended by the synod to be examined. When that happened, we found that he could do nothing at all. Nevertheless, he wanted to expel another brother and take his place, he ran away into the lands and caused unrest. Indeed, he managed to bring about so much that he had to be examined a second time, that is, a third time; he was always found to be Joannes in eodem. Yet he still wanted to be a preacher, but he failed. It is said of him that he dabbles in black arts, I do not know whether rightly or wrongly, and since he also took up medicine, he was contemptuously called Doctor FÃ¶tzli. He has otherwise troubled me greatly; I do not desire him, and the further away he is, the better. Some useless knowledge causing much trouble, etc. My lords elected last Wednesday my lord mayor Kammli as an envoy to ride to the new king with Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, to wish him well and to advocate for peace, so that the bloodshed may cease and peace may come to the empire. May God grant that the Confederates also send their envoys to such a Christian work, etc.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated August 27th in great haste.</p>
      <p>My dear brother-in-law Felix Keller has taken my dear godfather and now also brother-in-law Haller's daughter Verena; they will be married today. May God grant them happiness! And this marriage was arranged on my Verena Zwingli's wedding day, etc. 1574.</p>
      <p>Bullinger, yours.</p>
