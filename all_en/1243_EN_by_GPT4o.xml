      <p>Greetings in the Lord, dearest Bullinger. Everything is safe with us, although some predict ill of us. Satan shows himself in wondrous ways among the papists everywhere; yet they wish to remain blind and not learn Satan's cunning. You may ask: "What unusual thing has happened among your people?" Listen briefly. In the district of Sundgau, I have not yet been able to learn the name, there was a priest who, during the last week of Lent, led a woman, his godmother, into the sacristy, as they call it, pretending to confess her sins. She was detained there for a long time. The others were amazed at what the priest was doing with the woman in the closed place; someone peered through a crack and discovered the priest and the woman lying together and shouted: They are fornicating in the holy place. Everyone left the temple astounded by the disgraceful thing that had happened. The bishop learned of the matter, took the priest away, and threw him into prison in the town of Altkirch, punishing the man with bread and water so that he would be more cautious in hearing confessions. Why does the bishop not get rid of that scoundrel? More on this when the matter is more thoroughly known; but what I have written is very true.</p>
      <p>I would have many other things to pour into your bosom about the betrayals of the gospel if I had a reliable messenger to whom I could safely entrust them. They say Mr. von Heideck is in Rappoltsweiler and has been received into the favor of the Emperor and Ferdinand.</p>
      <p>The brother of the treasurer of Strasbourg was there, I do not know what he is doing there. May the Lord preserve us from wicked men.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Basel, April 12, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius, hastily at nightfall.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear, gracious lord. Zurich.</p>
