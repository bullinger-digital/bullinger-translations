      <p>Greetings. I received your letter at this hour, and since your messenger is set to depart again tomorrow morning, I wish to send these few words promptly. First of all, I express my utmost gratitude to you for sharing the letters of Lord Martyr; you are doing a most pleasing service not only to me but also to our entire republic, and you will continue to do so if you share any further writings he may produce. Almost everything aligns with what I recently wrote to you myself.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we have received no other news, except for the confirmed reports that while these events are unfolding at court, a severe uprising has erupted in Aquitaine, and our people, having formed a procession, are plundering temples far and wide, toppling idols, and violently reforming everything. There is great fear, therefore, that this untimely zeal may pose a significant obstacle to our common cause, which, however, may the Lord avert! There is a certain noble Frenchman here today, a prudent and wise man, who has requested permission from the senate to travel to France (for he has lived in our domain for some time). He asserts that Beza is not bringing very favorable news from Geneva and fears, indeed foresees, that the matter will end in a tragic outcome, and therefore he wishes to go there to assist his endangered people in whatever way he can. However, may the Lord, for whom nothing is impossible and who holds the hearts of kings in His hand, guide everything to a better end! What your messenger has brought, I do not yet know. We hear that the confederates are again causing unrest against the Glarus people; may the Lord restrain them! Our people are very restless and are keeping watch as much as they can. In Italy, it is certain that there are Spanish troops.</p>
      <p>What will happen, however, is not yet known for certain. That Vilnius man passed through us; I greatly fear for those churches because of that heretical rabble, and because the pious themselves do not seem to be sufficiently united, but are causing divisions over trivial matters. Diesbach has not yet returned; however, he sent to me these letters pertaining to you, which you will find enclosed with mine. He promptly forwarded your letters, which you had written to him about Rhaetian and Italian matters, to our senate. I have nothing else to write at the moment.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their greetings to you in return.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to yours as well, especially to those belonging to your household.</p>
      <p>I received the letters of D. Gwalther sent through the Vilnius man, to which I have nothing to respond at the moment; greet him very much in my name. Bern, October 4th, at nightfall, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, as much as I am, Johannes Haller. To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
