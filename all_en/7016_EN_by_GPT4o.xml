      <p>We have most gladly received your learned letters to Humphrey and Sampson, which are most suitable for settling both our disputes about vestments and the verbal altercations and battles of our minds. We have ensured that they were printed and published, not without careful consideration, while sparing the names of the brothers, and from this we have indeed received the most abundant fruit, as we hoped. For they have greatly benefited the sound men who look at the whole evangelical institution and its end. They have certainly persuaded some ministers, who were thinking of abandoning the ministry because of the matter of vestments, which was the only controversy and cause of dissension among us, not to allow the churches to be deprived of their work for such a trivial matter. They have confirmed and brought them back to your opinion, and they have calmed and soothed the people, who were stirred up by the importunate cries of some and were being divided into various factions and were insulting pious ministers, with a certain concord and temperance. However, they have not satisfied the morose ones, who can bear nothing except what they themselves have decided, but they have benefited them to the extent that they are less willing or able to revile the pious with insults and to boldly defile the church's salutary peace with their foolish speeches. We confess and lament that some of these have been deposed, even if it is their own fault, so that we do not say more serious things against them. But we think it should be borne with a more equitable mind that they are not many but few, and although they are pious, they are certainly not very learned. For only Sampson among those who have been deposed is to be considered both pious and learned: Humphrey and all the more learned ones remain in their position so far. If your letter had been printed and published, so that those who deposed would be confirmed; if those who were deposed were thrown down from their position because of other articles controversial among us, and not for the matter of vestments alone; if finally that letter, which so exquisitely and clearly handles the sole controversy of vestments that it cannot be transferred to another, were to be used to approve articles unknown to you, not yet controversial among us by the grace of God, (for no articles have come into contention with the brothers among us so far, except this one about vestments,) it would indeed have been an injury done to you, whom we love, honor, and revere in the Lord: just as a clear calumny has been applied to us by those who were the authors of the most vain rumor, by which it was brought to us that ministers of the church are required to subscribe to some new articles or to resign their position.</p>
      <p>The sum of our controversy is this: we hold that the ministers of the Anglican Church can use the distinction of vestments without impiety, as prescribed by public authority, both in sacred administration and in external use; especially since they are proposed as indifferent things, ordered to be used only for the sake of order and due obedience to the laws, and every opinion of superstition, worship, and necessity, as far as it pertains to consciences, is removed, rejected, and utterly condemned by the prescription of the laws themselves and the assiduous preaching of purer doctrine. They, on the other hand, loudly proclaim that these vestments are by no means to be ascribed to the number of indifferent things, that they are impious, papistical, and idolatrous; and therefore all the pious should with one consent rather resign from the ministry than serve the church with these papistical rags, (as they speak,) although we have the utmost liberty to preach the most sincere doctrine and to accuse, attack, and condemn all errors or abuses, whether in rites, doctrine, sacraments, or morals, through sound doctrine. We cannot accept this immature counsel of theirs; nor should we bear their impetuous exhortations, by which they continually disturb the peace of the church from the pulpit and bring our entire religion into danger. For we have experienced too much, alas, that by such exhortations the mind of the most serene queen, otherwise inclined to deserve well of religion, is irritated; and we know for certain that the minds of some nobles, to say nothing of others, are wounded, weakened, and alienated by these things.</p>
      <p>Who can doubt that the papists, having seized such an opportunity, will spew out their most pestilent venom against the gospel of Jesus Christ and all its professors, hoping that they now have the opportunity to recover their lost Helen? If we were to heedlessly acquiesce to the counsel of our own, so that we all with united forces make an attack on the vestments established by law against the law, destroy them, and utterly abolish them, or all at once lay down our duties; we would indeed have a papistical, or at least a Lutheran-papistical, ministry, or none at all. But we testify to God, the best and greatest, honorable brothers in Christ, that this dissension has not happened through our fault, nor does it depend on us that such vestments are not removed; indeed, we can most solemnly swear that we have hitherto labored with as much zeal, faith, and diligence as we could, to achieve what the brothers demand and we desire. But being brought into such straits, what is to be done, (we leave many things to you, who are prudent and keen to perceive the dangers impending over the churches, to conjecture,) except that when we cannot do what we would like, we should in the Lord will what we can?</p>
      <p>So far we have explained the matter of controversy and full of dissension among us as it stands. Now, however, receive what remains. That rumor is entirely false, if it should even be called a rumor, (for we know your prudence and modesty, and we praise it,) about the reception, subscription, and approval of the new articles you enumerate; nor are those who have tried to deceive you with this pretext, either by their written letters or in person, more truthful. For most of these articles are falsely imputed to us: very few are received: none of these are imposed on the brothers to be approved by their subscription. We do not affirm that figured singing in churches, along with the noise of organs, should be retained, indeed, as is fitting, we attack it. The Anglican Church has entirely lost the foreign language, exsufflations, exorcisms, oil, spittle, mud, lighted candles, and other things of that kind, never to be recalled by the prescription of the laws.</p>
      <p>We in no way at all agree that women can or should baptize infants. In the reception of the Lord's Supper, the laws command, and usage confirms, that the bread is commonly broken for each communicant, not inserted into the mouth but handed over into the hands, and the manner of spiritual eating and the presence of the body of Christ in the sacred supper is explained. Our Anglo-Louvainese detractors testify to this in their nefarious writings. The wives of ministers are not kept away from their husbands; they cohabit, and their marriage is held honorable among all (we always except the papists). Finally, it is no less false what they bark, that all the power of ecclesiastical governance is in the hands of the bishops alone, although we do not deny that the primacy is given to them. For in such ecclesiastical matters it is customary to deliberate in synod; the synod is convened by royal edict at the time when the parliament of the whole kingdom, as it is called, is held.</p>
      <p>The bishops are present, and also the more learned pastors of the whole province, who are three times more numerous than the bishops. They deliberate separately from the bishops on ecclesiastical matters, and nothing is established or defined in the synod without their common consent and approval, or at least that of the greater part of them: so far is it from being the case that pastors are not allowed to express their opinion in such ecclesiastical matters.</p>
      <p>We indeed receive, or rather tolerate, until the Lord gives better things, the interrogations of infants, and the sign of the cross in baptism, kneeling in the reception of the supper, and the royal court of faculties, which they call the metropolitan's. We publicly profess and diligently teach that such questions are not very suitably proposed to infants, even if they seem to be borrowed from Augustine.</p>
      <p>We do not defend marking the forehead of the already baptized infant with the sign of the cross, even if the minister openly professes in set words that the infant is marked with the cross only as a sign that he will not be ashamed of the faith of the crucified Christ in the future, and even if it seems to be taken from the more ancient church. We permit kneeling in the reception of the sacred supper, since it is so constituted by law, with that explanation or rather caution, which the authors of kneeling themselves, most holy men and most constant martyrs of Jesus Christ, have applied, most diligently declared, promulgated, and inculcated to the people. Which has these words: "Although it is established in the book of prayers that communicants should receive the sacred communion kneeling, it should not be drawn from this that any adoration is made or should be made, either to the sacramental bread and wine, or to the real and essential presence of the natural body and blood of Christ existing there. For the sacramental bread and wine remain in their own natural substances, and therefore are not to be adored. For that would be horrible idolatry, to be detested by all Christians; and as for the natural body and blood of our Savior Christ, they are in heaven, and are not here, since it is against the truth of the true natural body of Christ to be in more than one place at one and the same time."</p>
      <p>The court of faculties, wherever it is brought from, is royal, not metropolitan. For that prudent father, learned and most well-disposed to propagate the most sincere religion, very much desires, strives, and endeavors to wash away all Roman dregs completely. And although we cannot remove all the abuses of this fiscal court, as well as some others, we do not cease to criticize them, pursue them with insults, and thrust them down to Tartarus, whence they have crept out. Believe us, venerable brothers, it is permitted to each minister to contradict all such articles with modesty and sobriety both privately and publicly: indeed, we do not deject pastors unwilling to receive or approve these articles falsely imposed on us from their position.</p>
      <p>Therefore, continue to love us, admonish us, help us, so that the fire kindled among us solely for the matter of vestments may be extinguished. And we will strive, as far as possible, as we did in the last parliament, although we could obtain nothing, that all errors and abuses may be corrected, amended, and purged according to the rule of the word of God. We commend you, brothers, to the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom we pray to keep you and your churches safe and in peace for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers and colleagues in Zürich in our name.</p>
      <p>London, February 6, in the year of our Lord 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours most lovingly, Edmund of London, Robert of Winchester.</p>
      <p>I also beseech you, brothers most esteemed by me, to forgive me for not having responded to your letters, written to me privately, until now, nor having returned any thanks for your most learned commentaries sent to me. Nor should Wolvius and Lavater, whom I ask you to greet very much in my name and excuse me to them, take this amiss. For I know that the reason of my duty has demanded this very thing; and I do not doubt that you and they have desired my letters. I will ensure that I satisfy you all by writing in the future, and I will not fail in my duty. Also, say hello from me, I pray, to Mr. Simler, Zwingli, and Haller. Live and farewell in Christ.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Robert of Winchester.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished men, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger and Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, most faithful pastors of the church in Zürich.</p>
