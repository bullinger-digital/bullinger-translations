      <p>S. I have no doubt, most excellent man, that the letters I sent to you at the last Frankfurt market through your printer have long been delivered to you, and because your kindness towards me and your diligence in writing have been sufficiently evident to me before, I can tolerate your silence for this half-year with a calmer and more peaceful mind. And indeed, I can do so more easily because I know that not a single person, with whom you could have conveniently responded, has come from you to us this summer. Lord MÃ¼nster wrote to me from Basel with a certain student from Livonia; when I asked him, he said he had not been in Zurich. However, since I could conveniently write at this time as well, I preferred to send you two letters, even without having received a response to the previous ones, rather than neglect such an opportunity.</p>
      <p>In my last letters, I indicated what great disturbances Osiander is causing in Prussia and how horrendous and pernicious the madness he spreads everywhere about essential righteousness is, and I asked you, as well as Lord Pellican and Lord Bibliander, to briefly and clearly explain your opinion on this article to me. Because this has perhaps been delayed due to a lack of messengers and Osiander has not yet ceased, indeed he presses his diabolical monstrosities and fantastic imaginations more and more, I still ask that you either publicly (which I especially desire) express your church's opinion on this matter in some writing or write to me privately about it.</p>
      <p>For Osiander does not hesitate to boast that he is the only one who can rightly explain this article on the justification of man; he claims that all others cannot even understand it correctly, let alone express their opinion. See, I ask you, the arrogance and impudence of the most shameless theologian. A pious and learned man from Prussia recently wrote to me that he completely rejects and tramples on the merit of Christ, saying, "It is not done by the seed of the woman" (these are his words), "it is not done by the seed of Abraham nor the seed of David, but God must do it," and openly denying imputation, he says that we are made righteous and accepted before God by the essential righteousness of Christ. He has a supporter in Johann Funck, who, in a public debate in the presence of the Prince of Prussia, proposed this argument to confirm Osiander's opinion: Works do not justify; the passion of Christ is a work; therefore, the passion of Christ does not justify, and consequently, we are justified by the essential righteousness of God, etc. I could report more, but this is the summary of the entire debate. Our church and all others throughout Germany, which embrace the doctrine taught in our church, namely in Wittenberg, utterly detest Osiander's opinion, as their letters and writings, now publicly published, testify. Therefore, so that all good people may see that your church also dissents from those most absurd fabrications and monstrous errors, I earnestly wish for something to be published by you, so that the insolence of that proud, dizzy spirit may be curbed by your writings and his mouth may be shut by your authority. This matter will move many to embrace simple truth and flee from those new monstrosities of opinions and errors. For even if there is no hope that Osiander with his Scintilla and other followers will yield to the truth, because it is impossible to suppress a heretical mouth forever, it is nevertheless very necessary to counter their madness for the sake of many others and to draw and free doubtful minds, deceived by some plausible appearance, from their false doctrines. This will be pleasing to God and to all the pious, who abhor such deceptions and love and embrace simple truth.</p>
      <p>I heard that Dr. Vadian collected a certain refutation of Osiander's arguments and departed from this life in the middle of the work. I certainly regret that such a pious endeavor was hindered and I ask you, with your singular learning and wisdom, to undertake this labor and to encourage your colleagues as well, so that they may wish to gratify not only me but the whole church in this matter.</p>
      <p>We have no news here except what the Magdeburg war supplies us with, the whole sum of which is that a great multitude of people is being miserably slaughtered on both sides and no end is yet in sight. Besides this evil, famine and a horrendous plague threaten us. May God, who is the guardian of his church, alleviate these and other hardships and, for the sake of his son, mitigate them and in his wrath also remember his mercy and not unleash his entire wrath. Amen. If you have any news about the council along with the state of your church and republic, as much as I need to know, I ask you to write to me diligently.</p>
      <p>With Dr. Pellican and Dr. Bibliander, you will accurately excuse my silence; for I was absent from here for several days, and when I returned, it was announced that the booksellers would leave early the next morning. You will greet them reverently in my name and urge a response to my last letters, especially concerning the matter of Osiander. Farewell, most illustrious and kind Dr. Bullinger, and love me perpetually as you have begun.</p>
      <p>Wittenberg, on the very day of Bartholomew 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Erhard von Kunheim.</p>
      <p>Lelio Sozzini has departed from here to explore Poland and intends to return directly to his homeland from there.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and upright man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the people of Zurich, his lord and friend to be honored with perpetual fidelity. Zurich.</p>
      <p>Erhard Kunheim.</p>
