    <p xml:id="regest1">[Johannes] Haller conveys Bullinger's greetings, sent by letter; a testimony of Bullinger's sympathy for Birck! Furthermore, he was grateful for Bullinger's admonition [“Oratio de persecutione ecclesiae”?]. He, who is troubled by the scholastic inconveniences [of his colleagues], was strengthened by Bullinger's admonition.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Haller is enjoying increasing popularity among the [people of Augsburg], so that Zurich already enjoys a better reputation in Augsburg. Even [Haller's former] detractors are beginning to align themselves more closely with him.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, reverend father. Our Haller, whenever he receives letters from Zurich, is accustomed to convey your dutiful greetings to me. From this, I gather a certain singular benevolence of yours towards me. I thank you for your faithful exhortation, by which you often strengthen my spirit, wavering under scholastic troubles. Pray to the Lord, that He may supply the strength to endure them.</p>

      <p>Haller is becoming more and more pleasing to us because of those admirable gifts, which he has received most abundantly from the divine. The name of Zurich is already beginning to be heard better among our people because of him, which previously was heard by many not without offense. What is more, even his rivals are now beginning to join him more familiarly.</p>

      <p>Farewell to you, your family, and your church most happily. Augsburg, May 9. Convey my greetings in turn to the administrators of the schools and church.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your lordship, X. Betul.</p>
      <p>To the most holy and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, well-deserving Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and special friend.</p>
