    <p xml:id="regest1">So that Heim does not appear ungrateful, he would finally like to thank you for the gift of Bullinger's book "The Old Faith" [HBBibl I 102].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Furthermore, he recommends the young bearer [Paulus Blasius], especially since the schoolmasters and teachers of [Chur] believe that it is worthwhile to further educate this boy. Heim is also his rightful guardian and is in friendship with the father [Johannes]. Bullinger should have the boy placed with a scholar who examines him daily. The father will cover the costs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger and his family are commended to God.</p>

      <p>The grace of God be with us. Venerable, just, and well-learned Master Heinrich, so that I am not considered entirely ungrateful towards you (for the received gift of the little book, containing the explanation of the old faith, as well as many friendly and Christian greetings sent to me), I have deemed it appropriate to thank you once again with this letter, with the assurance that if I could be of service to you or yours, I would be entirely willing and eager, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Furthermore, I earnestly request of you to commend this boy, the bearer of this letter, to your care. For he is, as our schoolmasters and teachers consider, worthy of being helped and furthered in learning, in the hope that he will, in due time, fulfill our expectations; therefore, I am not reluctant to take responsibility for him, firstly because I am his rightful guardian, secondly because his father has been related to me with true Christian love for a long time, etc. Now I desire nothing else than that the boy might be placed with a learned man, who exercises him daily, with your help, and whatever is necessary for this, the father will promise and pay for him. In all goodness, to repay you, you will always find me willing and eager, etc.</p>

      <p>Herewith, you and your entire household are faithfully commended to God the Lord; may He preserve you with His grace for a long time in His church. Amen.</p>
      <p>In Chur, on April 26, 1546.</p>
      <p>Luci Heim, mayor, your always entirely willing.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, just, and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the Christian church in Zurich in the word of the Lord, this letter is addressed.</p>
