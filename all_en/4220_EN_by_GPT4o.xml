      <p>For almost a month and a half, I spent time at Griessenberg with my most delightful sister due to business matters that needed to be completed. From there, on the nineteenth of February, I sent you a rather long letter, which I believe you received through the diligence of our Conrad HÃ¶uw via a certain courier named Augustin. Since I returned here the day before yesterday, I wanted to be informed by you about what you think should be done regarding the matter of Burcher, the Englishman, which involves my sister, as he is preparing to leave, lest, heaven forbid, his departure should be a disadvantage to my sister.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will do the duty of a friend in your usual manner and, as soon as possible, inform me of what you have done here or what you think my sister should do, so that we may soon decide what further action is necessary. Upon returning here, I found letters sent by friends, in which there is nothing so new that you have not already learned. Calvin writes that he is afflicted with continuous illnesses, one following another; he is compelled to spend a good part of his time lying down and therefore will have to give up his studies unless the mildness of spring provides him some relief; he is troubled by the weakness of his legs, but more so by the distressing weakness of his stomach. He adds that he was recently almost suffocated by a large flow of blood from his lungs.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore commend, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, this excellent servant and valiant soldier of Jesus Christ to the Lord, that He may preserve him vigorous and healthy for His church for as long as possible, and thus take the entire church of Geneva, which has been undeservedly exposed to so many dangers, under His protection, especially since we too will soon be in the same boat. Ah, let us be vigilant, let us pray, and thus gather strength to withstand the many temptations and struggles that also await us. Farewell, my heart and soul, in the Lord, and assist me with the perpetual prayers of the pious before our heavenly Father. Convey my greetings to your household in my words, may all the brothers, your fellow ministers, Gwalther, Wolf, Theodor, and especially the incomparable martyr of Christ, Peter, be well. Would that he could fully restore England and make it truly angelic again; but I fear that due to his age and other dangers of the body and journey, he may not be able to do so, and perhaps it is better that he, having already found his Sparta among you, as he began,... and.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Winterthur, 5th day before the calends of March 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, his brother, as venerable as he is dearly beloved.</p>
