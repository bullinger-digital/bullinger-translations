      <p>Greetings. Our Wilhelm, so persuaded by his wife and mother-in-law, most esteemed Lord Bullinger and dearest brother to my heart, believed that childbirth was imminent; thus, he has delayed his journey to you until now. However, since the birth is so long postponed, he is coming to you; yet he could not obtain the testimony without greater expenses, as no ordinary meetings are currently held and extraordinary ones must be purchased. Therefore, to avoid any suspicion that his affairs are not in order, I decided to write these few lines. I believe, however, that he will obtain the testimony in due time, with which you will be satisfied. He set out without testimony at my urging; for the longer he lingered here, the more his foreign debt increased, as he has nothing to sustain himself. We do not consider that you have received him into favor and assisted his need due to our intercession, as if you had not bestowed this benefit upon him. But our brother Mr. Brandmüller has already (unless I am mistaken) thanked you. We are led by good hope, as charity commands, that he, having been troubled and tested by various and many evils, will become more prudent and corrected in the future. Whom you have once begun to help, you will not allow to be endangered again. Therefore, I do not need to say more on this matter. I will write the rest (God willing) not long after to Mr. Wolfgang Haller; for these were written hastily, as I was held up by other business. You, my venerable lord and beloved brother, take this kindly.</p>
      <p>Those whom you greeted here, Dr. Wyssenburg and (who is not very well) Dr. Oporinus, wish to be most lovingly greeted in return. I beseech you, in my words, to greet all the lords and brothers. May Christ preserve you with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 21, in the year of human salvation 1568. Entirely yours from the heart, Johannes Hospinian.</p>
      <p>To the wisest and best theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and brother to be kept perpetually in sight.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
