      <p>When the nephew of Paolo Vergerio came here and stated that he was returning to Zürich, I thought it my duty to greet you with my letter and to ask you or Konrad Gessner for the form of the privilege for the book on animals; for I have already indicated in two letters what happened in this matter, that is, the secretary, who had it in his orders from the king to expedite it, gave it to his son-in-law, who held the same office. However, when some of my people asked the son-in-law for the expedition due to the absence of the former secretary, called Bochelet, I could not find the form of the privilege; therefore, as I wrote to you, it is necessary for Gessner to send me again a brief or summary of the privilege similar to the one he sent me, and I will ensure it is expedited immediately. I came here to rest for a few days; for I am burdened with such great and serious matters that I can hardly breathe, and if good men had not dissuaded me, I would have already renounced this legation; for not only are Swiss matters entrusted to me, but also Italian, German, and countless others. Moreover, my family in France was somewhat disturbed; for when a young man, quite familiar in my household, had learned some craft in Geneva so as not to be a burden to the church, he, without my knowledge, although he had been with us here for several days, wanted to return to France and, having destroyed some stone and wooden crosses that stood on the roads, was captured with others and sentenced to be burned. Wanting to save his life, he began to accuse some, among whom was my son-in-law and younger brother, who, when called before the judge, so cleared himself that he was released. As for my son-in-law, the king's prosecutor demanded that he be captured; but the judge did not dare to comply. Finally, all those matters either because of me or for other reasons vanished. These are the things that have somewhat hindered me, from which God has delivered us. Farewell. Basel, February 3.</p>
      <p>Yours, Maurilius Musaeus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Zürich ecclesiastic.</p>
