    <p xml:id="regest1">When a seemingly reliable messenger [N.N.] voluntarily offered to deliver the letter, Schuler seized the opportunity and wrote to Bullinger. For with all the deceit and betrayal, every letter is difficult and perilous! And despite [the reliability of the messenger], Schuler preferred that he himself take on the function of the letter [and communicate the news to Bullinger orally]. The topics Schuler discussed personally with the messenger, he wants to convey to Bullinger: Schuler's situation in Memmingen; the expulsion feared by the Memmingen Evangelicals; the thoughtless words publicly expressed at a [banquet] in Augsburg by a man from Geldern [Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Buren] against the city of Constance; the death of the mercenary leader Sebastian Vogelsberger, how he was arrested and with what steadfastness he died, and how Emperor Charles V justified [the execution]; the 16 negotiators chosen by Charles V [the interim committee]; the widespread rumor about a future war, which according to some will be directed against the Confederates; the promise of Charles V to Charles III, Duke of Savoy, [to restore his duchy]; the negotiation between Charles V and Pope Paul III about the Council of Trent; the Duchy of Württemberg. The messenger will report reliably on these topics.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Greetings, also to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler,] and their children.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Through the misfortunes of others, one becomes wise. One must be wary of those who are unreliable. Greed is a great evil! For no man is incorruptible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Bullinger may already be aware of the situation of the Evangelicals in England.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Philipp Melanchthon has ordered a certain Spaniard [Francisco de Enzinas], who is currently staying in Basel, to Constantinople by letter. Whether he obeyed, Schuler has not yet learned. What more can be said about it?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">First, according to God's will, the Germans should be preached the Kingdom of God. But because they largely resisted and proved themselves unworthy of eternal life, God will turn to the heathens. The Lord tests [his church] in passing. Blessed are those who believe in him. May Christ strengthen the people of Zurich in the recognized truth and avert all deceit and betrayal from them and continue to grant them their inherent bravery and sincerity, so that they can face every enemy to the glory of God and the increase of their old [confederate] virtues.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Greetings, also to Bullinger's wife, Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, and Rudolf Gwalther.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. When the bearer of this letter voluntarily offered himself to me, I wanted to write to you through him, as he seemed good to me. For, as everything is full of deceit and betrayals, it is difficult and often dangerous to convey everything through the work of the pen. However, I wanted this bearer of the letter to serve as a substitute for the letter. Therefore, I only wanted to indicate certain points, about which I have spoken in person to the bearer of this letter. From these, you can measure the rest with the prudence given to you:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You will have certain information about all these matters from the messenger.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, beloved brother, together with your most beloved wife and dear children.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>One becomes wise through the misfortunes of others. And take good care of those who do not come with the right intentions. Greed is a desperate, wicked, and shameless villain. For nature has not formed any man so iron-willed that his resolve would scorn money or be impenetrable to our gold, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>You may already be aware of the progress of the Gospel in England.</p>

      <p>Philipp Melanchthon has summoned a certain learned Spaniard, currently residing in Basel, to Constantinople by letter. Whether he obeyed the summons, I have not yet learned. What more can be said?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>To us Germans, the Kingdom of God was to be preached first according to God's counsel. But because a good part of us reject it and judge ourselves unworthy of eternal life, the Lord will turn to the Gentiles, etc. The Lord is passing through as a visitor. Blessed is he who receives him in faith. May the Lord Jesus Christ strengthen you in the truth you have embraced and recognized, avert from your people all imposture, fraud, and betrayal, and grant you ancestral strength and integrity, so that you may face any enemy to the glory of God and the increase of ancient virtues.</p>

      <p>Greet your wife, Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, and Rudolf Gwalther in my name. The Lord be with you, my venerable brother. Given in Memmingen, February 22, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your friend, known to you in the old manner.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my old friend and dearest brother.</p>
