      <p>Greetings. I recently received, incomparable friend, the sermons which you delivered on the glorification of Christ, our Savior, in the church assembly of Z체rich. I am greatly delighted by the passage from Matthew, which you have so learnedly and piously elucidated. I myself wished to deliver the rest to the prefect of the castle, as you had indicated, but since he had gone to Bern, I gave it to his wife, a noblewoman from Erlach, who, being a prudent Christian woman, received it with gratitude and in turn thanked you through me. Meanwhile, war rumors are spreading everywhere; they say that Count von Mansfeld has prepared for war against the people of Augsburg with a large army, and many fear that Margrave Albrecht will winter with his soldiers in the county of Pfirt.</p>
      <p>Some say that the Emperor, that "Plus Ultra" (if it pleases the gods), is encamped in Dieterhofen, and that Maurice has gone to Hungary, perhaps to negotiate with the Turkish emperor, as he is a most vain man and a notorious traitor to Germany, and not one to keep any alliance he enters. What more can be said? The whole world is in turmoil; what the end of these things will be, God knows. I hope that God will soon redeem His elect; this is my only remaining hope, beyond which I do not see how the present evil can be countered. The Antichrist, in whom I believe Satan dwells bodily, fearing for his kingdom, moves every stone to ensure his safety and to continue to ravage the wretched churches for longer. The world is plainly insane, as it does not shudder at such open and horrendous lies, but rather, as the prophet says, loves, venerates, and worships such things. I, with my whole family, am moderately well; the Lord marvelously spares us undeserving ones, so that the plague does not trouble us; otherwise, this evil somewhat afflicts people all around.</p>
      <p>In recent days, Jodocus Br채nwald from Winterthur was with me, along with a certain young man from Constance, and he asked for my daughter in marriage; but because he approached me with open deceit (which I tell you) and lies, I refused, especially when I saw him intoxicated; for that night at the inn at the Crown, he drank so much wine that his feet, as if completely unsteady, refused him any step; moreover, it did not seem advisable for my daughter to have such a husband, whom you also know, that I should send her into Thurgau under the lovely peace of the land.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I thank you for the benefits bestowed upon my daughter by you when she was recently in Z체rich; you act as you have been accustomed to; I hope you will continue to do the same. Farewell, beloved brother; you will greet your wife much on my behalf. My wife, Hammann, the city prefect, and the widow of Gotfried greet you. Given at Lenzburg, November 18, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gervasius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Z체rich, lord brother, and dearest old friend.</p>
