    <p xml:id="regest1">Refers to Bucer's report from April 14 from Regensburg [CO XI 194-196, No. 296]. [The pastors and teachers of Strasbourg] have read the letter from Zurich [No. 1489], but in the absence of Calvin and others, they cannot make any decisions; Bedrot hopes that Calvin can be made available to the Geneva church at least temporarily after the conclusion of the Imperial Diet, but until then he is indispensable, as he is - according to the judgment of Philipp [Melanchthon] - one of the most important champions against the Roman phalanx. A month ago, the plague began to rage in Strasbourg, especially at the school, where it claimed two teachers [Claudius Feraeus and Wendelin Bittelbronn] and four students [including Louis de Richebourg]; now it is subsiding again. To protect [Johannes] Sturm from it, he was sent to Regensburg, but he is expected back within 14 days. Greetings. [Martin] Frecht conveys to Leo [Jud] that the mayor of Ulm, Bernhard Besserer, is saddened by his silence.</p>

      <p>Greetings. What is happening in Regensburg, you will learn from Bucer's letters, which he sent to us on April 14. We must diligently pray to the Lord to be present with His Church. We have read your letters, in which you request that Calvin be returned to the Geneva church. However, we who are here at this time can do little to assist the plans of both the Genevans and yours. Our Calvin is absent, as are others, as you know, my dear Bullinger, with whom this matter was especially to be discussed. I hope that after the conclusion of the Imperial Diet, we will have Calvin, at least temporarily, that is, until he restores and even establishes the church. Now, as it seems to me, this cannot be done. For there are few learned men in Regensburg, and among those few, Calvin holds a prominent place. Philipp [Melanchthon] is greatly delighted by his intellect, so that the Protestants can use him among the veterans against the most insidious phalanx, which, led by the Roman Antichrist, attempts the utmost against us. You, with the other brothers, pray to God, as you do, for the Church.</p>
      <p>The plague began to threaten us here a month ago quite harshly, especially our school, taking away two professors and four students; but now it has completely ceased to be troublesome. We sent Sturm to Regensburg, so that nothing unfortunate would happen to that singular intellect. But I hope he will return within 14 days. There is no time to add more. Farewell then in the Lord with Pelican, Leo, Erasmus, and others. Tell Leo that Bernhard Besserer, the mayor of Ulm, is saddened by his silence. Frecht has instructed me to write this to Leo. April 20 (1541).</p>
      <p>Your Bedrot.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the primary pastor of the church in Zurich, his venerable in Christ.</p>
