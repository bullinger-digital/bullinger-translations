    <p xml:id="regest1">Laments the unwise concessions in Philipp [Melanchthon's] opinion [for Chelius]. Criticizes especially [Melanchthon's] statements about the papal primacy, which he rightly rejected in his "Antiplacentinus." The Pope and the bishops will not cease to abuse the power they have acquired. The Church needs leaders who meet the standards [of the New Testament]; [Melanchthon] himself once called on the princes to intervene against the Roman Antichrist. The [traditions imposed by the Pope] should not be accepted as adiaphora, but should be arranged according to biblical and apostolic models. Auricular confession, unlike the confession of sins, is not founded in Scripture. There is little to object to in [Melanchthon's] statements about justification and forgiveness of sins. The traditional form of the Mass causes offense, especially the Canon of the Mass is to be rejected; if the Lord's Supper is arranged in the manner of Christ and the Apostles, further discussions are unnecessary. The Scripture knows nothing of the intercession of the saints. The monasteries were founded as schools and to support the poor; instead of disputing about vows and the monastic state, they should be returned to their original purpose. In the question of priestly marriage, no compromise is possible. Bucer assumes an agreement among Christian believers, but the Pope and his bishops are enemies of Christ. What does not conform to Scripture must be clearly named. Even Bucer concedes too much to the papal claim to power. Since the Pope and bishops will not change, such statements are harmful. Such opinions only strengthen the opponents in their hopes, as shown in France and Germany. Bullinger does not want to blame Bucer, but considers it dangerous to get involved with the French. Refrains from further discussion of Bucer's opinion. Requests the return of the letter.</p>

      <p>What shall I say, my dear Zwick, or what shall I note, there are so many things in Philipp's counsel that are displeasing, indeed that no good person can approve, that I can hardly and with great pain of mind recount them. For if you consider the man's intention, he certainly believed that with this counsel he would obtain something from the bishops and ecclesiastical leaders, or he thought he would receive nothing. If he believed he would receive nothing, he certainly imprudently deferred so much to the most impious scoundrels, and also poorly advised us, who are now accused by them of inconsistency. But if he believed he would obtain something with this counsel, he again acted imprudently, who did not prefer to ask for the unjust to remove the just, now he yields his right, so that there is room for them to invade and obtain less just things.</p>
      <p>How suspect are the things he disputes about the monarchy of the Roman pontiff! How far and wide they differ from what he once wrote, inspired by the good, free, and fearless spirit of God, in his Didymus of Faventia against Thomas of Placentia! Read them, I beseech you, my dear Zwick, read them, I beseech you by Christ, F6, 7, 8, G1, 2, 3, etc. There he refuted the monarchy of the Roman pontiff with the most certain arguments. Here, as if changed into another man, he exhales hot and cold from the same mouth. I am ashamed and grieved by the most unworthy inconsistency. What, I beseech you, will those ecclesiastical leaders, those enemies of Christ the Lord and his gospel, think after they have read these most desired words: "Some think that nothing else is being done but that a certain barbaric freedom is being sought with the monarchy of the Roman pontiff shaken off. This opinion harms" - oh fear - "us with the Roman pontiff. Therefore, it is necessary to show them that this is not being done to dissolve ecclesiastical authority. For our people concede that ecclesiastical polity is a legitimate thing, namely that there are some bishops who preside over several churches, likewise that the Roman pontiff presides over all bishops." The Roman pontiff demands nothing else. How truly our bishop of Constance now laughs in his sleeve, raised in hope of recovering Constance! But in his Antiplacentinus, Philipp once judged far more wisely. The words of the man are these: "Gregory, a good man and piously learned, decreed that no one should call himself the ecumenical pontiff. And would that the edict had prevailed! But by then the church had degenerated and piety was at an end." Thus he. Indeed, now also with us piety is at an end, after we voluntarily defer such titles to the Roman pontiff and other bishops, which piety has taken away, indeed which we ourselves long ago took away from them with divine help, when we were still sober.</p>
      <p>But he deferred these things to them only with the condition, namely if the pontiff and bishops do not abuse their authority. As if they could rightly use their authority, which is nothing else but tyranny. He rightly concludes, who says: If ample means were available to him, he would be rich. But he who meanwhile is vexed by poverty judges more rightly that he is pouring out empty words. Why do we still judge conditionally about those prostituted scoundrels, who, if the leopard can change its spots and the Ethiopian his skin, and they know not to abuse their authority, who have hitherto believed their authority to be to remove heretics, that is, true professors, with fire and sword. Why do the examples of many centuries not move us? Do we not know what harm both truth and ecclesiastical discipline and the whole church of Christ have received, after the monarchy of the Roman prelate and the dynasty of the bishops occupied the world? Nor will they cease to attack Christ and the church with their resources. Here indeed we beautifully defend the donations, that is, the betrayals of the pontiff and bishops, so that they have resources, with which they, superior to even good princes, move nothing but wars against the church. For thus Philipp judged about the donations: "We teach that the donations of kings and princes are legitimate things. But those revenues" (namely of the pontiff and bishops) "are the donations of princes." We certainly teach otherwise from the word of Christ in Matthew 15[5f] and Luke 22[26]: "But you are not so." And Philipp in the Antiplacentinus: "After the times of Charles", he says, "with our Caesars occupied at home, when in Italy everything was done at the nod of the pontiff, it became of pontifical dominion, which Charles had called Romandiola, because it seemed that there was no legitimate empire in Italy except that of the pontiff. For they falsely pretend that it was donated by I know not whom to the Roman bishop. This is what they call the patrimony of Peter." And a little later: "Satan stealthily invaded the Roman see, gradually occupied the minds of men with laws and ceremonies, until that abominable kingdom of the antichrist was established." Thus Philipp once judged soberly altogether. But now he gives the primacy in the church to those who, namely together with other bishops, that is, arch-scoundrels (I meant to say archbishops), inspect doctrine, exercise ecclesiastical judgments. Oh shame! This is to appoint the wolf over the sheepfold.</p>
      <p>We also confess that there is a need for governors in the church, but such as Christ chose in Matthew 10 and Luke 22 [24-26], Peter in 1 Peter 5 [1-4], Paul in the epistles to Timothy and Titus, likewise in Acts chapter 20 [17-35]. Can we no longer do this? Can we not manage with the teaching of Christ? The church of Christ for 400 years had most holy and happy times without the monarchy of the Roman pontiff and such bishops. "Where religion has begotten riches, the daughter has devoured the mother." Philipp in the Antiplacentinus, after he had dealt much with the monarchy of the Roman pontiff, finally turned to the princes of Germany: "Therefore, since Europe has been entrusted to your faith", he says, "if your own, if the salvation of the Christian people is of concern to you, wake up at last and drive that antichrist from the sheepfold of Christ, recall Christian letters, Christian institutions into the midst of those obliterated by his laws and traditions. Some call this a frivolous dispute, in which it is asked whether the pope presides over all churches by divine right, and we also consider it frivolous, unless you refer it to this, that you may know it is lawful for you to determine matters of the church even against the will of this antichrist, since it is persuaded and thus sanctioned by that putrid law that nothing can be changed in matters of the church unless the authority of the Roman pontiff intervenes. But Christ willed, Paul willed that the judgment of all things should not be with the bishops, but with the church, with the Christian people." All these things Philipp wrote with a sober mind, to which how those things agree, which he advised in the recent counsel, any wise person sees.</p>
      <p>Why do we repeat the scrupulous dispute about human traditions? Truth said: "In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men" [Mt 15, 9]. In the Antiplacentinus, Melanchthon is angry with Victor, the Roman pontiff, because he tried to force the churches of Asia to the rites of the Roman church; for evangelical freedom and opinion allow each to have their own ceremonies. But now: "Since", he says, "the world cannot be without ceremonies, what would be the obstinacy to want to dissent from others or to prefer new ones to the customary ones?" For it is known that almost all our ceremonies have been transferred from the Roman to our church. Why does he not rather advise to establish all rites as closely as possible to the canonical letters and the apostolic example? About adiaphora we are not ignorant of what the apostle wrote. We also know that some things are counted among adiaphora by some, which can in no way be adiaphora.</p>
      <p>And about retaining auricular confession they seem perversely to dispute diligently. For it is known to all that auricular confession is not of divine right, indeed it was only received late in the church and is alien to the apostles and their institution. The confession of sins, which is made to God and the neighbor, is absolutely necessary and is set forth in the divine scriptures. It is also free to consult a learned scribe in the law of God, if you are oppressed by some sin. But they, following the example of the old, that is, papal confession, think to retain I know not what dregs in an impure vessel.</p>
      <p>We do not desire very much in those things which he disputed about justification and the remission of sins.</p>
      <p>Now since it is certain that the supper was instituted by Christ in the simplest manner without pomp and was not observed by the apostles and the primitive church in the form now used by the papists, it rightly offends those who are zealous for piety and veneration of apostolic antiquity, what Philipp wrote: "We indeed retain the customary form, so that hardly any dissimilarity can be recognized, and I wish the same to be done in other places." Indeed, there is nothing in the unusual form that cannot be changed for the better. I say nothing now about the impiety of the canon. For who does not disapprove of this canon cannot be a good man. If Philipp also approves this, I judge both him and the canon as reprobate. In short: If in the Lord's Supper we follow the rite which the authority of Christ and the apostles has handed down to us, there will be no need to dispute about the private mass, about communion under both kinds. It bothers me that they still go about with the peddling and empty tricks of the priests, and that they do not frankly say what it is about, and that their masses are nothing but a foolish deception and fraud. What need is there for politeness? Simple is soon polished. I know indeed that consideration must be given to the weak, but in such a way that we do not again insert those snatched from error into other superstitions. We must rather strive to subject those liberated from the yoke of human traditions to the service of scripture. It would be inauspicious if the wretched man feels himself snatched from human rites only to be subjected to others again with a changed title.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Philipp seems to me to gravely sin against the simplicity of the Christian religion, while at first judging piously about the worship of saints, he soon turns to I know not what moderation. How much simpler it was to pronounce about this matter as scripture taught: that God, the author of all good, alone grants to mortals all things necessary for life and bodily needs; that he alone is present everywhere, omnipotent, omniscient; therefore, he alone is to be supplicated in all things through Christ Jesus our Lord. But with what scriptures will Philipp prove what he pronounces with great confidence: "It is certain that the saints in heaven pray for the whole church in common"? Indeed, nothing is more uncertain, since it is written in Isaiah 63[16]: "Abraham did not know us and Israel did not acknowledge us."</p>
      <p>About monasteries and convents he rightly judges, who believes they should be established as schools. For even the papal decrees themselves are forced to admit that the monasteries of monks are hospices for the poor. Therefore, it is foolish here to dispute about vows and the monastic habit. For they are most vain. For the monks who now inhabit the monasteries, besides neglecting their rules, also consume the resources destined for studies and the poor with luxury, pomp, and superstition to the great detriment of studies and the oppression of the poor. It should rather be consulted how, with the support of princes and holy magistrates, the resources destined for study and the poor can be taken from unjust possessors and restored to holy use. This will never happen if you attribute even a little to vows or the habit. For we have learned from experience that this kind of people is opposed to the business of truth from the heart and stubbornly hopes that they will be restored by the support of some tyrants. Therefore, they hinder studies with great skill and are more unjust to the poor as long as they live, but much more vehemently if they are appointed to public offices in the monasteries. It is better, therefore, to entrust this business - with those monks who are more unjust in their mind towards piety being sent away, yet not without honor and provision - to holy and faithful men, who will diligently and faithfully manage the affairs of the students and the poor.</p>
      <p>But those who forbid priests to marry promote fornication and fornicators. Therefore, this article cannot be softened by any mitigation.</p>
      <p>Now what Bucer writes in his counsel: "True concord can only exist among those who are of the church and truly believe in Christ", is not displeasing. For he spoke the truth. But we here infer: Therefore, no concord can exist between us and the bishops of the Roman pontiff. For they do not believe in Christ so much that they attack him with all their might. And yet: "In this name we want some to be chosen from the order of the clergy, who will deal with Christian concord." But the pontiff and bishops will not tolerate this, who claim the primacy in these matters for themselves. Therefore, it is to be wished that Philipp had deferred less to them. For if we want to confess the truth, they are false prophets and those antichrists, about whom there is much in the scriptures. Bucer seems to have signified this very thing more covertly, when he said: "What was once in the false prophets and impious priests" etc.</p>
      <p>"What the ancients observed healthily", are drawn from the most healthful sources of scripture. What is not drawn from there, although it may seem healthy, is so far from being restored that we should not even acknowledge it. But if we acknowledge that the ancients did not observe many things healthily, why do we not speak more simply and plainly, especially when we are speaking to those who lie in wait for us, to establish their kingdom with us submerged.</p>
      <p>When he speaks of ecclesiastical polity and adds that he resists the ordinance of God who does not obey external power, whatever it may be, he seems to attribute too much to pontifical power. For he speaks chiefly of this, although it can also be understood of civil magistracy. But what have we done for many years other than to draw people away from its obedience? But: "We are wholly", he says, "in this, that this power is sacrosanct and is thus honored by all." As if the power of the antichrist could be sacrosanct or the authority of the Roman pontiff ever was sacrosanct. We seem indeed, let the word be without envy, to have undertaken a dispute about utopia and Plato's republic, as if the pontiff and his bishops could be brought into order. We do not deny that these things are discussed holily, sweetly, and beautifully, but since among the pontiffs and bishops in the meantime all is desperate, what, I beseech you, other than what we have warned above, do we pour out empty words, indeed not empty, but pernicious. For besides this, that we obtain nothing from the bishops, we also gravely offend our own. For although our mind is whole and is carried away into these straits by the force of charity, they nevertheless believe that we, weary of afflictions, want the face of religion to be changed and thus aspire to pontifical honors with flatteries. Nor do I see anything else that we have achieved with these counsels of ours. For the Frenchman persecutes the gospel of Christ more cruelly than before and Germany is wonderfully inflamed against the ministers of the word because of these counsels; says, we are all rogues (scoundrels), it will soon be better. The Lord, who inspects the hearts of all, knows with what mind I say these things.</p>
      <p>I cannot think or speak ill of Bucer. Yet I freely declare what I feel: that he has attempted a dangerous thing with great risk, with little fruit. I do not want to say anything now about the slippery faith of the French. Certainly, he holds an eel in his hands, with which what business does he have with the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>I do not want to examine the rest more laboriously. For most of what Bucer disputed about doctrines is not disapproved, and we have noted some things above about the mass, ceremonies, confession. I truly grieve that readers are overwhelmed with so many papers, when simplicity (let the word be without calumny) is content with fewer.</p>
      <p>I write these things to you alone, most learned Zwick. Therefore, when you have read them, return them and farewell.</p>
      <p>In the month of March 1535.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
