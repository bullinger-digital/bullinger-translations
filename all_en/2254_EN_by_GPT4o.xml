      <p>On the 17th of February, I received your last letter along with the book "On the Grace of God," a most welcome gift, with open arms, as they say, and with reverence. You indeed continually bless me with the most delightful and beneficial fruits of your books, and thus you bind me to you, so that you have long since made me entirely yours, although you are no richer or happier with such an unprofitable possession, since there is nothing in me with which I can in turn benefit or delight you. However, I will tirelessly beseech the Lord, the true author of all your goods, to act on my behalf with you and to bless you and all yours with an abundance of all temporal and eternal goods, so that you may feel that your generosity towards me has not been in vain, but rather that you have gained much profit. With even more fervent prayers, I wish to obtain from our Christ that your most honorable and holy labors, which you sweat for so singularly, may continue to prosper for the happy propagation of His kingdom, and thus, what you pursue as either the sole or chief aim, you may achieve for the great good of the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>Questor Fuchsius, along with my Funck and other friends, sends you respectful greetings, especially Witenbach and Valerius. May your domestic church of Christ greet you with all your fellow ministers and the professors of your school, whose prayers of sacred intercession I uniquely hope and desire to be aided by. We are very eager to know about your excellent brother, how he is now, and whether his illness has subsided. May the Lord Jesus Christ, with His healing and most blessed hand, soon restore him to you and us entirely, so that we may render great thanksgiving to Him in His church with utmost rejoicing.</p>
      <p>I believe I have nothing new to tell you that you do not already know. I see that our Germany is once again facing new and very grave dangers, and the evils of the previous year are resurfacing, so that the coming summer seems to bring with it much more severe calamities, which the mournful fate of the most excellent and Christian prince, Elector Frederick of Saxony, and his most chaste wife, as well as Lord Johannes of Heideck and Gabriel Arnold, the Palatine questor, men of heroic virtue and rare piety, seem to portend, occurring almost simultaneously. Additionally, it is reported that the magistrates of some Swiss are determined to loosen the reins, so that they can almost freely go off to war, among whom the Bernese are now, which I say with great sorrow, numbered, with the preachers also strongly dissimulating in this matter, whom you will urge at the first opportunity with your holy exhortations, which will be very effective, not to be silent here; for they will also sin against us if they do not do their duty, since ours imitate them not unwillingly as neighbors and joined to them by a certain singular bond.</p>
      <p>The situation looks dire, as if everything must fall apart, as it certainly will; if the devil also removes the stone from the wall, we will see a terrible fall. May the Lord God grant that in our days His judgment over the blood guilt of this land is not executed, but rather postponed and averted, and that neither old nor new harm is inflicted upon us. I hear reliably, apart from Witenbach's confidential reports, that they will let it run; for the penalties are so mitigated that whoever is inclined will not stay at home because of them.</p>
      <p>I would commend our Johann Ulmius to you in many ways, if I did not know that you already favor him greatly. It pains me much to hear that he does not get along well with his uncle Gregor von Ulm, my relative, a very good man, although I am completely ignorant of the cause. You, with your prudence, which you possess with both, should, if you can, timely remedy this evil with your authority, so that it does not spread further. Ah, my soul, pray diligently for me, a sinner, that my coming Lord, who is not far off, may find me vigilant and eagerly expecting Him. I feel the time of my dissolution is at hand, which I wish may dissolve me in such a way that it may unite me most closely and happily with my Christ, whose utterly useless servant I have been, but whose promised salvation I embrace with whatever faith I can. Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother. Biel/Bienne, April 6, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable friend.</p>
