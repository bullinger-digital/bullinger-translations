    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger could not write for a long time because the many tasks forced him to neglect his friends. However, Erb should know that he values him no less than before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The state of the Church in Zürich is good. May it remain so for a long time! A year ago, no one would have dreamed that such changes would occur in the churches of Germany! The Lord tests His own and spurs them on. He wants to teach them not to rely on earthly things, alliances, and princes, as the Church thrives through the proclamation of the Word and only God can protect it. Soon everything will become much worse, namely when everyone is ordered to kneel before the decrees of the Council [of Trent]. But even then, God will protect His Church and set its persecutors against each other, destroying them forever. This is already becoming apparent: Emperor Charles V and Pope Paul III, who once attacked Germany with united forces, have now become mortal enemies due to the murder of the Pope's son, Pier Luigi Farnese. Let the just God execute His punishment, while we (always praying) strive to fulfill our duties! May God grant us the strength to do so!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Thanks to the kindness and affability of Count George of Württemberg-Mömpelgard, Bullinger was allowed to become a confidant of the same. In response to his question of whether Judas partook of the body and blood of Christ at the first Last Supper, Bullinger has now replied with a writing [„Consideration whether the traitor Judas also sat at the Lord's table“]. If Erb wishes, he can request it from the Count or his scribes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings from everyone, also to the colleagues.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [P.S.:] Bullinger did not read through this letter.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have not written to you, dearest brother Erb, because I am often forced to neglect my friends due to being overwhelmed with tasks. But you undoubtedly know that I love you no less.</p>

      <p>The state of our Church is quite good. Thanks be to the Lord! May it remain so for a long time! For we have seen in the German churches a change that no one would have believed if they had heard even a dream of it a year ago. But the Lord tests His own and shakes off their lethargy. He takes away the reed-like staff from our hands. He removes hope in the flesh, in alliances, in princes, in allies. The Church grows through preaching; it is defended by divine help. I believe far more atrocious things will follow when the decrees of the Council are presented to us all to be worshipped! Nevertheless, the Lord will preserve His Church, even through tribulations. Again, He will set His enemies and the persecutors of the Church against each other and destroy them forever, of which we see an example today in the Emperor and the Pope, who invaded Germany with united forces, but now, due to the murder of the Pope's son, Pier Luigi Farnese, they are so at odds that it is thought the enmity will not end without bloodshed. Let us therefore leave judgment to the Lord, who will execute justice. In the meantime, let us do our duty, praying. May He grant us the grace to do so.</p>

      <p>Through his benevolence and humanity, I have become quite familiar with your prince. I have already responded in writing to his question of whether Judas partook of the true body and blood of the Lord at the Last Supper. You can conveniently request that treatise from him, or from his scribes, if it seems appropriate.</p>

      <p>Farewell and always be strong in the Lord. October 21, Zürich, 1547. All the brothers greet you. You will greet your people for us in return. Bullinger.</p>
