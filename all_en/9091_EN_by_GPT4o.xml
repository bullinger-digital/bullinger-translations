      <p>God be with us, dearly beloved son, I have received the wine well and properly, thank you greatly for it with the promise that I will deserve it and conduct myself as always, as soon as I have money. I have given your servant 10 β for drink money, 5 β to Dyeß, I have given the oats to the horses and paid the innkeeper at the Stork. Do not worry about Susanna and the carriage; they are dear and worthy guests to me, they must stay until the weather is very good, etc. Regarding the marriage matter, tell the parties that it is a decent matter, which you cannot burden yourself with, refer them to the court, otherwise, you must not involve yourself further according to our lords' statutes, and do not let yourself be involved further. I am sending you here the judgment of Gwalther about it, etc., it is also his opinion that you should refer it to them. Herewith a letter to Mr. Hans Heinrich Locher, who is undertaking the school in the lower town and dismissing the poor fellow, the old schoolmaster Peter Wipf, who has served well for 8 years, etc. We write to him amicably, that he should desist and not bring great displeasure upon himself. Dear, do not forget it soon. Herewith I also send you a letter from Mr. godfather Hans Hugi in Glarus, which he sent to me to forward to you. Whatever news I have, I will send to you in good time, provided that you send it all back to me accurately and securely within 8 days; I would like to have it back by Thursday evening, if possible. I have previously sent you the conditions through your servant, upon which Bergen was given up; you should also send them back; you should have sent them back long ago. How is it that you have not written to me from Oberwinterthur, how it has fared with you, etc. Greet J. Hansen warmly for me, also Mr. Löwe. I am waiting every day for news from Nuremberg and also Augsburg; if anything new comes, I will let you know. God be with you; may He protect us and give us His blessing. November 8, 1572.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
