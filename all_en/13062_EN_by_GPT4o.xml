    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] This good man [Georg Seemann] is very grateful to Bullinger for having ensured that his son [Maximilian] was admitted to the school [of the Grossmünster]. He would like to express his gratitude in some way.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Now he implores Blarer to ask Bullinger to intercede on his behalf with Otto Werdmüller, so that he may be content with 5 florins (which he had to borrow) for the time being, instead of the 10 that he owes him [for his son's pension]. After the autumn, he will settle the outstanding amount. Since he is truly a good person, Bullinger should convince Werdmüller that Christ will reward him for the kindness he shows to this very poor man.</p>

      <p>This good man is as grateful as he can be and expresses his deepest thanks to you for your support in having his son admitted to the school of the Grossmünster. He wishes to demonstrate his gratitude towards you in any way he can.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Through Christ, he implores me to commend him to you once again, so that, with your intercession, he may obtain from Otto Werdmüller, to whom he owes 10 florins in his son's name, the favor of accepting 5 florins (which he borrowed) for now, with the assurance of receiving the remaining five after autumn. Since he is truly a good man, I earnestly beseech you to assist him in this matter with your kindness. His fortune is exceedingly meager, and Otto would greatly endear himself to Christ if he grants this small delay to the poor man.</p>
