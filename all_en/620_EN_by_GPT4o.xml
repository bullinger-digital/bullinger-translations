      <p>Greetings in the Lord Jesus, man of God and my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Your letters have filled me with singular joy from what you have reported about England, Saxony, the maritime cities, and finally the kingdom of Poland. As for Camillo, I am not surprised that he wrote a very agitated letter to you; it is his custom to be troublesome not only to one but to many, indeed to as many ministers of Christ as he can, to disturb churches, to divide and create schisms. He has now compiled a certain collection against me of one hundred and twenty-five articles, titled: "Errors, Absurdities, Scandals, Contradictions of Augustinus Maynardus from the year 45 onwards," with a letter to the reader so immodest and biting that it could cause nausea to the reader. Nevertheless, I responded to him in a Christian and temperate manner, so that whoever reads that treatise will judge Camillo to be a man full of many and great errors; no one could depict him better and more accurately than he himself with his true and genuine colors; he deviates so manifestly from the right path. He has left here; however, his disciples remain, whom he has taught his ways so well that they follow their teacher abundantly. You advise me to strive to defend the purity of truth; nevertheless, you urge me to abstain wherever I can refrain from quarrels. Oh, how much I dislike quarrels as if they were the most present poison! I know it is not fitting for me to engage in contentions, being nearly worn out by old age and a minister of Christ, to whom peace and concord should not only be pleasing, but who should also exhort others to it. But what can I do, who endure so many adversaries, yet have none to bring help or at least console me? For those who favor Camillo are so inflamed with hatred against me that they nearly tear apart my entire doctrine. If I say nothing, the truth will be endangered; if I respond, I am a morose old man, impatient, unwilling to listen to anyone, stubborn, and hard-headed. They gather so many calumnies that they seem to think of nothing else than to undermine my ministry, to make me hateful to all. Franciscus Niger, who previously sided with Stancaro, now joins those who favor Camillo; he no longer attends our sermons; our adversaries are with him daily and devise new plans among themselves. In recent days, a certain surgeon, called Peter from Casale Maggiore, burst into such madness that he openly declared he had been newly baptized; he openly confessed to being an Anabaptist and raged against me with such fury, calling me a deceiver, a ravenous wolf, a false preacher, that he seemed to be driven by an evil spirit.</p>
      <p>He was their very dear friend and regarded by them as a most Christian and holy man. Another Anabaptist, named Titianus, whom the synod expelled with secular, as they say, arm, was also a friend of Camillo and his followers. I often invited them to a debate: they say they do not want to contend. Camillo and Franciscus Niger say the same; they are allowed to create schisms, but not to debate, although Franciscus Niger, I think, is not involved in the errors, I think, in which Camillo and the others are. I asked Camillo for a confession of his faith; he replied that he would do so in his own time, not now. There are countless such things that I could narrate, which I willingly pass over. I do not want to burden you with more; I wanted to say these few things even unwillingly and without order. Spare me; for the thought of such indignity overwhelms me. Therefore, seeing the certain ruin of our church unless good men bring help, and I am without counsel and do not know what more to do, I ask you, most esteemed man of God, to write to Comander and Blasius, that they may assist me and either come to us themselves or send some wise men, who, with the authority of the lords if necessary, may gather the church and diligently inquire about the cause of the schism; for the adversaries will try to bring up countless things that are irrelevant, to avoid what is primary in the cause.</p>
      <p>Advise Blasius and Comander to be prudent in this matter, to listen to no one, either others or me, unless in the presence of the party and before the whole church; otherwise, everything will be confused. Let them inquire why they did not want to accept the confession confirmed by the churches; let them ask for a confession of their faith. Otherwise, you know the ways of such men, how biting they are against the ministers of Christ. You would not believe how much I have suffered and still continuously suffer. I had decided to go to England; for Bernardinus Ochinus had called me there. However, one who recently returned from there said everything is disturbed by wars, factions, and there are many dangers there, which I thought were all divinely arranged, lest this little flock be without a shepherd, although I desire another better and stronger than me to be appointed to this office. Meanwhile, you, man of God, pray to God for me and for our church. I equally commend to you the bearer of this letter, Hieronimus Illiricus, a pious man and highly recommended to me by friends from Italy. I have offered him all my things; however, he wishes to earn his bread by his own labor and to devote himself to honest work, not to receive food for free. Help him, if you can, with your advice and favor. Do not be surprised that I write to you so confidently; for I regard and consider you as my father.</p>
      <p>Farewell well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Chiavenna, August 7, 1549.</p>
      <p>Greet, I ask you, in my words, Master Pellican and Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>Your Augustinus Maynardus.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed lord, Master Heinrich Bullinger, distinguished interpreter of divine letters and most vigilant Antistes of the Zürich church, his most revered father.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
