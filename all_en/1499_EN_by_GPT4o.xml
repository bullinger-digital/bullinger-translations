      <p>Gracious and trusted, dear lord and friend. Your letter and response were answered to me the other day in Basel, and as far as your letter concerning Rheinfelden is concerned, I can truthfully write to you that the same letter was properly answered and sent there by Mr. von Reischach through his servant.</p>
      <p>What has been said to you about Magdeburg is conjecture, and as I have also heard, it has happened, etc. However, in all this, you should know confidentially that Magdeburg has been resolved, in a Christian manner, and so well tolerated that they can and will do great good for our religion and the fatherland, along with others. You should accept this with satisfaction and not inquire further at this time, but rather think of making progress, so that we may be found thankful to God alongside the improvement of our lives and be kindled with the fire of Christian and brotherly love and loyalty. The poor Christians in Magdeburg, whose houses, especially in the suburbs, have been burned, and whose entire possessions have been exhausted to the utmost, have been so exhausted that the Christian, honest, brave women have not only encouraged their men to be manly and not to accept any agreement against God's will and word, but have also initially brought their chains, rings, small items, and silverware to the town hall and have offered to contribute the other half and to risk their lives, etc., to come to their comfort and help and to support them, etc. Years ago, we began to bring much money to a mad monk to arrange for bells, churches, buildings, idols, and devil's ornaments. Now we have become so learned and so full or weary of the gospel that we dare to say in a devilish and wanton manner, what does Magdeburg concern us, as also happened with Constance.</p>
      <p>There is a great outcry about a Hans Gutschick, a citizen of Zell am Untersee, how he, as a spy or traitor, was appointed to serve the crown of France and in particular to murder Mr. [Sebastian] Schertlin and was bribed with money by the authorities in Constance... P. This Gutschick was overthrown by those from Basel and is known for the matter, as the letters found with him are supposed to prove.</p>
      <p>Tear up this letter; it is not appropriate to write further about it now. God will and will still bring wonderful things to light. Dated Bern, December 6, anno etc. 51.</p>
      <p>G[abriel] A[rnold].</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Jacob, the city clerk of Lindau, your and their wives, and I would like the city clerk to have arranged to come to me in Aro at the Wild Man on Monday for certain reasons; for I have something to discuss with him that cannot be written, therefore I send this special messenger. Tell him not to stay away; I will ride to Aro tomorrow, Sunday, and will wait there on Monday. From there I will ride to Bruges, where I also have a day to spend with Mr. D.?].</p>
