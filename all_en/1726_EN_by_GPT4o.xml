      <p>Yesterday I received your letters, most illustrious man, and I had also received the previous ones, to which I did not respond due to infinite business, poor health, and also some slowness of mind, not to excuse myself entirely. However, I sent a package to Schertelin; indeed, he did not respond, just as he has not written anything since his departure. I received your German booklets, for which I thank you, one of which I gave to Sulzer, who visited me that day. I certainly see, as you had predicted, what has happened; however, things are not in such a miserable state among the people of Strasbourg as there was danger, not due to their prudence, but due to the goodness and mercy of God, who has made good use of their ease.</p>
      <p>For the arrival of the Emperor brought more fear than harm, although, if we carefully consider everything and look to the future, we find that it has caused no small inconvenience and that Strasbourg has recognized him as its own, which has caused a loss of its reputation and freedom. He lingered there for four hours and, having left the city, spent the night half a mile away. He was admitted with two thousand horsemen; as for the ceremonies, I think you already understand. He is heading towards Hagenau and Luxembourg, so that he can relieve Thionville, which, besieged by our forces, is suffering from great scarcity. They wanted to bring food to fifteen hundred soldiers; but they were destroyed by the Duke of Guise, who leads our army. Queen Mary's army also suffered some defeat. All these things are more diligently awaited by those coming... The King has summoned all his nobility and at the beginning of the next month, he himself will be in the camp with the Margrave of Brandenburg, who, having become entirely royal, will await the Emperor, and certainly, if the Emperor seriously wants to bring food to Thionville, it will come to blows. I am surprised that your Swiss are so silent at this time, when at the time the King was in Alsace, they held assemblies every month. Lord Vend√¥me captured three camps, one of which was said to be impregnable, and all the enemies who were present for the defense, who were five hundred, were killed except for five... not so much by our forces as by fire, which invaded their artillery and fortifications, whether by chance or by design, is unknown, but it is certain about the dead. I cannot thank you enough for writing to me so often, and I ask that you continue to do so with your usual kindness. I will do the same in return and, if I understand anything worthy, I will write to you. I write these things now in passing, for due to my occupations, I have spent the whole night sleepless.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Basel, September 25, 1552. Yours, Maurilius Musaeus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, dearest friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
