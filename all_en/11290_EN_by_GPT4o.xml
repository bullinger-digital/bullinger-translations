    <p xml:id="regest1">Jakob Zorn, pastor in Alterswilen, has requested a testimonial because he is entirely relying on Zürich in his difficult situation; they can, in good conscience, attest that he has conducted himself blamelessly in terms of lifestyle and teaching and has fulfilled his ecclesiastical duties well. They have advised Zorn, who has explained his dealings of the past years to them and sought advice, to persevere, but now they must let him go.

      <p>Grace and peace through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Most honorable men and brothers to be respected in the Lord, Jakob Zorn, the pastor of the church in Alterswilen, appeared before us and requested that we provide you with worthy testimonies of his doctrine and conduct, relying on the good hope that these will greatly influence your excellencies, in whom he has placed all his trust for assistance in his tribulation. Therefore, since we have no certain knowledge of his integrity of character and purity of preaching, nor could we ascertain otherwise from those nearby, other than that he has faithfully provided for his church up to now and has administered his ecclesiastical function well according to the gift given to him, has modestly corrected corrupt morals and wayward sheep with frankness, and finally has offended no one with a blameworthy life, we give him, with a sincere conscience, as far as all of us are aware of this matter, an undoubted and true testimony, meanwhile earnestly praying that you may hold him in the highest regard; for we do not doubt that he will conduct himself among you in such a way that he cannot displease any pious person.</p>
      <p>He has explained his causes over the course of the past year and now at this time, and has consulted us intimately, whether the church should be abandoned due to the anger and persecution of some. To which we have always responded and advised from the sources of sacred scripture that it is pious to endure many tribulations for the profession of the gospel, especially for a preacher, if we wish to be conformed to the image of the cross of Christ, hence the church should not be abandoned rashly due to the ingratitude of some; to these admonitions he has hitherto obeyed and has shown himself to be prudent. Now, however, as Satan exerts himself with greater force through his members, he has sought assistance from the whole church against those he considers to be underminers, which being frustrated, we recognize that he has the free ability to depart according to the smallness of our judgments. This we did not wish to keep hidden from you, our respected lords, once again recommending him to you, so that through your help and industry he may be introduced to your most honorable patricians and be able to provide sustenance for himself and his children.</p>
      <p>Given and sealed with the usual seal of our chapter by Andreas Klinger on the nineteenth day of March in the year 1539.</p>
