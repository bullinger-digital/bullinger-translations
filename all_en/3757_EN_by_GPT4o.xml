      <p>Greetings. When (reverend father in Christ) on the day before the calends of November, late at night, I was about to go to bed, around the tenth hour, Mr. Aurelius Scytarcha came to me by order of our envoy, who brought this news, which I am writing to you this evening. A courier arrived around the ninth hour, who announced this: a truce of twenty days has been agreed upon between both kings; however, it seems that this was done so that under the pretext of a truce, soldiers could be dismissed without disturbance. Therefore, the King of France is retreating towards France, and the other one towards Flanders with his army. It seems, therefore, that peace is entirely concluded.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the envoy had invited me to dinner this evening; if I had attended, I would have understood the whole matter more clearly from him. However, this was the gist of Aurelius's words.</p>
      <p>If these seem hastily written to you, I hope you will forgive me; for I preferred to write to you while drowsy rather than not at all. The same Mr. Aurelius added that Charles V, the brother of Ferdinand, had passed away, and indeed this was first announced this evening. Certainly, it struck me as quite strange, as I believed he had already passed away. However, since he announced it as new information, I wanted to include it here.</p>
      <p>This is written late at night, indeed in the dead of night, when I could hardly restrain myself from sleep; therefore, you must forgive me. Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most esteemed patron. ZÃ¼rich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
