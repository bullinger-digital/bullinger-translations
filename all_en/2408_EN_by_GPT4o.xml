      <p>Greetings. In recent days, most honorable Bullinger, I sent a bundle of letters to you through some citizens of Konstanz, in which my letters to you and those of Mr. von Freiberg to you and to Mr. Funckh were included. Mr. von Freiberg is daily urging me to extract a response from you, because what he wrote to you was of considerable importance. Furthermore, the severity of winter, now knocking at the door, must be warded off with suitable clothing by his sons, which, although he greatly desires, he cannot accomplish without first learning what he wished to know in the letters. He has written to me about this matter at least six times and has reminded me in person once and again. Therefore, I cannot understand why we have received nothing from you so far; however, I suspect that either our letters to you or yours to us have not been faithfully delivered. I wrote to you much about the afflicted religion, attacked and almost profaned not so much by the papists as by the Lutherans; I also requested certain books, some published by you, some in Geneva.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask that we may have your letters and those of Funckh to Mr. von Freiberg, as well as the letters of his sons, with this message. If you do not provide them, you will burden the mind of the excellent man von Freiberg with the gravest thoughts and will place him from tranquility into day and night labor.</p>
      <p>Molinaeus at this hour, when the messenger was about to leave, gave me letters in which he laments the state of the T端bingen gymnasium. I suspect much about this Duchy of W端rttemberg; for I know that there are great heroes who leave nothing undone to bait, frighten, and again ensnare with new interimistic tricks. I cannot commit much about this matter to letters, as I would like, if it were safe. Private absolutions, confessions of principal sins, indecent veneration of the Eucharist make many good men both entangled and astonished. Our people forbid that the sacramental bread be touched by the hands of those receiving it, lest a Zwinglian, Oecolampadian, etc., for thus they name them expressly, approach the altar of the Lord, nor do they propose more breads than are sufficient for those who showed themselves to the priest the preceding day, adducing the place about lepers for their purpose. But when 20 have shown themselves, perhaps 1000 or more approach the tables of the Lord, the minister turns to the altar and consecrates new hosts, oh shame. What disturbances do ill-disposed men not stir up in the church, and for no one is so stupid that he does not understand that they gradually deflect to papism and that it is more important to them that greater authority comes to them because of impanation than that the glory of Christ, charity among brothers, and peace in the church be promoted.</p>
      <p>I wrote earlier to Mr. Gesner that I had persuaded the magnificent Mr. Johann F., to seek to obtain a privilege; the same was promised to me by Mr. Zasius, the royal counselor, who is now with us, provided they have a copy beforehand to send to the court. For it is decreed both in the king's and the emperor's court that no privilege be given to anyone whose copy has not been seen beforehand.</p>
      <p>Therefore, greet Mr. Gesner and promise all acts of friendship in my name to the excellent man; also commend me to the excellent men, the leaders of your church and school.</p>
      <p>It will be beneficial in every way for you to read Molinaeus's letter to me; for he has stirred up many adversaries against himself because of his sincere confession about the sacramental matter; therefore, I will take care that it be copied and sent to you as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>I ask Mr. Gesner in my name to ensure that the medicine, about which Maximilian wrote, be brought to us; for a certain good man desires it with a certain wonderful affection. There is nothing new, except that the prince of Bavaria, with a few certain counselors, is diligently acting to prevent true religion from taking root in his duchy, while his subjects meanwhile embrace the word of God vigorously; the same is being done with greater severity by the king of the Romans.</p>
      <p>A courtly rumor spreads among us about future assemblies; but there are few who give it credence. They say the margrave is already preparing a new army; moreover, they say the imperial forces have fought with little success in the Piedmontese field. If you have anything, I ask you to share it. Farewell, my Bullinger. Whatever is to be paid for that drink, you will settle it yourself, and with one word indicate how much we owe for that medicine.</p>
      <p>Freyberger will immediately repay you whatever it is. That messenger can easily bring some books, if any are available with you, to me.</p>
      <p>I wish that Mr. Gesner would consider changing his place and enriching his family; for if he were treated unworthily with you, I would make an effort that he be treated more worthily with us and according to his merits in literary matters. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, September 27, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Geryon.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the church of Z端rich, lord and best friend. In Z端rich.</p>
