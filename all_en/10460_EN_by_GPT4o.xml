    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger should consider Capito's opinion that one should not proceed with accusations against the Arian Antitrinitarians, but rather that they should prove the negative proposition of Christ's non-divinity. Zwick considers it more just, instead of the rare negative proof, that the Evangelicals should prove their statements of faith and remain accusers, and he requests the return of the letter.</p>

      <p>I also want to advise you, most esteemed man, to carefully consider Capito's argument, by which he thinks the Arians can be easily refuted.</p>
      <p>First, he argues, if I am not mistaken, from creation. The Arians do not deny that all things were created through Christ, but they do not admit that Christ himself created all things, nor does it follow: All things were created through Christ, therefore he himself is the God creator.</p>
      <p>Secondly, he thinks that the role of the accuser should be given to the Arians and they should be pressed to prove this negative, that Christ is not God.</p>
      <p>Here, remember that it is very rare for anyone to be justly compelled to prove a negative. It is more fair and just for us to prove what we affirm, and then also to remain the accusers. But if we want to throw the role of the accuser back onto the defendants, we might seem to not fully trust our cause and suspect it to be somewhat unstable.</p>
      <p>I ask that you return the letters after reading them.</p>
      <p>Farewell and forgive me for bothering you with such crude letters.</p>
      <p>To Bullinger.</p>
