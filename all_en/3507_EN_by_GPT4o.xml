      <p>Greetings, my father.</p>
      <p>I write briefly, as the courier is in a hurry. Regarding that Englishman, I have nothing to report to you.</p>
      <p>I do remember a certain person passing through here, who claimed to come from there, but my memory is not fresh enough to determine who he was or whether I learned anything more from him. Today, I sent the letters you wrote to me about this matter to our Calvin, so that, if possible, he may relieve you of this concern, which I would gladly do myself, having experienced how burdensome such troubles can be.</p>
      <p>However, I hope that shortly, that is, within three days, I will come to Bern, and from there I will write to you in detail about certain matters, which I prefer to omit now rather than explain insufficiently. Then I will also send you Camerarius's notes, for which I am very grateful to you.</p>
      <p>Regarding our Goldius, I do not think he could have been better provided for. I placed him with our Beraldus, a man truly of exceptional learning and piety, whom we have now appointed to the school, having dismissed the excellent old man Corderius due to old age. The young man himself seems to be of good character, which I infer from the fact that he voluntarily requested to be placed where he would be held under stricter discipline. Indeed, my father, besides considering that I owe this duty to all students and to the church of God itself, I will gladly strive, both for the sake of his noble and pious father and because of your and Mr. Wolf's recommendation, to provide him with everything by which I think he can be helped and sharpened in all piety and learning. Farewell, my father.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you safe and sound with all good things. I wish Mr. Martyr, my other parent, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Gwalter, and all my fathers and brothers there to be well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, February 16.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered father, the truly faithful pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
