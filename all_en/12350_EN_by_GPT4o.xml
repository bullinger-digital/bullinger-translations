    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian should [return] the booklet [the Augsburg Church Service Order?] and [express] his opinion on it. [Wolfgang] Musculus unjustly complains that it was Bullinger who sent [Johannes] Haller to Augsburg. Initially, Georg Frölich had written to Bullinger [No. 2164], asking him to suggest a faithful and gentle man for the Augsburg church. Bullinger then recommended Matthias Erb, who was reluctantly working for Count Georg of Württemberg (this was entrusted to Vadian alone). Subsequently, the Augsburg council requested Bullinger with an official letter written on parchment [No. 2204] to persuade Erb to accept the call to Augsburg; however, in vain. Bullinger informed the Augsburg council [not received] about Erb's refusal, for which the council thanked him [not received]. In September, Frölich visited Zurich and requested on behalf of the Augsburg council for a moderate Zurich preacher. After Frölich's departure, the Zurich council deliberated and wrote to Frölich that they could not fulfill the Augsburg request. But before the letters arrived in Augsburg, the Augsburg council sent a messenger [...] to the Zurich council with a renewed request for a preacher. The Zurich council then asked Bullinger to propose a candidate. The Augsburg messenger waited a full eight days in Zurich for the decision; and so it happened that [Johannes] Haller was sent to Augsburg. - Haller's companions [Huldrych Zwingli the Younger and Hans Wilpert Zoller] reported upon their return that he was received with honor. This is also confirmed by letters addressed to Bullinger from [Hans] Welser [No. 2293], [Georg] Frölich [No. 2289, 2294], [Claudius Pius] Peutinger [No. 2291], and Nikolaus [Müller known as] Maier, the former chancellor of Duke Ulrich of Württemberg. Other brothers [including Ambrosius Blarer] also expressed their joy over this dispatch. - Haller was also recommended to Musculus [letter not received]. In his response [No. 2287], Musculus showed little joy over this dispatch but was reprimanded by the mayors [Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser]. Bullinger will respond kindly to Musculus, even though he wished that [preachers] like Musculus [were clearer] in their sermons. Some points of faith are understood much better by the authorities and the people than the preachers explain them. - [Haller] preached for the first time on November 22 in the church [St. Moritz]. Whether he will stay or wants to stay in Augsburg is open. If he is allowed to speak the truth, he will stay. However, if Musculus causes him difficulties, he will return to avoid disturbing the church there. If the Bucerite Musculus truly had the city's approval, they would not have asked for [Haller]. The latter will prove to be moderate and will also try to win over Musculus. Bullinger will also ensure harmony. - Bullinger suffers from terrible headaches. - [Johannes] Herwagen and [Johannes] Oporin visited Zurich. They spoke of a Spanish bishop [Pedro de Malvenda] who passed through Basel in great splendor. Vadian should read and return Myconius’ letter [No. 2301], which Herwagen and Oporin brought with them. - [P.S.:] Vadian should forward the letter intended for Frölich [not received] to Augsburg. If no messengers to Augsburg can be found in [St. Gallen], Vadian should send the letter to [Ambrosius] Blarer in Konstanz. Bullinger detained the [messenger Alexius] Knoblauch for about two hours in Zurich.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I am eagerly awaiting the booklet along with your opinion, most kind sir. I did not send Haller, as Musculus complains; but to make the whole matter clear to you, here is how it stands. Mr. Georg Frölich wrote to me privately; he requested a learned, faithful, and gentle-natured man - if I knew of any, I should indicate him - whom the people of Augsburg could appoint to their church. I suggested Mr. Matthias Erb (which I want to be said to you alone), who was most reluctantly serving Prince Georg of Württemberg. Soon after, the consul and senate, with written and sealed letters made of parchment, requested that I try to persuade him, if perhaps I could move him. I tried, but in vain. I wrote the reasons to the senate. Again, they expressed great thanks for the efforts made. Hence, I did not think anyone would be requested from us. But in September, Mr. Georg Frölich came to Zurich, especially to visit me and see the city. Meanwhile, in the name of the senate, he requested from the ministers of the Zurich church a man of moderate nature. We promised him nothing, except that we would consult on the matter. After he left, we consulted and for many reasons wrote to Frölich that there was no one at present whom we could spare; therefore, the people of Augsburg should see how they could manage their affairs. Meanwhile, while these letters were on their way, by divine providence, the most illustrious senate of Augsburg sent a public notary or courier to our magistrate and humbly requested a minister from him. Our senate appointed senators to consult with us on the proposed matter. We explained to them what had been done by us so far. The senate ordered us to choose a minister. The courier waited a full 8 days; finally, Haller was presented and sent to Augsburg. Those who returned with him reported that he was received with great favor by all good people and with great honor. This is confirmed by letters sent to me by Mr. Consul Welser, Mr. Frölich, Peutinger, Mr. Nikolaus Maier, who was formerly the chancellor of the Prince of Württemberg and is now the syndic of Augsburg; this is also confirmed by other brothers and friends. I had recommended Haller to Musculus. He responded in such a way that I could easily understand from his response that he was very displeased that a minister was called from Zurich, and because he wanted to cause trouble, he was summoned by the consuls and warned to pursue peace. I will write to him kindly. Meanwhile, I wish those people had more sincere minds. They teach doctrines in some matters, especially concerning the sacraments, which the magistrates and the best of the people understand more correctly. These do not want to accept this kind of doctrine, which is such that the people do not understand it; thus, the teachers themselves cannot explain it clearly. He first preached on November 22 in the church of St. Moritz; but whether he will be appointed to that church or wants to remain there, I have not yet said. If he is free to speak the truth and enjoy the conditions under which he was called, he will stay; otherwise, if Musculus begins to cause him trouble, he will not disturb the church but will return. But if Musculus, who is entirely a Bucerite, had the approval of the city, they would not have sent for him. He will act most modestly, do not doubt. He will try to win over Musculus, although he is more learned; however, he has a more splendid cause. Moreover, he will give the learned and senior man whatever he can. I will be entirely devoted to ensuring that they act in harmony and that peace is maintained between them. I cannot say more now; for I am greatly troubled by dizziness and am almost killed by unspeakable headaches. Hervagius and Oporinus came here for the sake of their spirits. They report that the Spanish envoy of the Emperor passed through Basel with great pomp. But receive the letters of Myconius, which these men are now giving, and return them. Farewell, December 4, 1545.</p>
      <p>I did not have time to reread.</p>
      <p>I beg you as humbly and diligently as I can, to ensure that these letters, addressed to Mr. Georg Frölich, are soon delivered to Augsburg. I assume you have a great number of couriers at your disposal. But if there are no messengers immediately at hand, I ask you to send them to Constance to Mr. Blaurer, and ask him to send them to Augsburg immediately. I will be yours in similar and greater matters. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I detained Knoblauch for about 2 hours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Dr. Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord.</p>
