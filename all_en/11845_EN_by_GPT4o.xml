    <p xml:id="regest1">The occasion for writing is the messenger who delivered Calvin's greeting. In view of the dangerous circumstances of the time, the pastors of Geneva and Bern should work towards settling the dispute that their lords are carrying out over formerly episcopal territories; if the papist Emperor [Charles V] defeats France, he will subjugate Germany and restore [Duke Henry of] Brunswick[-Wolfenb√ºttel] as well as especially [Duke Charles III] of Savoy to power; the danger then threatening Geneva and Lausanne is shown by the mandate against the city of Hildesheim [cf. No. 1797]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Savior Jesus.</p>
      <p>Having found this convenient messenger, who greeted me in your name, Calvin, most learned and pious man, I could not refrain from writing these few words to you, my esteemed friend and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>I hear that some discord or at least a quarrel is arising between your people and the Bernese, concerning some boundaries and territories formerly subject to the bishop's rule.</p>
      <p>If what is said is true, it would be your duty, as well as that of the Bernese ministers, to urge your people not to quarrel over these fleeting and unstable possessions or titles, but to reunite again in holiness through the authority and judgment of some arbitrators. There is no reason for us to litigate and contend even over the greatest matters in our time. The papist Emperor, that Caesar, threatens our necks, who, if he either breaks the King of France by war or leads him to some insidious pacification by arts, nothing else remains but to subjugate Germany to his lust, and especially to restore Savoy and Brunswick. And before this, that one, since he is connected by affinity, and because the bishops of Geneva and Lausanne demand it earnestly. You are not unaware, I think, of what he ordered the city in writing at the complaint and calumnies of the Bishop of Hildesheim. He will undoubtedly order the same to the Genevans and Lausannians, the complete restoration of the Antichrist. But if in the meantime we have worn out our strength by being distracted among ourselves with quarrels and dissensions, we have certainly opened the door to the enemy, both cruel and sacrilegious. Therefore, if at any other time we have urged our people to utmost peace and concord, we must urge them in this most dangerous time of ours. Especially we must urge those entrusted to our faith to sincere repentance, to solid trust in grace, and to the most ardent prayers, if perhaps the merciful Lord may deign to avert the evils impending over our heads, who is never absent to those who sincerely invoke his name. I commend you to this grace along with the holy church of the Genevans and with all the fellow ministers and your whole household.</p>
      <p>Your brothers Megander, Bibliander, Pellicanus, Gualtherus, and the others greet you. 14 Oct. 1543.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the man of distinguished piety and doctrine, Mr. Johannes Calvin, venerable bishop of the holy church of Geneva, his esteemed and dearest brother.</p>
