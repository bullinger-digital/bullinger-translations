      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>I heard from Rodolph Hermann and Benedict N., our neighbors, that you are well, dearest brother, which is the reason for my great joy, and I wish it to be perpetual. I and mine are all well, thanks to God. The greetings from you were most welcome to me, and each of them brought testimonies of your perpetual love for us, which, as it is, may God the best and greatest preserve for us forever. Now I have no doubt that, due to your paternal affection for me, you have inquired diligently about my fortune and affairs. However, since what is perceived from the reports of others rarely escapes suspicion, lest some things are believed to be fabricated, some things are presented differently for favor, etc., you may hear from me directly. As far as domestic matters are concerned, fortune has changed nothing from the past, and I indeed experience such a master as the son of Isaac, Jacob, is read to have experienced long ago, who, sent naked to his uncle, although fortune would have rendered him an adversary, returned to his own enriched by him with offspring and wealth. Not that I compare myself in any way to that most worthy patriarch, nor do I say that I possess such great resources; but the Lord has provided beautifully and very kindly for me, who was naked and (as you know) almost cast out by my own, and has not allowed me to lack anything that would suffice for my sustenance and that of mine. I have many friends, some also intimately. I preside over the school as before, namely, I alone sustain a great multitude. To my daily labors has been added the duty of preaching in this manner: D. Jakob Wurbenius, towards the end (if I am not mistaken) of January, fell into such debility that he never indeed lay down, but nevertheless could not perform his duty. He is still nourished by the hope of better health. Meanwhile, at the beginning of his infirmity, for several weeks I entirely took over his duties, so that I was almost overwhelmed by the burden myself. But D. Michael took the whole burden upon himself during the time of the papist fast, explaining the history of the Passion, leaving me only the Saturday and evening sermons. And in this way, we were both long and much fatigued. Finally, he returned to his own duties, and I said that the care of the school along with the catechism was sufficient for me. Then again, our council began to discuss the election of another minister (however, D. Jakob was allowed his stipend without any reduction); but D. Jakob obtained that the election be postponed to the end of September, unless he recovers in the meantime. Therefore, the lords requested from D. Michael and me that we fill in for the infirm in the meantime; but we, pleading the weakness of our strength and the magnitude of the labor, prayed that nothing be imposed on us beyond the labors initially enjoined and undertaken in our ministry, and we obtained this, except that I have to give a morning sermon every Saturday. Pardon me for pursuing these matters at length; if I had come to you myself, perhaps I would have distracted you from your studies longer, as I am accustomed to be importunate and troublesome to those whom I find to be my dearest friends. But enough of this for now.</p>
      <p>In the Biel/Bienne region, not far from the town, there is a spring very beneficial for those washing and especially effective for sharpening the eyes; there, for a long time now, many monuments of ancient buildings have been found. The host of that place planted a small vineyard in the sunny part of the house facing south; at its summit, while digging near the beginning of May, he found a treasure of 1406 coins surrounded by very wide bricks. The largest part of these bears the face of Gallienus, many represent Claudius, some exhibit Salonina, a few of others mixed in (but before I could see them, they were taken by others). I was able to have a few, which I sent to friends. I give you two, one to your wife and one to your daughter Anna, whom I hear is joined to D. Huldrych Zwingli, my once most delightful comrade, which I hope will be for the honor and benefit of you all and us all. I pray, however, that you kindly receive these small tokens of affection and gratitude and continue to love me as always.</p>
      <p>My dear wife greets you, as do D. Wurbenius, D. Michael, and Lord Jakob. Convey my many greetings to all yours and to your son-in-law. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Biel/Bienne, 5th day before the Kalends of September 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, his most revered father. Zürich.</p>
