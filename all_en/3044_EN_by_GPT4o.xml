      <p>Greetings. I would gladly write something certain from the Netherlands if I had it; everything is doubtful about the peace, and I wonder where such a flow of gold comes from for both monarchs to prolong the war for so many years. But in the meantime, the farmers, citizens, and especially the cities are being plundered. The imperial diet is convened by the Emperor for the calends of January, about which I see the people of Strasbourg are hopeful, as they think they will be freed from idolatry through their intervention; but I fear that it may be in vain, especially with the Emperor so embittered against religion and with so many states of the empire acting so tepidly. We hear that the Rhaetians are acting strongly for the propagation of piety and that, according to a new decree, the Valtellina will be annexed. A most excellent man, who was with us, conveyed much about Poland; we offered him the services we could and would have offered more, had it not been for the noise of the fairs. This was the reason why your Frisius was not treated as he deserved and as your perpetual kindness towards us and all others merits. But he interprets the willingness for duty as prompt.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my brother, and greet all yours. Basel, November 13, 1556/1558?.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>These things perpetrating to the pulpit.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
