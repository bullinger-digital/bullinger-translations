      <p>Greetings. Today after lunch, I wrote a letter to you, which I sent through the steward of Küngsfelden to my brother in Baden, because I will not write anything about this messenger who brings this to you. Meanwhile, letters have been brought to our senate from Valais.</p>
      <p>The senate immediately convened at 4 o'clock, and the prefect of Aigle, who was here in the city to present his accounts, was sent home immediately to oversee everything. Tomorrow, two envoys will follow to inspect the saltworks, supposedly ours in Aigle, but they are mainly sent to oversee the affairs in Valais.</p>
      <p>For the envoys of the Seven Cantons have arrived there; what they intend to do is not yet certain, although it is more certain than what they will accomplish. Our people are very concerned.</p>
      <p>As soon as I learn what is happening, I will inform you. Since this messenger presented himself to me in the evening, I did not want you to remain unaware.</p>
      <p>I would like you to inform my brother of these matters with a single word, so that he does not think I have deceived him, since I wrote to him that nothing is certain to me about the envoys. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Bern, July 21, at nightfall.</p>
      <p>The treasurer Dilger greets you, with whom I had dinner and from whom I learned all this.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>To D. Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
      <p>To M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
