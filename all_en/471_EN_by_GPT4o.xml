      <p>S. As for the fact that you have expressed your plan, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, you could not have given it more skillfully or sincerely, even after long deliberation. Since one or the other must inevitably be offended, we will not be concerned with the offenses of those who, in their unique wisdom, which is the most foolish folly of the flesh, believe they can reconcile light with darkness and Christ with Belial, while their conscience meanwhile responds poorly before God. I received letters again from Johannes Schmid, minister of the Memmingen church, who, in his own name and that of his colleagues, expresses great thanks, affirming that this plan is approved by him in every way. I sent the man your autograph, as I had no time to copy it, but with the condition that he would return it to me with the next messenger, which he faithfully did, etc.</p>
      <p>I seem to marvel at the counsel of Brentius, a most excellent and learned man, by what spirit and reasons he was led to dare to give it to the princes, who otherwise indulge themselves more than enough in the business of Christ. This case of such a great man seems utterly dreadful to me, especially since he allowed himself this outside of his own danger; let us fear for ourselves from human weakness and earnestly and perpetually pray to the Lord to clothe us with His strength and, however standing, to hold us so that we do not fall, being fully convinced of what was said about our flesh, which Christ said universally: "The flesh is weak."</p>
      <p>Ah, how true we find it to be, what the same Lord said: "Without me, you can do nothing." It will also be most true again in our weakness, what the Lord said to the apostle: "My strength is made perfect in weakness," and also what the apostle himself said: "I can do all things through him who strengthens me." Therefore, let us try to obtain from the heavenly Father through His only Son, what we can neither have from ourselves nor from anywhere else outside of Him, which we must have, unless we wish, God forbid, to disgracefully fall away from Christ and perish once and for all.</p>
      <p>I reverently kiss in Christ the steadfast spirits of Prince Christoph and Count Georg; may the Lord preserve and increase them, so that they may bravely break through these fierce threats from the left and the pillow-makers from the right, striving straight towards the predetermined sign of the heavenly inheritance.</p>
      <p>What was written from Magdeburg to Count Georg, was also written to the Bishop of Constance, to which, however, when it was read by his chancellor among the papal feasts, he burst into laughter as if at fabricated trifles, as this kind of people is accustomed to believe only those words and writings which they most eagerly wish to be true. The Lord, I hope, will preserve somewhere those through whom He will break this unbearable tyranny of some and vindicate His elect, and that as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>I wished grace and the spirit of God as moderator and director through Christ the Lord for the Synod of Bern, so that the pastors of the Lord's flock, imbued with the same solid doctrine of piety and kindled with the same zeal for innocence, may beautifully come together and be examples of virtue to the sheep of Christ and authors of the spirit of unity to be preserved through the bond of peace. You cannot believe how much I rejoice for the Bernese church in our Musculus, whom I have always found very faithful and zealous in the work of the Lord, nor do I doubt that it will fare well if it is built up by the common ministry and labor of Haller and Musculus. For this to happen, your authority will be especially needed, as far as Haller is concerned; for with this, you will easily ensure with him and with your senate that they do not fail in their duty; I think, and even without a reminder, you are considering this.</p>
      <p>What you conjecture about the ship running against the current without a sailor and without any oars was very pleasing to me. May the Lord make it so that we soon see you as a prophet here! Certainly, it cannot be that the Father of mercies and God of all consolation does not hear the prayers and tears of so many of His dearest children.</p>
      <p>Would that we might someday be allowed to sing with exultation: Blessed be the Lord, who has shown His marvelous mercy to us, etc. Uncommon things have happened to our city against the opinion of all good people; perhaps there will also be uncommon things with which He will again dignify it on account of not a few of His servants and handmaidens, so that where affliction abounded, consolation and blessing may abound in turn. Ah, let us pray to the Lord.</p>
      <p>As for your wish that some of ours might look for seats among yours and the Bernese, I too would very much wish it, and I am very grateful that you wanted to advise this out of your constant zeal and love for us, and at the same time opened the hope that we will not be expelled and that some place will open up. I think we will soon attempt this, after Ferdinand requested at the last diet from the Swiss that they expel us, which I also very much wonder that you so strongly concealed in your last letters. Four days ago, almost all the exiles of the city gathered to see what needs to be done next. My brother has not yet returned, whom I expect at any moment; after his arrival, I will inform you as soon as possible of what he has decided, gladly using your friendly advice.</p>
      <p>Regarding Calvin's version, I easily accept what you write; would that there were someone else who would undertake this work, which would greatly benefit the church of Christ! It is indeed a worthy book, which at this time all who are more devoted to sincere Christianity should read, so that they are not deceived.</p>
      <p>I informed Funckli of what I wrote to you on his behalf and what you in turn replied to me; but since he was also a citizen of Constance, he is in the same boat with the others. If yours and the Bernese are not going to expel us, then your advice will be entirely fortunate for him.</p>
      <p>Now, my venerable and by far dearest Bullinger, that gift of yours, which you call small out of your modesty, seems to me very great and indeed divine, I received it with open arms, as they say, reverently, so that I consider myself not so much honored as blessed; so much does the reading of those most learned and most Christian sermons console and delight me, which, however, is now interrupted by the one who binds the books and deprives me of great pleasure. I have been so bound to you, my brother, for many years now, that I cannot be more so, and yet you, with your fertility, continually bring forth new bonds into the light, by which you bind me even more strongly. May Christ in turn embrace and bind you with the most intimate bonds of His mercy and love, as with the arms of His eternal love, so that you may never fall away from Him anywhere, and may He pour out His longest blessing upon you like a torrent, with your whole household, whom you will lovingly and respectfully greet on my behalf, as well as the brothers, your fellow workers in the work of the Lord, with our Gervasius.</p>
      <p>My wife and sister greet you most dutifully and commend themselves diligently to your holy prayers. Farewell, my soul. When you have conveyed my greetings to Hopper, you will also give the letters addressed to that John Ulmar to be delivered to England, asking in my words that he ensure they are faithfully delivered to the young man. May the Lord accompany the excellent man in the camp of his good Englishmen, so that they may rejoice that he has safely reached them. Farewell again. 13th day before the Kalends of April 1549.</p>
      <p>We have no special news. The colonel returned to Constance last week, and from that moment on, almost all the soldiers, with very few exceptions, have been furloughed; no one knows what it means. Some say fresh soldiers, some say Spanish banners, are to come there; they are said to be planning an incursion into Thurgau, etc.</p>
      <p>Funckli, about whom I wrote to you, since he is now at TÃ¤gerwilen near the city, is worried about the parish and has had his stepbrother Ulrich Kundigmann inquire with Captain Ecklin whether there is any truth to it. He replied that he knew nothing of any Spaniards; but he does not think that the Confederates will remain unchallenged.</p>
      <p>The prince, when he was in Ulm, at the request of many well-meaning people, secured the release of Frechtum and his fellow prisoners; however, none of them are ever to return to Ulm, and they are to pay for what they consumed; otherwise, nothing is written that he has ensnared them. After that, the prince moved to the Netherlands; this is said to be difficult for him; after that, he is to come back here.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, an incomparable friend like a brother. Zurich.</p>
