      <p>Therefore, you should know that I have achieved absolutely nothing in this mission of mine. For His Imperial Majesty so favors Lord Beatus, the adversary of our bishop, that he wishes for Beatus to be entirely promoted. Having fulfilled my duty, I have nothing left but to report the outcome of my mission to the lords of our League of God's House and also to our bishop. They will then further decide what should be done next.</p>
      <p>We indeed find ourselves between a rock and a hard place regarding the League of God's House; for although all justice and fairness are on our side, so many powerful states and princes rise against us that we have reason to be fearful.</p>
      <p>... as it greatly concerns the promotion of our religion. For if our adversaries prevail, which God forbid! they would not rest until they spread even further. But enough about this; I only add this: the Cardinal of Constance, while we were discussing our case before the Emperor, as we have learned, attacked us with all his might; indeed, apart from your consul, I found no one in whom we could place even the slightest trust.</p>
      <p>In Memmingen, on the 21st of May, 1566.</p>
