      <p>With utmost respect, wishes happiness through Christ.</p>
      <p>Reverend man, I have often had the intention to write to your kindness for various reasons, but being distracted by the magnitude of affairs, I could not sometimes write what I wanted. However, what I cannot do in writing, I have continuously wished for you and all yours with all my heart, and I still wish for it every day. But the malevolence of certain sinister minds has once again emerged publicly in the sacramental matter, an old cabbage, which I cannot express in words how much I grieve from the heart.</p>
      <p>In my judgment, it would have been more prudent in these times to soften the matter, which is of a bitter nature, with civility, as truth is bitter to most by itself, rather than to add hatred to hatred. Not that my conscience accuses me here, but because I grieve for the public calamity of the Christian religion. For many write and dispute many things in these times, [a. R. "who challenge you to the arena,"] some out of a desire for a celebrated name, others out of a lust for avenging Luther, many to gain favor, but very few are stirred by the stimulus of conscience, who, as is worthy, desire the tranquility of the church to be consulted. But, alas, enough and more than enough has been shouted in this contention.</p>
      <p>People want to quarrel and mix everything up sooner than to yield to the clearest truth. Many good people grieve with me, not so much for their sake as for yours, that those who ought to teach charity have made the symbols of charity the foundations of discord. This matter shakes even the most faithful hearts. If some who write were to look at nothing else than the glory of Christ and the salvation of the flock, then in the defense of truth, they would have acted far differently towards those whom they consider erring than some angry revilers do. For the evangelical spirit has its own prudence, its own gentleness, and civility. Thus, Christ himself adapted himself to the affections of the Jews. He speaks differently to the coarser crowds than to the disciples, whom he himself, enduring for a long time, gradually leads to the understanding of heavenly philosophy. This gentleness of teaching, this prudence of dispensing the divine word, has conquered the world, and what no arms, no subtlety of philosophy, no eloquence of rhetoricians, no human force or matter could ever compel under the yoke of Christ, this could be done by apostolic simplicity and the authority of the divine word. Therefore, whoever desires the tranquility of the church to be consulted, let them strive for concord, which is so necessary for the church that without it, the church loses the name of the church. For what else is our religion than peace in the Holy Spirit? Let us therefore cry out in these crowds to Christ, the prince of peace, who will immediately awaken and say to the tumultuous sea of this world, be silent, and soon great tranquility will follow. May Christ therefore grant that with a constant heart, not only from us but also from our adversaries, not only in the future colloquy but also among us in the future synod (to which I hear you are also to be called), true and Christian truth may be sought, so that Fabricius's symbol may be verified among us all, who thus said: Let them be one, teach one, and confess one, who have one name from the name of Christ. May Christ grant us this unity, who alone is, in whom, from whom, and through whom all things are. These are, my Bullinger, what I wanted to give to you at present, otherwise being very busy. Therefore, continue and diligently procure the common tranquility of the church. Farewell, most learned man and most beloved to me in the bowels of Christ, together with your most honorable wife and your children [...] for Nestor's years. Your son Christoffer the baker came to me, whom I received for your sake and offered him my assistance, whatever it may be. There are others here like that noble man Georg von Stetten, who also both the elder and the younger wish him well from the heart. Then I ask your kindness to greet on my behalf the most learned man, Lord Theobald Bibliander, my old host; I would not hesitate to call him [...] as Pliny attributed praise to Aristotle, saying, Aristotle, the greatest man in all knowledge, so I say of Bibliander not ineptly nor falsely.</p>
      <p>Again and again, farewell with all the good people known to me, namely Gualter, Zwingli, and others, etc.</p>
      <p>In haste, very quickly, Augsburg, the first of August, in the year 1557. Yours sincerely, Johannes Ehinger, from Augsburg, whom you once received as an exile.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Lord Heinrich Bullinger, with much piety, outstanding erudition, and sincere doctrine, a most prudent preacher of the divine word, most worthy and to be honored with eternal veneration, these letters are given.</p>
      <p>In Zürich. To Zürich.</p>
