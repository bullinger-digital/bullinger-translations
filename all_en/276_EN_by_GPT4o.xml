      <p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. That I have not sent you letters until now, most esteemed and revered man, since I departed from you, was due to no negligence or slowness; for although tardiness is usually a companion of old age, and even if we had erred, you would forgive us this fault with your kindness, there is no reason for us to be accused of any carelessness, because there was another cause for our delay. For since I wanted to see first what the outcome of our affairs would be, whether sad or happy, so that I could write to you with certainty about us, I also awaited letters from Venice for Master Bibliander, and even reluctantly delayed until this day. Now, however, lest you remain in suspense in thought any longer, I have decided to make known to you whatever we have at present, whatever they may be.</p>
      <p>When I returned home, I explained our confession in my first sermon to all who were listening, and I showed the subscriptions and seals both of yours and of the other churches by which it was confirmed; in the following sermon, I recited your letters and those given by the fathers of Basel and Chur, which all urged concord and agreement in doctrine, in our language, so that all might clearly understand. We narrated from the pulpit to our entire church all the kindness shown to us by all of you together, and by each one in particular, how honorably and with what great love in the bowels of Christ Jesus you received us, your labors besides, which you undertook both in hearing us, in examining our cause, and finally in writing your opinion, and lastly the order of your church, doctrine, morals, manifold wisdom, readings, sermons, kinds of languages, all of which filled everyone with great joy and they gave praise to God.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the syndics of our church have imposed upon me to give thanks to you on behalf of the whole church as much as I can. For they confess that they are more indebted to your dignities than can be expressed, and they offer themselves and all that is theirs to you and ask that you deign to command them.</p>
      <p>As for the state of our affairs: know that Stancarus has left here. For when he was still causing a commotion over a certain writing, which he had either voluntarily from the hands of Master Comander or extorted by his importunity, I do not know, of which I send you a copy, I asked him not to trouble me further, which he did; but where he has gone, I do not know. Those who adhered to Camillus are still of that opinion; however, I hope in the Lord that soon they will return to the way. I would not wish to judge him; for he will stand or fall to his own master, and I hope he will not fall by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Franciscus Niger, the bearer of the present letter, is of the opinion of Franciscus Stancarus, although he was otherwise of a different opinion, namely that the sacraments are like instruments by which God imparts grace, by which he remits sins and justifies and regenerates. He did not believe this before; now he believes it, persuaded by Stancarus, nor would I write this to you (I ask you, do not be offended by my words, which I say unwillingly, indeed compelled) Franciscus Niger is an easy-going man; I did not want to tell you this when I was with you, for there was no cause then; now, however, there is a cause and indeed an urgent and great one.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, when he had received a little child from his wife, he came to me with a witness and revealed his confession of faith about baptism, wanting, as it seemed, the child to be baptized in his faith. I replied to him that I would baptize the child in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and in the faith of the church of Christ, not his own.</p>
      <p>For even if he himself were to err in faith, the child would not be badly baptized because of it, nor did I intend to observe any other form in baptizing his child than I had observed until now. Otherwise, he is a good man, but not sufficiently constant and firm. For although he was a very good friend to me and I to him (and I confess before God, I have never extolled a man with as many praises as I have magnified him), nevertheless he failed and violated the rights of friendship (unless I am mistaken). You will judge. I send you a copy of his letters, which he gave to the entire synod of Chur, where Comander, Blasius, and the other ministers of Christ were present, without my knowledge, before they were read. He did not warn me, said nothing.</p>
      <p>He wanted Franciscus Stancarus to be the bearer of the letters, whom he recommended. I heard; I read the letters with great sorrow of mind, utterly astonished that it could have happened that Niger could have written against me. Because in recent days he said he would come to you, I wanted to warn you, lest what happened to Comander, although you are more cautious and vigilant, should happen to you. Comander, in good faith, as he is a good man, gave a certain writing to Stancarus, which he should not have given, because it harmed our church and detracted from his own honor. For he confirmed our confession with his subscription and seal after you. In that confession, it is contained that the sacraments do not confer grace or justify, but are signs of those things; however, in his writing, he affirms that they confer grace and justify. I wanted to excuse this among our people by saying that sometimes what is attributed to the sign is not of the sign, but of the thing signified. But some respond to me that Comander is not consistent with himself. For although his words can have a correct meaning, it was not necessary at present to give that writing, which can generate doubt among the unlearned, to Stancarus, who seems to favor Stancarus and contradict the confession and even himself. Because of this writing, Niger does not assent to the confession, but to Stancarus, and again he wants to question you about this matter, as he promised on the day when he came to me for the baptism of the child. You know what should be answered to him. He was the author of our church, as is evident in his letters, that the confession or opinion of yours and the churches on this matter should be adhered to; nevertheless, he departs from his own counsel.</p>
      <p>I have received letters from certain nobles, to whom I had written about Stancarus, asking them to inform me about the qualities of the man known to them. They sent these letters from Venice, which I send to you, so that you may have them read by some Italian, if you wish, and explained, since they are written in our common language. The first is Balthasar Alterius, who is the secretary of the English envoy in Venice, the second is Dominicus Manzonus, appointed by the Venetian officials as syndic; the third is Marcus de Lilio, a Venetian citizen, a pious and faithful man. Balthasar Alterius writes about Stancarus thus: "I have known the mind of Stancarus for a long time and I know very well on which foot he limps." This is the conclusion: "He has always been poor, scandalous, and of foreign opinions, and he has a certain instability, so that he does not know what he is fishing for, rash much more than you say in your letters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, flee from him for the love of God and remove him from your sight as quickly as you can; otherwise, you will never have peace nor will your church." Manzonus writes thus: "As for your desire to be informed about Master Franciscus Stancarus, I will tell you simply and in truth all that I know and feel about him. First, it is openly and manifestly known that he is light, unstable, a lover of himself, and, to put it briefly, rash in all his affairs, and the worse thing is that he wants to espouse his opinions, although they differ from the common and truly Christian rite." Then after a few words, he adds that he was a priest; he does not believe, however, that he was a Jew, although he seems so in appearance, and he adds that he took a poor wife in Venice who had gone astray.</p>
      <p>"I will keep silent about the manner of his marriage," he says, "but I will say that he kept him at my house for a long time at my expense and did so unwillingly because of his restlessness." Marcus de Lilio writes little; he compares him to a snail, which leaves its marks wherever it passes, and that he is recognized by all. "I will reply," he says, "to you more fully another time." These things, most Christian and esteemed man, I did not wish to send or write because they delight me, but because I promised you, and so that you may recognize what kind of people they are who disturb the churches. Nevertheless, I do not want Franciscus Niger to be aware of any of these things that I write to you. Beware, I ask you, that he knows nothing of these things.</p>
      <p>When you have had the letters read, if you wish, fold and return them all to me enclosed in a paper, just as I send them to you enclosed in these. I do not write at present to Master Pellicanus, our most reverend father; greet him, I ask you, in my name. I will soon write to him and to Master Rodolphus, whom I also greet from the heart; for I owe them very much. Greet Master Frisius, Master Ghisnerus, and all the other fathers of your church. I heard that Master Musculus is there; tell him on my behalf, if he wishes to come to us, I will not abandon him as long as I have any substance left, and he will find deeds truer than words. Here there is a rumor that Strasbourg has accepted the diabolical Interim, which I cannot believe; but you know the truth. Forgive me, I pray, my lord, that I am so long; for I cannot be satisfied in conversing with you. Farewell in Christ Jesus and know that Augustinus is most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, 22 September 1548.</p>
      <p>Your servant Augustinus Maynardus.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed and wise lord, Master Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zürich and his most revered lord. In Zürich.</p>
