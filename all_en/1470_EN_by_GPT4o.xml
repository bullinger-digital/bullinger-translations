      <p>God and all good things. I wrote to you on October 29th by a fabric merchant from Zurich who was here at the market, I have no news, as I do not think, you have heard it before from Bern.</p>
      <p>You will know that the Emperor has moved from Augsburg to Innsbruck, where he intends to winter, so that he may be closer to Trent. Two men had to carry him under the arms down the steps in Augsburg, as he wanted to sit in the carriage. Someone writes, having seen it, how utterly miserable and deathly he appeared. Thus, by the judgment of the Lord, this living corpse attempts to harass and conquer the Christian world. May the Lord grant that we, having been made better, may deserve to see better times.</p>
      <p>The Emperor sends three regiments of soldiers in, writes Mr. Hans Welser, whom you know or his name; he has also publicly declared war in the Netherlands against France, and it is generally expected that in spring the war will be very forcefully waged against France and that the Confederation will also be involved in it. He also writes that the Turk with his fleet is again heading to Constantinople and that he is not worried about his half, for reasons, etc.</p>
      <p>Of the 2000 soldiers accepted by the French in the five places, you know better than I, also about the efforts that Zurich and Bern should also help, likewise that the French have pursued and captured some Spaniards, etc. Some sensible and experienced people write that practices have been made, that France and the Confederates must let go, if God lets Charles live for a short time longer. I want to believe it must be, if now still one, on whom everything depends, will indeed say yes to it.</p>
      <p>Mr. Wolf, pastor in Bischofszell, has sent me his son and requested that I commend him to those in Winterthur and give him a testimonial, so that he would be accepted in the place of the late pious Mr. Heinrich; I have refused him for various reasons. He does not yet have sufficient reason to leave his church, where he also has at least as much income as in Winterthur. Secondly, he has such a bad, miserable, quarrelsome wife, that it would be a pity if she should also cause offense elsewhere. I leave aside the other reasons concerning his person. May the Lord have mercy on us; may He grant that this church will be well and abundantly built up, amen.</p>
      <p>Keep me always recommended to God and in temporal matters along with yours and faithfully pray for me and mine.</p>
      <p>Greet your household, also all good gentlemen and friends. I can write no more.</p>
      <p>Xystus Betuleius, the proper schoolmaster in Augsburg, has also wanted to leave; he has been requested to hold one or two lectures a day with the young and otherwise be unburdened. [They] have otherwise appointed another schoolmaster over the school; he will not stay long. All catechisms have been removed from all schools in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>They cannot write to me enough about the misery; may the Lord see to it!</p>
      <p>Mr. Peter Bufler has also died in Isny, his wife before him. Praise be to God that they did not have to experience the misery! Dated November 14th.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Let us watch and pray to the Lord for His church, if ever before, now certainly most of all. It is more necessary than...</p>
      <p>To his venerable and most beloved Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
