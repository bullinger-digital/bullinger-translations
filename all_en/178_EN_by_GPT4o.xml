      <p>S. P. D. I return all your letters, most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, with great thanks. I believe, however, that some of the letters I sent have reached you, and I hope that once you have used them sufficiently, you will ensure that I can use them as well.</p>
      <p>For I was barely able to open certain letters before I was compelled to give them to a courier who was in a great hurry to deliver them to you, so they would be delivered more quickly and surely. At present, I have nothing new except what is written from Nuremberg to our people: that Elector Maurice has joined certain envoys of princes and cities at Hassfurt, a city in Franconia, to consult about appeasing and petitioning the Emperor, so that he may fulfill, sincerely and openly, the promises he made in good faith to certain cities and princes regarding the cause of religion. It is believed, however, that the fire that will arise from this single pamphlet, the INTERIM, will be as great in Germany as it has been nowhere since the beginning of the shining gospel to this day. May the Lord continue to protect and preserve His own.</p>
      <p>There is also an Interim in our confederation, unfortunately, as I have heard from my lords' messengers, due to the swearing of the oath. I cannot believe that such stubbornness could exist without an extensive scheme (may God grant that the source is revealed). I have also heard of the Christian mediation of my gracious lords of Zurich and Bern, which, however, has not been achieved, and some places of our religion, because they are bringing the seven places to swear to them, have proposed to let the oath be held according to the words in the confederation letters, willingly or, if no better solution is found or achieved, to let it happen without being unwise. In this case, it will be very serious to consider what the two highest places, who are accustomed to giving the oath, will be responsible for before God, so that the honor and majesty of the same are not surrendered or underestimated for the sake of temporal peace or enjoyment; for in such a case, we would have to expect certain punishment and retribution.</p>
      <p>At present, one should not bring the temporal governance of our fatherland to such unity and trusting assembly through the confederation oath that in such difficult, tumultuous times, the enemy might not take comfort in any hope from our discord, etc.; for the disunity of the opposite side gives the enemy the greatest courage to defeat his opponent, as you know. But it will certainly result from this that the Swiss cannot and will not agree to swear their confederations together, and therefore it is to be expected that they will not be assembled in the same way as before. They are now planning to push us into the corner, confirming and strengthening themselves.</p>
      <p>When I see and finally learn that our confederates from the seven places (with whom Glarus and Appenzell should also somewhat agree) are not willing to do otherwise, and our advantage is that they will swear to us, to which they have willingly offered themselves (as I hear) and have urged the remaining places to swear, then I would, for the sake of divine honor in this tension, without harming my rights, somewhat relent in temporal force. For it is an undoubted blasphemy for me to place a creature next to the Creator in the oath and thus take away from God the praise of His omnipotence, into which I will never enter, neither to swear nor to hold anything else, etc., so that I do not act against the command of God, who wants it to be sworn by His name.</p>
      <p>And thus the aforementioned place among the nine places, namely Lucerne, will be allowed to give the confederation oath in the words conceived, since they will not do otherwise, and all our fellow believers will swear by God our Creator and leave behind the proposed holy ones, for whom it would be a pity that we should ever swear in their name alongside God. Thus, we will be sworn by the nine places, and we will swear by our one almighty God to help them in maintaining our temporal force and all peace against all violence with body and goods, etc.</p>
      <p>I have not wanted to hide my good opinion from your Reverence, my lord Bullinger, in such anxious times; for nothing is to be trusted in the Emperor.</p>
      <p>As I hear, he refuses to allow the Elector of Brandenburg to keep the letters and seal given to him, to remain in his religion, and thus the devilish specter of the papacy still runs its course, that one is not obliged to keep faith with heretics; and yet it is not clear and proven whether the pope along with his followers are heretics or whether those who resist his wicked life and teachings for the love of truth are to be considered as such or not? Although I have little doubt about it. But all this will be made clear by time and certainly by the last time of the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ. Farewell in the Lord and always love me.</p>
      <p>Our abbot has again, without any of our thoughts, begun to sing the little song about the tolls and field and forest money, which we receive from his God's house people, in Baden and behind our backs, and yet last year he had his people pay all that he had complained about against us.</p>
      <p>There will also be a new devil in the details. Our desire is only that we are maintained in what we have clear, pure, and obvious rights to, according to letters and seals and honest, thorough, and fair reports, and while one wants to quarrel, we will tell the abbot where he has caught the cough; although I finally think that the abbot would not be bad if others would let him remain in peace. In summary: some would like us to keep the mill with all costs in building and honor and let the whole world take the grain from it for free and leave us the chaff for the reward. Many people would like us to be dead so that the sun does not shine on us. Commend me to the councilors.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the day after the calends of July, in the year 1548. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most famous church of Zurich, his most beloved lord.</p>
      <p>I send your Reverence herewith two copies - they have come to me from Augsburg - in which the efforts of the godless, the troubled states of the prelates and the princes, etc., are attacked on the proposition of some middle articles of the Emperor, etc. If they are allowed what they desire, the religion stands right, and they act as if they would rather be Turkish than evangelical, if any change in their actions and omissions should happen with any reformation. Thus, in these last times, the abomination stands in the holy place, and that kingdom of the Antichrist, which will be overthrown by the single word of the Lord. It is most regrettable and lamentable that they are not ashamed to adorn their newly introduced teachings and errors with the title of true and old faith, and call themselves Catholics, that is, orthodox (as they understood it), who in truth are found to be not orthodox but cacodox in all contentious articles. The word is that the Emperor has found a tolerable middle ground; but I perceive that it is a mishmash that contains nothing else but a wonderful papacy in itself.</p>
      <p>The Elector Palatine and the Elector of Brandenburg have never come to any mass at the Reichstag. Recently, the Emperor has urged them to at least attend for honor's sake, etc.; which has also happened. In summary, it is believed: with what he could and might win over the pope and deter him from the French and the Venetians, he would engage; for his foremost court is papist in all things.</p>
      <p>These are the honorary judges of the doctrine of Christ. Farewell.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a long-esteemed friend. Zurich.</p>
