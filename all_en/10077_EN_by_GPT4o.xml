      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God through Christ.</p>
      <p>Ah, dear Heinrich, I can write neither German nor Latin with a heart full of sorrow, having received such an unexpected reply from you, especially since I am already bedridden, brother Caspar is silent, the old Frantz is overwhelmed with all matters alone, and not a single one is found in all of Bern who could provide a sermon amidst this chaos of all things and people!</p>
      <p>I have read the unreasonable demands made for the fourth article, unable to sufficiently marvel and mourn that it comes to this for such a prophet and a people, and, to speak freely with you, I am thrice and four times miserable; I would sooner beg and gather sustenance from door to door than agree with them. It is a tyranny more than papal, which we barely extracted from the hands of our own, and now they not only inconvenience their own churches and ministers but also set an example and provide a pretext for ours as if by prescription. Among our people, a single bitterness has made the gospel of some hateful, not against vices, not against any impiety, but against the stirring of spirits to arms, even among the best, where the modesty of one Heinrich Bullinger could restore all. I have remained silent, unwilling to extinguish prophecies, neglecting to test, believing that everything was from the true prophet Zwingli.</p>
      <p>In summary, our situation is as follows: our peasants from the entire region have had their message to Bern, and although many misfortunes have been brought about by the suggestion of the Antichrist, yet the Lord most powerfully overturns the plans of all the impious. Those from Bern, with all their territory, have unanimously agreed to remain by God's word, the accepted reformation mandates, and have not changed anything except that, to avoid envy and so that the function of pastors is not made odious, all preachers have been forbidden to be marriage officiants in the land, but this is entrusted to the officials by oath. They also do not want to keep their pastors like hired blacksmiths from one St. John's Day to the next, nor give the peasants the power to dismiss them at their pleasure, but have ordered all matters of the parishes to be handled in the form of a church court or synods. Our peasants did not want to tolerate the word "God be praised," but my lords did not allow it. Our lords have also often asked us in a seated council to brotherly inform them of what concerns us against them, and likewise they. Would that God had granted a meeting before these miserable wars and allowed everything to be spoken to you to satisfaction, which cannot be written.</p>
      <p>In summary: I beg you, my heart and brother, to seek a reason, as best and as rightly as you can, to come to us; have the articles at hand, do not break them, but let them remain by their decision, but if they are not suitable for you, do not accept them, not for your sake, but for the sake of all the church of God. For surely: as they have been a mirror of all churches, so they want to be a mirror of all apostates, so that all cities will follow. I say this so that it is good to speak and deal with our community, prudently, not precipitously, with zeal according to knowledge, not from one's own and what they call good intention, but with truth, without the mark of gall.</p>
      <p>This I fear, Megander (God knows how much I love the man from the heart and he reciprocally me), even if he stays with us, will promote little of God's glory; they are so embittered by his more than free and apostolic bitterness. He has a pious spirit, sincerity of life, learning not to be despised; but while everything is permitted to us, we must consider whether everything is expedient. That is his span. When our lords finally wanted to let the provisions go to the pleasure of the Zurichers, he spoke openly in the assembly: "Your council and citizens have acted shamefully and dishonorably, so that you can never justify it with honor before God or the world, and your wives would have acted more wisely and honorably if you had sat behind the distaff!" - You indicate with one word whether this befits our function in such a small matter.</p>
      <p>In summary again: be assured of all good in Bern; if you come, your brother will be provided with a welcome immediately, next to the city, if not, I do not know how it will happen now, for there are also many of our poor. I beg you for God's sake: come, come, come, come! The messenger will personally ferry you. You have a just and holy occasion; if you do not come, I will think of either leaving Bern or the office.</p>
      <p>Farewell and make it so that I can greet you joyfully when you come. I know you will relieve me of the gout!</p>
      <p>11th of December, at the eighth hour of the night.</p>
      <p>You resemble seriousness. I know Megander will be more useful in Zurich than with us.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold H.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, now in Zurich.</p>
