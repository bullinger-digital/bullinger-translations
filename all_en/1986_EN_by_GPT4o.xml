      <p>Greetings. We have received the expense sheets and receipts along with your letters. Continue to record what you have spent or received, and always be mindful of this frugality: "What you do not need is expensive even at a penny, and do not think about what you want and desire, but what you absolutely cannot do without." If you make unnecessary expenses beyond necessity and are not frugal, there is a risk that the authorities will regret their decision. Since March, 80 French crowns or gold coins have already been sent to you; now I am sending 40, 20 for each of you; 20 German gold coins were given to those leaving at the end of January. This total amounts to 145 German gold coins, 72 1/2 for each of you.</p>
      <p>I mention this to encourage you towards frugality, not to reproach you for extravagance. Furthermore, keep it firmly in mind that you should not make these expenses in vain, but rather diligently and with all your strength focus on the task for which you were sent, not only by us but by the most distinguished consuls and the most honorable senate. You will constantly consider the great expectations placed upon you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, combine diligent work and tireless effort with earnest prayers, through which you seek divine assistance. For you have long understood that medical skill is indeed acquired through industry, but nonetheless, it is a gift from God and bestowed from heaven. Live righteously, avoid all profanity. Be humble; for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</p>
      <p>Be convinced that all time not spent on study is lost to you, and the loss of time is so great that it can be repaired by no means whatsoever, and time itself rushes by swiftly. By God's grace, we are all well here, and all our people are well; we live in holy peace. Pray that this may be long-lasting for us and for you to the glory of God. Farewell. Greet Mr. Besard, Mr. Peter, etc. September 2, Zürich 1553.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the young men of great promise, Kaspar Wolf and Georg Keller, Swiss from Zürich, devoted to the study of medicine in Paris, his dearest sons.</p>
