    <p xml:id="regest1">Provides information about the whereabouts [of the manuscript of the "Alexandreis"] by Walter [of Châtillon] and the possible publication [of the "Carmen paschale"] by Sedulius, as well as the costs of several books. Has taken on, with Otto [Werdmüller] on behalf of Oporinus, the commentary on some speeches of Cicero; their contributions are to appear under a pseudonym. Spoke with Myconius and Grynaeus about Vadian's letter [No. 894]. The harmful dispute over the doctoral degree will probably be reported by Myconius; Gwalther would be reluctant to see Karlstadt return to Zurich. Offers to forward letters to England. Plans a visit to Adam Frey. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letters along with the coins, most kind patron, in which you wish for the return of Walter of Châtillon to you; but as I wrote before, Gregor Mangolt received it from Platter. Whether Sedulius will be printed in Basel, I do not know; however, I do not think it will be published there. I purchased the Chronicle of Augsburg; it costs 12 Constance batzens, Vigilius 2 blapph[art], Vives On the Soul 8 blapph[art]. If there is anything else for which you need my services, let me know, and you will not find me uncooperative.</p>
      <p>Know, however, that I currently have some things in the press, which will come to light at the next fair. For Oporinus is printing in one volume the commentaries on all of Cicero's speeches. However, ten speeches were missing, which no one had undertaken to explain. When Otto chose these for himself or was persuaded by Oporinus to undertake them and could not execute what he wanted in such a short time, he sought my help, outlined the method and manner of treatment.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I chose the two later speeches On the Agrarian Law (for the first is mutilated). Since I had scarcely ten or twelve days' time and therefore could neither apply the utmost diligence nor spend much time on the precepts of rhetoricians, both Otto and I thought it best to suppress my real name and substitute a fictitious one; for he did the same. Thus, it is not known who the author is, and when there is more leisure, I can review them and claim them as mine. I will write more extensively about other matters soon.</p>
      <p>Regarding Vadian's letter, I met with Myconius and Grynaeus; I do not know what they will do.</p>
      <p>However, you will have more certain information about that most pestilent dispute from Myconius's letters, I suppose. They want to create doctors; it is to be feared that they will achieve this, so that both the school and the church will lack true doctors. But God will judge these things. There are those who say that Karlstadt is breathing again in Zurich; but as far as my judgment goes, I would not want such a man to preside over the fatherland.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write, except if you have something to write to England, send it through Mr. Butler; for he is a certain merchant very familiar with Myconius, who will soon go to Antwerp and has promised to take care of the letters.</p>
      <p>Adam Frey is now trying new medicines. I will meet him next Sunday; for he is only an hour's journey from Basel.</p>
      <p>I ask you to consider these things with fairness and goodwill. Greet on my behalf your mother and wife, most kind ladies, and all the children. Farewell, dearest patron, and continue to love me as you do.</p>
      <p>From Basel, at the house of Mr. Myconius, May 23, 1539. Your most observant Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron.</p>
