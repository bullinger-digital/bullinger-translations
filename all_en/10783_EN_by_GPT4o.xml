    <p xml:id="regest1">The woman in whom [Hans?] Kilchrat is interested—likely primarily because of her wealth—is capable and ready to meet with him. A rumor from Zug states that the Bernese suffered heavy losses at Chambéry[?] but achieved a victory; Rudolf Schulthess is said to have captured a banner and was wounded in the process. Greetings. He requests that his sermons and a document about the war be temporarily sent back to him.</p>

      <p>Greetings from Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear brother, as you desire an answer regarding Kilchrat, I have spoken with her myself. If it is her will (since the old man is mature), as long as he is neither too old nor too young and wants to do his best for her. She is upright, simple, of good character, and of a pure nature, where nothing else is but housekeeping and laying seams. She has 600 guilders, which is more than the person. Therefore, I do not want to interfere. I am also burdened with other matters, so I did not want to do it, etc. He may consider her; she also wants that and to learn what his nature and goodness are, etc.</p>
      <p>I ask you, let me know what news there is from the Bernese; for a rumor comes from Zug that they have again been very badly beaten before Chambéry, and also that the Bernese have lost a thousand men, but kept the field. Also, Rudolf Schulthess is said to have captured a banner and was severely wounded in the process.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet the family.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes.</p>
      <p>Send me my sermons with the document about the war that I have included. If you have more time, I will return it to you.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, his brother.</p>
