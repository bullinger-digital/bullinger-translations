      <p>Greetings. For the past 3 weeks, I have been suffering from unbearable pains in my loins - I do not know whether it is sciatica (which tormented me terribly three years ago for a full 6 weeks) or if a stone is troubling me; certainly, I am constantly afflicted with dysuria, so you will forgive me if I am brief in writing; for now, in 3 weeks, I have only entered the church once; I also could not persist in the synod. As for what you wish to know from your last letters, I have received all your letters, two before, now one. I give thanks to you and to Mr. Lentulus, whom I ask you to greet most dutifully on my behalf, for those letters. I will send to Mr. Coccius his latest writing, as he requested. As for news, I have little or nothing to write.</p>
      <p>The mission is postponed, I fear not with good counsel. We heard in recent days that a large sum of money was brought to Solothurn and an envoy is expected there. What will happen, we will hear shortly; I do not foresee anything good. It is certainly to be lamented that the Turks are triumphing; but this is perhaps by God's counsel, and here we will be given, I fear, Salmanazar and Nebuchadnezzar, a worthy reformer; for we do not want to hear the word of the kind father. There is a rumor that the king is now besieging three cities, Lucerne and two others, whose names have escaped me. Some say: "Even if there was some hope of peace before the king entered Italy, there is none now, after he came from Italy." Italy is the source of all calamity; so they and all who are Italian will receive their deserved reward, and let all the people say amen! Various rumors are circulating besides. I cannot and will not write more.</p>
      <p>Greet the lords, brothers, and our friends. Farewell eternally with your household.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 22, in the year of our Lord 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Especially greet and console the best and dearest man to me, Mr. Johann Baptist MÃ¼ller, whose plight I deeply regret, and since I can do nothing else, I pray to God from my heart to have mercy on him. May the Lord preserve him.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, my honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
      <p>To H. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin.</p>
