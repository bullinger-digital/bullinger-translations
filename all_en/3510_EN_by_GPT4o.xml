      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I have not received any letters from you for a long time, dearest brother; therefore, your latest ones were all the more welcome, to which I am not permitted to respond more fully due to various and urgent matters. The main topic you address in them is the colloquium.</p>
      <p>What other fellow ministers think about it and what I judge with them, you will understand from the enclosed letters. I send these to you as a friend, indeed as a most esteemed and intimate brother, but with the condition that you do not share them with anyone at all, keep them solely to yourself, and then return them safely through the next reliable messenger, so that these more secret matters do not fall into foreign hands.</p>
      <p>I have attached to these the notes I made last summer on Mr. Beza's confession, which you also requested so eagerly.</p>
      <p>Be careful that this writing does not leak out either, but is kept only in your hands, and indeed I cannot do without them any longer; therefore, act promptly. There is no time to write about new matters; indeed, I could hardly write this to you.</p>
      <p>Live well and farewell, and pray to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you; greet our friends, Mr. Jakob, Funcklium, when he returns, Mr. Fuchs and Mr. Wittenbach, for me. ZÃ¼rich, 17th February 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, faithful pastor of the church in Biel/Bienne, his most esteemed and dearest lord and brother. Biel/Bienne.</p>
