    <p xml:id="regest1">Gast has heard rumors of a discord in the [Z端rich] church, which pains him greatly. Why do the people of Z端rich not instruct those who are inclined towards new teachings, in order to nip an emerging conflict in the bud? The Papists and the opponents will rejoice over the discord. Since different things are being said about it, Bullinger should clarify the matter for Gast in more detail.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger will be better informed about other matters than Gast. The Schmalkaldic League has been extended by 20 years. [Elector Friedrich II of the] Palatinate, [Philipp the Elder III] of Nassau[-Weilburg-Saarbr端cken], and [Count Wilhelm IV or Georg Ernst of] Henneberg-[Schleusingen] have been admitted to the League; [Friedrich II of the] Palatinate has decided in favor of Lutheranism, so that the priests are fleeing to the territory of [King] Ferdinand [I], where they were lacking.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- To Margrave Bernhard [of Baden-Durlach], residing in Neuenburg [am Rhein], the son of the gravely ill Margrave Ernst, Jews have come with a gilded cup and money, asking him to allow them to maintain their old customs after his father's death. He has stalled them, and when they persisted, he threatened them with death for the time after his father's passing. Sadly, they departed. More about the vile behavior of Margrave Bernhard in the next letter. The rest will be written by [Oswald] Myconius.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. You cannot believe how much I have been affected by sorrow these days, when rumors were spread by some about a discord in your church. It appears that Satan cannot cease in his duty. Why do you, who are wiser in the spirit of gentleness, not instruct those who are slightly puffed up by new doctrines, and not uproot the budding discord before it turns into a crowd? Your church, which has been excellently established so far, purged of envious and contentious people, and now, when peace and unity are needed, do you begin to contend in this dangerous crisis, losing yourselves and the church over frivolous questions? The Papists and our adversaries will rejoice in their hearts. However, although rumors have been spread about your disputes, they have been varied and inconsistent; therefore, I beg you to inform me of the source of this tragedy, so that I may either pray to God for you (which I do constantly not only for our church but for all) or close the mouths of some who rejoice in lies, so that this rumor does not spread further.</p>

      <p>As for other matters, you probably know better than I do, since nothing certain is said. The Schmalkaldic League has been extended for 20 years. The Elector of the Palatinate, the Baron of Nassau, and the Baron of Henneberg have been admitted to the League. The Elector of the Palatinate has given his name to Lutheranism; priests are fleeing and confirming Ferdinand's region in the faith, which has so far lacked many priests.</p>

      <p>To Margrave Bernhard, now residing in Neuenburg am Rhein (the son of Margrave Ernst, who is suffering from a very severe illness), the Jews have come, of whom he has many in his father's land. They brought him a handsome gilded cup and money within it. They asked him, when his father dies, who is now very sick, to allow them to remain by their old customs. He gave them no answer, saying he had business. The next morning, he took it. The Jews asked for an answer. He stalled them. The Jews did not relent. Then he became angry, returned the cup with the money to them, and said: "Go away, you cursed Jews with your gifts, and know this, when my father dies, you will have to leave the land, or I will kill you all." Thus, the Jews departed, sadly. This Margrave Bernhard caused much trouble with the peasants and the priests. He is a remarkable character, about whom more in the next letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell. The rest will be written by Myconius. Basel, February 9, 1546. Yours, G.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most diligent pastor of the Z端rich church, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
