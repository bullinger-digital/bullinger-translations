    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes on behalf of the Bernese council very confidentially about rumors of foreign war preparations for the eradication of the Reformation. The Duke of Savoy is putting pressure on Geneva and does not want to recognize the Swiss arbitration award of Payerne, although Bern is advocating for it. The Five Places boast that Zurich is on their side. They are waiting for an opportunity to go to war against Bern. After the efforts of the Basel authorities to restore harmony between Bern and Zurich have so far been in vain, Bern wants to make a new attempt: The bailiff of Lenzburg [Sulpitius Haller] is to meet with "courageous" Zurich councilors based on Bullinger's advice; only if his report is positive will the Bernese delegation expected by the Zurichers come to Zurich. Bullinger should do his best in this regard. Haller had Bullinger's writings on predestination, free will, etc., copied. The Zurich Confession [No. 482] is to be negotiated the following day. Complains that Bullinger has not responded to all his letters. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. What I write to you here, dearest Heinrich, since it is done by the order of our local leaders, should be buried with you all the more, as they deem you worthy to entrust their matters, which are indeed not trivial, to you as a primary friend and sincerely favorable supporter. Various war rumors are also brought to us by friends, which threaten not only us, not just one or two cities, but almost the entire Christian Germany with destruction by the imperial, papal, and Spanish forces, as if they are about to put the final touch to exterminating the doctrine of the Gospel. The tragedy of the Genevans presents a more deadly and internal war. For as far as concord is concerned, nothing has been achieved yet. The Duke of Savoy completely denies the conditions of peace and the entire composition of the war decreed at Payerne by all the Swiss, where Vadianus was also present. The Bernese will not yield to this. They will implore justice as a judge. If this is denied to them, as a rare bird now, they will think of other plans. Meanwhile, the Five Places boast and threaten that Zurich will be steadfastly on their side. They seek an opportunity, however much they pretend to seek peace in all things, to either draw swords against us in the name of others or provoke us to act first against them. Since the Basel authorities and some others have attempted to reconcile our cities and restore the former friendship, albeit in vain, because there are no longer any secretaries among you to whom these efforts can be safely entrusted, nevertheless, our senate is again pursuing this, on the condition that our bailiff of Lenzburg, with your faithful advice and assistance, meets with the more courageous citizens, at least the deacons, to see how it might be possible for the spirits of the cities to unite more strongly. You might say: Why don't you send envoys to see the matter being seriously addressed? Certainly, what has been denied to others so far has made our people faint-hearted. But when you, with the pious and more courageous ones, have consulted and can truly consult, after exploring the minds of many beforehand, our bailiff will report back to us that our hope is not in vain, and you will see a serious delegation. You might then object to the certain conditions of public peace being denied, so that private cantons no longer erect private cities among themselves. Do not be disturbed. Everyone knows that something adverse was done with the Fribourgers against peace. Therefore, many cities, many documents, and oaths will not be needed, provided that the spirits are reintegrated with love. I therefore implore you in the name of our people, who wish to ask you through me, to apply the utmost diligence, as if you were doing it by your own ingenuity and counsel, and what you find, communicate with me through the bailiff, my godfather. You have what I wish and what our people wish.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I had your propositions on predestination, free will, magistracy, nobility, taxes, tithes, and the Sabbath transcribed and read. They seem to leave more than they promise on the surface. I will consider them at leisure. You understood that at some point I was also urged to preach a similar sermon on predestination. Many defend themselves with Zwingli's booklet. But more on these matters another time.</p>
      <p>Today we have a market here. Tomorrow we prepare with the brothers to consider your confession. Good things must have time. I will add one thing, that if you had responded to all my letters through that Burkhard, I would have hoped for much happier outcomes. I am glad you continue writing on Paul's epistle to the Corinthians.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me sincerely as you always do, for you are the dearest of all mortals to me.</p>
      <p>14th of December.</p>
      <p>The brothers and fellow ministers greet you. Franz can no longer. Nollius and others greet you. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Year 34.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
