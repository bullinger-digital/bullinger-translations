      <p>When Mr. Christophorus Thretius, distinguished in learning and piety and well-deserving of the church of God gathered among us, was brought there by the illustrious and magnificent Mr. Stanislaus Myszkowski of Mirow, the primary patron of this church, we could not refrain from also giving this Mr. Thretius our letters to your excellencies, in which we express a small token of our grateful memory and respect towards you, the distinguished servants of Jesus Christ. Indeed, neither by speaking nor by writing can we express how many and how great benefits and comforts all the Christian brothers in this city, troubled by the dire impression of the blasphemous doctrine of the Tritheists and Arians, have received from the most faithful, pious, and wise advice, judgments, and exhortations of yours and the other distinguished ministers there, transmitted to us through the work of the same Christophorus Thretius. May God, the best and greatest, deign to repay you all these things abundantly, we wish. Furthermore, we did not think it necessary to commend Mr. Christophorus Thretius to your excellencies, as his virtue and piety, as well as your old and familiar benevolence towards him, which has not been obscured, would sufficiently and more than adequately commend him. How things have progressed here in the church, the same Mr. Thretius will be able to narrate and explain to your excellencies in person.</p>
      <p>May Christ, our true Jehovah, extend your life, most fruitful for all the churches of God, to the years of Nestor.</p>
      <p>Given in Krakau on the penultimate day of the month of April 1567.</p>
