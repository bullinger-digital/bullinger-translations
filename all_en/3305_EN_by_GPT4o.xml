      <p>That Stanislaus, both known and dear to you, will report during lunch what I could scarcely write to you in three days. He was present at all the things which the Lord has accomplished in the cause of religion during this whole time (in which I have hidden like another Saturn). Therefore, having referred these matters to Stanislaus, I ask you, my most esteemed lord and brother, to use your authority to persuade the pious and excellent matron, Frau Lucia Bellora from Locarno, to accompany my wife.</p>
      <p>I write about this matter to many, but I know how effectively you are accustomed to persuade what you wish, that is, the best things.</p>
      <p>The Apology of the Waldensians, which I now send to you, needs the commendation or judgment of your church, wherefore, in the name of all the pious here, I ask you and all your fellow ministers to be seriously present with us here, so that the obstacles which Satan throws in the way may be removed, lest this most beautiful building should rise. I have given Stanislaus the places described for memory's sake which need examination.</p>
      <p>Those who are devoted to the Augsburg Confession abhor the doctrine of the Waldensians. And they also dissent from the opinion of Herr a Lasco.</p>
      <p>Herr a Lasco, in turn, does not approve of the Waldensians in all respects, nor does he agree with those devoted to the Augsburg Confession, as appears from his booklet, entitled: Purification of the Ministers, etc.</p>
      <p>The Waldensians, however, will not depart even a little from their confession and apology unless the judgment of the foremost men in the church of God, and that from the word of God, is added. Joined to them are several leading men from the nobility and aristocracy, who both think and live according to their prescription, preferring to be exiled rather than to use the ministry of others. This seems to me the immediate remedy, that the judgment of these churches may be exhibited as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>To this end, I send several copies of the Apology and two in which there is also the confession. I commend to you most diligently Herr Julius Maresius, the Dlusios brothers, and this Conrad, commended to you by his father, a pious and noble man. If Herr Johannes Beccaria has undertaken his care, he will do a pious thing and very useful for the boy; for he needs a strict guardian. But if he refuses, I do not see to whom he can be entrusted, except to Herr Wolphius, and for many reasons I would wish this, yet on the condition that he acts more as a stepmother towards him than a mother; you know the saying. He spent two years in Padua with no benefit, I wish not with the greatest loss; he is sent to you as to the most perfect doctors of souls.</p>
      <p>For your kind remembrance of me in your letters to the magnificent Frau Dlusiam, I give you the thanks I can, since it is not possible to repay.</p>
      <p>Farewell, man of God, in your prayers to God remember the Polish churches and your Lismaninus. From Tomice, September 8, 1557.</p>
      <p>I lovingly and reverently greet first your wife, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, grandchildren, and, if possible, even those who are born of them, then all who labor with you in that most fertile vineyard, my most esteemed lords and brothers. Your Franciscus Lismaninus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent in doctrine and piety, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, most esteemed lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
