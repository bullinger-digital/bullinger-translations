      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, I received your letter, honorable lord and compater, through those two Belgians or Flemings whom you recommended to me. Firstly, regarding them, they were not received here, as there was absolutely no use for them in our churches; for they do not speak the German language, so that they can be understood here, nor French, as in Savoy. Therefore, having obtained travel expenses from the senate, they were dismissed. However, I am very glad to hear that Mr. Martyr has finally come to you; I wish we were so fortunate as to be able to attract many such men to us as well! But you rightly write that all of yours are also ours; therefore, we congratulate not only you but also ourselves, the entire church, and Switzerland on such a great man and such a distinguished instrument of God. I ask you to recommend me to him on occasion, so that I too may come into his acquaintance and friendship, as he is now also a Zürcher.</p>
      <p>As for Mr. Nicolaus Bromius, the consul of Frankfurt, he did not come to us, and although I asked many senators today, none of them knew that he had been here. Therefore, I wish to know from you what he is doing, whether he has been in Zürich, or what you think he should do with us.</p>
      <p>I will keep watch in case he still comes; for he has been known to me for many years, since he acted in Basel with Mr. Grynaeus of blessed memory. He also did well by us Swiss when we were in Leipzig; for he has a wife from Leipzig, and when we were there, he lived there with his father-in-law and showed himself very kind to us. I would therefore like to show him some kindness in return.</p>
      <p>The Geneva affair is still pending, and the more we wish to unite, the more minds are divided. At the request of the Genevans, our people had set a day at Payerne to discuss renewing the alliance, and delegates had already been chosen: but for some reason, the Genevans refused to come again. Meanwhile, something else happened. The French king, because of the crops destroyed by the excessive heat of the sun, ordered in the vicinity of our territory and also elsewhere throughout the kingdom, that no crops be exported and sold from the kingdom. For he fears that a severe shortage of food will follow. Our people are upset by this, as many crops used to be imported from his territory to us. They have therefore written to the king about this matter. The king excused himself amicably, saying he did this for no other reason than fear of scarcity. Our people, wishing to look after their own, have likewise prohibited in Savoy that any crops be exported from their territory. The Genevans, thinking they are being played with, soon spread rumors about us, as if this edict had been published because of them, and I do not doubt that some of this rumor has reached you as well. But in truth, only this royal edict gave occasion for our people to enact this, with no mention made of the Genevans. Therefore, when the Genevans also complained to our senate about this matter, an explanation was given to them, with which I think they will be satisfied. This is how things stand now.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, various things are being said, but I do not know how certain they are, about the king's plans to occupy Geneva; also that the Cardinal of Guise has been made Bishop of Geneva, so that by this opportunity, plots may be prepared against them. But I can affirm nothing certain here. I fear that what happened to the people of Constance may happen to them. As for us, whatever happens to them, whether we like it or not, we will be involved in the same or perhaps even worse trouble.</p>
      <p>As for the one who offers this to you, you know what he was like once; I hope he is now different from what he was then; he has a good testimony from everyone. He comes there for the sake of settling some inheritance; I therefore commend him to you.</p>
      <p>In these days, on the 22nd of July, the wife of our Mr. Nikolaus Wytenbach, a most pious and honorable matron, passed away; also one of the tetrarchs or tribunes, Venner Pastor, died. Otherwise, there is nothing new that I know of. I have urged Mauritius several times to write to you; but I do not know whether he is prevented by shame or some other reason. He continually promises to write, but keeps delaying.</p>
      <p>Farewell and take kindly what I have hastily and rashly put together here after dinner. May all yours be safe; mine also greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, 24th of July, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his honorable and dearest lord and compater.</p>
