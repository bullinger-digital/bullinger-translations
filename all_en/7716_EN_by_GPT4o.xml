      <p>My father, I know how eagerly you await my letters; therefore, I ask you all the more to forgive me for writing so little, for I have nothing new that is sufficiently certain, except that it is reported from England that the Scottish queen has been confined in the Tower of London, condemned for the murder of her husband; it has been agreed between both kingdoms that the Queen of England will succeed the young king, and he in turn will succeed the queen should the other's children fail, and in the meantime, she will be his guardian and have him in her power to be raised royally. Meanwhile, Scotland is to be governed by the Duke of Moray, whom they call Milord James, chosen by the authority of the Scottish Parliament. If this is so, as even the adversaries affirm, nothing better could have been devised for that island, and I hope for the greatest good from it. They report that the army of Anjou was routed by Condé, with all its baggage captured and, as they say, a great booty taken.</p>
      <p>They add that your Cares have been treated very harshly. I am led to believe some of these things because the enemies most severely prohibit any news from being reported; yet I write these things as not sufficiently certain. They say that Orange is besieging Reims, which is also uncertain. The Count Palatine reviewed the army two days ago on the borders of Lorraine, if he kept his promises, namely 7,500 cavalry, 16,000 infantry with thirty cannons; many cavalry from the French, who had gathered at Strasbourg and Montbéliard, join them, to whom many from these regions also flock. May the Lord have mercy on this now miserable kingdom and grant that we trust not in horses nor in the sons of men, but in Him. The common brothers will write letters there, which you will receive along with these. There is no need for me to commend the business itself to you or the brothers, who are abundantly concerned with things that are so good and holy, and also so necessary; for you can hardly believe how many, indeed the most wretched and destitute, flock here.</p>
      <p>We still have quite a few hospices, though very cramped; but we are in need of food and clothing; we are greatly troubled about these things.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, with the whole college of brothers. May the Lord Jesus keep you and bless your labors more and more.</p>
      <p>Geneva, December 27, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a father to be greatly respected and the truly faithful pastor of the church in Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
