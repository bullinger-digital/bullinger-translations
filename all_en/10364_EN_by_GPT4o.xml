      <p>I have received and understood your letter. It is not possible for me to act at this moment. I have to preach twice. The caretaker has not given up. He is willing to do something. It has failed. The deed of the monks is bad enough. But the devil always targets the large crowds. However, I will see what and how I can negotiate with the mayor. I cannot go further. With this, I commend you to God. I will inquire about the booklet.</p>
      <p>Reminiscere.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his Stumpf, dean, Bubikon.</p>
