      <p>Greetings, my father, I write less often than I would like, because couriers do not present themselves.</p>
      <p>The state of our affairs is as it was before, although the threats of the enemies grow more and more.</p>
      <p>They thought this was the most convenient way to clear themselves, if they could turn back on us what is well known they themselves have attempted against us. They loudly proclaim that we have tried to seize some of their fortresses by treachery.</p>
      <p>Indeed, because we are so fierce, and so well equipped with money and soldiers, that we would want to provoke them first, and voluntarily, without any pretext of injury, to call for war, as if finally, if such a thing had come to our mind, we would be so insane as to want to seize in the middle of hostile territory what could neither help us in war nor be defended by us in any way. Therefore, their impudence must be incredible, who are not ashamed to invent such absurdities, and praise be to our God who forces them to descend to such vile plans, the infamy of which will undoubtedly rebound on their own heads. Meanwhile, we continue in our moderate state, and will continue as long as the Lord wills, being troublesome to no one and striving to gratify all as much as we can. Our Calvin, which torments us greatly, is afflicted with perpetual illnesses, and although he sometimes seems to recover a little, he is nevertheless so afflicted that we have much less hopeful expectation than we would like.</p>
      <p>I too have begun to suffer from asthma for some days now, and I have not been relieved by bloodletting. But I still hope well and consider my pains as nothing compared to his torments.</p>
      <p>In France, the papists, who thought that the church of God would immediately collapse upon the arrival of the Cardinal, have begun to riot in many places. In Rouen especially, a massacre was first committed by them, then repeated by some of ours repelling their force.</p>
      <p>A garrison of cavalry has been imposed on the city, who I wish would conduct themselves so as to punish only the wicked.</p>
      <p>That other Cardinal Granvelle, fearing for himself in the lower regions, has now arrived in Besançon. The Spaniard wrote back to the Frenchman that what his legate had done in Paris, wanting to compel the king to approve the council as if by a declaration of war, he had done without his order. He added that he himself was not even prepared to subscribe, and advised the king to observe that edict of peace inviolably.</p>
      <p>We received this yesterday from a certain friend in Lyon, a man of great authority, as most certain. The king is about to set out next week for Troyes, a famous city in Champagne.</p>
      <p>From there he will come to Bar on the borders of France and Lorraine, to see his sister. From there, having crossed Burgundy, he intends to come to Lyon.</p>
      <p>The provincials, having finally become more lenient, have admitted our people, and now churches are also being established there. Among the Occitans, the madness of Danville has not yet been restrained.</p>
      <p>But without a doubt, the king's arrival will also, as we hope, settle these matters.</p>
      <p>Finally, everything shows that the efforts of the adversaries are broken, as far as the Council of Trent is concerned: if they have entered into a new plan, I also hope it will be scattered. It was rightly done that those good princes were warned about the Augsburg Confession.</p>
      <p>For I feared this more than the rumblings of Trent. However, as far as France is concerned, I do not doubt that the Ubiquitarians will play all their tricks, whatever they may attempt. At Dole, a senate decree was made for Mr. de Ria against the Count of Montbéliard, concerning the castle they call Héricourt.</p>
      <p>Hence that collection of soldiers on both sides, which I wish would not provide an occasion for greater disturbances.</p>
      <p>Our neighbor has gathered six companies of foot soldiers among the Bressans, neighboring people of his domain; he himself is said to be coming there, to greet the king, his future godfather, in transit.</p>
      <p>May the Lord strengthen his own and break all evil plans! But enough of these matters. Of the seven students you recommended to us, only three have come here; we hear the others have stayed in Basel, where at least they will gain this advantage, that they will not find Castellio.</p>
      <p>They brought no money to me, nor did I ask them for any; you will write what you want done; for we will do our duty, and we wish this to be assured to you and the other colleagues that those who come from there will be no less cared for by us than our own citizens. Moreover, those two who are now coming to you have lived piously and honestly among us, which we also hope you will find out in reality. In the previous months, when Herther, one of them, came to me and indicated that he needed money because he had bought certain books, I gave him five crowns, which they call pistoles; he has not yet been able to return them to me, which I wanted to inform you of with his consent.</p>
      <p>All the brothers greet you and the other colleagues with me. I also ask that you share these things I write to you about French affairs with Mr. Blaurer especially and also with our Mr. Gwalter, to whom I am sending letters which I received fifteen days ago from P. Moio from Picardy. I would have gladly written to him myself, if I were not already exhausted from writing.</p>
      <p>But shortly, with God's favor, I will make up for whatever this loss is with interest. My father, I pray to the Lord Jesus, that he may preserve you all and especially you, and bless your holy labors more and more.</p>
      <p>Geneva, April 5.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered father, the truly faithful pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
