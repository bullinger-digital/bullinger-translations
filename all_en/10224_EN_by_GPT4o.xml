      <p>To the best and most upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest patron.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Snow, rain, and the force of the winds are preventing us from traveling. We are staying in Basel at Myconius' place without expense, waiting for clear skies and milder weather. All the roads are buried in snow, especially the mountains, through which no paths are currently open. However, what holds us back the most is that we have found here the French and some others who will soon be our travel companions. We ask your kindness to request letters from the Zurich council stating that we are from Zurich and have been sent by the Zurich council for studies. For this is what most learned men have advised, so that we may travel more safely. We beg and implore you not to neglect us. If you make the effort, you will easily obtain it. Upon receiving the letters, we will hasten our journey with our companions as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep us in your thoughts.</p>
      <p>At Myconius' house in Basel, February 25.</p>
      <p>Johannes Frisius and C. Gesnerus, entirely yours.</p>
