    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer hopes that the messenger sent the day before [...] has delivered his letter [No. 2762].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Today he received the [Hohentwiel] treaty. The despondency and despair [of Duke Ulrich of Württemberg] makes Blarer sweat blood! He wanted to copy the document for Bullinger, but learned that the council of Konstanz will send it with the current messenger [...] to the council of Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Just as Bullinger recently implored him [in a letter not preserved] [to remain steadfast], he now urgently asks Bullinger to advocate for the people of Konstanz in Zurich, especially since the intentions of Emperor Charles V are clearly evident from the Hohentwiel treaty. Constantly mentioning the House of Austria, he demands to be recognized as the natural lord. If the Confederates do not recognize the seriousness of the situation, soon all [the people of Konstanz and the Confederates] will face a disgraceful servitude under the Spaniards. Bullinger should think of Blarer and persuade the people of Zurich not to make decisions that cannot be justified.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Lord is not mocked, but demands that one acts uprightly and is not ashamed of His name. If only there were insight! If it does not come to that, the Confederates and the people of Konstanz will have to bear the dire consequences.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] During the week, a stately rider [...] rode through Thurgau and inspected the area. When he came across a wedding party in a small village, he sat down with the peasants, drank with them, and said, among other things: "Oh you Swiss, soon you will have one foot in the Rhine and the other wading in blood!" When some wanted to beat him up for this, an old man said to let him go, because otherwise [the people of Thurgau] would not be able to go anywhere without being beaten. How could the rider dare such audacity on Swiss soil and get away unpunished?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Bullinger should look at the Hohentwiel treaty again. It is as if the Emperor said: "I will leave you your principality for another eight days until a good opportunity arises for me to take it from you."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The young Duke Christoph [of Württemberg] has fled to Basel with his wife [Anna Maria, née of Brandenburg-Ansbach] and children, presumably to avoid having to ratify the Hohentwiel treaty. His settlement in Basel is also explained by the arrival of 1200 riders in Burgundy, who intend to take [the County of Montbéliard]. On his flight to Basel, there was an attempt to arrest him and his [son Eberhard].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The people of Zurich should pray and plead! The troubled time of the Maccabees has begun! If God does not send a Judas [Maccabeus] and a good, pious people do not gather around him, we are doomed. May God grant the will to turn to Him and keep His commandments to obtain His grace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] It is distressing to hear (even if Bullinger has not yet written about it) that the Swiss mercenaries who joined the Schmalkaldic League are now to be punished and that the people of Zurich even agree to this! This news is just as disappointing as the letter from the council of Zurich [through which Konstanz learned that the Confederates do not want to promise the city any help]. But God lives. He will help!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Last night, delegates from Lindau arrived. This city is also being urged by its neighbors to surrender soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] It is difficult for people to put everything in God's hands. Thank God for the steadfastness He grants Blarer. He would rather die than be involved in a disgraceful reconciliation. But only a handful of people in the council and among the citizens share his opinion. The majority think differently. He can clearly feel how weak the council is and how disappointed it is with the letter from Zurich, which only assured that "they would do what they could justify." Until recently, they spoke quite differently!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Blarer would prefer if nothing were expected from the people of Zurich or anyone else, but only from God alone. But since the majority thinks differently, Blarer hopes that this weakness can be remedied in a proper, honorable way to prevent much trouble.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] If only the Confederates could recognize the impending evil and reconsider their stance!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Take courage! The end is near. Therefore, it is probably too late for advice and help. This corresponds to the just judgment of God, who may eternally preserve the souls of His own.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Especially trusted brother, yesterday I sent you a messenger; I hope he has reached you well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Today, the Württemberg treaty or articles of reconciliation, as they are called, came to me, over which I could have sweated blood and turned to water, that we act so desperately and despondently! I would have copied the articles for you if I hadn't heard that my lords sent the same to yours with this messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>However, I wanted to remind and admonish you, and also testify, as highly and dearly as you have testified and sworn to me, not to neglect anything with yours, so that the common cause may be helped. For as you see in these articles, where the emperor's intention stands and is laid, and that one must recognize him as a natural lord (which no emperor has ever desired), and the House of Austria is constantly mentioned, so let it be of concern to you. For if you, Confederates, do not notice and understand this thing, I well understand that the punishment and plague are present and we all must soon come into the heaviest servitude of the Spaniards. God be eternally lamented that we must thus go to ruin with shame and disgrace and not suffer more knightly and bravely because of it. Now think of me, and see what you do. Speak courageously to yours, do not spare, so that they do not sit there and consent to matters, and say yes to things that cannot be justified.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Oh God, the Lord, does not allow Himself to be mocked or fooled. He wants one to act uprightly and not be ashamed of His name. Oh, that we would consider it! It will make us wise to our harm and too late. The bath is over you and us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>This past day in this week, a stately rider rode through many places in Thurgau. No one knows who he is. He inspected the area and came to a village. There was a wedding. He also sat with the peasants, drank with them, and said, among other things: "Oh you Swiss, soon it will come to pass that you will have one foot in the Rhine and the other wading in blood." Some wanted to beat him. An old man said: "Hey, let him go; otherwise, we would not dare stick our heads out, they would beat us." Consider what audacity and presage this is on your soil, and he had to go unpunished.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Dear, examine the treaty and Württemberg reconciliation properly and consider it diligently. Is it not pure tyranny and nothing else than: "I will leave you your principality for another eight days until my best opportunity; after that, I will take it from you entirely; I have enough reason and claim?"</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The young Duke Christoph has fled to Basel with his wife and children. Presumably, so that he does not have to ratify this unjust reconciliation. Meanwhile, it is written that they should have captured him and taken the young ones away. 1200 horses have arrived in Burgundy for this purpose, so that Württemberg would be completely taken. He was warned of this and thus fled.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Oh help us pray and plead! It is truly the time of the Maccabees, and if God does not awaken a Judas and a good pious people do not gather together, seeking nothing but God, His word, and the fatherland, then it is otherwise done. May God grant earnestness, conversion, and zeal, so that we turn to Him heartily, consider past evils, and with firm resolve, direct ourselves in God's pleasing way, so that He has reason to grace us and lay honor with us. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>It is terrible to hear that all yours, who joined the empire, are to be punished in honor and goods, and your lords and others also stand in such decisions. Many people say it openly, although you do not report it; for what your writing has caused suspicion, it does not stand as it should. But still, the old, strong God lives! To Him be praise and glory forever. He will still stretch out His arm and help us fatherly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Those from Lindau came here last night and are still here. Many good words are written to them. Some of their neighbors urgently advise them to surrender soon. What they will do, I do not know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Oh God, it is difficult for the flesh to put everything solely on God and risk it, and few have this gift, for it is the highest serenity. God be eternally praised and thanked, who has given me this heart at this hour! He may strengthen and hold it in me, that I truly, truly, dear and a thousand times with counsel and deed would rather help, perish and die, and do and suffer everything possible, than be involved in such disgraceful, desperate reconciliation, which I do not know how to see or hear, let alone be involved in myself. And although there is still a handful of such people in the council and community with us, the greater crowd is of a different mind. And yet now the weakness is so bare, and how highly burdensome it is taken and understood by your lords from the common councilman, that they write, they want to do what they can justify; which has sounded very different until now!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I would prefer, for my part, that no one looks to you or anyone else, but only to the one God and the means that one may freely have and bring to hand from His grace. But I see how the community is minded, and that it is not everyone's thing. Therefore, I would also heartily like that the common weakness be helped through a proper, honorable way, so that much worse is prevented.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Oh my God, if you Confederates could see with the right eye the impending evil, also from the world, you should soon consider something else and better!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Well then! I often think it is at the end and down. Therefore, there is neither help nor advice nor time now. And even if there are good means, one cannot use them. These are the terrible, but just judgments of God. May He eternally preserve our souls.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Greet all people. Dated January 22, evening 1547.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
