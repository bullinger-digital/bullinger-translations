      <p>Most magnificent Lord Heinrich of... always most esteemed...</p>
      <p>In the past days of... letters from your lordship, very pleasing to me, to which until now I have not been able to respond due to being ill, for which reason until this past 5th of March I had sent 20 scudi, but the one who was supposed to come to Zurich did not go, so he sent the money in such a way that now I send and they are 20 scudi in good hundred here. Then to Cornelius, I ask your lordship to ensure that he writes often and not as usual, for I have received few letters from him until now, nor have I received any notice if Cornelius has received a package sent last November and the slippers and leggings. Once again, I beg you to have him write Latin letters so I can see if he has learned or not, and also write in German. For now, I write nothing more than to lower my hands to your lordship and to the most holy consort.</p>
      <p>From Morbegno, January 27, 1572, regarding sending my sons to Zurich to be under a master, I am not sure about sending them this year.</p>
      <p>All of your lordship's most faithful servant, Thomas Guarinoni.</p>
      <p>To the most magnificent Lord, Lord Heinrich Bullinger... always most esteemed in Zurich.</p>
