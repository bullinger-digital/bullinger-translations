      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We have received two letters from you in quick succession, in the first of which news from Italy is mentioned, although little is heard about Cardinal Alexander Farnese and the Duke of Ferrara regarding armaments. We would like to know if Mayor Haab of Zürich was involved or intended to be involved in the Burgundian affair, otherwise only faithfully, how far his command extended. Regarding the council, several other points will be discussed at the aforementioned Passau day. As for the other letter, we have responded to the friendship and indicated that the expectations will be unburdened and settled; we would have liked to have known this some time ago.</p>
      <p>Regarding the new news, we think you should now be aware that around and near the Black Forest and of that kind, up to 40 companies of foot soldiers are to be accepted by the Emperor, and the process has already begun.</p>
      <p>Your indicated new news, that the Duchess of Lorraine and Queen Maria have made a plan to take Nancy and then move through Alsace and Breisach against the king, the queen and duchess do not need to take it, but they already have it; they are only looking to keep it. However, we cannot believe that the King of France is confidently moving towards Liège; he still has a good distance to cover. We also know that he is currently with part of his forces in the land of Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>Rodenbach, which belongs to the young Margrave of Baden, has been forcibly conquered and plundered along with several other towns and villages, among which some fortified houses have not yet surrendered.</p>
      <p>The clerical road up, like Mainz, Cologne, Trier, behaves as their loose custom is. We expect that after the day, the dirty riders and the poor blacknecks will reappear. May God grant that this time Germany may come to a blessed peace and tranquility, although it truly seems very unlikely. We did not want to withhold this from you in response to your letter. Dated Schaffhausen, the 21st of June, anno 1552.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] o[f] Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has requested the pass from the Bishop of Trier, after the day, matters will arise again.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
