    <p xml:id="regest1">Defends Luther, whose merits in the spread of the Gospel have been recognized by Oecolampadius and with whom Zwingli also admitted to agreeing theologically. Apart from the question of the Lord's Supper, Luther's theology leaves nothing to be desired. This agreement is also evidenced by the signatures under the Marburg Articles. Bucer also does not appreciate Luther's combative nature, but what he teaches will always be praised by Bullinger if he only considers it correctly. Bullinger's letter, written in a fit of emotion, prompts Bucer to caution against condemning Luther without real knowledge. Erasmus, whom Bullinger praises so highly, behaved even more disgracefully than Luther towards the people of the Oberland. Capito's illness. War preparations. Bucer expresses his affection and wishes for better agreement among the evangelical church leaders.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, my dear Heinrich.</p>
      <p>I have never written to you about Luther unless you first wrote to me about him. However, since we love each other mutually and truly, as it seems we must answer before the judge Christ, I do not conceal. I seem to have praised him too much, you to have criticized him. I would always prefer to err on that side, especially when there is a dispute about those who teach the Lord Jesus as our only savior. If only you would deign to read what he teaches here, not fights. It would be surprising if you did not admit, as Master Oecolampadius admitted with me, that the Lord used him above all to ensure that the world would hear his pure gospel again. I have heard before that Zwingli among you recognized and taught the sincerity of the faith of Christ before he read Luther's works, but what he taught then agreed so much with the Lutherans that it was believed he had already seen and recited what Luther had written. Zwingli himself told me this. Oecolampadius never concealed that he was taught by Luther that our righteousness is the faith in the forgiveness of sins, which is indeed the head of the whole doctrine of Christ. And if I had to die now, I know of no doctrine of Christian piety that he did not most happily bring forth to the world before others. The books he published before others are witnesses. Nor do I see what you would desire in his theology at all, except that he speaks more crudely than is fair about the presence of Christ in the supper. Certainly neither Zwingli nor Oecolampadius desired anything beyond this. The articles signed at Marburg testify to this. Now, who has spread the gospel more widely and first defended it before the whole empire, and who bears the envy of the gospel before others, I think you will give no one but Luther this infamous name among the enemies of truth, whatever you may protest. Brothers, let us not please ourselves, let us not measure the testimony of the world by the voices of a few who acclaim us for reasons I do not know, if only out of love for truth as much as hatred for the present and those who do not agree with them, who often cover the purity of the gospel, the freedom of Christ, when nothing but the spirit of sedition agitates them. I write this from experience. For I have received more letters from the Lutheran regions so far than perhaps you have. Let us test the spirits. Then let us not confine the extent of the kingdom of Christ to our own, nor indeed to the whole of Germany. I do not approve of many things in Luther's way of handling matters, I even detest his way of fighting. But what he teaches, and the way he teaches, where he teaches nothing but, Bullinger will never cease to embrace if he knows it rightly. If now the Lord uses this instrument of his so excellently, whatever else he may sin, ah, what is fitting for us fellow servants? I wanted to respond to this, especially moved by what you write at the end of the letter. For we love you in truth. That was written with such affection that it spurred me to at least warn you not to judge Luther or to know his cause well beforehand and not to reject the best substance because of some bad accidents. We attribute much to you deservedly. But what do we restore here in the doctrine of Christ that we have not learned from Luther? I speak of doctrines. For in the explanation of scripture, perhaps the Lord has shown us some things through others and to ourselves. Let this be a certain argument for you, brother, of a mind not rightly disposed in the cause of Luther, that you praise Erasmus so much and cast down Luther so much. For Luther never allowed himself anything against us that Erasmus did not do - read his letters - except that the more virulently and not rabidly like Luther, the more harmfully. Then compare the doctrine and life of each. Luther wrote too scurrilously, but if only falsely! O brothers, brothers, let us fear the judge who will reveal the hidden things of darkness.</p>
      <p>Capito is dealing with a very severe fever.</p>
      <p>What you fear about the prince, we also fear. Let us pray to the Lord more for this. A huge army is being conscripted. Great things seem to be impending. May the Lord be with us. Let us not disturb ourselves less in the matter of Christ. I can do nothing with Luther. Because I truly love you and you love me, I advise, as I see it is pleasing. It moves me that I do not doubt either the matter of church reform has been acted upon or that we, who preside over the churches, ought to agree better. I now receive letters from Philip and many others from time to time, which give hope of this. I would therefore wish, if it is allowed, that no false judgment stands in the way here.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, and I beseech you, interpret everything for the good. Your ease in the cause is such that I deal with you freely. Think, I pray, that Luther has hurt me more than all of you.</p>
      <p>Martin Bucer.</p>
      <p>23rd of April.</p>
      <p>Greet the fellow ministers most dutifully.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, a most learned and pious man, truly dear.</p>
