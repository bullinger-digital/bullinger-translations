    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the letters. Peter Kolin wrote to Bullinger about how Weingartner was approached regarding the Commandery of Hitzkirch. He did not want to accept anything without Bullinger's advice, is also not willing to leave his congregation, and therefore declined the matter. Hans Siber will report on it orally. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. P. D. Indeed, the present inconvenience of both time and leisure has prevented and not allowed me to write more to you. However, know this, most honorable man, that I do not know how or with what I can deserve and earn the friendly offer and writing, which you have sent to me now two or three times, etc. But I will pray to God with mouth and heart that He may reward you accordingly, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my dear lord and brother, you should know well that for some time I have faithfully brought forth the cause of God, etc. Let me inform you here from my innermost being that I am of a willing and humble mind, as much as God grants me grace, to continue to carry this out with modesty. You should not think otherwise of me, in the hope that God will grant grace, so that the honor of God and the welfare of our fatherland will be promoted and planted through this, etc. Therefore, my beloved brother Peter Kolin has written to you on my behalf about what has concerned me regarding the Commandery of Hitzkirch, etc. I did not want to accept anything without your advice. I am also not of the mind to leave my congregation, who have understood and embraced the cause of God, so that no harmful wolf may be set upon them, who would not spare the flock of Christ, and solely considering the honor of God and the salvation of the people, in the hope that God will neither abandon me nor my way. And so I will follow your advice, and have completely dismissed the matter, and will continue to pursue the cause of God, as much as God grants me grace.</p>
      <p>What else concerns me, I will let rest for now until another time, when I have more to write. However, my cousin Hans Siber will further inform you orally about the matter, etc. Deal with me as with a brother, of which I have no doubt.</p>
      <p>Let me always be commended to you. Greet our brothers for me, namely my dear friend M. Werner Steiner, Konrad Pellikan, and especially my lord mayor RÃ¶ist.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Your always willing R. W.</p>
      <p>To the president of the church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, a man of utmost integrity, to be especially revered.</p>
