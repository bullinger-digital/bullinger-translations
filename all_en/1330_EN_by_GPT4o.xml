      <p>[To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, honorable lord and dearest brother.]</p>
      <p>Greetings. I have fulfilled, to the best of my ability, the promise I made, [most esteemed lord and dearest brother, and what] I owed in the name of religion. I have indeed discussed the matter you know of with a few chosen ones, and I can elicit no other response than this: We sincerely favor the most serene King A. because of his excellent character and outstanding zeal for true religion: but we can promise nothing regarding alliances or aid, and that for countless reasons. The same people add: Whether a mission to A. for the sake of religion can be obtained, we could not divine, since a good part of the senators, frightened by some examples, always suspect something else lies hidden under these missions, and because such matters cannot be accomplished except by the votes of the Two Hundred, among whom is the supreme power. But since among the Two Hundred there are very diverse minds, it would be most foolish to decide anything certain about these. However, we promise all our efforts, if ever King A. should request something that pertains solely to the agreement of pure religion and its propagation.</p>
      <p>Indeed, to have something certain, they wanted this matter to be referred to the senate as proposed or outlined by friends, not by the council of the King or the King himself. I, however, opposed this in every way, frightened by a not so old incident. For when Mr. Montius proposed something of this nature as a mystery in some cities of Switzerland, the Roman Kingâ€™s lieutenant at Constance, an enemy of the cross of Christ, immediately discovered it, and he greatly agitated the frustration. Not that I think any of ours or the people of Schaffhausen or St. Gallen, to whom he proposed the same, maliciously betrayed it, but that they imprudently blurted it out. Therefore, lest this should happen now as well, I opposed in every way that the senate should learn of this mystery. Added to this was the consultation about the Council of Trent, which I feared might arouse suspicions or completely disturb the good matter. If I have erred in anything, I erred out of concern, not malice. For the Roman pontiff, having sent messengers and an apostolic brief, as they call it, to the Baden assembly, demands that the Swiss send their prelates and pastors to the Council of Trent. The same was requested by the Emperor in letters sent to St. Gallen and some cities. Therefore, when our delegates return from Baden, they present the matter to the senate. The senate orders it to be explained to the preachers or ministers, so that, having examined the proposal, they may recommend in writing what should be done. We therefore wrote a demonstration, showing that the pontiff is unworthy of a response, and that the Council of Trent is not such that pious men should attend, etc. Having understood the opinion of all of ours, they convene an assembly and call Zurich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen to meet on July 26, and this was done today. Our papist confederates think it fair that the cities submit to the council. Therefore, a serious matter is now at hand among us. I hope the Lord will not fail us. Always pray to the Lord for us. However, I did not want you, my lord and brother, to be unaware of these things.</p>
      <p>Do what you think will be for the benefit of Christ and the churches, according to your wisdom. I will devote all my efforts to you here.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever. Greet all the brothers in Christ, especially Gallas. Zurich, July 8, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
