      <p>Greetings. Although we have not yet received any letters from you, most honorable lord, which would inform us this week about the current state of affairs in France or what has happened since the Basel document and the announcements of other learned men, we cannot in any way be surprised or take it badly, as it is beyond doubt how overwhelmed you are by the storms of business in these times. However, we fear that either illness or some disease contracted from constant sweating and sleepless nights has completely exhausted you (may the Lord prevent it) or that less favorable fortune in our affairs in France has deterred you from writing. Certainly, many things are being circulated here that could instill fear in pious minds.</p>
      <p>For although we do not lend our ears to any trifling rumors more quickly than is proper for an honorable man, our interpreter triumphs so much about a certain battle that he has long filled the ears of all people here, confirmed the malevolent, and so terrified the benevolent that there is a great eagerness to understand the other side. It is not enough for the envoy to infect all of Rhaetia with writings and examples of this kind, but he also boasts and spreads much greater things by word of mouth. I am sending three examples, two of which were sent by the bishop, the third by the consul; you will easily see how well these fit together. Many things (even if something had been done) I would believe to be fabricated. But I do not doubt that you have already received all this. Now to various matters. - The bishop's case is more stuck than ever before; the people's counsel will be sought. There were those who wanted to impose those large expenses on the communities. However, the expense of 103 gold coins was recently made, for which the good archpriest Bartholomew was forced to pledge and provide guarantors, which he recently complained about anxiously to Mr. Pontisella and me, indicating that he is the most miserable of all men and reduced to extreme poverty. Meanwhile, the bishop, while the matter is pending, employs a daily guard for himself, somewhat timidly. And because nothing has been accomplished in that tedious case, Mr. Frederick did not want to write. - Mr. Dietägius, the son-in-law of Consul Ambrosius, along with two of the bishop's sextons, were summoned to the senate (as I recently mentioned) and compelled to either attend our church with all their household or lose their citizenship. Dietägius responded amicably and testified that he had never attended the papist church for religious reasons throughout the year; as for rarely attending ours, it was due to negligence, which he promised to rectify most diligently. The other two, claiming poverty, are uncertain what to choose; however, they preferred to neglect salvation rather than abandon those antichristian duties. This was a very strong action by our most honorable magistrate, especially at this time when the papists are trying to bring us under their yoke.</p>
      <p>Would that in all things and everywhere, the more they attack us, the greater the frustration and pain it would cause them! - Brunner will be called by the people of Maienfeld; the day before yesterday, Captain Lucius Gugelberger and Mr. Adancus, sent by the entire community, wanted him to be brought by our letters under prescribed conditions, which I hope he will never accept.</p>
      <p>For the stipend (as he requested) will neither be increased nor reduced; no other house; nothing significant about reducing expenses. - Mr. Zanchus writes that the pope is entirely focused on sending a huge amount of money to the king. He also adds that on the 24th of November, his relative returned from Genoa and reports that several ships loaded with papal soldiers have been sent towards Avignon and that soldiers, both cavalry and infantry, are constantly crossing the Alps into France; therefore, there is a danger that delay will be harmful to our people. - A certain neighbor of mine, sent to Innsbruck by your Mr. Wisenbach, has returned and reports that everything in and around Innsbruck is ready, I don't know for whose aid. - Mr. Charles reported that Prince Condé has 18 regiments of the royal or knightly order and 1500 of the most distinguished nobles on his side. - We have also received and read what was done at the Baden assembly and what the four Christian cities have proposed to extinguish the remnants of the civil war. Would that the matter be brought to the desired port, as no one is unaware that victory in a civil war is the ultimate evil. Therefore, God must be asked that it be settled amicably in this way without any force intervening. But if something lukewarm were achieved, which could cause greater harm to the faithful there, peace should be achieved by victory rather than by agreement.</p>
      <p>For what would be remarkable? Even if arms were laid down on both sides, in the meantime, the fear of Egyptian servitude would be established? Nor does it seem surprising to our people that many did not want to agree to this proposal. For what would those who do not cease to disturb it with their soldiers help peace? They would undoubtedly consider it dishonorable if they now retreated and helped to avert that evil, which they did everything to pursue at first. May the Lord God Almighty restrain these intractable ones with His rod and iron scepter for the glory of His name and the safety of the afflicted church. Amen. These are the things I have now hastily and rashly poured out; I ask that you interpret my loquacity with paternal love and your usual spirit.</p>
      <p>The consuls (a. R. cosss.), Mr. Charles, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gantner, and I greet you and wish that you may remain with us, God, and the church for as long as possible. Farewell, the greatest honor of the entire Christian world. December 2, 1567, early in the morning in Chur.</p>
      <p>Your dignity's most observant and submissive servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned and venerable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, his honorable lord and father.</p>
