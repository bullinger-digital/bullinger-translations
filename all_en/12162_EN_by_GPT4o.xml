      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>So as not to cease being a bother to you. Behold, the messenger offers you a small package once again; I have sent it to the Duke of Württemberg. I believe his preacher is named Kaspar Gräter; if I am mistaken, I beg you to wrap my letters with yours and address them correctly. I ask him to present the example along with the letters to the prince; I have also given him a copy. You, with your faith and diligence, take care of these matters diligently.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Remember us in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 17, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Please ensure that these addressed to John Butler are received by him promptly; I have kept them with me for several days because I could not find a messenger. Greet him in my name.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Ambrosius Blarer, Bishop of Constance, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Constance.</p>
