      <p> Greetings. I believe it is necessary to be vigilant so that the false and deceitful spirit does not cause harm; the scripture forbids believing in such spirits or revelations, and indeed commands us to test them, according to the rule of truth. - I understand that Melchior Lussy, whom you mentioned, is now not the bailiff of the Unterwalden, but the commissioner of Bellinzona. He came to Baden and interpreted for the Bishop of Como, the papal legate... The Pope's donkey's messenger has conveyed the good, fatherly (wolfish) will of papal holiness towards the Confederation; therefore, he has appointed him as the messenger: since he, the Pope, the shepherd, who should bring the sheep into one fold, has arranged it so that the Confederates may deal with him, that this and other similar matters belong to him, etc. All papal legates have always sown wars; this one also tries to do so. </p>
      <p> May the God of peace tear apart the pouch in which he carries the war practices. - The message of the Savoyard messenger regarding an alliance and neighborhood with the common Confederates has been dismissed; they will respond at the annual meeting, as will the imperial messenger regarding the new tolls and the uniformity of the coinage. - The matter with the Glarus people has been settled; they have been answered that the alliance, peace, and everything will be maintained with them. - The one from Unterwalden has been beheaded, under the pretext that he confessed to theft, and he is said to have confessed something. But if he had been as hostile to the true religion as he is said to have been to the false one, he would not have perished. - The army that gathered near Lyon has moved on; it is said that everything is heading to Scotland. May the Lord protect those who call upon His name. </p>
      <p> From Poland, through a special messenger, a nobleman, we have received letters stating that the state of religion is very good and growing, except that a certain Stancarus is trying to disturb the churches with new doctrines. He argues that Christ is a mediator only according to His human nature, not according to His divine nature. They requested our judgments on certain questions, which we sent to them in writing. </p>
      <p> The Muscovite war has been postponed, and peace is hoped for; for the Muscovites not only do not harass Livonia, but also deal amicably with the King of Poland, etc. Dr. Melanchthon passed away to the Lord on April 19, etc. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Greet Dr. Philipp, Pontisella, especially the consuls and the royal legate. The Bernese are sending envoys to all and each of the Swiss cantons. </p>
      <p> Live and farewell. </p>
      <p> All of mine greet you. May 31, 1560. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Dr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur. </p>
