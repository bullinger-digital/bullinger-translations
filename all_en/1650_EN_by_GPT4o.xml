      <p>This pious young man, having lived in Paris for some time, came to you and conducted himself in such a way that I do not doubt he is endowed with both sincere fear of God and true modesty. He has made not unsuccessful progress in the humanities. Afterwards, he dedicated himself to the study of theology, in which he decided to attend your school and church to make greater progress. Although he does not intend to be troublesome or burdensome to you, as I hope, or to anyone else, because he seemed to me to be an honest and sincere worshiper of piety, I did not want to dismiss him without this testimony.</p>
      <p>Two of our friends who recently visited you have not yet returned. May the pious brothers feel some relief. It has not yet been fifteen days since three others were thrown into prison in Lyon. The faithful are being mistreated in Brittany.</p>
      <p>In Bordeaux, one was recently burned, others redeemed their lives with treacherous renunciation. In other parts of the kingdom, there is also cruelty.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we must strive as long as it is possible. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother to be respected by me. May the Lord be with you perpetually and guide you with His spirit. Greet the fellow ministers in my name.</p>
      <p>Geneva, on the day of Pentecost, 1552. My brothers greet you very much.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and exceptional minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed brother and fellow minister, greetings.</p>
