      <p>I did not dare to send nothing in the way of letters to you as Fabricius was setting out to you.</p>
      <p>What more is there that an eloquent man would not have expressed more clearly in this my letter? Certainly, my constant and singular love towards you... I have communicated some things to such a certain man, which I would scarcely have entrusted to a letter. If you have discovered anything deeper, which may be to your advantage, I would love for you to inform me.</p>
      <p>I am eager to know what you hear about the Palatine.</p>
      <p>Chur, May 8, 1565.</p>
