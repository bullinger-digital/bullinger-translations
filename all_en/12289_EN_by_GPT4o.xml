      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Our Froschauer conveyed to me your many greetings and at the same time, in your name, gifted me your commentaries on Mark, for which reasons I owe you, most humane of all men, eternal gratitude for your exceptional kindness. And although your generous spirit (which wished to leave a testimony or token of your goodwill and faith towards me and expects no reward) consoles me, I will consider my life bitter unless I, in turn, send back a pledge of my respect and faith towards you and all yours - suitable to my humble fortune and not unworthy of our friendship. Meanwhile, I wish you to free me from any suspicion of rusticity and ingratitude.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your whole household. The time does not allow me to write more; and in person, from Froschauer and from the letters of others, you will learn more, I know.</p>
      <p>Given from Frankfurt, 12th of September, 1545. Yours with all my heart, Wigand Happel.</p>
