      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I entrusted a certain Brabantine student from Brussels named Philipp Pensart, who traveled with us from Bern to Baden, with my quickly written letters to be delivered to you. Among them were two letters from Lord Haller, the minister of the church in Bern, one addressed to your excellency and the other to Brother Lord Wolfgang; I hope they were delivered correctly. Therefore, I ask you to at least note to this Augsburgian, Mr. Sultzer, in three words, so that I may know that everything was properly taken care of by this student; he can always send to me most correctly.</p>
      <p>I myself could not come to you due to many certain reasons, although I had certainly planned and promised Lord Haller. You can easily consider how great a task has been imposed on me, who must respond for six students throughout the journey, all from Augsburg and all from the most honorable families.</p>
      <p>I asked this student to have me excused to you until I could clear myself at leisure. You will also hear from Sultzer how unwillingly I passed by you.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily with all yours. Given by hand on the 10th of August in Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>Your excellency's most observant Engelbert Milander. To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the elder, his lord to be honored with perpetual faith. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
