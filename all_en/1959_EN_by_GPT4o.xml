      <p>Greetings. I did not want this messenger, so opportune, to return to you without my letters, even if there is nothing with which I can delight you. It has been reported that our England is miserably torn apart and that Mary has obtained power through her arts and is in control of affairs, having rejected the other whom the more prudent would have preferred as queen. Therefore, nothing is expected but the calamitous overthrow of the church and pure religion and multiple disasters, unless the Lord mercifully brings help as if from a machine, whom it is fitting for all of us to beseech with constant prayers and, as if we were in the same body, to undoubtedly sympathize with our most afflicted brothers. Furthermore, I conjecture that you will soon have certain news from there; I also ask that you deign to share it with us, especially if you have received more favorable news, so that we may be refreshed by consolation to that extent. It is reported that August, the brother of Maurice, has died, along with two other sons of Heinrich of Brunswick, who had not participated in the battle, so that the old man, bereft and delirious, is almost driven to madness. In Nuremberg, some princes and cities are holding assemblies, from which I would hope for something good more easily, because Heidecker, who was first reported dead, has been summoned to the same, a man endowed with admirable counsel and singular greatness of spirit and piety, whose authority is said to hold much weight among the orders of the empire. Maximilian, now King of Bohemia, is said by Bartholom√§us Blaurer to have made a place for the gospel of Christ, but I fear he may be reporting rather than certainly exploring.</p>
      <p>Albert is said to have 30 banners of infantry and 4000 cavalry, equipped with funds partly from the emperor, partly from the mother of Eric of Brunswick, and now to be requesting war machines from the people of Bremen, promising to utterly destroy Heinrich of Brunswick, the ancestral enemy. But what he has achieved is not yet reported. But farewell well.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 16, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers in my words.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
