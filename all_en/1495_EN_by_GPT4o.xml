      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most learned man, from the very person who delivered it to you. As for the fault you so greatly apologize for, it is nothing; for since the time I received the booklet, which I thought was published by you or otherwise written and shared with your friends there, I found it only begun or certainly less complete than others, although I know for certain that it will bring not a little importance and assistance to my sacred studies and those of others, and therefore I still greatly desire it. However, I am not so inexperienced in matters that I would consider it a sin to trouble you, a very busy man, with this matter any further.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I confess it was pleasing that you finally replied. As for what you write about our or your Frenchmen and the messenger, you will easily understand how much I wanted to gratify you and yours for this rare matter if you understand that I have been so devoted to your name for more or less fifteen years now, that I would rather undertake any struggle or danger here than condemn your doctrine or not defend your name with a strong spirit, at least excusing you whenever our people, both privately and publicly, so miserably slander you before the nobility and the common people even from the pulpit. Therefore, since the death of Ulrich, the prince, who always pursued me with a certain singular benevolence, unless God had prevented it, I would have been expelled from this town of ours and indeed from the entire duchy as a heretic (if it pleases the gods) and a Zwinglian, and they still cause me so much trouble on this account that I often consider moving my home and my affairs either there with you or in Geneva.</p>
      <p>For by the grace of God, I can live for the rest of my life, if not splendidly, at least Christianly and comfortably. But these and other matters I will discuss more fully at another time when I have more leisure. I am greatly, as I should be, grateful for your Antithesis, so illustrious and so notably, that is, openly and learnedly written. Regarding Mr. Brenz, when he comes here, I will do what you ask, and that as diligently as I can; but if he delays coming to us, I will send your note to where he lives. I once had a great friendship and familiarity with the man, which has been interrupted for several years now, not by me, but by him for the reason I mentioned; he is much more modest than others or, to speak more truly, less immodest than others. Farewell, most learned man, and may the service of your Volmar always be dear to you. TÃ¼bingen, on the third day before the Nones of December, in the year etc. 51.</p>
      <p>You will act wisely if you consecrate this letter to Vulcan. Your better Volmar.</p>
      <p>To the man of exceptional learning, piety, and dignity, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and honorable and old friend.</p>
      <p>"Volmar."</p>
