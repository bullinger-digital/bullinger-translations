      <p>Well-educated, honorable, pious, prudent, wise, especially gracious, dear lords. We send you our friendly greetings, inclined, humble, willing service along with whatever we can do for your honor, love, and good, beforehand. Gracious, dear lords, we have appointed Emanuel Kaufmann, the bearer of this letter, as a professor some days ago and also entrusted him with the care of our poor people of the special hospital church. However, since he has not yet been examined by you, we have instructed him to present himself before your honorable wisdom in this manner, with the humble request herewith to have the good young man in favorable care. This is to obligate us in all humility to your honorable wisdom. Dated the 7th day of the winter month in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>The mayor and council of the city of Winterthur. To the well-educated, honorable, pious, prudent, wise general assembly along with and especially the examiners of the city of ZÃ¼rich, our gracious, dear lords.</p>
