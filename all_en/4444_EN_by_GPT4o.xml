      <p>Greetings. When I last wrote to you, my reverend father in Christ, I thought it would be the last letter I would send you. At that time, I was in severe pain and had heard from other doctors that this illness was acute and could kill a person within a few hours, not to mention days. Therefore, I had arranged all my affairs as if I were about to depart to the Lord. Now, by divine grace, the pain has subsided, although I am still struggling with the remnants of the illness and feel nausea from my stomach. But I hope that this too can be cured with proper treatment and a good diet.</p>
      <p>I have not yet returned to my studies, but I felt it necessary to write to you, my father, so that you would not be unaware of my situation. God wishes to exercise me longer in this arena, to whom I have long since consecrated myself and all that is mine. I know that the apostle did not say the golden phrase "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain" in the Roman court, but in the midst of hardships and persecutions. As for what I mentioned in my last letter about ingratitude and implored you not to be the cause of sending anyone here after my death, do not take it as if it was said out of impatience; I have serious reasons for feeling this way. For I knew that an old man would not be sent to these parts, and I did not want a young man to be endangered by so many simultaneous insults. But there are already four young men here who are not unlearned and preach outside; they are citizens and more accustomed to these customs. I do not write this as if I am contemplating fleeing, not at all; for I often remind myself of what happened to the prophet Jonah when he refused to carry out divine commands.</p>
      <p>It is the mark of a lazy and cowardly soldier to abandon the post assigned to him and to want to flee before victory. But you, my father, should not in the future encourage your people to negotiate with ours about increasing the stipend; for in the meantime, I have learned from experience that this advice is not useful for our church. For all good people also persuade themselves that there is nothing more than my stipend; if they ever want to prove themselves to me, they say that such a generous stipend has never been given to anyone before me and will not be given in the future. I attribute this entirely to their simplicity and remain silent.</p>
      <p>Now, if you consider the malevolent and the bishop's followers, no other opportunity could be given to them to bring me into disrepute among the simple people. For since we ministers are not paid from the treasury (which they could have done), but from the contribution of the citizens, you can easily imagine how badly not only I, but also the gospel would be heard. I would have a guilty conscience if, because of my benefice, a poor washerwoman or day laborer were to be burdened in their distress. Therefore, I leave all this to the Lord, who called me here and will sustain me; I will not write more to you about these matters in the future. The late Commander of blessed memory was very wealthy and lived in the Rhaetian manner; what that custom is, inquire from others. I will never again be a burden to you, who are oppressed with other cares and labors. I was sent here to remain for three years.</p>
      <p>I will add another three years to this triennium and, if it pleases God, a decade, provided it is useful for the church; for I have promised this to God because of my illness. As for the bishop's cause, about which you prudently and paternally advise, I, my father, believe that not all outcomes and results should always be weighed exactly, as long as the cause is good and the modesty required by the Christian profession is applied. The rest should be in the hands of the Lord.</p>
      <p>We see that the Lord often blesses pious and simple efforts, while the wise are often shamefully deceived, so that we learn not to trust in ourselves, but in the Lord. We strive with all our might to exclude or rather not admit the bishop's officials to the council and assemblies (for they have already been excluded by the tenor of the articles), and no one living now can persuade me to think otherwise. But if our efforts here do not succeed, I have freed my soul; for if the bishop achieves this, it is no small argument for me that God wants to punish the ingratitude of the evangelicals and bring them back under the bishop's tyranny. But if some of those who oppose the bishop do so for their private interests, which we are not unaware of, that indeed is nothing to us, who seek only that Christ be preached. Certainly, as long as this hyena keeps watch over our stables, it will always have those it can entice. The state of the Republic of the Three Leagues has taught me to write and think this way for a long time, and if anyone from your side wants to measure it, they are completely mistaken; for the difference is very great. You think we should wait until these things can be better managed with counsel and reason; but neither reason nor counsel can have a place where everything is for sale.</p>
      <p>But what, my father, will you expect while the Salices occupy the bishopric, surrounded by such great defenses, as you see? May God prevent us from having to gnaw on a bitter willow soon. The new bishop is now enacting the mystery of iniquity, and now we know what is holding him back, namely that he may be revealed in his time, and it reminds you of what I recently wrote about the bishop of Constance. I have written at length, reverend father in Christ, but somehow I feel better whenever I converse with you through letters, to whom alone I entrust my matters, whom I uniquely observe and honor and revere as a parent. I pray to God that He may preserve you in good health for His church for as long as possible. Amen.</p>
      <p>All of ours wish you well, Mr. Philipp, Mr. Pontisella, and other friends.</p>
      <p>Chur, September 9, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
