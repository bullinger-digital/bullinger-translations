    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller has not written for several weeks, as Ammann Hans Vogler [the Elder] accompanied the Augsburg [former] mayors [Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser] and saw the entire army, and upon his return to Zurich, he will have recounted the details more precisely than Haller could describe them. Here are further news in brief.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The Bavarian town of Rain near Donauwörth, held by the Imperial forces and besieged by the [Schmalkaldic League], surrendered through a clear response from the long-indecisive Duke [Wilhelm] of Bavaria. Free passage and subsequent supply trains through his territory were granted to the [Schmalkaldic League]. The town remained with the [Bavarian] Duke, but in such a way that the [Schmalkaldic League] could station a company to monitor the crossings over the Lech and the Danube. The imperial troops were allowed to leave Rain unpunished and without any oath of allegiance. Through this leniency, they wanted to show the remaining imperial mercenaries that they did not thirst for German blood, but for freedom.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Afterwards, the [Schmalkaldic] army moved towards the Bavarian Ingolstadt, occupied by the Emperor [Charles V], besieged the city, ensured a free crossing over the Danube, and moved as quickly as possible to Regensburg to reach the Emperor. The army moved on the left side of the Danube [towards the northeast]. The supply train of the Ulmers, Württembergers, etc., followed. About 30 bakers from Augsburg, transporting food, were plundered by Spaniards near Ingolstadt but were left alive. Afterwards, the supply train moved on the right bank of the Danube towards Regensburg. Due to this minor loss, the [Schmalkaldic League] did not want to lead the army back to Ingolstadt for retaliation. However, the eight Swiss companies that had passed through Augsburg were made available to accompany the supply train.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The army thus arrived in Regensburg, where the Emperor is still present. Both warring parties have their camps opposite each other, and both are eager for battle. A fight could break out at any time. The [Schmalkaldic League] is being insulted as chalice thieves, church robbers, heretics, and rebels against the Emperor. May the Lord grant victory to the glory of His name!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Some wealthy citizens who had fled have returned to Augsburg. Prayers are being said there. There is no craft in the city anymore. Haller can hardly devote himself to his studies. His main task is prayer. Only through this and fasting can demons of such kind be driven out! As soon as he learns anything certain, he will report it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Zoller was wounded by one of his comrades. He was already thought to be dead, but he is already back with the main army. Thank God!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- From the Zurichers, Haller met the following: Heini Hermann, [Hans?] Rüttimann, J[akob] Götthart, Jakob Reinhart, Wilhelm Stutz, Galli Schnider, a son [...] of [Johannes?] Bosshart, [...] Herrliberger, a brother [...] of [Johann] Felix Renner, the [...] Stetter zur Wiegen, and several others from the Zurich region, especially from Bülach and Illnau.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Vogler wrote from Lindau that he had met the Magister Jakob [Reinhart?] and the brothers Jakob and Wilhelm Wirz there. Today it was reported that besides the Helvetians who had already been mustered earlier, about 4000 more had newly arrived in Donauwörth. Undoubtedly, the Zurichers seen by Vogler in Lindau are among them. Bullinger should specify more precisely who [from Zurich went to war]. Among the [Schmalkaldic League] there are also many mercenaries from the Five Places who are not willing to follow the order issued by their authorities to return.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- The army intended for the Emperor from the Netherlands, 2000 horses and 12000 foot soldiers, has reached Worms. It is led by [Maximilian von Egmont, Count] of Büren. The passage through the territory of the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] was denied to the army. Therefore, it moved through Luxembourg and the territory of the Bishop of Trier [Johann IV. Ludwig von Hagen]. The [Schmalkaldic League] sent troops to keep [the imperial army] away from the Rhine crossings. Strasbourg, the Elector Palatine [Friedrich II.], the Archbishop of Cologne, the Bishop of Münster [Franz von Waldeck], and the remaining Hessian troops are participating in the blockade.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- If only the Swiss understood what is in store for Germany and occupied the four [front] Austrian [forest] towns [Rheinfelden, Säckingen, Laufenburg, and Waldshut], as well as their granary, the Sundgau, while the Grisons took Tyrol to deny the Italians the Alpine passes!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- But Haller writes this not to call to arms, but only to fill his page... Bullinger may forgive him! Haller knows what holds back the [Protestant Confederates] and suffers with them. The [Schmalkaldic League] fights like desperate men, for it is not about trivialities, but about the Word of God and the threatened freedom of Germany.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- So far, they are still waiting daily for news about the negotiations from [the Diets] in Baden and Zurich. The desecration of the church in Einsiedeln by the stallion and the mare will soon come to an end and must be publicly punished. It will also soon be known what that misfortune in Solothurn portends!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- The Augsburg pastor [Johann] Flinner was sent to Füssen with [Sebastian] Schertlin. He is still there. He has imposed the faulty Augsburg church order on the simple pastors and monks there. After the war, this will again lead to tensions [among the Protestants]. The supporters of this church order want to appear spiritual, but express themselves [about the Eucharist] so carnally that the human nature of Christ is blasphemously undermined! Haller often consults with [Georg] Frölich on how this compendium could best be replaced. Unfortunately, it is already printed, and the [Augsburg] authorities hate any innovation. However, no one can prevent Haller from interpreting it correctly in use. The advice of the Zurichers will be needed to get rid of this church order, which was brought into the city by that Strasbourg "Sinon" [i.e., Bucer] as a "Trojan horse"! If Haller can assist in this, he will gladly play the role of a "Laocoön."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Bullinger should soon send Haller the requested books [Bullinger's "Hope of the Believers" and Bibliander's "Relatio fidelis"]. The [Augsburg] printer [Heinrich Steiner?] would be ready to print the handbook [“Hope of the Believers”] translated into German by [Johannes] Fries. Is Bullinger agreeable to this?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Enclosed, Haller sends a copy of the letter of renunciation [“Protestation” of Landgrave Philip of Hesse and Elector John Frederick of Saxony] to the Emperor. He did not accept it but violently pressed it against the chest of the delivering boy [... von Plato], along with his letter of outlawry.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- In Augsburg, the written renunciation of the Zurichers to the Council of Trent [“Response of the Preachers of Zurich”] is met with approval. Melanchthon has also written a German document [“Reasons”] on this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Greetings to family and colleagues as well as to Ammann Vogler, the godfather of Haller's son [Johannes the Younger]. Bullinger should inform him of the content of this letter, as Haller cannot write to him as well. Greetings to the father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli], who should forward the enclosed note to Haller's stepfather [...].</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace through our Lord Jesus Christ, etc. The reason I have not informed you about our affairs, indeed the affairs of the entire Church of Christ, for several weeks is due to the presence of Ammann Vogler, to whom I left the reporting upon his return to you, as he undoubtedly recounted everything more accurately than I could have written. He saw the entire army and was a welcome companion to our consuls. Now, I will briefly tell you what has happened in the meantime; for only a few memorable things have occurred.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The Bavarian town named Rain, not far from Donauwörth, where some imperial soldiers were stationed, was besieged by our forces until the Duke of Bavaria gave our forces a clear response, allowing them free passage through his territory without intercepting any supplies or other matters that might follow them. The town was left to its lord under the condition that, since it has the most convenient crossing of both the Lech and the Danube, it would be secured with one of our banners, while all imperial soldiers were released without any oath or obligation. They wanted to gain great favor with the remaining imperial soldiers by showing that they were not seeking German blood, but freedom.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>After these events, the army moved towards Ingolstadt, which was similarly besieged by the imperial forces, although it belongs to Bavaria. Our forces, having surrounded the town, hastened towards Regensburg, leaving Ingolstadt under the condition that no one would be prohibited from crossing the Danube. Our forces acted somewhat incautiously here (as you will hear), but the sole reason was that they hurried to reach the heart of this war, namely the Emperor himself, and not to be occupied for long with the costly siege of such towns. Thus, leaving Ingolstadt on the left side of the Danube, they led the army downwards. The supply train, as usual, followed from our Ulmers, etc., and Württembergers. About 30 of our citizens, bakers and others transporting bread, wine, and other provisions, were plundered and robbed by Spaniards near Ingolstadt, who had remained in the town; however, they released all alive. After this event, they also left Ingolstadt and headed towards Regensburg on the right side of the Danube. Our forces did not consider it necessary to lead the entire army back for such a small loss and to be occupied with punishing them, but proceeded directly towards Regensburg. The protection of the roads was entrusted to 8 Swiss banners that had passed through Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Our forces thus reached Regensburg, where the Emperor is now present (as everyone reliably reports) and has set up his camp outside the city against them. Our forces are eager, and so are they. They provoke our forces with great insults, calling them chalice thieves, heretics, church robbers, rebels against the imperial majesty, etc. A conflict is expected any day. May the Lord Jesus, who has delivered us from the power of Satan, grant us a happy victory and deliver us from the bloody jaws of this Spanish lion for the glory of His name and the propagation of evangelical truth. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Devout prayers are being made by our churches. Some wealthier individuals who had previously fled have returned. All craftsmen's hands have ceased. Everything breathes war. Certainly, I have become completely unable to study. I cannot keep my wandering mind within the confines. My only task now is to pray frequently and fervently, and I think I can do nothing better. We will slay many more with prayers than with other spears. For such demons cannot be driven out and overcome except by fasting and prayer. This is all for now. As soon as I have anything certain, I will write.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Zoller was struck by one of his comrades, but he has recovered and is again with the main army. We thought he was dead. But praise be to the Lord! Everything is well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Zurichers who were with me are mainly: Heini Hermann, Rütimann, J. Göthart, Jacob Reinhart, Wilhelm Stutz, Galli Schnider, a son of Bosshart, Herliberger, a brother of Felix Renner, the Stetter zur Wiegen, etc., and many also from the countryside, many from Bülach, and also some from the parish of Illnau. They were certainly modest and left a good name.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Vogler wrote to me from Lindau that he found Master Jacob, Wilhelm, and Jacob Wirtz brothers there, etc., whom I do not know where they are now. I hear today that about 4000 Helvetians, besides those who had previously crossed, have come to Donauwörth, among whom they will undoubtedly be. I ask you, if you have any certainty about these, let me know who has left. Among the Five Places, many among our forces are completely disregarding the recall of their lords.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The army (which you undoubtedly know) has ascended from Lower Germany to Worms, numerous, 2000 horses, 12000 on foot, to join the Emperor. The leader of this army is called the Lord of Büren. They ascended through the Duchy of Luxembourg (because they could not pass through the territory of the Archbishop of Cologne) and the territory of the Bishop of Trier. Our forces immediately gathered not a few troops and besieged the Rhine to prevent them from crossing. The people of Strasbourg, the Palatine, the Cologne and Münster princes, and the remnants of the Hessians are present there. We are also expecting something new from there.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>You see, brothers, what threatens Germany. If only the Swiss would understand and, as could be conveniently done, occupy the four Austrian cities, as well as the Sundgau (which is their granary), and the Grisons the County of Tyrol, to close the Alps, so that the Italians would not have access to us! For it is not the time to sleep. The die is cast! They are seeking us; let them be sought by us as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I write this not to rashly encourage anyone to take up arms, but to fill the time by staining paper. Forgive me! I write foolishly what I feel. I will gladly join wiser counsels. I know what hinders you. Therefore, I can sympathize with your weaknesses. Our forces certainly boldly undertake everything. For they see that it is not a matter of trifles, but of the suppression of the Word of God and German freedom and the blood of all the pious, and therefore, as if desperate and driven to the utmost necessity, they dare everything. May the Lord confirm this zeal, which I cannot say is evil, in all of us!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>What has been done in Baden and previously in Zurich, I do not yet know. We are waiting daily. I do not think the desecration of the Hermit Temple portends anything other than the end of desecration is near, and this must be revealed and publicly punished, by which they have impudently desecrated the holy temple of God, true religion, and piety, as well as this horse with its traditions and lustful pollutions, I mean the church of Christ, the true religion and worship of God. What that Solothurn incident portends, the event will soon declare.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Flinner, one of our companions, was sent to Füssen with Schertlin and is still there. He imposes that limping Augsburg form on the unlearned and miserable priests and parish priests, and thus these errors are planted, so that I do not doubt that when everything is settled, we will again have war with those who want to feed the newly born churches with such obscure expressions and, when they want to be understood spiritually, speak most carnally. May the Lord give His spirit to these churches, so that what they say too crudely may be understood with spiritual judgment; otherwise, they will never be able to avoid the crime of blasphemy against the humanity of Christ. I frequently consult with Dr. Laetus on how this form can be exploded and a more sincere one substituted. But it is difficult to reject what is printed, especially since our lords are the greatest haters of disturbances and novelty. Therefore, while I cannot do otherwise, I use it corrected only to my sense, indeed Christian, with no one prohibiting. We will therefore need your advice in due time on how we can again expel this Trojan horse, brought into our city by that Strasbourg Sinon, without harm. If I can do nothing more, I will play the role of Laocoön.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Furthermore, I have nothing to write at present, except that I would like the booklets I recently wrote to you about to be sent to me quickly. Our printer is ready to print the handbook on the resurrection given by Frisius in the vernacular, if it is agreeable to you. Therefore, write back what should be done.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>I am sending you here a copy of the letter of renunciation, which the princes sent to the Emperor, which he did not want to receive, but violently placed in the bosom of the boy who brought it, along with a booklet or writing (which they call) the letter of outlawry. For he writes the outlawry over us everywhere, as you will find in this writing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>I have seen your arguments, by which you give a reason why you do not come to the Council of Trent. They are pleasing to everyone. Philipp Melanchthon also wrote an apology in German on this matter, which I do not know if you have seen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Farewell. Greet your family and the lords, fathers, and brothers to be honored forever, Ammann Vogler, my godfather, to whom I would like you to report all these things. For I could not write to him because of business. Also greet my father-in-law, to whom I beg you to deliver this note, so that he may send it to my stepfather. Farewell again. Augsburg, on the day of Bartholomew.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, his uniquely esteemed lord and father. Zürich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
