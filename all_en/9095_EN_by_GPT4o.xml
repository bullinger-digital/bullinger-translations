      <p>Greetings. Venerable father, I had sent you a letter last month and along with it, I had attached a certain document which contained the state of France. My friend, to whom I had entrusted it, while traveling to Basel, gave it to a certain citizen (as he says)</p>
      <p>of Basel, whose name is Konrad and who, he says, lives in the fish market. I once knew someone there by that name whom I suspected; I wish to know whether he has taken care of the package for you. I can hardly write more due to a slight fever that has come upon me.</p>
      <p>Would that your most wise council and the other most prudent Swiss seriously consider their affairs! For those who bring news from the French court here write that our executioners are threatening you vehemently. In summary: the people of La Rochelle, Montauban, and NÃ®mes are now openly contending with arms; if they could be helped with some support, so that in the meantime those executioners would be hindered, they would be forced to change their plan.</p>
      <p>Would that, just as the people of Trento have done and even sanctioned with the blood of so many victims, you too, along with the Count Palatine, would enter into some pious and defensive alliance (as they say) with our people of Geneva! This plan, unless I were unwilling to teach Minerva, I would dare to affirm would be consistent with religion and sacred letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell, venerable father, and be well. I commend myself and my miserable wife and dearest children to your prayers.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 12th of November.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Hotman.</p>
      <p>To my venerable father, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most excellent and faithful theologian, pastor of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
