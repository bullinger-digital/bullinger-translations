    <p xml:id="regest1">Intended to ask Bullinger for help, as he and his wife are accommodated at high costs. Sends a letter from the people of Strasbourg to the city of Lindau, which he received from Thomas Gaßner. Gaßner informed Vogler that Blarer is preaching in Stuttgart and the Duke attends his sermon daily, and reported on the dispute with the Hessian preacher Schnepf. Vogler hopes to be with Bullinger soon. Greetings. Requests new news.</p>

      <p>Especially my dear lord and brother, knowing of our health. Thus, we would gladly hear from you with joy, etc. I have been intending every day to ask you for something on behalf of my wife and myself. We are accommodated again at great expense, although with kind and pious people. Therefore, I am sending you here, if you do not already have it, as I hope I have sent it to you, what Thomas Gaßner, preacher in Lindau, sent me, which was sent from Strasbourg to the city of Lindau, and you can indeed see both copies, as he copied it and sent it to me in trust. He also writes to me that he was told that Blarer is preaching faithfully in Stuttgart and the Duke, along with three princes, attends his sermon every day and not any mass. The churches are also too small, so that the people cannot fit inside due to the multitude. May God grant that it continues. He also writes that the Hessian preacher, who is more Lutheran, has somewhat opposed him regarding the sacrament. However, they are said to have reconciled, so that they now preach peacefully. There are also two others there, whom he does not know.</p>
      <p>I hope to be with you soon, God willing. My wife sends her greetings to you and your wife, especially the mother, as do I.</p>
      <p>In haste, St. Gallen, done on Wednesday before Bartholomew's Day, in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Do you have any new news, etc.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler, currently in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and friend M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to hand.</p>
