    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger should receive the remaining sum of one crown and two silver pieces from the bearer [Eynard Pichon]. [Pichon] has been sent by the people of Neuchâtel; they are having difficulties with a fellow official [Jean Chaponneau], who is quarrelsome and inconsiderate and receives backing from the governor [Georges de Rive, Baron of Prangins] of the princess [Johanna of Hochberg]; now the people of Zurich are to help [the people of Neuchâtel] to restrain this Ishmael. The [Waldensian] brothers in Provence presented their pure and simple confession [RBS I/2 223-227, No. 25] in writing to the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence three years ago [1541], were further tortured, resisted, and achieved [on June 14, 1544] that King [Francis I] appointed two investigating judges, leaving the final judgment to him; since then, the [Waldensians] have been spied on both openly and secretly; they were also asked to present [Francis I] with a clear and sincere confession [RBS I/2 415-420, No. 30]; now both the bishops and the governors and the Parliament [of Aix] are opposing with all their might, so that there is no possibility for royal mediation; [the Waldensians] are accordingly a welcome and easy prey for the lions [of secular authority] and the wolves [of spiritual authority]; in three cities [Mérindol, Lourmarin, and Cabrières d’Aigues?] and in several villages they confess the true Gospel; the greater the danger they are exposed to, the more they need support, especially since the danger threatening them is only a pretext to fight the Gospel [in France]; should [Waldensians] therefore appear in [Zurich], Bullinger should be prepared to help them; either the king must be asked to continue tolerating the Waldensians or to punish them less harshly. Luther's recent attack against the people of Zurich, which also concerns the people of Geneva and is not only due to Luther's character flaws but also to his bad advisor Nikolaus von Amsdorf, would be best met with silence; however, since this would not be fair, one should not forget Luther's merits for the Gospel in the defense and be aware of how this internal [Protestant] dispute benefits the opponent and enlarges the wounds. Regarding the [Eucharist issue], Calvin would like to have a half-day conversation [with Bullinger], as he suspects that Bullinger has something to reproach him for in this regard; however, he should know that he adheres to the Word of God and attributes nothing to man; meanwhile, they should continue to maintain brotherly friendship among themselves. Greetings.</p>

      <p>From this brother, who delivered my letters to you, you will receive one crown and two silver pieces.</p>
      <p>For this is the sum, unless my memory fails me, that was remaining. I ask you to excuse me for not sending it sooner. However, the reason for sending it, this brother from Neuchâtel will explain to you in person. In my judgment, there is nothing, or very little, difficult in the matter. But the obstinacy and importunity of one man compels them to be troublesome to you and to us.</p>
      <p>They have in their assembly one from that group of learned men, from which no good man has yet emerged, who does not cease to cause them some trouble from time to time. There are two reasons that drive him. For he is naturally inclined to contradict: and because he is not valued as highly by others as he values himself, he takes revenge in this way. If he were in this church, he would be easily restrained. For we would have the means at hand to subdue him. But there he has the support of the Prince's envoy. For such drones are accustomed to fortify themselves with the protection of the wicked, so that they may harm with impunity.</p>
      <p>What I know you will all do willingly, I nevertheless ask of you, that in such a holy cause you extend a hand to the brothers: that is, that you assist them with your authority and instruct them, so that they may restrain that Ishmael. I wrote this, not because I thought it necessary, but to comply with the brother's request.</p>
      <p>There is something else I would like to ask you earnestly. There are brothers in Provence, for whom you know we have always labored. And not without reason. For they are endowed with such piety and innocence, that their safety ought to be commended to all good men. Three years ago they had progressed so far, that they presented a pure and simple confession to the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence, such as would be issued among us. And lest you think it was done in a sudden fervor, which immediately vanished: whenever they were challenged, they consistently persisted in it.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, they were cruelly harassed. When they endured the savage tyranny of the enemies, they finally obtained from the King that he would appoint judges to more truly investigate the whole matter. The King entrusted the task of inquiry to two: he wanted to judge and pronounce himself.</p>
      <p>The letters contain this, that those who are to be sent should inquire diligently both publicly and secretly about their doctrine and morals. The brothers do not fear this. For they have conducted themselves in such a way among all, that they have a singular testimony of probity even from their adversaries. As for the doctrine, they are going to present a confession to the King as he requested, clear and sincere: which comprehensively includes more than can be said against them. Now both the bishops and the governors and the Parliament itself are resisting with all their might, so that there is no room for royal mediation. If it is not admitted, they will be exposed to lions and wolves, to unleash their savage rage upon them. For this is what they aim for, that they may freely attack the wretched with impunity.</p>
      <p>If it is admitted, they will not have escaped danger even so.</p>
      <p>For in three small towns, and in several villages, they profess the pure doctrine of the Gospel. And in one small town, they have cleansed the temple of all impurities, and there they celebrate the supper and baptism in our manner: The greater the danger that threatens them from both sides, the more they must be helped by us: especially in this admirable constancy, which it would be a great disgrace for us to fail. Add to this that their cause is not being pursued here: but either the way will be opened for the cruelty of the wicked throughout the kingdom through their downfall, or the Gospel will break through in this way. What then remains, but that we exert all our strength, lest the pious brothers be oppressed while we are idle, and the door be closed to Christ for a long time? I wanted to forewarn you of this, so that if they ever flee to you, you may have your minds prepared to help them. One of these two things must be done: either the King must be asked to allow them to enjoy the benefit once granted: or his fury must be mitigated, if he has become enraged against them.</p>
      <p>I hear that Luther has finally burst forth with a fierce invective not so much against you, as against all of us.</p>
      <p>While it is in itself lamentable, that we who are few in number and besieged by enemies on all sides should be engaged in internal wars among ourselves, this could not have happened at a more inopportune time. Therefore, I have nothing else to say but that the Lord has loosened the reins of Satan. Luther himself, besides that excessive violence and obstinacy of his nature, has Amsdorf as an advisor, a man utterly insane and of no brain, by whom he allows himself to be led or rather dragged. But it is useful for us to recognize that we are being stirred by the Lord with this scourge, so that we may bear more moderately what would otherwise be most bitter. Whether he was provoked by any of your writings I do not know: as such a nature is not only easily irritated but also driven to bitterness for a slight cause, certainly no sufficient reason could have existed for him to rage so madly, or at least to cause such a tumult. Now I hardly dare to ask you to remain silent: because it is neither fair to be harassed undeservedly and to be denied the opportunity to clear oneself: and it is difficult to determine whether it would be expedient. But I wish these things to come to your mind: first, how great a man Luther is, and with what great gifts he excels, with what fortitude and constancy of mind, with what skill, with what efficacy of doctrine he has hitherto labored to overthrow the kingdom of Antichrist and at the same time to propagate the doctrine of salvation.</p>
      <p>I have often been accustomed to say: even if he called me a devil, I would still pay him this honor, to acknowledge him as an eminent servant of God: who, however, while he excels in extraordinary virtues, also struggles with great vices.</p>
      <p>This intemperance, which boils over everywhere, I wish he had more diligently sought to restrain. But the vehemence, which is innate to him, I wish he had always directed against the enemies of the truth, and not also wielded against the servants of the Lord. I wish he had devoted more effort to recognizing his own vices.</p>
      <p>Flatterers have greatly harmed him, as he himself was also too inclined by nature to indulge himself. Nevertheless, it is our duty to criticize what is evil in him, so that we may concede something to those illustrious gifts. Therefore, I beseech you, consider this first with your colleagues, that you are dealing with a primary servant of Christ, to whom we all owe much.</p>
      <p>Secondly, that you will achieve nothing by fighting him as an enemy, except to provide amusement to the impious, so that they may triumph not so much over us as over the Gospel. If we tear each other apart, they have more than enough reason to have faith in us. But when we preach Christ with one consent and one voice, they use this to detract from the faith they place in us, in which they believe more than is fitting. I wish you to consider and think about these things, rather than what Luther has deserved by his intemperance. Let it not happen to us, therefore, as Paul warns, that by biting and devouring one another we are consumed: even if he has provoked us, we should abstain from the conflict, rather than increase the wound to the common church's detriment.</p>
      <p>I do not touch upon the matter which I would very much like to discuss with you: because I fear that you may find something lacking in my manner of teaching. I simply and without deceit profess what I feel: I do not involve or dissemble anything for the favor of men. But I seem to myself to feel what is handed down to us by the Word of God. Although if we could converse for even half a day, I hope it would be easy to agree between us, not only on the matter but also on the form of speaking. Meanwhile, let not this scruple hinder us from cultivating brotherly friendship in the Lord. Which I will do myself and I am confident you will certainly do. Farewell, brother, most honorable to me in the Lord, and dearest friend. Greet all the fellow ministers reverently in my name. May the Lord preserve you, and increase his gifts in you more and more. Geneva, November 25, 1544. My colleagues greet you very much.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
