Bears the uncertainty [about his appointment to Zurich] with patience. Asks to obtain a scholarship for his brother-in-law [Christian Wirth].</p>

      <p>Health and a quiet conscience through Christ.</p>
      <p>As far as the common affairs of the holy church throughout Germany are concerned, I thank our immortal God that He has granted such concord to His flock through you, the invincible ministers, that the simple speech of evangelical truth has suffered no loss, even though τραγέλαϕοι καὶ βουκέϕαλοι (tragelaphs and bull-headed ones), most harmful monsters, have tried to obscure it. This I have gathered both from your and Jakob of Biel's concise writings and learned more fully from Erasmus' narration, whatever some idle chatterers may babble that the Bucer and Sebastian's opinion has prevailed among you. But it is well when the adversaries have nothing to defend themselves with except the most shameless lies.</p>
      <p>Just as God, through you, His faithful and steadfast ministers, has asserted the sincerity of the word, both invisible and visible, against smoke and deceit, so He will also dispel the clouds of these lies with the most brilliant light of truth. This will undoubtedly happen when the acts and response of your assembly, to be sent to Luther, are read before the διακοσίοις (two hundred). The special synods held in Aargau have prevented them from being recited so far. For when our churchmen decided to communicate the acts of the Zurich assembly to the brothers, they sent Mr. Dilimann home without the acts and finally followed him after visiting four classes of pastors.</p>
      <p>As for my private affairs, I can never praise enough your and our Megander's diligence and effort in promoting me. However, that you have not yet achieved anything by your vigorous efforts, I attribute to divine providence, which seems to wish to exercise my faith and hope in Christ as if through a kind of apprenticeship. For if I did not dare to trust my Lord God, who created me from nothing, that He would provide the sustenance for this fleeting life, how could it be likely that I would sincerely believe that I will one day enjoy the food of eternal life?</p>
      <p>Therefore (although the flesh is often weak and impatient), when I consider the past and the future, I think: Let God rule; He knows well what is useful and good for you and what He wants to use you for. You have heard all your life: "Good things take time." Please, my Bullinger, share this with our Megander, and make sure that I receive a response, whether good or bad, either through David Lanista or M. Johannes the organist. For the time to depart from here is approaching more and more day by day.</p>
      <p>In my name, bid farewell to our Theodor and all your companions. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, May 17, 1538.</p>
      <p>Johannes Rhellikan.</p>
      <p>My wife's brother has come to me from Tübingen and will move with me to you; therefore, as I have previously interceded for him, I would very much like him to be recommended to the council through your and Megander's efforts, so that he may be supported by the church's expense in his studies of letters.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, adorned with letters and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Zurich church, his most esteemed friend and patron. Zurich.</p>
