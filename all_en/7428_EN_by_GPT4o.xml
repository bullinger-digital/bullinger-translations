      <p>Greetings. If I were not greatly afraid that by writing to you at this time I might cause you trouble, I would not be ashamed to write to you more extensively. Now, since you are burdened with such great responsibilities, especially in these turbulent times, I will dare to mention only one incident that occurred in Valtellina, Italy. A man, most noble in both the splendor of his lineage and the excellence of his virtues, was betrayed to the enemies under the name and suspicion of the Christian religion. He was seized and thrown into a squalid prison, and after being kept there for a long time, a most severe interrogation was finally decreed. When he could not be forced into apostasy by the power of torture, they subjected the poor man to repeated interrogations, so that in the very anguish of the tortures, he expired with great wailing. As the news of such tyranny spread, the citizens, as if given a signal, rushed together from all sides; fury provided weapons; they seized whatever was at hand, tore apart the temples, overturned the altars with the images, and attacked and aimed at the heads of the priests. Some sought safety in flight, others were trampled underfoot, many were slaughtered and expelled; even the governor himself barely escaped, and various kinds of tumults and seditions spread throughout all of Italy, gaining strength. These things are written and spoken of as certain among us. May the Lord Jesus graciously deign to rescue His own from the jaws of their enemies and grant His church the deep and long-desired peace. In this, I wish you, most excellent man, eternal well-being.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 29, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, supreme pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord, to be honored with perpetual fidelity.</p>
