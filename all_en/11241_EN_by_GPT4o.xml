    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports once again about his situation, as he distrusts the bearer of the last letter [No. 1191]; he would like to finish attending [Johannes] Sturm's lectures on dialectics and rhetoric, which will last at most until the Frankfurt [Spring] Fair, but this is only possible with an increase in the scholarship due to the high cost of living in Strasbourg. Describes the course of a working day; assures that he almost exclusively associates with Martin Peyer and avoids public disputations. Bucer is on his way to Wittenberg; Joachim Camerarius is also traveling there to call upon Philipp [Melanchthon]. Beat [Gering] is staying in Strasbourg with a prostitute. Gwalther inquires about new prints by Froschauer and about the Bible by [Sebastian] Münster. The delivery of Zurich paper has become unnecessary. Requests the forwarding of the letter to [Bullinger's] brother [Johannes]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, I sent you a letter, most kind patron, in which I informed you of my current situation; however, whether you have received it or not, I am made to doubt by the innate negligence and treachery towards scholars that almost all couriers possess, as I had entrusted my letter to one of their number. Therefore, I am writing to you a second time now, so that you can certainly know the state of my affairs, which would not be unfortunate if the high cost of provisions were not a burden to me. For this, as I fear, will cause me to soon forgo the lectures of the most learned man, Sturm, which I would do unwillingly. For he teaches those things which I have always eagerly desired, namely the institutions of dialectics and rhetoric, from which I do not doubt I could derive considerable benefit, provided I could remain as a listener until the end. Both, as far as I can conjecture, will conclude before the next Frankfurt Fair. Therefore, most beloved patron, I earnestly beseech you, if any convenient opportunity arises here, to take up my cause with the presidents of the Zurich college, if perhaps they might deign to add some increase to my stipend. For who does not see that it is impossible for me to live in Strasbourg with this money, as I am compelled to spend twenty-seven florins of Strasbourg currency for sustenance.</p>
      <p>Nor is there any point in negotiating with Bedrot about a lower expense, as he has solemnly affirmed that he cannot support any of us for a lower price. Therefore, most kind teacher, I do not see how I can remain here longer unless some assistance is provided to alleviate my poverty. For since Bedrot could not provide a convenient place for my studies nor for Martin Peyer from Schaffhausen, we also had to rent a room with our neighbor. But if the most prudent procurators of our college, frightened by the magnitude of the expenses (for I easily acknowledge how great the expenses are now), refuse an increase in the stipend, I ask you to at least strive to obtain this, that they might be willing to add at least one or two florins this winter; if they do this, I will take the utmost care to be able to remain there longer with this aid.</p>
      <p>But if they refuse this too, your counsel will be my sacred anchor, which I will always follow as an infallible guide, and I hope it will not fail me in this matter. So much for this.</p>
      <p>The schedule of my studies is as follows: Early in the morning, I exercise my pen by writing, at the sixth hour I attend Sturm's lecture, who teaches Cicero's Oratorical Divisions. At the seventh to eighth hour, I review the same lecture; I have dedicated the eighth hour to mathematics. At the ninth hour, I attend Capito's theological lecture. After lunch, until the twelfth hour, I practice on the lute. At the twelfth hour, I review Capito's lecture. At the first hour, I review the previous lecture of Sturm in dialectics and prepare myself for the future one. At the second hour, I listen to Sturm lecturing in dialectics. At the third hour, I review the lecture. At the fourth hour, I listen to Bedrot, who professes Plato's dialogues on laws. At the fifth hour, I reread the same. After dinner, when I have practiced on the musical instrument, I read one or two chapters in the Bible, and this is the schedule for the whole day. Besides, I have commerce with few, I alone confer my studies with Martin Peyer, an honest young man. I have never yet inserted myself into the public disputations in the manner of other young men; for I think it would be more prudent for a Zurich Harpocrates to be among the Strasbourg than a Chrysippus.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us, except that Bucer has gone to Wittenberg and Joachim Camerarius, the professor from Tübingen, has undertaken the same journey to call upon Philipp, whom I think will be washing a brick in vain. Our Beat, indeed the most disgraceful slave of Venus, has gone to Strasbourg with a prostitute, oh shame, and it is rumored secretly that he intends to take the prostitute in marriage. I am amazed at the man's impudence, who is not touched by a greater stimulus of repentance after such a great crime with such a great offense.</p>
      <p>I would like to know, along with other good men, what our Froschauer has under the press and whether Münster's Bible will be published at the next fair.</p>
      <p>In the previous letter I wrote to you about sending paper, which if you have not yet sent, there is no need for you to be concerned about this anymore. For the booksellers in Strasbourg have brought Zurich paper, and it is sold here at as cheap a price as with you, namely a book for 3 kreuzers.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to write, except to ask you to forward this letter to my brother. Farewell, unique patron, and always remember your Rudolf. Greet most kindly in my name your mother and wife, the ornament of matrons, all your children, Ammianus too, Collinus, the most kind old Pellican, etc., and also Georg Stadler with his wife, etc.</p>
      <p>From the house of Bedrot in Strasbourg, November 15, 1538. Rod. Gwalther, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Zurich church, his most esteemed patron.</p>
