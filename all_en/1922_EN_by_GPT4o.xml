      <p>Greetings. We have received your letters, most esteemed man, both those you wrote to us for Heinrich, our brother, and those for the miller.</p>
      <p>The community no longer wished to retain him. He came to us; we will show him another church, which he may lead and which will receive him. You did well to send him back to us; for many churches among us lack a preacher. We give you great thanks, for you do not cease to write to us, despite being quite busy, and yet you make us aware of everything.</p>
      <p>The times seem to be approaching, of which Lactantius once wrote, when no one will have anything unless it is obtained and preserved by violence and armed hand. May God have mercy on us, as you write. The Bishop of Bayonne sent me these letters yesterday, which I am to ensure are delivered to you. I know that this has been preserved for a long time among the learned and that the learned pursue it with benevolence, and that they especially love you, unless I am mistaken, who are very familiar with them. But he specifically ordered me to write to you that he has now written to you with great haste, as he was already prepared to leave and was wearing his boots. In our Confederation, there are those who are less pleased because they suspect him of being Lutheran, perhaps because he does not spew insults at the Lutherans, but rather speaks honorably of them everywhere, and always speaks very poorly of Eck. From Italy, no news is brought at all. What was said about the Turk having come to Italy is nothing, nor do we hear of him coming. Farewell, most courteous man, and continue to love us in return. Comander, Ponticella, and your Heinrich Gassenser greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord, the most faithful minister of the church.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
