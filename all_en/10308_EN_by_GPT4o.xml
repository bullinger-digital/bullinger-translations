      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ, our Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother in Christ. After God the Lord has graciously chastised me for my sins and has, for a time, put me to shame for my own and others' good, I confess my misdeed, giving great praise to God and His grace, and humbly thank Him with a plea to you, as my particularly kind dear lord, to whom my teaching, life, being, and conduct have been known for a long time, to reconcile me with those whom I have offended through my life. Therefore, I willingly submit myself to your teaching and correction, and I am always willing, whenever I am found blameworthy, to better myself and not only live and serve myself but also my neighbor. However, since I am currently deprived of the opportunity to serve my neighbor with the gifts I have received from God by grace, which I would gladly do for God's praise and my neighbor's good, and since no one should offer themselves, I entrust my good intentions to your love, to judge therein, for my conscience presses me before God to stand idle all day at the market. Since it is now the last hour, I desire, for God's sake, if it is possible and your love thinks it good, to work faithfully with you in the Lord's vineyard in the last hour, so that I may be found and graciously rewarded as a faithful steward on the last day of divine reckoning. With this, I always commend myself to your love, which God may keep long-lasting in His protection, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Rudolf Ammann.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, faithful evangelist M. Heinrich Bullinger, his particularly kind dear lord.</p>
