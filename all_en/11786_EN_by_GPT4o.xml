    <p xml:id="regest1">Since March 30, open conflict has prevailed between the estates [at the Imperial Diet] in Nuremberg, after King [Ferdinand] denied [the Protestants] peace and justice; therefore, the deliberations on aid against the Turks continue without them. Severe pain in his right arm has prevented him from writing for 14 days. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Since March 30, the estates in Nuremberg have completely fallen into conflict; because our people could not obtain any lasting peace or justice from the king, and the situation is quite dangerous if one were to remain in such division, while the other estates continue their deliberations on aid against the Turks without us.</p>
      <p>I am suffering from severe pain in my right arm; for I have not written anything for a full 14 days, during which some force of an evil humor has been severely tormenting my right arm. April 11.</p>
