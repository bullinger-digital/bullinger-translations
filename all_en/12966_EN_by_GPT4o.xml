    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger is distressed. He has done everything for the recall of Haller and Thoman Ruman by the Zurich Council. He also ensured that the letters from the Augsburg friends, Nikolaus Müller known as Maier [No. 2910] and Michael Keller [No. 2909], were read in the Zurich Council without any disadvantage to them. However, the Zurich Council surprisingly decided, both for him and for other good people, to comply with the cunning request of the Augsburgers and to let Haller stay longer in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Haller should therefore patiently endure until God grants him the return. Greetings to Maier and Keller, to whom he should explain why the Zurich Council accommodated the Augsburgers to such an extent. The Council believed that by doing so, they were serving religion. For whatever may have been behind the request of the Augsburgers, the Zurich councilors were of the opinion that in this situation good sermons and faithful pastors were needed. Haller should therefore know that the response of the councilors is not directed against him, but rather has the advantage of the Augsburg population and the promotion of truth in mind.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He should create a detailed description of the Saxon campaign. In Zurich, it is claimed that Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony was freed from Dresden, the army of the victorious Emperor Charles V was scattered, and then again, that peace had been concluded.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I write briefly, for I am distressed. I have applied all effort and diligence, and indeed turned every stone, to ensure the recall to the homeland. Therefore, I arranged for the letters of friends, Nikolaus Müller (known as Maier) and Michael Keller, to be read in the council, ensuring, however, that nothing would be to their disadvantage. But it happened not only contrary to my expectation but also contrary to the expectation of some other good men, that you were ordered to stay, and our most illustrious council cunningly agreed to the request. Therefore, I do what I can.</p>

      <p>I urge your piety to conduct yourself bravely and bear the yoke patiently. Perhaps the Lord so disposes. The same will prepare a way for you to return when it seems right to Him. Pray for His mercy. Trust in His care and goodness. He will never forsake you. Convey my greetings to Maier and Keller, and tell them that the Zurich council is so accommodating when it believes it is promoting the cause of piety, that it grants everything and bears everything. Whatever arts may have been uncovered, good men still believe that sincere preaching and the constant faith of the minister bring the greatest fruit. But believe me, the agreement to that response was not made with malice, as far as I have understood from trustworthy men, but from good hope and for the sake of the simple and honest people who are sincerely and without deceit devoted to the truth.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I ask you to write me a detailed account of the Saxon war. Here it is consistently said that the Saxon Elector was freed from Dresden, the army of the victorious Emperor Charles V was scattered; and now indeed peace has been concluded.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell with yours.</p>
