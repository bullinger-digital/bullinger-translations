    <p xml:id="regest1">One gladly excuses the brevity of a letter by referring to the messenger. The bearer, Nikolaus [Pfister, known as Baling], will himself report on his dismissal, which was enforced by Papists and pension lords against the resistance of the [preachers]. Hopes for a reply to his letter. Greetings and recommendations.</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius Plurimontanus wishes grace and peace from the Lord to the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, the most outstanding defender of the most sacred theology.</p>
      <p>Do you know, most learned Bullinger, the excuse that those who are lazy or less capable of writing use? They always excuse the brevity of a letter by the messenger, who, if he happens to be somewhat uncertain, they deny entrusting with longer letters, lest much effort be wasted if they are not delivered, or lest they spread to more people than should know, if they are opened by the carrier's treachery. But if it happens to be someone of proven faith through whom they write, they deny the need for lengthy letters, since the messenger will relate everything better in person than can be committed to writing. I could truly use this excuse, since our Nikolaus Baling (Nikolaus Pfister, known as Baling) is traveling to you, not only known to you but also dear for the man's excellent qualities, to whom indeed we owe much (even if there is any learning, not to mention knowledge of languages). From him, I say, you will learn whatever is happening here both publicly and privately. Many things are happening, which may the best and greatest God turn to a good outcome, namely, to sum it up for you in one word: The Papists and pension lords (to speak in their manner) are striving with all their might to utterly destroy not only good letters and honest disciplines but also the evangelical sermon, of which you can gather a sample from this, that in our golden age they send us such a faithful and learned guide for our youth against all their most impious machinations, but this time in vain, since this matter was carried out by a few conspirators who, content with their own foolishness, are more eager to increase their wealth than to letters and do not care how much the youth progresses, as long as they rule at their own discretion. O men hateful to themselves, o ingratitude worthy of no pardon! etc. Thus far about the state of our affairs, which you, as a prudent and wise man, understand more deeply. I have written these things to you, most excellent Bullinger, relying on your most humane humanity, which I earnestly ask you to consider fairly and kindly, not unaware that you bear the immense care of all Christ's churches, finally so that I may give you an opportunity to reply to these my inept letters not only about the succession of the gospel and the novelty of new things but also about your health, which we wish to remain long surviving, always advancing to better things.</p>
      <p>I will end, lest I trouble you occupied with holy labors. Farewell and greet on my behalf your mother, wife, and family worthy of you, and inscribe Blasius in the catalog of your clients, in which indeed you will never find any deceit. Again, farewell and do not cease to pray unceasingly for our church, tossed here and there by various winds.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur, the first of November in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your preacher from the heart at the Church of Saint Regula.</p>
      <p>Our Comander sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed brother and lord.</p>
