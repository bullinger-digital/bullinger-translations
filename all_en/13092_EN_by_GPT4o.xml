    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] From Italy, it is heard that new soldiers are being recruited for the daily growing army of Emperor Charles V, and that it is setting up camp between Parma and Piacenza. Additionally, someone from the imperial troops in Feldkirch is currently supposed to be recruiting for a campaign to Italy. Hopefully, God will free Germany from the Spanish tyranny! If there are further news, Blasius will share them. He will also report whether the following two reports from Italy are true: 40 Spaniards, who disguised themselves as Franciscans, are said to have attempted to cunningly kill Pier Luigi Farnese, the Duke of Parma. However, they themselves fell into the trap set for him and were beheaded. The second report concerns the imperial envoy [Juan Figueroa], who was sent to Pope Paul III to offer condolences for the death of his son, Pier Luigi Farnese. The Pope is said to have had him hanged with a rope!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The annoying dispute already mentioned in the previous letter [No. 3016] between the pastors Agostino Mainardi and Camillo Renato in Chiavenna is a work of the devil to disrupt the Grisons church. What should be done? Remain silent and tolerate the discord within the church? [Mainardi] claims that the promises of God are somehow confirmed through the sacraments, while [Renato] vehemently denies this. Bullinger should help with advice and action to settle this senseless dispute over words! After Martini [November 11], a synod will take place where the two must answer for themselves.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] How are the churches in Germany? Is Johannes Haller still preaching in Augsburg? Where has Philipp Melanchthon gone? It is claimed that he is being called to Basel.</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius to his esteemed Bullinger, greetings. There is no news from Italy, most excellent man in the Lord, except that the army of the Emperor is daily increasing with the recruitment of new soldiers and is encamping between Parma and Piacenza. We hope that the Lord will, through this means, free Germany from the Spanish tyrants, since in Feldkirch these days, someone from the imperial troops has begun to recruit a German army and intends to lead it into Italy. Meanwhile, if anything worthy of note is brought to us, I will diligently inform you by letter, and if these two reports from Italy are indeed true. Namely, 40 Spaniards, disguised in the robes of Franciscans, attempted with their Spanish tricks and deceptions to kill the Duke of Parma, but they themselves fell into the pit they had dug, that is, they were beheaded. The other report is that the Emperor sent an envoy to the Pope to offer condolences for his son, whom the Pope is said to have immediately hanged with a rope, etc.</p>

      <p>Therefore, we are deeply troubled by the discord between Agostino Mainardi and Camillo Renato, ministers of the church in Chiavenna, which I wrote to you about in my previous letter. We see it as being stirred up by Satan to disturb our church. What do you think we should do? Should we remain silent? Should this doctrinal discord be tolerated in the church? One asserts that the promises of God are somehow confirmed by the sacraments; the other vehemently denies it, etc. Therefore, it will be your task, most learned Bullinger, to provide us with your counsel and assistance to suppress this vain contention of words. We have summoned both to our upcoming synod, which is set for the days following St. Martin's Day, where each will be required to give an account of their contention.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Finally, we also wonder about the state of the German churches, whether Johannes Haller is still preaching in Augsburg, and where Philipp Melanchthon has gone. There is an uncertain rumor that he is being called to Basel, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding all these matters, if you do not have time, you will entrust Paulus to respond, and farewell. In haste, Chur, 16th day before the Kalends of November, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Your same, from the heart, there in Chur</p>
      <p>קהלת</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the most ample church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord, etc.</p>
