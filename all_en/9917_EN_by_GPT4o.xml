      <p>Greetings. By chance, I happened upon this courier, most illustrious man and most revered father in Christ, and I wanted to at least say a word or two of greeting to you and your fellow ministers, although the courier I mentioned was in quite a hurry.</p>
      <p>I received your Apology, in German from you and in Latin from Master Simler, and I gave the greatest thanks I could for this most welcome gift to both of you through a letter sent to your son, Master Heinrich, on the 10th of this month.</p>
      <p>In those letters, I also expressed my great concern for your health, from which I am not yet entirely freed, although I hear that you are somewhat better now than you were at that time. I am incessantly invoking God through Jesus Christ with the brothers and friends, with the deepest sighs, that if it is His will, He may preserve you safe for us and especially for His church, and prolong your life. I finally received from Basel copies of our Theodoret and, as a token of my goodwill towards you and the most illustrious and learned men, I am sending four, which I beg you to distribute in my name to those to whom they pertain. I also composed a double index for the dialogues, which the printer had requested from me; but due to the lack of time, he could not include it in the book at this time, promising to include it if some copies remain after the fair or if the book is to be printed again.</p>
      <p>I respectfully beg each of you to accept this humble gift of mine, and in the meantime, I offer you my utmost services. I cannot add more due to the courier's haste. Therefore, I commend you and yours to the Lord, asking that you kindly and lovingly greet all your colleagues in my name and that of the brothers.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Written hastily on March 21, 1575.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Johann Konrad Ulmer. To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, Master Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, the most faithful Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most revered lord and father in Christ.</p>
