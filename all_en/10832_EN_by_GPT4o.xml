    <p xml:id="regest1">Although he sought asylum in the Wettingen Monastery and can understand that this caused displeasure in Zurich, he is by no means inclined towards Papism, but rather rejects images, mass, and ceremonies; in their place, the Holy Scripture should stand. He fears that he cannot assert his rights in the dispute with [Heinrich] Holzhalb, even though he never promised to deliver a document; Holzhalb is supported by the opponents of the Gospel, as shown by the commissions he received for windows and coat of arms panes. He himself has promised not to create any more monastic works, yet the request for a devotional image always tempts him, as he has learned nothing else and must feed his children. Therefore, he would like to know whether it is compatible with the faith to paint biblical stories.</p>

      <p>As God has punished me for my sins, I went down to Wettingen on Maundy Thursday and sought asylum there, resting in the cloister in the chapter house, or whatever it is now called, where many gravestones are and shields hang down. I lay on a bench and rested there because it was hot for me, also went into the church, but did not take off my hat, nor did I go there for any other reason than I thought I would seek justice and stay there until my situation improved. Also, I can well understand that a Christian community here in Zurich has been greatly displeased. But praise be to God, the creator of heaven and earth, who always increases my faith, I have no liking for Papism, for this is my true and undoubted belief: no images, no mass, no ceremonies, and instead use the holy divine scripture, as is done, praise be to God. It is also to be considered that Christ did not have much silver or gold with him, for he bought it at the very least.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as I have a dispute with my father Holzhalb and he with me, although I have become innocent of their accusations, I cannot know whether he will come to it or not. For as I have told him decently at the court and shown him all things, yet said nothing of their matters to him, and that from the best of intentions. But I fear, nothing has been spared me, for I fear nothing worse than what has been said, they lay it upon me or what I have said, they twist it against me, for I know well how they have done in the house, where they mock the heirs and pay little heed to the divine word. For I know well words that have passed, namely I have a document that states 100 pounds, and on the Wednesday night after the old carnival, his brother Jacob [Wirz] explicitly said, if I tell the mother more, I must give out the document, and with ambiguous words. The next Friday after that, I told him myself, and on Saturday night I fetched my little press with the painting tools, there they have a document with a seal and two cleavers on the other sides. But that I have promised them to give out a document, in no way or manner, that is not true. Likewise, he said they want to break the freedom, namely the bailiff at the Fraum√ºnster his house on the ground, and he must make the windows, one sees the stone heap at the stone council. For it seems to me entirely, those who do not like the divine word, that they are the same in the past. Likewise with the windows. So it seems to me entirely, many temptations happen with it; not that I hold so much of it or that it reminds me, but it seems to me, they would like to keep the guild, as one might do many insinuations. As you and every heir well know, I have renounced making any more monastic works. Likewise, I intend not to paint any more stories from the new or old testament, and intend for someone to read them. When I reflect on the matter, I must remember it, for I cannot otherwise; also, I have small children, whom I would like to raise with piety, as long as God grants me grace and life. But I always fear the evil insinuations, as one might say: "I want to have a window and a story from the old testament made, Abraham, Lot, and others thus named. When I consider this, it reminds me of how God dealt with the old and preserved them". So if it is so, one might say: "So I want to have a crucifix or a redemption from the new testament thus named painted. When I consider this, I am reminded of the suffering of Christ". As they speak of idolatry and for the sake of such evil insinuations, I have a shyness from the beginning, and would to God that I could do something else for it, for I am dependent on my craft. I would like to raise my children as long as God grants me life, and ask you for advice on how to handle the matter, for I have been deceived, and it seems to me, the glaziers, whom I must rely on, are also on the opposition, for it seems to me entirely, they would like to depart from the holy gospel. This is common among many people. May God turn it for the best. And therefore, dear Master Heinrich, I would like to know whether it concerns the faith when one paints stories. Nothing more than God be with us all. Amen.</p>
