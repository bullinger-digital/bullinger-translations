    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Certainly, Vadian did not receive the confidential letters that Bullinger sent through Augustin Ruch and the guild master Hans Wegmann.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] There is hardly anything new. Bullinger learned from a trustworthy letter [not received] that the Ulm captain Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz, who had moved to Constance, had traveled with the Saxon commander Johann von Heideck through the Zurich area to Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Bernese have hastily convened a meeting in Baden for the Sunday Invocavit [February 27]. The people of St. Gallen will be informed about this by the Zurichers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Duke Christoph of Württemberg and Count Georg of Württemberg-Mömpelgard are said to have pledged their land to the French King Francis I, who is having the symbol of the lily placed everywhere in Mömpelgard. Whether this is true is uncertain. Johannes Gast has also reported this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blessing wish. Bullinger did not want to let Alexius [Knoblauch], to whom he usually entrusts his letters [to St. Gallen], leave without news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to Hans Widenhuber, Hieronymus Sailer, and the other friends.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. In recent days, I have written to you, beloved sir, frequently and confidentially, first through Augustin Ruchen, then through my particularly dear master Hans Wegmann. I trust that everything has been properly delivered to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>There is nothing new, except that Dietrich Marcell, the captain from Ulm, who had moved to Constance, has recently ridden through here to Basel. I have been reliably informed that Johann von Heideck, the Saxon, was with him. The people of Bern have hastily convened a meeting in Baden for Invocavit Sunday, about which you will undoubtedly receive a report from my lords themselves.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The rumor is (though I do not know if it is true) that Duke Christoph of Württemberg and Count Georg have pledged their land to the French, and the French are raising their shield and lilies in Mömpelgard. Gastius has also written to me about this. I have nothing further to report.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>God be with you. I have written this so that I would not send absolutely nothing through our Alexius, to whom I always entrust my letters. Zurich, February 20, 1547.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Convey my friendly greetings to Widenhuber and Sailer, along with other good gentlemen and friends.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Doctor Joachim Vadian, Consul of St. Gallen, his ever-observant lord. St. Gallen.</p>
