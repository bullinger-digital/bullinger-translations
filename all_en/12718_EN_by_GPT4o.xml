    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has done Myconius a great favor! However, since the bearers of Bullinger's letter [not received] are about to leave, Myconius must be brief.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] [Duke] Maurice [of Saxony] is more loyal to the emperor than Christian. He is pushing for the holding of a council. However, councils are pointless, regardless of whether they are initiated by the Pope [Paul III] or the Emperor [Charles V]. And since the Emperor considers the Protestants to be heretics, he will never keep his promises. The past already proves that! He would rejoice if he could persuade all evangelical scholars to participate in the council, because then he would destroy them out of enmity against the [Gospel] and frustration over the unfavorable outcome of the war! According to the opinion of wise people, Maurice was persuaded by the Emperor to enter into peace negotiations. His agreement is due to his fear of the Turk [Suleiman I]. But why does he invade the territory of his relative, the Elector [John Frederick of Saxony]? A letter to him dated October 27 was formulated like a declaration of war without salutation or greeting, and he wrote that after consultation [with his own people] he must occupy the land of the Elector so that the Bohemians do not do it. Myconius does not want to express his suspicion about Maurice's actions here! It is certain that he could have prevented the Bohemian attack. From Nuremberg, it is written that Hungarian and Bohemian units are ravaging [Electoral Saxony]. And in letters from Venice and Hungary, it is learned that [Sultan] Suleiman is already in Adrianople and is arming more strongly than ever before...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] A Christian-believing Spaniard [...], who was in the Emperor's camp for four days until November 9, received from an Italian [...] [the copy of a war] diary. He was also able to look around everywhere in the imperial camp, as he is a Spaniard. As he reported, he had already been in the Provence, in "Belgium," and in Champagne in imperial camps, but had never seen so much misery as this time. Numerous people and horses die daily from the plague. Corpses remain unburied. Due to the cold, the soldiers look like beggars, as they wrap themselves in blankets, women's clothes, furs, and rags that they have stolen from poor peasants. He even saw someone warming himself on a recently deceased person! A "hemina" of wine costs three batzen, a piece of bread (so small that it can hardly satisfy a hungry person) costs one batzen. Therefore, many thousands of Italians have deserted. Many have also fallen, so that not even 3000 of them remain. The Emperor is said to have used only them because he wanted to spare the Spaniards and distrusted the Germans. The cavalry of [Maximilian of Egmont, Count] of Buren is said to have shrunk to 4000 riders (of whom not even 3000 are fit for battle). All imperial commanders advise winter quarters, but the Emperor remains stubborn, as he does not want to be the first to leave the battlefield. These are verified reports.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] May the Lord remedy the financial shortage of the [Schmalkaldic League]! Only with a victory [of the Protestants] can there be a solution [to the religious question], and not through councils, which Myconius detests.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also to Gwalther and the colleagues.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [P.S.:] Myconius cannot return the [documents on the] community assemblies in the [Zurich] region, as he has not received them.</p>

      <p>S. You do a great favor for me, I acknowledge. May the Lord repay you! As the bearers of your letters are about to leave, I am compelled to respond briefly.</p>

      <p>I do not trust Maurice, because he is more imperial than Christian (in my view). He insists on councils. Therefore, it displeases me; for whether the Pope or the Emperor initiates them, they are futile. It is certain that nothing is to be kept with heretics by the Emperor: He considers us heretics; therefore, he will keep nothing, even if he promises a thousand times! Let us look at the actions up to now. Maurice was persuaded to make peace by the Emperor according to the judgment of the wise. I do not speak in vain or vaguely. If the Emperor could bring all the learned and good men of the Gospel to the council, then he would sing: "Io, io!" For he would destroy them, so hostile is he to the holy religion and now moved by melancholy, because the war did not turn out as he wished. The same Maurice so fears the Turk that he would rather attempt those things. But why does he meanwhile invade the territory of his relative, the Elector? For it is certain from his own letters; for on October 27, he wrote to the Elector without title and greeting, as if declaring war, that after holding a council in his province, he had decided to occupy his territory, lest the Bohemians do it. I do not wish to indicate why he did this. However, it seems: If he had wanted to be a good man, he could have prevented the Bohemians from leaving their home. It is written from Nuremberg that a collected band of Hungarians and Bohemians has begun to ravage the Elector's territory with fire and sword. It is also written from Venice and Hungary by the best men that Suleiman is now acting in Adrianople and is preparing against us with greater force than ever before.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, a man faithful to Christ (although Spanish) and experienced in present affairs was in the Emperor's camp for four whole days and left it on the 9th of this month. He obtained from a certain Italian the diaries of the entire war and, having heard many things in the camp, and having inspected these things from all sides, because he is Spanish, he reported that he had been in the Emperor's camps in Provence, in Belgium, and in Champagne, but had never seen such misery. Many people and horses are consumed by the plague daily; corpses are left unburied; soldiers are so afflicted by the cold that he saw one who warmed himself on the body of a recently deceased person. The soldiers do not have the appearance of soldiers, but of beggars, so wrapped are they in blankets, women's clothes, furs, and rags, which they have taken from poor farmers. They suffer from a lack of provisions and wine, so that a hemina of wine is bought for 3 batzen, and bread, which can hardly satisfy hunger once, for one batzen. For these reasons, many thousands of Italians have left; many have also fallen in skirmishes, so that not more than three thousand remain. For only these have advanced to skirmishes, for the Emperor spared the Spaniards and did not trust the Germans well. The cavalry of Buren is said to be reduced to 4000, and not three of these are fit for battle; so debilitated are the men and horses by lack of food. All the commanders' plans tend towards winter quarters; only the Emperor's stubbornness does not want it, lest he be said to have left the field first (as we are wont to say). Although you are not unaware of these things, I wanted you to know them from me as certain.</p>

      <p>There is no other complaint among our people except the lack of money, which is nevertheless the sinew of war. Let us pray to the Lord, that he may enrich us. For it does not seem that we can come to concord in any other way than by victory. I dread councils.</p>
