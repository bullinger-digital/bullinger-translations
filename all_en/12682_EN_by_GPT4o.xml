    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received]. Because the messengers always offer themselves so shortly before their departure, he could not write earlier.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger is right, one should have acted differently and should do so now. May God turn everything for the good!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Enclosed is a letter from [Georg] Frölich, in which he reports that it is strictly forbidden to transmit news from Augsburg by letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Emperor [Charles V] is [at Sontheim] on the Brenz, the Schmalkaldic army at Hermaringen [on the Brenz] near the [Augustinian] monastery, a mile away from the imperial camp. Since the Emperor has sent a regiment and three cavalry squadrons towards Nördlingen, it is suspected that he wants to reach Württemberg. Therefore, Duke Ulrich's [of Württemberg] troops are moving to Heidenheim to be able to assist the Schmalkaldic troops if the Emperor finally attacks. It is thought that he will want to go to Württemberg or along the Danube to Austria.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Memmingen city clerk [Georg Maurer] reported in a letter dated October 17 that the Ulm people have stabbed or captured several riders at Langenau, but the Italian mercenaries [of the Emperor] have set the village on fire.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Blarer must stop, nevertheless fears having missed the messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [P.S.:] The one-eyed [Zurich] messenger [Felix] Schubinger in Attikon is a cheeky fellow. He unjustly criticized [the Konstanz messengers] before the mayor [Sebastian Gaisberg], because he wants to blame them for his failures if he is late or drinks in Töss. Bullinger should restrain him so that [the people of Konstanz] do not have to fall out with him.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother, I have received your letter. I could not write to you earlier, as the messengers sometimes offer themselves so shortly before their departure.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>It is as you write: It seems much wiser to speak humanely, that one should have acted differently until now and should still act differently. But it is so in fate. I hope that everything will still be turned to a good path by God's gracious providence. The best still lies on the ground.</p>

      <p>From Augsburg, Lętus writes, as you have enclosed. It is now strictly forbidden in Augsburg, under threat to life and limb, for anyone to send out news.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Otherwise, the Emperor is now at Sontheim on the Brenz, our camp at Hermaringen near the monastery. They are a mile apart. He has sent a regiment and three cavalry squadrons from him towards Nördlingen. From this, it is suspected that he will move towards Württemberg. Therefore, Duke Ulrich's troops are moving straight to Heidenheim, so they can come to our people without any worry, if the Emperor, as long as he lives, might be fought with him. It is thought he will move to Württemberg or down the Danube to Austria.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The people of Ulm have stabbed several riders and captured several at Langenau belonging to Ulm, but the Italians have set the village on fire and burned it. This was written by the city clerk of Memmingen. The date of the letter was October 17.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I cannot write more. I worry about missing the messenger. Dated October 20, 1546. A. Bl.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The one-eyed messenger, named Schubinger, who is in Attikon, is a very cheeky fellow, as I am informed. He unjustly criticized our people here before the mayor, and that entirely with falsehood; for they are very diligent fellows with their business, who do not neglect anything. But what Schubinger does himself and perhaps delays, he then wants to blame on our people when he drinks in Töss, etc. One could well show how diligent he is! I would like you to be involved so that it is forbidden to him, so that he leaves our people untroubled. For they worry badly, they might otherwise have to become unfriendly with him; but it is better to avoid that. Therefore, do the best in this matter.</p>
      <p>To Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
