    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports on the arrival of new French refugees and the threat to Italy by [Cheireddin] Barbarossa, who is allied with the French king. Basel has been called upon to participate in the costs of the siege of Münster. In Strasbourg, in the absence of Capito and Bucer, who neglect the leadership of their own church due to their efforts for all other churches, measures have been taken against the Anabaptists. Expresses understanding that Grynäus would like to continue his work [in Württemberg]. Thanks for the books delivered by Mangold and Christoph [Froschauer]. Has heard of a new mandate from the Bernese. Cannot write in more detail due to catarrh.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Today I still saw new Frenchmen expelled into exile and have endured these days - not yet finished - someone in my house with considerable annoyance. Therefore, I still do not see an end to tyranny. It is said that the Frenchman is allied with Barbarossa or the Turk or the neighbor of the Turks, who is said to threaten Italy, especially the Insubres. He inflicted an uncommon defeat on the emperor, for which reason he is preparing for revenge here.</p>
      <p>An army is being prepared against the Anabaptists of Münster and the disseminators of the worst errors. Whichever side the victory falls on, it will turn out badly, as you can easily see by conjecture. A tribute of two thousand gold coins has been imposed on our city for this war.</p>
      <p>I believe the people of Strasbourg have been moved by that city, so that in these days, in the absence of Capito and Bucer, the consul went around the tribes and inquired about the sects, above all about the children not yet baptized, and with a sharp mandate compelled all who were found to baptism or perpetual exile. At the same time, in one church and at once, 14 children, soon 18, who all went on foot to baptism, were washed. I do not know what happened in the rest. Lanius and some other great man have migrated. It was added that if henceforth a child is born and not baptized within six weeks, exile will be the penalty. The doctors of Strasbourg did not see this dregs, and if they saw it, they did not yet purge it, although they otherwise try to purify all churches. Indeed, I have always praised that effort, yet I could not sometimes not desire diligence in governing their own houses, which I also testified to them in letters a year ago. Perhaps now it will be better managed. Meanwhile, Capito has returned from Frankfurt. What he has done, I do not know. He wrote to the doctors Paul and Andreas. He did not write to me; I am nothing, after all.</p>
      <p>Lord Grynäus gave us an account a few days ago of the delay. Indeed, I cannot contradict. What he began both in letters and in religion, he wishes to bring to some completion. For it is not anyone's task to compose well-begun things into a true and right course that never deviates. Therefore, he most earnestly requests that this be obtained from our senate.</p>
      <p>Finally, Mangold returned the Apology and Christophorus your Commentary on the Second Corinthians. I have immortal thanks for you. The mind eagerly desires to return something. Who knows if an opportunity will ever be given? But in the meantime, I say this: Where are the declarations of the articles? I have not yet seen them. Not certainly that they should be sent, but that you should explain why you wrote the Apology separately.</p>
      <p>I have heard about the Bernese, that they recently issued a not-to-be-despised mandate. They themselves have not yet written to me.</p>
      <p>I am flowing with catarrh, so I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Farewell with Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 16, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his very dear friend and lord. Zurich.</p>
