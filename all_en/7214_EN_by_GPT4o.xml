      <p>Greetings in Christ the Savior. The affairs of Scotland, about which I promised to write more fully in my previous letters, are now as follows: The nobles of the kingdom, offended by the marriage of the Queen of Scotland with that regicide Bothwell, gathered a sufficiently large army around the end of last June. Bothwell, who had also gathered soldiers, fled to the Orkney Islands with 4 or 5 ships when he saw himself outmatched. The Queen surrendered to her nobles, who led her to a very fortified castle situated in the middle of a lake (called Loch Leven), where she is still kept in custody; after a few days, the Queen solemnly and publicly resigned her royal dignity to her son, the prince. Around the end of the following July, the prince was crowned King of Scotland; not long after, a meeting of the estates was held, in which these five decrees were made: 1. They declared Lord James Stewart, Earl of Moray, of whose piety I believe I have written to you before, as the governor of the king and the kingdom. 2. They prohibited all exercises of the papist religion under severe penalty. 3. A universal reformation of the churches was instituted. 4. The stipends of the ministers were established and increased. 5. Finally, it was decreed that the authors and agents of the royal murder should be sought out and punished. The Queen is still kept under very strict custody, and there are those who think that this custody will be perpetual. It is rumored that letters written by the Queen's own hand were found in Bothwell's chests, in which she urged Bothwell to hasten the death of the king, her husband. How true this is, I do not know. Recently, a certain baron (named Grange) was sent with four armed ships to pursue Bothwell. It is now quite certain that he strangled the king with his own hands, and afterwards, by placing and igniting gunpowder, destroyed the house, so that the event would seem accidental. From these things, you can easily gather how great and how horrible the disturbances have recently been in that kingdom.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, however, we are led by the best hope that all these things will result in the greatest propagation of the evangelical doctrine. John Knox has recently returned to his church in Edinburgh, from which he was previously completely exiled, with great rejoicing of the people.</p>
      <p>So much for Scottish affairs. Our affairs are almost in the same state as they were when the Bishop of Winchester and I last wrote to you. The minds of all have not yet settled, but we hope for better things daily. We were very glad that nothing was attempted against the Bernese and Genevans last summer: for we feared that the Duke of Savoy, aided by the Spaniards, might undertake something great against them.</p>
      <p>Greet for me Lord Gwalter and your other colleagues. May the Lord bless you and your labors, and preserve your piety unharmed for his church for as long as possible!</p>
      <p>London, August 29, 1567.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you in the Lord, Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London.</p>
      <p>As for the decrees passed in the public assemblies of the kingdom, I also wanted to briefly write to you the sum of them, by which the sincere religion of Christ is established, and the impious superstition of the papists is abolished. However, I will omit those which pertain to the civil polity of the kingdom, since it would be endless to recount each one; indeed, it is not necessary, especially for you, whom I am convinced know all these things well enough.</p>
      <p>First, not only are all the impious traditions and ceremonies of the papists abolished, but also that tyranny, which the pope himself has exercised in the church for many centuries, is completely abolished; and it is provided that all shall henceforth recognize him as the very antichrist and son of perdition, of whom Paul speaks.</p>
      <p>II. The Mass, as an execrable abomination and diabolical profanation of the Lord's Supper, is abolished; and it is forbidden for anyone in the whole kingdom of Scotland to either celebrate or hear it: if anyone does otherwise, for the first offense all his goods, both movable, as they call them, and immovable, are confiscated to the treasury, and the violators of the law are punished at the discretion of the magistrate, in whose jurisdiction they are caught. For the second offense, they are punished with exile, for the third, with death.</p>
      <p>III. All those decrees of the senate, by which the authority of the pope was either established or confirmed in past times of darkness, are rescinded.</p>
      <p>IV. The coronation of the king is confirmed, because the queen, his mother, voluntarily abdicated the throne and ordered him to be made king by her letters.</p>
      <p>V. Lord James, Earl of Moray, is chosen as the regent of the kingdom (as they say), and he is granted the power to administer the republic in the name of the king, and to govern until the king himself reaches the age of 17: this was also done at the command of the queen and with the prescribed number of years.</p>
      <p>VI. A form of oath is prescribed, which all future kings will take at the time they are created. They will promise and solemnly swear that they will do their utmost to ensure that the Christian religion, which is preached throughout the kingdom today, is sincerely maintained, and that it is not contaminated by any traditions of the papists or other heretics, which are contrary to its purity.</p>
      <p>VII. It contains the manner of granting benefices to those who ought to perform the office of ministry. For those to whom the right of patronage belongs by hereditary right will present someone to the church, whom, if the church, after diligent examination, finds worthy, it will admit: if not, it will reject, and choose another more worthy for that office.</p>
      <p>VIII. No one is chosen as judges, scribes, notaries, public apparitors, and bailiffs who has not first professed the Christian religion.</p>
      <p>IX. The third part of the tithes is paid only to the ministers of the word of God until, upon the death of the old possessors of the benefices, they can fully enjoy the benefices themselves.</p>
      <p>X. No one is admitted to instruct the youth in good letters and morals until he has subscribed to the religion.</p>
      <p>XI. Ministers are granted the power to preach the word of God sincerely, to administer the sacraments lawfully, and to sharply rebuke vices and the corrupt morals of the people.</p>
      <p>XII. The patrons of those benefices, which the priests previously enjoyed in colleges, can now convert the same to support those whom we commonly call Bursars, among whom are usually chosen young men who, lacking friends and resources, cannot otherwise devote themselves to letters.</p>
      <p>XIII. A penalty is established for fornicators. For the first offense, they pay 80 pounds, or are imprisoned for 8 days, where they are fed only bread and the thinnest beer. Afterwards, when public markets are held, they are placed in a more prominent place, so that they can be easily seen by all. Here they remain from the tenth to the twelfth hour, with their heads uncovered, bound with iron rings. For the second offense, they pay 130 pounds, or are imprisoned for 16 days; bread and water for food.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, in public markets, as before, they are displayed to the people, but with their heads shaved. For the third offense, they pay 200 pounds, or are imprisoned for three times the number of days. After this time is completed, they are immersed three times in deep water and are exiled from the city or parish forever. Both the man and the woman are subject to these penalties, as often as they are caught sinning.</p>
      <p>XIV. Incest is punished with the death penalty. However, nothing was established in the assemblies concerning adultery; but the consideration of this matter was postponed to the next assembly.</p>
      <p>XV. Marriages contracted between persons in the second degree, such as those of two brothers or sisters, are declared lawful.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend in Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich and dearest brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
