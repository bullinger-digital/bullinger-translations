      <p>Jesus.</p>
      <p>I received your reproachful letter, dated March 2, on July 17, for not having written to you for so long (my reverend in Christ), on June 24. Continue what you have begun; urge, stimulate, and finally, at least by force, you will extort something. Better are the wounds of a friend, etc. I am slow and infrequent in writing, but I have not cast off all shame; nor has my memory of you cooled so much that I cannot rightly sing what the Psalmist says of Jerusalem, I say of your blessed Zurich: "If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill at the beginning of my joy."</p>
      <p>Your prudence has heard, albeit late, as you write, about our troubles, how harshly and suddenly they rushed upon us; and also, how well they have been quieted; but I wish I could say extinguished!</p>
      <p>In my last letter to you, I narrated that the Queen of Scots had fled to us, and I compared our state to the people of Laish. I feared that what happened to them would happen to us; and what I feared, happened. The Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland, among whom I live, preparing a rebellion, roused us from sleep; and as long as they could, they pursued it with all their might. They intended all violence against religion and individual ministers. However, the Lord delivered us all from the mouth of the lions, unharmed in body, although stripped of all fortunes and goods. You may wonder how this happened: the world does not tolerate two suns, nor one kingdom two queens or religions. Our people in Leuven obtained papal bulls to absolve the people from the obedience due to the royal majesty: so that they would no longer attend our churches and prayers, be reconciled to their synagogue; and obtain forgiveness of all sins even neglecting purgatory, who submit to these. These impieties so occupy the minds of many that I doubt whether they can ever be eradicated. Some are detained in prison for these matters: many have fled, but the greatest part hides, eagerly awaiting the opportunity for new tumults. Some of the nobility have joined them: but our good Lord has frustrated them all in their hope, and preserved our Elizabeth for us, and will preserve her for a long time, as all good people hope and wish. Northumberland, fleeing to Scotland, is detained there in prison, with some others of the same faction. Westmorland wanders there in exile with some of his kind. Others flee to Flanders, seeking help, who are conscious of their guilt. But the Lord will not forsake His own. James, the tutor of the King of Scots and second in the kingdom, was killed by the treachery of a certain Scot, whom he had saved from death; which troubles many good people: for he was a good man to all and feared God. The better part of the Scots favor our queen: we pursue the others with sword and flame.</p>
      <p>We have been restored to our flock by the grace of God; and although not all minds are as peaceful as I would wish, there is nevertheless a place left here and in Scotland for the exercise of laws and religion freely. The Lord will grant better things through your prayers. The Bishop of London has now been made Archbishop of York, my nearest; which indeed I seriously rejoice.</p>
      <p>As soon as Thomas Lever comes to London, he will make some collection in aid of our good matron and send it. I would send it now if I understood how it could be conveyed. With our good Abel, the common messenger, long dead, I do not know how these will reach you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my lord, with all your fellow students. May Zurich be blessed!</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, James Pilkington.</p>
      <p>To the reverend in Christ and most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the people of Zurich.</p>
