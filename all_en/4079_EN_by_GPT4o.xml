      <p>Lord Klebitz, etc., moved to England with his entire family about two months ago, although he otherwise had a vocation nearby. It is said that in his homeland, his adversaries, Mr. Thilmann, offered him a position, etc.</p>
      <p>The same Mr. Thilmann is said to have been removed from Prem as unruly and to have come to Geneva to Mr. Illyricus and his adherents, where he will not stay long due to the end of the primacy and other reasons; for their temperaments are quite restless, and among themselves in the matter of the council, they are opposed and disagreeing, etc.</p>
      <p>What has been issued from the new council is notorious and partly to be noted from the enclosed writing. As for Mr. Doctor Weidner, he is still doing quite well considering his age. Given as in the letters.</p>
