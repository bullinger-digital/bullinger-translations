      <p>Greetings. I am sending back the living letter. It will be able to say more than I can write; my hands are so weary, my head weak from a long illness, from which I have not yet fully recovered. I am pleased that you commend Jakob in such a way that you have received him into the stipend; I have always expected him to become someone of whom the homeland would be proud; make sure to retain him in this way. I truly give you immortal thanks for so many and such great benefits, with which you continually affect me; I am forced to despair of repaying, and I ask the Lord to act as a rewarder for me. I have not yet read the Decade, I have read the Consensus; here it pains, as it pained before, that our church is despised as if it does not pertain to the truth. Our smallness could be despised; the fervor for the truth should not have been, nor could it have been, indeed it could have been, because it happened so. But enough about this matter, because what is done cannot be undone.</p>
      <p>It is reported from Augsburg about the council, that the princes should bring their preachers; there will be freedom for them to dispute for the truth, and everything will be safe until the return of each one.</p>
      <p>But I say: "And who are those princes who should do so?" For they are either Papists or Interims. So what kind of people will they bring, especially the Interims, if not troublemakers, and those who will be a delight to the enemies, with whom they will collude? There are many other things that are said, but they are vain. For what truth in the matter of piety can be expected from the Emperor and the princes, who are involved together? They want to save the Papacy, nothing more, so that they themselves can be saved, not concerning souls, but concerning the body.</p>
      <p>Jakob will report about Magdeburg, I pray, what we have learned. I will write more, once the Lord makes me more vigorous. Farewell in the Lord with yours and all pious brothers. Basel, March 12, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Consider Jakob as highly recommended as you do.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
