    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] To not neglect the friendship that began [at the end of August], Enzinas prefers to write an unimportant letter rather than none at all. He will certainly give [Bullinger] another reason to respond, especially since the current unrest often provides opportunities for writing. Although much is said about the war, it is uncertain rumors that are spread publicly by people without restraint.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Enzinas could not learn anything certain about the past assembly in Baden, but unfortunately, the discord among the Confederates seems to persist. What is happening is sad. However, nothing can be changed about it. All the more reason to serve God faithfully and fearlessly until the end.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger (and who else?), who is entirely suited for it through his virtues, should express his opinion and his beliefs for the common good and for posterity, and share the treatise on the church's doctrines that is with him, as he promised. Only when he has done this will Enzinas be at peace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan and to Johannes [Jan Mączyński] who is living with him. Enzinas forwarded the letter of the latter to [Martin] Bucer, but has not yet received a response. Enclosed is an oracle ("vaticinium") that he received from Bucer. Enzinas is still waiting for the paper that the printer [Christoph Froschauer] was supposed to send him. If the latter is unable to do so, he should notify Enzinas so that he can take care of it in Frankfurt.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [P.S.:] Bullinger should forward the enclosed letter to Lindau.</p>

      <p>S. D. Although there was nothing that needed to be written to you, most learned Bullinger, yet, because I thought it unworthy of our love that the friendship begun between us under the auspices of Christ and confirmed by an eternal bond should languish through neglect and silence, I preferred to write an empty letter to you rather than none at all. Certainly, I will provide an occasion for you to reply, which otherwise the disturbances of these times supply too much. Much is indeed said about the war, but all are uncertain rumors, and sometimes sad, sometimes joyful news is announced, as is the custom and nature of people, who do not hesitate to transfer their private feelings and prejudices, which they brought from home, to public affairs. I suppose you have more certain information there, which I would wish to know from your letters.</p>

      <p>About the assembly held in Baden, I have heard nothing certain yet, except that I fear the same discord among the Swiss persists as before. These are indeed sad things that we see with our eyes today, and they rightly ought to afflict the minds of those who think correctly. But what can you do? Should we therefore be broken in spirit? On the contrary, I decide that we must work much more courageously, so that each one may serve God faithfully in his calling and with a strong and unbroken spirit, persistently break through the midst of hardships and dangers to the goal of his calling. Indeed, you do, if anyone else, Bullinger, not only with great commendation of your virtue but also with greater utility to the republic, while you build splendid monuments of your genius to testify to your integrity and doctrine for all posterity.</p>

      <p>You would indeed fulfill your duty much more abundantly if you would share the treatise on ecclesiastical doctrines, which lies hidden with you, for the common good. Not only does the utility of the church urge you to do this, but I also earnestly request it from you; for I seem to myself to have the best right to obtain this from you, as if from a promissory note, based on your promise. Nor will I certainly cease to entreat you until I have extorted it, lest you allow the utility, which is to reach many through your writing, to be confined in you alone. If you wish to escape my importunity, quickly fulfill your promise, which I do not doubt you will do. As for me, whom I have otherwise surrendered to your power, and I again bind my faith to you, you will always expect from me what can be expected from a man most devoted to you.</p>

      <p>Greet in my name Mr. Pellikan and Johannes, who lives with him, whose letter I sent to Bucer, but I have not yet received a response. I send to you the oracle, which I received from Bucer. I am waiting for the paper that the printer was supposed to send, whom I urge to send a selected one and quickly, or if he cannot do this, let him inform me so that I may take care of it from Frankfurt. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 5th day of October 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Francisco Dryander.</p>

      <p>You will send this letter to Lindau.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest friend and brother. Zurich.</p>
