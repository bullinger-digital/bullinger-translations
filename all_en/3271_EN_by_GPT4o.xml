      <p>Greetings and blessings. I received your letters, dear godfather and brother, carefully written about all your matters, and I give you the greatest thanks for them. Continue as you have begun.</p>
      <p>The king hesitates because he is uncertain.</p>
      <p>The assembly is now being held in Baden, and they have not yet granted soldiers to the king except for the people of Freiburg and Solothurn; the others have so far granted nothing. However, many suspect that the king, once he has more freedom, will have soldiers.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, it is certain that the people of Basel and Schaffhausen are more inclined to renounce the alliance. The soldiers the king now demands, he plans to lead to Italy to free and bring out the Guise army, with which he will soon descend through Piedmont into the Belgian Gaul. But the Swiss will hardly grant soldiers who will first go to Italy; for they see that this journey will be most dangerous. Also, those who serve holiness should be rewarded.</p>
      <p>Would that the Rhaetians might someday be wise, so that, after their soldiers are slain in the service or army of the king, they are not forced to allow themselves to be plundered and torn apart by the Italians and Spaniards, leaving their entire domain to the Athesians and landsknechts, etc.</p>
      <p>Friends write from Augsburg that Ferdinand has requested from Schertlin an army of 5000 infantry and 300 light cavalry, Schertlin here having devoted all his efforts to the king and prepared a chosen army for the king, which he would lead against the Turk in Pannonia. But behold, while he waits for the call, a messenger arrives who shows that the king now has no need for an army against the Turk; therefore, the soldiers he has prepared should be sent to Riedlingen, where Pollweiler will soon enlist an army of 7000 infantry and 1000 cavalry, which he will lead into the Netherlands against the French, with no mention made of expenses, etc. Hence, both the captains and soldiers are almost driven mad against Ferdinand.</p>
      <p>Such foolish matters are being dealt with. It is said that Philip has prepared three orders: the first will be led by the Duke of Savoy against Marienburg, the second by Gonzaga (I think) against Burgundy, and in the third will be Philip himself with his people from Lower Germany and the English; of these (as we heard from Antwerp the day before), 7000 have arrived in Lower Germany to serve Philip against the French. The supreme commander of the English is the Earl of Pembroke, the lieutenant is Mr. Brown, the advisors are the Earl of Rutland, the Earl of Bedford, Mr. Bray, Mr. Clinton, Dudley, etc.</p>
      <p>They say Philip will head straight towards Paris.</p>
      <p>This is also written from Augsburg and in agreement from other places; although I do not think these things are entirely baseless, I still believe the matter surpasses the rumor. The king in France will not be so easily turned around, unless perhaps his day has also come and God's vengeance has fallen upon him. The colloquium in Worms is said to proceed, but without the princes, about which more later, when I have more certain information. You will have these common letters as well as the previous ones written 8 days ago with the lords consuls, Philip, Travers, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, to whom you will send all enclosed with yours and greet them most diligently. All of mine greet you and your household.</p>
      <p>Be faithful and diligent in the Lord's business. Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Most hastily.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 13, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned, pious and faithful Mr. Johannes Schmid, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, his dear lord and godfather. Chur.</p>
