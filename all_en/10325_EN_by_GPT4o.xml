      <p>God's grace be with us forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>My dear lord and brother, I hope soon, as early as the next day, to come back to you, God willing, and to resolve our distress.</p>
      <p>No special news. You already know that the meeting in Augsburg began 8 days ago. I was in Lindau with the preacher there, thanked him and others for their hospitality in my time of need outside my homeland. Then the messenger from Lindau, Deputy Mayor Bodmer, a highly esteemed man, came in the evening from Ulm, as the cities are considering the purchase of grain, minting, and other matters, to address poverty. He says nothing definitive has been decided, but they should all, whether they are in the alliance or not, come to Augsburg for this matter, etc.</p>
      <p>From Constance, Sebastian Geißberg has left, from Lindau the aforementioned Bodmer. Today, Mayor Varnbühler from Lindau writes to me in confidence. He writes to me that it is said the young Duke of Württemberg has great support with him in Augsburg, and it is expected that the Landgrave of Hesse will come there himself, etc.</p>
      <p>Konrad Zwick in Constance is not entirely healthy, etc.</p>
      <p>According to your request, as you know, I have not yet done anything, but I hope to do so and, God willing, to bring it to you myself. Greetings to both of us, your dear wife and Leon, all brothers.</p>
      <p>Done in St. Gallen, in haste, Sunday after St. Nicholas, in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Your willing, poor Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
