    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The condition of the gravely ill Myconius worsens daily. May God restore his health!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Count Georg of Württemberg came to Basel with a young, pious Count of Castelberg from Franconia [Friedrich XI of Castell], who was dispossessed by Emperor Charles V.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, traveled from Freiburg im Breisgau via Breisach and Ensisheim to Thann in Burgundy. When the mayor [Hans Schirin] in Neuenburg am Rhein asked him when the Emperor would make peace, he replied, when he wishes. It was also learned from him that the Emperor had lost over 30,000 men.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] In Freiburg, where many mercenaries with unknown destinations are located, troops are being recruited for the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Johann Hilchen von Lorch is still in Frankfurt. They are waiting for Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Buren, [from Ulm] to return from the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The people of Strasbourg have sent Jakob Sturm and Mathis Pfarrer to the Emperor. Gast cannot yet say what they have achieved.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] It is said that Johann Friedrich of Saxony is marching against Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and also against the Würzburg Bishop Melchior Zobel. May the Lord grant him victory! If God does not grant peace, there will be a great uprising in Christendom.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] It is confirmed that a farmer [...] from the village of Häsingen, a mile from Basel, has requested in writing that 80 captains be sent to his squire Hans Ludwig von Eptingen. For there are many deaths among them, and of the nine mercenaries that the squire recruited from their village, eight have already died. May all enemies of Christ and his servants perish!</p>
