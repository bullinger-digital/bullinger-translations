      <p>With Ambrosius writing, I can easily remain silent, except to thank you for your generosity and magnificence for the book you sent us as a gift, and also to mention that it was our fault that your young man was delayed longer than he wished. Therefore, blame me if he neglected anything. Ambrosius will speak of other matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your whole family. March 2, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed brother.</p>
