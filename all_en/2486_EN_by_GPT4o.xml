      <p>S. D. I understand that the case of the people of Locarno has been brought to an extreme, and the mediators' opinion is that they must either change their seat or deny the profession of truth. As for them, there is no harm, for they are exercised by the cross of Christ for healthy testing and glorious exaltation. However, the example set in them, whether from the conditions of the treaties or what they call peace, is, in my judgment, poorly understood and explained, and it is established among the rest that there should be no place for Christ, and that Switzerland, having deserved the Lord's indignation through rampant licentiousness of life and shed blood, dares and hastens with this most serious offense. We, as the only thing we can do, continue to commend the matter to the Lord in prayers and urge repentance all the more fervently among our people. Although I receive letters from some brothers from Strasbourg, they do not bring any news about the state of the church, nor anything else sufficiently new; otherwise, I would write extensively. If you have anything, I ask you to inform me. Jacob, the bookseller from Paris, has not yet arrived, and I fear greatly that the delay of the mission may be harmful to the best young men, and yet I can hardly trust such a large sum to others whose faith is not certainly known to me. Hence, I do not dare to easily entrust it to a certain fellow citizen of ours, Andreas Bletz, who is said to be departing there in the coming days; but I will use the advice of Mr. Frobenius and others in this matter, and if they indeed advise that the money should be sent through him, I wish to know your opinion and that of your people, without whose approval I will do nothing.</p>
      <p>Therefore, write as soon as possible, because this fellow citizen of ours, whom I mentioned, is said to be leaving within 12 days. Farewell. Basel, December 3, 1554. Convey my greetings to your wife, family, and all your people.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
