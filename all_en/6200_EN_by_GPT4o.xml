      <p>Greetings. I congratulate you, dearest father, on the singular blessing of God, by which He preserves you from the plague that is common to almost everyone. It is also spreading remarkably in Bergamo.</p>
      <p>In Chiavenna, it seems to have subsided, having claimed seven hundred and more people; only a few remnants remain; therefore, not many more can be taken from us, and if some are afflicted, most of them are already recovering. Praise be to God.</p>
      <p>However, as I see it, the church will not be gathered again as quickly as it was scattered.</p>
      <p>The Lord has also miraculously preserved me and my family. When I left Chiavenna, I left a certain excellent brother with his wife in the house to guard it.</p>
      <p>Not long after, the place where our clothes used to be cleaned was infected by some scoundrels, who had also infected many other doors and locks of houses with some unknown pestilent grease, with the same poison. A good matron, when she began to clean the clothes, was immediately seized with a headache and fell into a fever, then her husband, who also died; but the wife recovered by God's grace. I am on a certain mountain, solitary and a true hermit with my family, doing well and wholly devoted to prayer, reading, and writing, waiting for the Lord to call me back. I seem to myself to be Jonah on this mountain opposite my church, except that he desired Nineveh to be overthrown, while I wish my Chiavenna to be restored and saved. This calamity of our church has certainly caused me great sorrow, but not less, if not greater, and undoubtedly greater, is the death of our Calvin, especially at this time. May the Lord have mercy on His church.</p>
      <p>Within a few years, the Lord has taken from us five pillars: Philipp, Martyr, Musculus, Hyperius, Calvin, blessed indeed are they, who finally enjoy the long-desired sight of that good Lord Jesus, for whom they have suffered much; but in the meantime, the miserable church will not easily find other Philipps, Martyrs, Musculuses, Calvins. Therefore, may the Lord preserve you and in His other not-to-be-despised servants who survive, may He increase the gift, and may He destroy all heretics and sectarians or convert them to a better mind! Brentius will feel the hand of the Lord unless he repents.</p>
      <p>I am eager to understand what outcome that disputation in Heidelberg with the TÃ¼bingeners had. I was very pleased with what you wrote about the resolution of the dissension that was among your Cantons and about the hope you have for peace between the Bernese and the Duke of Savoy; it will benefit Geneva. As for France, the Lord will accomplish what He has begun, no matter how much the world and all the gates of hell rage, snarl, and go mad. I had indeed written some time ago to Beza to return those letters you sent to me, but later I forgot to include them in mine; now, therefore, you have them enclosed here.</p>
      <p>Forgive me.</p>
      <p>I truly wish to greet all the brothers and friends. I will indeed greet those whom you ordered. I have partly read in Chiavenna, while the plague was raging, and partly in this my hermitage, all of our Rodolph's homilies on the minor prophets and on Mark, not without pleasure and profit; but I have some things to write to him when I have more leisure; now I do not have time. You will convey my greetings to him in my name. I hear nothing about our Josias, although I had written to him in Chiavenna shortly before my departure, nor about Julius and whether his little son has recovered.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest father, and may the Lord keep you safe for us for a long time. Amen. From the Hermitage, July 21, 1564.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, H[ieronymus] Zanchus.</p>
      <p>Fridericus, yours entirely, greets you.</p>
