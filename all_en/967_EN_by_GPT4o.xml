      <p>Greetings. I send back to your kindness a copy of your letters to our people and I am immensely grateful for the great faith you have shown in dealing with us. At the request of the mayor (since the proconsul is bathing at the baths), I translated into the common language whatever you wrote, so that the senate could learn about the utmost silence on the matter. Now, since I understand that our people have replied, and I am not unaware of the arguments they use to defend themselves, namely that they will attribute nothing to divine laws unless they are confirmed by secular ones, I will recount to you the entire matter of the degrees of blood relations, as it was conducted among us, in order, simply as my affairs require, but candidly and truthfully, so that you may learn from it that the senate is not at fault (although they are accused of it by others) for not having promptly promulgated the law concerning the third degree. First of all: when our envoy, Franciscus Studerus, returned home from those Zurich assemblies of the cities, which your letters mention, the proceedings were immediately recited in the senate; upon hearing which, the senate decided that a law on the matter should be promulgated, provided that, above all, the ministers of our churches (which was indeed attributed to their honor) should hear the law itself. Upon learning this, Dominicus Zilius, our parish priest, a man neither unlearned nor impious, but nevertheless remarkably obstinate and hostile not only to Zwingli (by whom he was publicly rebuked for many reasons in a crowded synod at St. Gallen), but also entirely opposed to the name of Zurich, opposed himself with such a fierce effort to the rest of our ministers, who were willing to accept the law, that he even dragged them unwillingly into his opinion, denying that any magistrate had the right to restrict the freedom of marriage, which God had permitted to his people, by any laws.</p>
      <p>Then, fearing that our senate would ratify that unanimous agreement of the cities without hearing him and proceed with enacting the law, he suddenly, in his usual manner, caused a tumult from the pulpit, easily achieving among his many followers that the matter was referred to the people, having been entrusted to one or two of the tribunes; which was done without delay and indeed obtained by faction, so that the senate's judgment was rejected, and the decree was made in these words: that what is of divine law, the ministers ought to follow, and no human law is required to set a limit to divine law, etc. Dominicus believed that divine law demanded that those related in the third degree of consanguinity should not be excluded from the right of marriage, not considering in the meantime that it would also follow without any controversy that, in the same way, even brothers and sisters, paternal and maternal cousins, could not be barred from the right of marriage, since God had not excluded even this degree from the right of marriage, and thus, from the single forbidden degree of brothers and sisters, no descending degrees on either side should be open to legitimate marriages; which, however, Dominicus himself did not approve in the case of cousins, defending his obstinacy about marrying in the third degree with no other argument than the one we mentioned above. Indeed, many prudent and pious men bore Dominicus's insolence with little equanimity, and there were those who would have openly resisted, had they not thought it necessary to yield somewhat to the authority of the people due to the right of democracy and also to avoid any dissension among our people, already afflicted by the grave circumstances of the times, that might distract the churches. I often dealt very calmly with Dominicus, urging him to consider that we should not fail in either honesty or public decency; but I was telling a story to a deaf man and was even reminded not to proceed with more wisdom than was appropriate and to remember that all human prudence must yield to the wisdom of God, while he, in reality, preferred his own sense to the divine sense of the Scriptures. Indeed, as long as he lived and presided over our church named after the divine Lawrence, he administered his kingdom not only in this doctrine with the favor of many, and indeed at that time (while I presided over the judgment of matrimonial cases by the mandate of the senate), it happened once or twice that some obscure men, touching each other by that line, were united by the supporting sentence, lest the law passed by the people should not be sufficiently fulfilled, while Dominicus was meanwhile shouting and teaching that the will of the Lord required that the third degree of blood should not be deprived of the right of marriage. Here you see, Bullinger, through whom it has stood that this kinship has rejoiced in the freedom of marriage in our forum.</p>
      <p>Our entire senate was intent on having a law proclaimed that would remove scandals according to the will of the Lord and have regard for public chastity. Dominicus, on the other hand, calumniated that opinion as human wisdom, and with his followers, as we have said, he was able to achieve that the authority of the senate, however well-intentioned, was held in low regard, and by the people's request, that law was altogether restrained and suppressed until the death of Dominicus, that is, for nine continuous years. For in the year 1542, after the thousandth and five hundredth year, Dominicus, having been seized by the plague, departed from human affairs.</p>
      <p>I swear by Jesus, Bullinger, that I am telling you the truth and meanwhile suppressing my not insignificant grief, which the annoyance of his so obstinate and untimely spirit had inflicted on me. Nevertheless, as a layman and a lover of public peace, I was compelled to swallow and digest everything, even though with an anxious conscience, in an illicit matter, but yet somewhat external. After Dominicus's death, Johannes Valentinus Fortmüller succeeded him, a man more learned and eloquent in sacred letters than Dominicus, but who himself nevertheless followed the footsteps of his deceased colleague with the utmost observance in recent years for eight years; although (to tell the truth) for the last three years, he seemed to me, when discussing with him, to have become somewhat milder, perhaps due to the difficulty of the times or certainly more lenient due to the depravity of morals, looking to the sanctions of the magistrates as if they were subsidiary and in those degrees of marriage as if he were hesitating and wearying. For he had seen - alas! - a brother inflamed with beastly lust for his sister and, if I am not mistaken, encouraged by that indulgence of marriages, had begotten a child from her, who (oh, unspeakable crime!) was baptized by that parent, who was the legitimate brother of the mother from both parents. And from that time of public mourning, as far as I know, it never happened that that proximity of the third degree of blood or, to speak more correctly, kinship was united in any celebrated marriage, and finally, the ministers willingly accepted some laws passed by the magistrate, which pertained to the proper recognition of marriages.</p>
      <p>One law concerning degrees, due to the rarity of cases, I think, was not promulgated at that time and was not even desired by the ministers, as far as I know, although even then Fortmüller confessed that the senate could rightly enact against that indulgence of degrees.</p>
      <p>Only in the year 1549, when the rumor of this so deceitful marriage, about which we are currently in controversy, had spread, did Antonius Zilius, Fortmüller's assistant, come to me one day, and with such insistence did he argue the case indignantly, that he seemed to me to be acting on behalf of everyone, asking and beseeching that, since it was not permitted for me by affinity, I should act with the consul Rhiner, a serious man, to proceed with imposing penalties to prevent Ludewicus and Rosina from meeting and from all closer intimacy, crying out and lamenting that it could not be, if those so closely related by blood were admitted to consummate marriage, that our church would be affected by a very grave offense. Therefore, diligently procuring the whole matter according to his mind, I soon understood a little that Antonius, fascinated by some demon, had so slipped away from both my and his former opinion, that he did not hesitate to openly assert that Ludewicus could not be released from the bond of marriage, who had contracted it with Rosina Zollikoferina in such explicit words. Whereupon, indeed, I was greatly moved, and I decided not to fight with Antonius (lest I offend anyone), but to address everyone at once, so that I could be certain of everyone's opinion at once. Therefore, when they came to me and we were discussing the matter, I seemed to understand not obscurely that not only Antonius but also Kessler had been persuaded by Fortmüller, so that they would continue to follow and uphold that one opinion, that is, their own in this matter; for it was not fitting that those who professed the same doctrine and indeed in one church should not think and approve the same. Hence, I see that Sertorius, who thought quite differently, preferred to dissemble rather than quarrel; although he does not lack a certain genuine vehemence of spirit combined with outstanding doctrine, he has nevertheless experienced and clearly perceived Fortmüller's insolence in contending, so that he has plainly considered it better to be silent than to contend and fight in vain. Moreover, the integrity of all is such that I can in no way persuade myself that they were corrupted by either prayer or price in that matter, although there are many who do not doubt the actor's zeal, that he would achieve his desire in this way (if he could). But even so, the open cause prevents me from believing it, because the aforementioned Ludewicus, having noticed the indignation of the senate and seeing that Rosina's guardians were greatly offended, voluntarily offered to yield, provided that the ministers would calm his conscience and release him from that supposed bond of marriage, however contracted, and allow him the opportunity to take another wife. Which the ministers have consistently denied doing to this day, saying that they would have been ready if the senate had long ago passed a law to restrain that line of blood from marriage, which for many years, however, they were prevented from doing by the ministers alone. Thus far, I have depicted the whole matter for you as it was conducted, in order. It remains now for me to briefly reveal to you my opinion on those degrees (since you seemed to request it), which indeed is as follows.</p>
      <p>The entire state of marriage is governed by divine and human laws, for it is not only accomplished by the union of minds and bodies according to the law and will of the Lord, but also by the sharing of things according to the prescribed reason of civil laws. Therefore, there are in the Scriptures the precepts of God, which define and establish its measure, and there is in the monuments of the apostles the doctrine of Christ, by which its purity and chastity necessary for the members of Christ are determined. For God himself consecrated marriage for the purpose of procreation in Genesis, who created male and female for this use with a not obscure distinction of sex. And since chastity combined with reverence for blood is a notable virtue, and on the contrary, nothing is so shameful and beastly as any impudent ardor of lust neglecting it, the Lord enacted laws through Moses, by which modesty and decency would be consulted. And Christ himself so restrained what was previously permitted, that he openly implied that it was not lawful for his followers what was lawful for the Jews, and that a stricter discipline was required from the baptized than was provided to the circumcised; which Matthew extensively discusses in the fifth chapter. To these, he inculcated no precept more frequently to his followers than that of love and charity, and the apostle decrees that however great virtues, even those combined with miracles, are void if they are devoid of charity. But who does not know that true love, that is, Christian love, is contained within the bounds of chastity and modesty? For this reason, it is believed that he also imposed a restraint on polygamy in Matthew 19, expressly commanding that there should be only two in one flesh and that after the union of marriage, they should no longer be two, but one flesh. For it cannot be that the love of a husband is one and entire if he has two, not to mention more wives. Therefore, we read and observe no less salutary precepts concerning marrying and taking a wife, concerning an undefiled bed, and concerning the various duties of marriages, comprehended in the letters of the apostles.</p>
      <p>But those profane and civil laws are almost entirely applied to civil actions, although even in them the end is charity itself, because it is clear that they are established for this purpose, lest those whom the Lord has joined be distracted by disputes over adventitious things, if not in flesh, certainly in minds, and dissent and separate. Therefore, long treatises have been placed concerning betrothals, the right of dowries, donations between husband and wife, inheritances, and successions of heirs, to pass over other things. Furthermore, there are more discussions among legal experts about lawful and unlawful marriages and about divorces and repudiations; but their primary authority is those that mention the goods of the married. However, I think that the laws of Christian magistrates, which discuss either permitting or prohibiting marriages, ought to be such that they do not conflict with divine laws nor allow anything more liberally or bind more strictly than the Lord has allowed or bound. For it is necessary that in a congregation sanctified by the faith of Christ, civil power, no less than the hierarchical ministry, be subject in all things, and especially in enacting laws that pertain to religion, to the will of God, and propose their laws in such cases as we have mentioned, for no other purpose than that they may be an aid to those things that are sanctioned by the Lord, so that those who would not act rightly out of love of virtue may at least be restrained by fear of punishment from what is shameful. For I do not approve of certain glossators of civil laws, who excuse the improper edicts of princes by saying that they are lawful and valid by the law of the forum, even if they are not admitted by the law of heaven.</p>
      <p>Just as in the Justinian Code, where it deals with marriages, he allows the law by which the emperors Arcadius and Honorius permit marriage to paternal and maternal cousins to be valid, so that it may prevail by the law of the forum, but not by the law of heaven, etc.; as if indeed the law of a Christian prince could be approved, which conflicts with the heavenly law, or as if those saints were so holy that they could not err in enacting laws and approve unjust and impious things, and that Valentinian, the father of Gratian, did not fall foully when he took Justina in addition to his living wife Saevera and enacted a law that whoever was not content with one could have multiple wives. For they seem to me to err equally, who think that relatives prohibited by the magistrate's law from contracting marriage should not be admitted for this reason alone, because the magistrate prohibited it, but the Lord left it free for his people, neither expressly commanding them to marry nor forbidding it more strictly. For I would not dare to approve any law of the magistrates that binds and forbids something that God had left free by his word; for the authority of the civil sword would be valued more than that freedom, which the Lord would not have disapproved by some tacit consent. But the apostle Peter in no way permits the prudence and dignity of the magistrate to be preferred to the will of the Lord; for the judgment of God in every kind of cause is to be preferred to all human opinion.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I would not listen to those who say that the pope sins because he does not admit the right of marriage to many to whom the Lord admits it, while he dispenses with many (as they say) who are barred from marriage by the law of the Lord. For unless I am mistaken, the magistrate would sin no less if he removed from marriage by his law those whom God neither commanded to contract nor forbade, than the Roman idol sins when he entirely forbids marriage to his shaven and anointed ones with Mosaic oil. For in both cases, as I think, something other than what the Lord did would be done. What else is it to sin than to contravene the will of the Lord? or to enact in the church otherwise than the Lord has established and not to acknowledge his will?</p>
      <p>Therefore, Bullinger, I consider another reason why I think the magistrate acts rightly and piously when he provides by law that those related in the second or third degree of blood should not unite in marriage. For I feel that the Lord has sufficiently and more than sufficiently admonished by his doctrine that those things should not be admitted in the churches that are connected with so great a multitude of offenses. And I entirely believe that indulgence of marriages of such close blood was legal, just as many things were customary in the time of the law, which after the advent of Christ have completely fallen into disuse in the congregation of the faithful, such as marriages between a widow left and the brother of her deceased husband and again between a single man and a woman who had been the sister of his former wife. For by the law of charity, that rule of chastity and modesty is especially confirmed, which comprises no small part of the sanctity of ecclesiastical conversation; which those who have perused the Scriptures of the New Testament cannot be ignorant of. Therefore, I approve the magistrate's law concerning restraining degrees, because I see that it is approved by the doctrine of the Lord, and I would not indeed approve it unless I saw it approved by the Lord, and I think our people err in adhering to the magistrate's law and deferring to the authors of external or civil law what should rather have been deferred to the author of internal or divine law. For Fortmüller denies that the marriage of Ludewicus and Rosina can be dissolved by law because it was not restrained by the intervention of a law passed by the magistrate.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he seems to think that in this case, it is more to be considered what the magistrate commands than what the Lord requires, when on the contrary, he should rather urge the magistrate to deem it worthy to ratify by law what we are all taught by divine law of charity. For sanctions pertaining to public discipline seem frivolous to me, which the magistrate thinks should be promulgated unless it is clear that they have been derived from the consent of divine will. Our Savior Jesus cried out and taught in this way: Woe to the world because of offenses, Matthew 18, openly admonishing that nothing should be committed or admitted that could offend a neighbor and lead to a fall and entice. But I ask them, do such shameful marriages not bring with them any offense, from whose union, not from the grace of Christ, but from the modesty instilled in us by nature, we recoil? For you to fully understand me, Bullinger, I do not only consider and revolve in my mind that offense in those degrees we mentioned before, which arises from the indignation of a thing as unusual and unheard of for many centuries and disturbs the churches with grief, but I value much more this one, which applies the torches of rabid lust to the minds of those whose age or nature is inclined to incest, in such a way that inflamed by this so insolent liberty of marriages, they dare to promise themselves anything even from closer degrees and do not much consider it important in their minds by which line of blood they abuse to satisfy their lust, as long as they see that, with only brothers and sisters excepted, all the nearest descending lines on both sides, namely of the second and third degree, are placed in the conjugal bed by the assent of divine law (as they think). For I have no doubt that from this source of disgrace those unspeakable crimes have flowed among us, when in the territory of the abbot of St. Gallen, in those very years when this license was opened, a certain parent begot children from his legitimate daughter and again another from the sister of his living wife, with a horrible defilement to the ears of the good, so that it is not at all surprising that the divine Augustine so greatly abhorred the marriages of cousins; for indeed the holy and learned man saw that such marriages were not only impure in themselves but also open to offense for this reason, that it seemed as if a brother were marrying a sister and a sibling a sibling. What then do they mean when they say: the Lord left the third degree free in Leviticus 18? Certainly, he did not touch the second degree either by commanding or forbidding, to which they have nevertheless permitted no place in our churches.</p>
      <p>The apostle made the eating of meats forbidden by the law free, and in a few words taught that all things are pure to those baptized in Christ and endowed with the doctrine of faith. But he so tempers this liberty, even commanded by God, with charity, that he most strongly removes and asserts any loss of offense from it, which could be damaging to a brother, saying that he would rather abstain from the forbidden food forever than cause the weakness of anyone to be provoked to a fall by his eating. If, therefore, the apostle so severely warns against violating the law of charity with a matter external and indifferent in itself, what, I ask, will our people not defer to charity in the modesty of blood and that public discipline of chastity to be preserved, when they see that people are unwilling to bear such marriages or certainly take them as an example leading to a fall, while such people, as if to a certain promiscuous Venus, with no honest cause or any just reason urging, but rather with a single pursuit of seeking wealth or living a life in leisure and luxury, pant with such great offense to all and, to speak freely, seek their advantage with brazen face by marriage contrary to both human and divine law with tricks and wickedness? Who, I ask, would not be indignant and not rightly have that line from Persius in his mouth, namely "shame has perished from things," etc., if any magistrate were to continue to connive at such deceitful marriages? Now, when the ministers of Christ, neglecting, as it seems to me, the laws of preserving charity and averting scandal, not only connive at these things but (which is far worse) proceed to aspire to them with great consensus, what limit can there be in expostulating with those who make marriages free full of offenses, which we have already said are restrained by divine laws from the churches? For I think that the divine law of Christ concerning removing scandal from the churches is to be considered, and moreover, the law of charity should be held in an eminent place by the faithful, not only for this purpose, lest we offend a neighbor according to the apostle or, according to Augustine, the bond of friendship be propagated as widely as possible in the churches by the intervention of marriages, but especially for this reason, that help may be given to the weak and unadvised age, lest, having despised the laws of modesty and chastity, it continues to lend an ear to captious persuasions.</p>
      <p>For the praetor of the city of Rome, a pagan man, sitting in judgment, proclaims in these words: Whatever will be said to have been done with someone under 25 years of age, I will certainly take notice of it.</p>
      <p>The pagan man took notice - alas! - of what men initiated into Christ do not take notice of. But as Ulpian says, the praetor followed natural equity with this edict. For since it is agreed among all that the counsel of such an age is fragile and weak and subject to many deceptions and exposed to the snares of many, the praetor promised help to it with this edict and assistance against deceptions, etc. If, therefore, the equity of civil law derived from natural law is accustomed to this, what should Christian charity, strengthened by the authority of divine law, not provide with its dutiful solicitude to all those whose age is that of a minor and unadvised and ignorant of what is fair and just, and who are subject to the governance of parents, guardians, and curators for no other reason than that they are allured and persuaded by deceitful arts and tricks to that consent, the ratification of which neither divine nor human laws permit?</p>
      <p>Moreover, just as help must be given in every way to minors to avert offense and retain the form of discipline, as charity demands, so also a barrier must be imposed on adults who are of their own right, lest, with the pollution of blood relations, they harm good morals with a bad example. For what is worse than the degeneration and corruption of morals? What, on the other hand, is more sacred in the congregation of Christ than the law of modesty? What is more excellent for diligently cultivating sincere love?</p>
      <p>Bad company corrupts good morals, as the apostle taught by citing a verse from Menander; how much more do bad examples subvert them. Now, Bullinger, so that you can have a clear understanding of all the circumstances of that so inauspicious marriage, know that two matrons of our city are under great suspicion and are moved by not slight conjectures, who suspect that by the cunning of both, not only Rosina but also Ludewicus himself was led to this plan, so that he dared to experiment with contracting marriage with her. For he is said to have once declared in Lyon that he would be more alienated from no Venus than from that of relatives. Rosina also confessed to one of her brothers that she was lured by clandestine persuasions to consent to the words of marriage with Ludewicus. Of the matrons, one is Rosina's aunt, who has Ludewicus's brother as her husband, the other is Ludewicus's sister, both otherwise honorable and of good family, whose plans, not much noticed by the dignity of the laws, perhaps aimed at providing the greatest possible advantage of the dowry (which is six thousand gold coins) to the brother and brother-in-law; which you know to be peculiar to female cunning, I do not want to say foolishness. Indeed, Rosina was long ago orphaned of her father, and recently also of her mother, from which time she was under the care of her brothers, paternal uncles, and maternal uncles, who are indeed all relatives and kin of Ludewicus. But both Ludewicus himself and, who should not have, Rosina, once, if I am not mistaken, with the advice of those we mentioned before, so supinely and impiously despised them all, that they did not utter a single word (although they were present at daily banquets and feasts) about that very serious matter worthy of the knowledge of their elders.</p>
      <p>For they feared on both sides that they would not be able to achieve their desire if even a single modesty stood in the way, if their relatives and elders, whose interest it was, learned anything of the matter. And so it pleased female prudence that the matter be accomplished in the utmost silence until the bond was completed by words in the usual solemn manner to capture wealth; which indeed I hear happened in the last part of the story.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Ludewicus denies that he was more captivated by wealth than by love for Rosina in aspiring to marriage. But such is the nature of human minds that they especially conceal those plans in such cases that have most deeply taken root in their minds, especially if they are such that they cannot be excused with any honesty. Indeed, he could not have been looking at beauty, which is not present in her; for everyone admits that she is deformed.</p>
      <p>Nor indeed could blood have attracted him, from which he is said to have once confessed to abhorring, nor do those who are endowed with the nature of chaste Venus not entirely abhor it.</p>
      <p>What then? Whether he wants it or not, wealth must have been considered, the incentives of evils, as Ovid says; for the sake of these, almost all things today are turned to hunting, however much in appearance Christian marriages, which we nevertheless vainly claim to enter and celebrate strenuously for the sake of God's will. But to leave these things aside and return to our ministers: I confess that I was greatly offended by this very thing, that they say the law of the senate, first published last year, pleases them so much that in the future they will in no way admit those degrees to marriage; but what was done before does not pertain to the law, etc. For they do not consider or certainly, blinded by favor, dissimulate that it was their obstinacy that prevented the law from being promulgated at the earliest possible time from the very day of the assembly, and that the causes of that law are so established by divine equity, as we have said, that for the sake of that very thing, the ministers of charity in the kingdom of Christ ought to have barred anyone from those lines, even if the magistrate had continued to delay. And the man of good memory, Dominicus, who delayed the pious endeavor of the senate, should have seen that no union could be approved by which the relationship of blood was so greatly polluted and to which so many offenses of both good morals and also consciences, which we mentioned before, could not but be associated. It cannot be believed how much these so affected and effeminate pursuits of marriages, which everyone openly sees are sought and undertaken for no other reason than the sake of amassing wealth, which can indeed suffice for immoderate luxury and leisure, displease the people of our city.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it is added that several in that family continue to have little regard for the modesty of blood and coldly observe relationships. For Rosina's aunt, whom we mentioned above, now has a second husband, indeed an excellent man endowed with exceptional candor of morals, but who was the cousin of her former husband.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Ludewicus's sister, mentioned earlier, being a widow, is believed to be eager to marry someone who, if he became her husband, would be related to her in the third degree of blood. For what else does that license of marriages produce in the minds of those who, inflamed by avarice, would not be satisfied even with the wealth of Croesus if they understood that greater wealth was required to satisfy their delights? Therefore, it would be better to be intent on the law of God, and it should be the primary concern of the ministers, and then also of the magistrates, to so restrain and govern the most savage lust with harsh bits that regard may be had for public modesty.</p>
      <p>The ministers have the most explicit admonitions of the Scriptures and are bound by the law of God, that they do not at any place or time cease to uphold what they understand to be in accordance with the will of the Lord. Indeed, Bullinger, I would consider the law of Theodosius, the most Christian prince, to be worthy of great authority, unless I saw that he was moved by those causes which are comprehended in the law of preserving charity and averting scandal; for Augustine in his book on the City of God 15 seems to refer that tacit consent of God in Leviticus 18 more to the Jews, to whom many such marriages were permitted by the letter of the law. He acknowledges indeed the opinion of his times and admits that this indulgence was not believed to have been removed by any express laws before. Nevertheless, he does not remain silent about how greatly it was sinned against the morals of the good in this matter, with the law of charity protesting. For these are his words: "For if it is unjust, out of greed for possession, to transgress the boundaries of fields, how much more unjust is it, out of lust for marriage, to transgress the boundary of morals?"</p>
      <p>Thus far Augustine, openly implying that the law of charity is violated in such marriages because of the corruption and depravity of morals; and the cause of that violation is the offense itself, which arises from the indulgence mentioned above, so that from there it is sufficiently clear, I think, that Theodosius was compelled by the reverence of divine law and today every Christian magistrate is compelled not to permit any degrees of blood so close to brothers and sisters to be united, but to make themselves conform to the divine law by their own law. As for the legal indulgence of marriages, it is sufficiently established that it also carried with it some figure and mystery, according to the custom of the old prophetic Scripture, full of shadows and figures. For the apostle, educated in the law, does not doubt that that union of man and wife, which was instituted from the beginning, was not without figure and mystery, namely of Christ the bridegroom with his church so inseparably united that they are no longer two, but one flesh; our flesh sanctified from his flesh and our bones from his bones, as we read in the epistle to the Ephesians.</p>
      <p>Moreover, since it is manifest that it was severely forbidden by the Lord to Israel hastening to the promised land not to pollute themselves with the marriages of foreign nations, and the Scripture itself testifies that the multitude that first entered that land of promise was not so numerous, it seems indeed not alien to the truth that divine providence did not wish to grant a more liberal indulgence of marriages to that people by laws, so that they might separate themselves further from the company of those who, having rejected the true God, were devoted to the veneration of false gods, and that those very things which had been granted to the Jews not without cause could easily be amended in that kingdom of Christ, that is, the asylum of light and truth, as I may say, since not only the Jews but also the nations with their most numerous offspring were to come to Christ, and one law of averting offense was to remove all near kinship of blood by the authority of Christ, while the magistrate, both pious and pagan, would take notice of those whom either the lust of the mind or the bad examples of morals admitted would hold captive with depraved and incestuous affections. For the Lord openly removed that primitive necessity of propagating the human race, by which a sister was joined to a brother and a cousin to a cousin, by enacting laws, demonstrating by that very fact that what was temporarily permitted to necessity cannot be allowed to anyone once that necessity is removed, and that modesty should be so deferred to that no occasion of violating or certainly diminishing it should be admitted by those who are sanctified by the Lord. For we learn from the very laws of the pagans that great honor was paid to the reverence of blood even among the nations; how much more do we owe to it, who not only cultivate and profess the law of nature (which is weak in itself) but also the law of the Spirit of Christ. As for the mysteries of marriages celebrated by the indulgence of the law among the Jews, it is not my place to discuss at length, although I see that they were at hand for interpreters, however bearded, in interpreting the Scriptures, I do not know how happily treated, but far better handed down in the light by the monuments of those whose profession in sacred letters is renowned and famous. The other thing, Bullinger, that I attribute not only to the ignorance but also to the madness or certainly the inadvertence of our ministers, is that they themselves refuse to release Ludewicus Hagium from error and to calm his conscience, demanding solid doctrine, and furthermore, asking for the freedom to contract with those with whom he can by right, for this one reason, because he bound himself with words of present contract, as they say, to marriage with Rosina and ratified the marriage with his consent, however unjust, and by their hesitation, they do not see that they are adding spurs to Ludewicus, who uses cunning teachers, to urge more strongly, whose minds he sees so entangled with the conscience of this matter that he does not doubt that he will be victorious in his, however calumniously and deceitfully initiated, trifling, because no one can or even dares to persuade them otherwise. Are we to believe that the words of present contract (as they call it) are so solemn and sacrosanct that even in captious and deceitfully contrived contracts, moreover in the age of a minor, circumvented by female arts and counsels, they should prescribe laws, I do not say enacted by the magistrate, but by the Lord himself, and published, without any controversy?</p>
      <p>What law of God, what law of men has impressed such a character and mark so indelible with these words: "I want to have you as a husband," etc., that once uttered they should be considered like a divine oracle and be worshiped as the voice of God and be thought valid, and not rather be persuaded by divine and human law admonishing that not only words, than which nothing is more captious, nothing more full of deceit, but minds, and indeed confirmed by much deliberation, should establish that perpetual union of both bodies and also of all things and fortunes of life, and be contracted by prudent or certainly mature and experienced men, and that indeed especially if it should seem to be done in the name of God and according to the prescription of divine law?</p>
      <p>Indeed, I cannot sufficiently marvel at how it happens that the same people do not admit somewhat inconsiderate contracts that are made by drinking or toasting, and by their judgment declare them invalid, and do not condemn this very contract of Ludewicus and Rosina, but wish it to be valid with the danger of conscience, which they can nevertheless know to be frivolous and invalid not only by human but also by divine law intervening, because the minor herself had no right of any legitimate consent, which was not approved by the plain consent of guardians and curators.</p>
      <p>For what can any man do by right who is not of his own right? Or what can be valid in that simple and half-witted age, which the elders (in whose power these things are) do not make valid? But such marriages have also been admitted by us before, contracted with the elders either unaware or ignorant. Indeed, let it be so; for we cannot deny that. But it was done not by the error of our senate, but by the error of Dominicus and his followers, that what should have been prohibited and forbidden was permitted without any just cause. What then is the use of drawing an example from error? and preferring to reject the recognized truth of the matter rather than uphold it? preferring to act as a patron of the unjust rather than the just? finally, and not fearing the law of God in the matter of marriage, even if nothing is promulgated by the magistrate? The ministers know the law of God: HONOR YOUR PARENTS.</p>
      <p>By which law they themselves admit that minors are altogether barred from the right of marriage, especially if any suspicion of deceit intervenes; for from this right, both divine and human, all who are under the power of their elders are barred. But I have pursued these things more extensively and diffusely than I intended when I began. For I wished that no act of this story should be hidden from you, although almost everything seems to me to have been so adorned and arranged by sordid pursuits and a sufficiently long time that it could not be entirely recounted without annoyance. However, I testify to the Lord that in this cause and controversy I was neither captivated nor excited by hatred of anyone nor by favor of my own, but was moved by that one and only indignation of the matter, by which I did not indeed fear to oppose myself to the ministers' reputation and in some way to advocate for public modesty, not indeed in the senate or in any assembly of men, but among ourselves. For I thought that a good man ought to be so minded that he would not consider even the favor of his neighbors to be preferred to the truth, which was associated with the dignity of religion. Therefore, I have satisfied my conscience, although I can hardly say that they have rejected my opinion so supinely. Nevertheless, I love and honor them from the heart, not unaware of what I owe to the authority of the priesthood; although I cannot deny that in Fortmüller, endowed with so many gifts, I miss a somewhat more civil modesty than his mind has hitherto displayed; in Antonius, indeed, an excellent man, a somewhat greater constancy and knowledge of things than I have hitherto discovered in him; in Sertorius and Kessler, the liberty which they only intermittently use through dissimulation and the pursuit of peace, and yet they could sometimes use it with the greatest benefit to our church, for they surpass all the rest in knowledge; and I confess that in the meantime there are also many things in me that I would wish were not there, which they themselves desire in me. For I do not inspect another's wallet (oh Bullinger!) so that I do not inspect my own. However, God knows that I am a lover of both honesty and also truth and holiness; which indeed they themselves, I think, not obscurely proclaim about me and openly agree with me in this, that it is fitting for the ministers to uphold and follow the law of God, however the judgment of the magistrate may be, and that the Christian magistrate should be most candidly exhorted not to indulge anything at any time to the congregation that disagrees with the divine law; for by this one function they can prove themselves and all their counsels to the Lord. As for the parts and characters of the story, know this: I not only love Ludewicus with his brother Johannes and with the widow Magdalena, his sister, but I also honor them and pray for all good and happy things from the Lord, not only because of the celebrity of the family (which touches me with much kinship), but more because of the goodness of their morals, which I would wish to be approved by the judgment of all good people in this cause, and I would wish them not to be so greatly held by the love of wealth, who are blessed with such a great increase of fortunes otherwise.</p>
      <p>For from this one disease of greed alone has arisen that whole conflagration in which we are now laboring to extinguish for so long a time. I love Rosina herself greatly because she is the sister of my family, and I pity her because I see that those wicked attempts have been so greatly abused by her innocent and simple and plainly childish nature. I cannot say how often that line from Maro has come to my mind in the discussion of this matter: "What do you not drive mortal hearts to, accursed hunger for gold?" But I leave these things, which draw a long rope with the pursuits of the world and the flesh and Satan. Finally, I have to confess this: I commend the long-suffering of our ministers, that, doubtful by what right or what wrong, they so kindly support those men, joined to us by no communion of our Lord's table at all, nor distinguished by any (as far as I know) testimony of purer religion, but devoted for a great part of their lives to their trade in Spain, whose religion I have not yet clearly seen whether they have rejected from their minds. They gather at our house in our congregation and listen to our ministers; but to listen to others of different doctrine or to make themselves participants in the tables of demons is indeed forbidden to them at home by a severe law imposing a great fine. However these things may be, I say that I think most candidly of them (except for this one cause of the shameless marriage) and leave the secrets of their hearts (as far as religion is concerned) to God, and what the divine Jerome said in a certain preface to Jeremiah, this I can also say before the Lord:</p>
      <p>"I am an enemy not of men, but of error," etc.; provided that error is to be considered, which I pronounce to be a foul error. Farewell. St. Gallen, on the 10th day of July, in the year of our Lord 1550.</p>
