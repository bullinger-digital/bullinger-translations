      <p>Greetings. That you count me among those pious and learned, my most esteemed and dearest Bullinger, whose judgment you value so highly that if they approve your writings, you think you have reason to congratulate yourself, you certainly do more out of friendship than rightly. I truly acknowledge that there is nothing of the sort in me, nor do I arrogantly claim anything of this kind for myself, always measuring myself by my own standard. However, I am very glad to read in your letters to me that you love me so much, and I do not wish to free you from this error by which you attribute so much to me, lest your love for me diminishes even by a hair, which, believe me, I value so highly that I consider it a principal part of my happiness. Therefore, you will continue to love me much and steadfastly, as you have long begun, for I love you in return, and I also greatly revere and admire you, as I almost worship the remarkable and rare gifts of the Lord in you, which I strive to obtain with the prayers of my faith, that He may make them even more illustrious with new additions.</p>
      <p>Those who value the Württemberg prince and Brenz so highly that they prefer them to their own churches and other men of sound and solid judgment, act completely preposterously, and they will eventually understand how unhappily they indulge their own passions here, preferring to yield to truth. Let us pray to the prince of the shepherds of his sheep, Christ, for them, that while things are still somewhat intact and not too late, that is, before the irreparable damage to the churches is done, this may happen to them. Our Jüngius, anxious in spirit, in those letters, a fragment of which I recently sent to you, earnestly requests at the very end that I seriously pray to the Lord for the church of Basel. "For I fear," he says, "great disturbance and discord, unless God averts it." It was indeed fortunate that our Jüngius was called there, mainly at my instigation; for with his grace and authority, as much as he has, he greatly hinders and even breaks the ill-conceived plans of some others before the senate and the people. May the Lord preserve him for as long as possible! I see more and more how much the church of Basel needs this teacher.</p>
      <p>Regarding our letters to be sent to London, I will follow your advice, for which I am also grateful to you. I am returning what you recently sent, greatly amazed at how you found so much leisure to write it with your own hand. I gave that reading two days ago to the truly noble Hartmann von Hallwyl, who had business here with your consul von Komm and the chief scribe Äscher in the Goldenberg affair, a man well known to you and recognizing your hand at the first sight of the writing. He is exceedingly grieved by that domestic discord born within our walls, from which more evils threaten us than from the most papist adversaries themselves. Everything wants to clash together, our own house's evil and the many great dangers outside the house. May God help His beloved church and us in and with it. Amen, amen, amen. We will pray to the Lord that the evil plans of the Confederates, which they now seize from the opportunity of the time, may fall back on their own heads, so that they may understand the truth of the saying: An evil plan is worst for the planner. For there is no wisdom, no counsel against the Lord; if we turn to Him with all our hearts, we will not have to fear, even if the shattered world collapses. I hope to be able to send the little bishopric today, which is addressed to Rietmüller; I could not do it earlier, as there are not daily opportunities here for those who travel there. May the Lord Jesus Christ, the only mighty avenger of our salvation, preserve you, my esteemed and sweetest Bullinger, with your household amidst these worldly pressures and storms... with all your fellow ministers, always venerable friends and brothers to me. I truly wish that my old age may be so aided by all your sacred commendations to our heavenly renewer, that I may effectively feel my end fortified by them. Farewell, my soul.</p>
      <p>In Winterthur, April 3, that is, the day before the day on which 69 years ago I was brought into this world's light, now about to enter the seventieth year of age, which, according to the royal prophet, is the limit of human life, which may Christ, bearing me, happily transfer me from this heap of all evils to the heavenly and eternal light of the higher world! Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, friend and brother, as esteemed by himself as by all, by far the dearest, etc.</p>
