      <p>Greetings. I wrote in recent days about the selection of soldiers made by our people.</p>
      <p>We now await the outcome of the matter and what the Lord will do. There is no end to threats.</p>
      <p>Rumor has it that the Pope will send 2000 musketeers. Our people are investigating everything as much as possible.</p>
      <p>Among the Five Cantons, there are those who dissuade war by all means; but we are in the hand of the Lord; may He strengthen and protect us! Yesterday, several from Glarus were present, with whom we discussed various matters and encouraged them in the Lord. They seem to be quite spirited now.</p>
      <p>A meeting has been convened in Baden for the 27th of this month. The Five Cantons are also invited; but we doubt whether they will come; for our messengers, who were sent to them, have not yet returned. Nevertheless, the others will gather in Baden, unless this week they sound the trumpet and attack the people of Glarus, which many think will happen; for many of them are driven by a certain fury, in which we indeed recognize the hand of the Lord. May He lead this matter to a desired end!</p>
      <p>I am very concerned about the safety of the most serene King of Navarre, not indeed with the Lord, but among men; for the Guise seem to have brought all the power of the French kingdom into their hands, so that, unless God delivers from their hands, all seems hopeless. Nevertheless, we must hope in the Lord and pray to Him, that He may break the stubbornness of the enemies and strengthen His afflicted church. You will have done a most welcome thing for all of us if you write diligently about the success and end of these matters; for we are held in great desire for it, praying to the Lord that He may add His mighty hand to the afflicted matters. Where is our brother Beza, and how is he living? May the Lord bless him!</p>
      <p>If the Five Cantons and the people of Solothurn have united in a pact, they intend to oppress the people of Bern. Therefore, we will pray to the Lord that their efforts do not succeed.</p>
      <p>Dr. Martyr greets you, to whom I have communicated your letters. Yesterday, letters were brought from Heidelberg by the most distinguished man, Dr. Thomas Erastus, the prince's physician, now the rector of the school; I have taken care to transcribe from his letters what pertains to you. At the same time, I am sending the book of Heshusius.</p>
      <p>I prefer to spend good hours better than in refuting his trifles. I think you will do the same.</p>
      <p>However, if something must be answered, give this task to a mind imbued with pleasant and candid wit, and I do not think you lack it. It would be better to collect and publish Dr. Melanchthon's letters written to you on the matter of the Supper, for some are more moved by his authority than by Christ's. Live and farewell with all yours, to whose prayers we commend ourselves.</p>
      <p>I am sending the judgment of Philippus, brought yesterday from Heidelberg. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Greet the fellow ministers and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you and especially you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 19th October 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
