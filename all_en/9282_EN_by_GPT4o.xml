      <p>Greetings. I am sending with this letter some notes about the state of affairs in France and the Netherlands, which seemed to me to be of some importance and which are published among us as almost certain. These, my most esteemed lord, please consider favorably.</p>
      <p>When I have more, I will also share it with you as soon as possible. We have nothing from Poland; in Germany, there is sudden silence. Some soldiers, not so many, are wandering around us; they say that soon someone will come to lead them to Italy.</p>
      <p>Farewell; I do not wish to trouble you with more at this time. Given in Augsburg, April 10, in the year 1573.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten. Yesterday evening it was reported that the Cardinal of Augsburg has passed away.</p>
      <p>At this very moment, your letters of March 14 and 25 have arrived, to which I have these few things to say: Regarding the Queen of England, I think I wrote to you some time ago that she wished to be the godmother of the king's son, but her envoy was intercepted on the way; as I think and conjecture, this was done deliberately.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, it seemed strange to me. Even if she does not send aid to the Huguenots, she at least promises it. I hear from a servant, whom I sent to hire baths, that the Five Cantons have set out; however, I think that when they hear about the massacre of the royalists at La Rochelle and the killing of Aumale, they will deliberate whether they want to proceed or not. What you write about the admiral's widow being captured by the Savoyard is astonishing, and I feel sorry for the widow; however, I hope nothing more serious will be attempted against her, since the status of the Catholics is so precarious everywhere, lest they also unwisely bring harm upon themselves. I have briefly read the notes you sent, as I am in a hurry to write, and I now return them to you. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zürich, my dear lord and friend. Zürich.</p>
