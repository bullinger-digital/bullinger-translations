      <p>Greetings. The need to dictate this letter quickly is due to the thoughtlessness of a good but inconsiderate man, who did not inform me of his intention to send his sons there until he was about to send them off. I am now relieved of great pain, having passed a stone almost the size of a hazelnut. Because the retention of the stone was very troublesome to me, I mounted a horse on the doctor's advice, hoping that the movement would help expel the stone; upon returning home, behold, bloody sediment instead of urine. The next day, the stone burst from the bladder into the canal, causing more severe pain. For more than half an hour, I tried to free myself by shaking my whole body, but achieved nothing except with the help of warm water. The interior of the canal was ulcerated on all sides, causing a large flow of blood. Now I seem to have revived, as I have been given a two-day respite. I would write more extensively about the state of France if I had more leisure. In Lyon, the temples have been returned to the priests, leaving us only four, one of which was cunningly obtained under false pretenses. The man who previously governed the city has been recalled, a man of calm and gentle nature, hated by the papists because he favors us. The pious gather courage everywhere. In many places, the enemies still riot, and their rage exults in both arson and murder. They will eventually burst forth, so that even their patrons will find them implacable. The Constable softens day by day. Although the Queen flatters the prince, she gives us no hope, or very little, being fickle and cunning. Although there is nothing sincere in her, she would comply if she saw a wise and magnanimous man. Although the Parisian court has finally admitted the counselors who were fugitives, many have resigned, that is, they have exchanged their office for money. The Chancellor is very upset by this, as he would like as many as possible to be on our side; therefore, he strictly prohibits these resignations as much as he can. Admiral is still resting at home. His brother is at court. The Constable has finally been extracted to lead the army against the English. Either the laziness and cowardice of Condé is most disgraceful, or a change will soon occur.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished and esteemed brother. May the Lord keep you safe, enrich you more and more with His gifts, and support your labors. Diligently greet all the fellow ministers. My colleagues, who are now with me and from whose company I have withdrawn for a short time to dictate this, also greet you all.</p>
      <p>Geneva, July 2, 1563. Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>Believe me, I am diligently watching to prevent Lutheranism from creeping in or being introduced into France. The most suitable plan seems to be to publish the confession written by me in the name of Condé and other nobles, which binds their faith and reputation and attempts to draw the German princes to us. I am waiting for a response. Admiral is urging him. If a subscription is elicited, this matter will bring us pleasant results. Meanwhile, the condition of the churches is better than you might think, and there is greater freedom: because their religion remains intact. The confession presented to the king, along with the Catechism, is permitted to them. Finally, there is no mixture.</p>
      <p>There is no fear that the papists will accept the Augsburg Confession, even if it is forced upon them a hundred times. Since my lectures on Jeremiah will be published at the next fair, I have decided to dedicate the book to the Palatine. In the preface, I briefly summarize the whole controversy. Thus, Brentius will turn against me. The father of the boys who will deliver this to you asked me to commend them to you. Furthermore, he does not wish to cause you any trouble, but when the occasion arises, to inquire how modestly they conduct themselves and ensure they remain in their duty.</p>
      <p>Your Ionville greets you respectfully and sincerely. Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
