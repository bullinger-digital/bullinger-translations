    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to the unexpected arrival of Junker [Hans] Wilhelm von Laubenberg, a fervent follower of Schwenckfeld, Blarer cannot write much as he has to attend to him, even though he detests debates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Blarer sends Philipp [Melanchthon's] [funeral] speech [„Oratio in funere reverendi viri d. Martini Lutheri“], which will please Bullinger more than that [inappropriate funeral poem]. Bullinger should return the funeral speech with the messenger [...] unless he wants to have it reprinted in Zurich. If a reprint occurs, Blarer would like to receive some copies of it. However, the people of Zurich will probably have already received this funeral speech (of which there is also a German translation printed at an unknown location) from elsewhere.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The [Konstanz] doctor [Johann] Menlishofer is still alive and is doing quite well. His son [Johann Jakob] is also an experienced doctor. [Hans Rudolf Lavater] can thus turn to both of them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [Jakob] Metzler has returned home well with the pleasing letter of recommendation from Zurich [No. 2396]. He now wishes for his father [Bartholomäus] to allow him to marry. May he also be happily united with the bride of Christ, the Church, and not engage with the world like many others!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Blarer sends two letters from [Konrad] Hofherr, whose highlighted passages Bullinger should read. Hofherr himself admits to being less intrusive in the penultimate letter than in the last one. However, since he was suffering from a fever when he wrote the last letter, Blarer is willing to forgive his cheeky manner.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Blarer will soon write to Theodor [Bibliander] and [Rudolf] Gwalther. However, he already thanks the latter for sending the highly interesting [„De providentia sermones X“] by Theodoret.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Blarer's judgment on Bullinger's writing [„De sacramentis“] is essentially unimportant. Nevertheless, Blarer would have shared his opinion with Bullinger if he had had time to read the entire writing. Moreover, he did not want any potential printing for the Frankfurt [Spring Book] Fair to be delayed. However, since Luther's death, he believes that such a publication would be unwise. Rather, he fervently hopes that the harmful [Eucharist] dispute will now be ended.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander], [Rudolf] Gwalther, and [Konrad] Pellikan. [Thomas Blarer] also sends his regards. The latter intends to write at the next opportunity to personally thank for the book [by Theodoret] given to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [The people of Konstanz] will delegate Matthäus Molckenpur and Dominik Hochrütiner to the [upcoming] day in Baden. Since both councilors are not as familiar to Blarer as others, Bullinger should report what is to be discussed at this meeting and what he hopes to achieve from it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- He should also write if there is any news about [Antoine] Morelet [de Museau] as well as about the machinations of [Francis I] and his relationship with the Emperor [Charles V]. In Konstanz, different things are being heard about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Blarer recently forwarded [Jakob] Herbrot's letter to Bullinger [No. 2392]. Since Herbrot sent a similar letter to Blarer, Bullinger should indicate [whether Blarer should also write to Philipp Melanchthon]. It is expected that the prudent Melanchthon will avoid any turmoil.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Konrad Zwick sends his regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- [Enclosure:] The Papists are at work! The Emperor, who is on his way to the Diet, allowed the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] to arrange his own escort for the journey to the meeting in Speyer. The meeting, about which not everything is known, went amicably. From a credible man [...], Blarer has learned that the Emperor tried to prevent the planned meeting of the [Schmalkaldic League] in Worms and consequently the extension of the leagues (to which many others want to join). Allegedly, strange alliances are planned to lure [the Protestants]. May God grant prudence!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- The Cologne matter has been postponed to the Diet, so that [Arch]bishop [Hermann von Wied] still has peace, whereas his clergy is dissatisfied because the Emperor has not yet imposed the imperial ban on him. The Emperor declared to the delegated [Protestant] envoys that he hopes to settle all religious disputes at the Diet, which, however, can be interpreted in different ways.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- The Emperor still has great plans. If the peace with [Suleiman I] continues, he might instigate a war in Savoy or Lorraine. Allegedly, [Cheireddin] Barbarossa is causing him great harm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Recently, two [Spaniards, Alfonso Diaz and Juan Prieto,] traveled through Augsburg to Neuburg an der Donau to [Juan Diaz]. [Juan] had participated in the [Second] Regensburg [Religious] discussion and had become very dear to [Martin] Bucer. After [the two Spaniards lured Juan] and murdered him, they escaped and changed their horses in Augsburg to reach Trient and be rewarded there by [the bishops]. They could no longer be caught.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- The presidents of the [Religious] discussion have been recalled. However, the colloquents are said to still be there. [From the Council of] Trent, nothing is heard.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The unexpected arrival of Junker Wilhelm von Laubenberg, a fervent follower of Schwenckfeld, prevents me from writing much to you now. I have business with him, which I hope to conclude successfully, even though my spirit vehemently detests such debates.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I am sending Philipp's speech, which I know will please you more than that previous Beguttica. Please ensure that you return this message as soon as possible, unless you wish to have it printed there; in that case, I will allow you to keep it and then send me a few copies soon, although I believe you may have already received it from elsewhere. It has also been translated into German and published somewhere.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Our doctor Menlishofer is still alive and moderately well. He also has a son at home with him, who is quite experienced in medicine and very successful in healing, and he himself is honored with the title of doctor. If your consul wishes to seek assistance from either the father or the son, he will clearly see that he has not done so in vain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Metzler has returned to us accompanied by your letters, without which his arrival would not have been very welcome; but now he is well, since you, such esteemed men, have given such a testimony to the young man. He asks his father for permission to marry, a request so honorable that the father cannot refuse. May he also be beautifully united with the bride of Christ, the holy church, through his faithful ministry! For there are many who disgracefully disappoint the expectations placed upon them and embrace the present age too closely.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Regarding Curio, I cannot restrain myself from sending you his most recent letter to me and the latest one, not for you to read everything, but only those parts that are marked. It would have been more appropriate for him to write to me less boldly. But since he wrote while suffering from a fever, I am willing to attribute whatever fault there is to his illness, no matter how unfairly he treats me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I will soon write to our Theodor and Gwalther, to whom I am very grateful for Theodoret's booklet, which I have not read anything more learned or pleasant for a long time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I do not see why you so greatly desire my judgment on your book, since it matters so little what I think of it or other people's books. And yet, unless it would be rash to pronounce on a matter not yet sufficiently known, you would obtain what you ask for, if only because you are a friend, and such a one as scarcely any other. But I would die, Bullinger, if I had diligently read this; which I would have done, had not other business arisen for me at that time and I hastened to return it to you because of the approaching Frankfurt fair, lest I delay its publication, although now after Luther's death I very much doubt whether it is advisable to publish it and provoke certain hornets and not rather wait until they themselves attack the Schwärmer (as they call them) again. I fervently pray to Christ, the author of peace, that, with Luther buried, he may also bury this unpleasant (not to say more harshly) controversy and give courage to all the ministers of his gospel, that with utmost agreement they may extend the boundaries of his kingdom as widely as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Greet your household and the excellent men Theodor, Gwalther, Pellican, and the rest who love us in Christ, to whose holy patronage I uniquely desire to be commended to the Lord. My brother sends you many greetings; he himself intends to write and give thanks for the book sent, if urgent business permits.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Matthäus Molckenpur and Dominikus Hochrütiner have already been designated as delegates to your common affairs in Baden. You, please write to me diligently in your usual manner what you hope will happen and what has been done in those matters. For I am very eager to know this in time. Neither delegate is as familiar to me as several other senators are.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>What you recently wrote about Murrlet being spread among you, but not with a consistent rumor. Come, let me know whether it is true, and what the French attempts are, and whether they still agree with the Emperor. Here everything varies. I recently sent you the letters of Herbroti Augustani. The good man also sent me letters of the same example. You write what you think should be done in this matter. For I will gladly comply with your advice. Philipp, with his modesty and prudence, will weigh himself with great counsel among his people in this matter, so that he may not seem to have disturbed anything himself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Conrad Zwick, my cousin, sends you his most dutiful greetings. Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother, and continue to count us, as you do, steadfastly among your best friends, as we certainly desire with all our hearts to be. Konstanz, April 7, 1546.</p>

    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>

      <p>The world is full of priestly schemes. The Emperor is hurrying to the Diet, has been in Speyer, and has summoned the Landgrave to him on a safe conduct that he himself has arranged, showing himself very gracious towards him. But what he has dealt with him, not everything can be known. However, I know from a trusted man that all matters are directed towards preventing the Protestant meeting, which is now supposed to be in Worms, and the extension of our league, in which many others have recently desired to join, will not be extended. The Emperor puts forward many reasons for this: This meeting would hinder the Diet, and there is much and great to be handled. However, there are otherwise wonderful plans for new alliances in a strange manner, in which they would also like to entice ours and prevent the other. May God give spirit and heart, that they may not be blinded and led behind the light, for it truly requires bright vigilance. May God protect us with grace.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>The Cologne matter has also been postponed to the Diet, so that the pious steadfast bishop still has peace, although his clergy is dissatisfied with the Emperor for not proceeding with the ban. However, he has his reckoning further than the priests must make. The Emperor has, among other things, given the envoys of ours in the Cologne matter the answer that he hopes to settle the disputes in the matter of religion at this Diet. How he means it will not be laid out in one way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>He has great things before him. May the strong God turn it for the best! If he has peace with the Turk, it is suspected that he will start a war in Savoy or Lorraine. It is said that Barbarossa is causing him great trouble. Recently, two Italians were posted through Augsburg to Neuburg on the Danube. There they sought and also found a very pious, honest, Christian Spaniard, who was also at the conversation in Regensburg and became very intimate and dear to Bucer. They lured him to a place as if they had something special to discuss with him. One of them immediately stabbed him, so that he remained dead there.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Afterwards, before the murder was discovered, the two murderers quickly posted away. They took other horses from the postmaster in Augsburg and quickly posted towards Trient, to bring their bread of reward to their holy fathers. It was soon learned in Augsburg what their crime had been, but they could not be caught. Thus these murderers fill up the measure of their fathers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>The presidents of the colloquy have been recalled. The colloquents are said to still be together. From Trent, we hear nothing at this time.</p>
