    <p xml:id="regest1">Suspects that some of his letters have been lost; received a letter from Bullinger forwarded by Christoph [Froschauer] as well as the writing delivered by Johannes von Bekensteyn [No. 1464]; asks not to leave his letters unanswered. At the request of his patron [Hero von Oldersum], he will take over the Oldersum congregation at Easter, where he intends to preach Christ, admonish the congregation members in personal conversations, and hold communion four times a year. Seeks advice on dealing with the Anabaptists taken in by [Hero von Oldersum]; suggests dedicating a printed work on church governance with references to the Anabaptist issue to him. Thanks Leo Jud for his catechism and expects the promised Passion writing as well as the Latin Bible; is also interested in Bullinger's gospel commentaries and a sermon guide that should be more concise than that of Erasmus. In earlier letters, he asked for a statement on emergency baptism; the pastors have agreed to perform such baptisms to not give support to the Anabaptists. His patron sends greetings to Bullinger and asks for a statement on divorce. Further greetings; apologizes for the hurried writing.</p>

      <p>Hermann Aquilomontanus wishes Heinrich Bullinger much health.</p>
      <p>I have sent many letters, and if you had received them, I would now hope for a sufficiently lengthy response. I was glad to read two letters from you; the first was brought by your Christoph [Froschauer], a citizen of Emden, and the second was delivered by Johannes von Bekensteyn. I have always intended to entrust some letters to the wind, especially at the Frankfurt fairs. Please respond briefly. I know the burden you are under, and I am aware of how many letters you are exhausted by daily. However, as ministers of the same Lord and guardians of His bride, I ask that you sometimes extend a helping hand to me.</p>
      <p>Now, at Easter, I am moving to the ecclesiastical administration in the House of the Oldersum, as my patron wishes, where I intend to act in this way: I will delineate Christ as clearly as possible to sinners sent by the Father for repentance; daily, I will take hold of one person or another, advising them as a friend whether Christ lives in their heart and with what confidence they expect death, which threatens at all hours; if I hear of any crime, I will admonish them paternally not to be ungrateful to the best Father and to be cautious in the future. I have established communion four times a year.</p>
      <p>Many Anabaptists have flocked to this place, whom a gentle man, moved by their misery, has received in the hope of reform, yet many of them persist stubbornly in their ways. I would like you to indicate the best way to deal with them. Moreover, please include in your writing about church governance and the handling and treatment of Anabaptists, dedicate it to my lord Hero, lord of the House of Oldersum, a noble man and patron of the poor, a great supporter of piety, and send it printed; you would do a great favor to the man and be of great use to the church.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to Leo Jud in my name and give him immortal thanks for the catechism; we are daily expecting the promised Passion writing from him. We are also expecting the plain Latin Bible. We desire to see your writings on the gospels and the method of preaching, which Erasmus wrote in a rather lengthy manner.</p>
      <p>I have written once and again about the baptism of sick infants and sought to know your judgment on it. Now, by common counsel, we baptize and do not give the Anabaptists a handle to establish their views.</p>
      <p>Finally, my patron has ordered me to greet you and asked what advice you have on poorly contracted marriages and whether separation is possible where no concord is hoped for. Please respond to all these matters briefly, and extend your hand to a brother who depends on you. Johannes von Bekensteyn and the brothers living here with me greet you. Please greet all those who, with us, worship the one Christ, the complete savior, in spirit. Farewell, unique teacher, and please consider kindly what I have hastily written due to the occasion of the messenger.</p>
      <p>From the House of Oldersum in East Frisia, March 7, 1542.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant shepherd of the Lord's flock, my esteemed teacher. Zurich.</p>
