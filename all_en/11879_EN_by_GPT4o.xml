    <p xml:id="regest1">He wrote to him during the Martinmas fair [HBBW XIII, No. 1817] and hoped in vain to receive a reply. Bullinger should cautiously admonish the letter carriers traveling to Bern, Mayor [Luzi Heim] and [Hans] Tscharner, who, despite their evangelical disposition, stand too close to the Bishop [Lucius Iter] and the Anabaptists. He requests news from Germany and about Emperor [Charles V.]; he is a bitter enemy of the Gospel, yet everything is in the Lord's hands, who may protect Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. During our Martinmas fair, I had sent you a letter, most learned Bullinger, primarily with the hope of receiving yours in return. But I was disappointed in that hope; either my letter was not delivered, or your many affairs do not allow you to satisfy all who address you with their letters. But now, having found such suitable messengers, the consul of our city and the younger Tscharner heading to Bern, I could not refrain from troubling you with my letter. For these two are prominent among us, who support and favor the Gospel, and although those who run willingly do not need a spur, yet an exhortation from you would make them more eager. For not everything is in order with us that pertains to the glory of the Gospel: they are slow in correcting crimes, too familiar with the bishop, do not guard against the Anabaptists, but rather support them. Your exhortation on these matters could do much with them and be beneficial, yet it should be disguised as if it were received from elsewhere, not written by me. Furthermore, I wish to be informed by you about the affairs in Germany and those concerning the Emperor. I do not doubt that the Emperor is an enemy of the Gospel, indeed a very bitter one. He is entirely for the Pope; when he has found an opportunity or seized the handle of the sword, he will surely rage. Nevertheless, our Lord Jesus Christ holds everything in His hand; may He deign to preserve you for us for many years. From the court of Rhaetia, on the first of January, in the year of our salvation 1544. Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the church of the city of Zurich, his lord and brother, to be especially revered.</p>
