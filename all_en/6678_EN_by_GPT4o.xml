      <p>I rejoice, reverend father in Christ, that you have recovered and been refreshed and relieved from the long illness by which you were afflicted, by the grace of God, and I congratulate you, us, and the church, and I pray again and again that you may be more and more strengthened. I have seen and read with pleasure your writings on Daniel along with the preface and the honorable mention of myself and the exiled brothers, and I am grateful for your kindness. I am indeed glad that you promise to comment on Isaiah, and I earnestly ask that, with the Lord's help, you may complete and put the finishing touch on the work you have begun. The book is entirely evangelical, dense and filled with mysteries, somewhat obscure in places due to concise sentences and interposed stories, frequent figures of speech, and some interruptions; therefore, although the best and most learned men have brought great light and rendered excellent service, yet the addition of your labor will be pious and very useful. In the third chapter, where the prophet discusses ornaments and women's adornment, if you were to insert something about clothing, in my judgment, you would have done a worthwhile work. I am not unaware of what you have written so far; however, you seem to have expressed your opinion too briefly and not clearly enough. Therefore, I beg your piety again and again to answer these few questions of mine: 1. whether ecclesiastical men should be prescribed clothing laws so that they are distinguished from laymen by form, color, etc.; 2. whether the ceremonial worship of the Levitical priesthood should be recalled into the church of Christ; 3. whether it is permissible to share clothing and external rites with the papists and whether Christians should borrow ceremonies from any adulterous and adversarial church; 4. whether a priestly and peculiar dress should be worn as a civil habit or whether it smells of monasticism, papism, Judaism; 5. whether those who have so far acquiesced in their freedom can, with a clear conscience, involve themselves (and the church) in this servitude by royal edict; 6. whether the papistic clerical habit can be called a matter of indifference; 7. whether clothing should be taken up rather than abandoning the station. I sent other questions to Mr. Beza and to your piety; I do not know whether you have received them. I ask that you deign as soon as possible to explain your judgment and opinion a little more fully and to touch upon or note the reasons why you feel this way. You see that the papal tail is like the Lernaean Hydra; you see what the remnants of the Amorites have produced; you see our importunity. I ask that you confer with Mr. Gwalter and the fellow ministers about the whole matter and write your opinion to me or to Mr. Sampson. Oxford, February 9, 1565.</p>
      <p>May Christ keep you well and flourishing for a long time for His church! Yours most observantly, Laurentius Humfredus.</p>
      <p>To the reverend father in Christ and lord, Mr. Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich.</p>
