      <p>Dear sir and brother! I was in TÃ¤gerwilen near Constance on Saturday. A very pious person informed me how the scribe of the governor, named Mathis, had confidentially revealed to someone as certain that in a few days the king would take the Au from the bishop, and the same person also disclosed it to a good friend.</p>
      <p>I wanted to inform you of this in good faith; for it still seems as if this disagreement between the king and the bishop is a fabricated pretense. The bishop has recently allowed all the foreign wine of the citizens of Constance, which was stored in Wolmatingen, to be transported to the Au; the new wine he leaves in Wolmatingen. It is possible that this is happening so that the king has a reason to forcibly enter the Au and seize the wine of the Constance citizens by force (yes, in appearance), so that he thus gains favor with the citizens and in the meantime takes the Au, then aims for Gottlieben, Arbon, etc., and takes them as well, as far as the bishop is concerned, all to the detriment of the Confederates; for if they took up the matter and did not want to allow it, the king would have a claim, etc.; if they then let it happen, then the emperor and king, if they wanted to act against the Confederates, would have these and other possessions of the bishop to their advantage. I did not want to withhold this good opinion from you; for in my opinion, it truly requires some reflection.</p>
      <p>Given in utmost haste on October 14, 1549. You will surely know where to report this. I have also heard that a prominent person has let it be known that as soon as autumn is over, someone will be surprised who does not expect it. This is talked about in several other places, that a battle will be seen before winter. May the dear God bring all evil, bloodthirsty intentions to nothing and grant us His temporal and eternal peace!</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
