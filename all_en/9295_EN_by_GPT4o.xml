      <p> Greetings. I received both your letters, most illustrious man and honorable godfather, along with the news which you instructed me to share with Mr. Amman, the treasurer, and the other men who are most devoted to you. I did so diligently. They express their deepest gratitude to you through me and all sincerely wish for your well-being. To answer your questions, you should know that our Mr. Amman, Schuler, being a man of exceptional spirit and singular dedication, composed this poem for himself amidst the countless tasks of his vocation. However, at the request of some good men, he allowed it to circulate more widely, so much so that some, who were greatly pleased with it, agreed to ensure it would be printed without Mr. Amman's knowledge. They came to me asking for my advice on this matter. I said, as I truly feel, that this work is indeed worthy of being shared with all good people; however, it seems unwise to me to impose such a burden on this good man, who might face some reproach from the malevolent. For although Mr. Amman's name is not attached, some papists know that this poem was composed by him. </p>
      <p> Therefore, I instructed them to first inform Mr. Amman of their intention and then to comply with his wishes. Meanwhile, as our Cornerus was heading to Zurich, some, without much thought about your affairs and labors, rashly instructed him to offer you this poem, believing that you would soon, based on your esteemed opinion, guide them on how this matter should be handled both with the magistrate and with those responsible for examining what is entrusted to the printers. </p>
      <p> But perhaps Cornerus could not fully explain their intentions to you; I, having learned from them, wanted to outline this for you briefly. Please, with your longstanding kindness, take these actions by the less experienced and most rustic people in the best light and continue to hold me, along with all the ministers of our region's word, in high regard. </p>
      <p> In Glarus, April 22, 1573. </p>
      <p> Johannes Hugo, your godfather sincerely. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious and distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most vigilant minister of the Church of Zurich, my most beloved and highly esteemed lord and godfather. </p>
      <p> To Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich. </p>
