      <p> Greetings. I have not written for a long time because there was nothing worthy of your ears, although I wrote twice and received no response from you, which was not necessary anyway. Now, having met this brother, a most reliable messenger and a strong man in preaching the Lord Jesus, I wanted to scribble these few lines to ask you not to be angry with me for not having written for so long. Moreover, 15 days ago, masons came here from Vienna, Austria, announcing for certain that the Turk had slaughtered 30,000 of Ferdinand's men. Peter Comander is not well; he sends you his warmest greetings. I do not wish to trouble you to write back unless you have something you wish to command me. </p>
      <p> May the Lord Jesus preserve your kindness to the world unharmed for a very long time. A certain community near Chur has also abolished the mass in these days. </p>
      <p> Farewell, most honorable man. </p>
      <p> From Chur, on the 22nd of August, 1556. </p>
      <p> Entirely yours, Philipp Gallicius. </p>
      <p> To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, most honorable to all good people. ZÃ¼rich. </p>
