    <p xml:id="regest1">Earthquake in Augsburg, which was also felt in Konstanz. Credible rumors of the recapture of the occupied territories in Jülich and Kleve by Duke [Wilhelm of Jülich-Berg-Kleve-Geldern]. Bucer has been recalled to Cologne after Archbishop [Hermann of Wied], who feels deceived by Pope [Paul III], is now seriously considering the reformation of his diocese; therefore, let us pray for Bucer! [Enclosure:] The Duke of Kleve has already lost the recaptured territories again to Queen Maria [of Hungary], [Governor of the Netherlands]; the war between [Emperor Charles V] and [King Francis I] will continue for several more years, although the Pope seeks to mediate.</p>

      <p>From Augsburg, dated November 23.</p>
      <p>On the eighteenth day of this month, there was an earthquake here in Augsburg at 9 in the morning, which was felt more inside houses than on the streets; in some houses, it shook the birdcages along with other household items from the walls. We felt the same here in Konstanz on the same day and hour.</p>
      <p>It is written here that what the Duke of Geldern had recaptured in Jülich and Kleve, he has conquered again and even more. And it is written so credibly that people believe it. I will inform you by the next message. These from the letters, etc.</p>
      <p>Our Bucer is again called to Cologne and, if I am not mistaken, has already begun his journey. They affirm that the Archbishop, after realizing he was imposed upon by the Roman Pontiff, is now seriously contemplating the reformation of his diocese. Therefore, we will pray for Bucer, that in establishing churches, he may always carefully consider, with the prudence given to him, not what the Archbishop can bear, but what can bear the glory of Christ, since the times now are different from those earlier times of the rebirth of the Gospel. Pray for us.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household with all the brothers and friends. Konstanz, November 28, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Amb. Bl.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
      <p>From a letter from Augsburg: What Geldern had recaptured and taken, he has lost again immediately, and Queen Maria has burned and devastated it completely, so they have fallen back again, as they were forced to do by the enemy's pressure (force). The war will last for several more years, as all things seem to indicate, although the Pope is very much involved in mediating. But these two mighty lords intend to destroy each other.</p>
