    <p xml:id="regest1">Communications from a letter by Martin Frecht to Vadian [Vadian BW VI 30-33, No. 1173]: The troops of [King] Ferdinand [I] began their attack on Buda on May 13, but the Turkish garrison is strong, and a powerful relief army, numerically far superior to Ferdinand's troops, is on its way; the besiegers had to deal with 600 heavy projectiles in a single day, but this did not result in significant losses; Emperor [Charles V] wants to negotiate Turkish aid as soon as the religious question is settled. [Johannes] Eck is ill and was unable to participate in the discussions [in Regensburg] for several days; there was intense debate there about the Eucharist and penance, with the Protestants rejecting the opposing side's demands regarding the veneration of the Host and confession; the Emperor is under pressure from various sides; Philipp [Melanchthon] and [Martin] Bucer are engaged in reporting on the resolved and still open questions; the article on justification has retained the Protestant interpretation. Vadian expects the Emperor to seek a temporary peace and, in the meantime, issue a new "Julian Edict" that provides some security to the faithful; he is skeptical about the possibility of reforming the [Roman] Church, as it takes a lot of time to correct long-established errors and behaviors. Frecht's letter is dated May 28 [correctly: May 24]. Regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Yesterday at dusk, that is, on the very first day of June, our courier, who had been ordered to divert to Regensburg from Nuremberg, delivered letters from our Frecht to me, in which you are indeed placed in a prominent position and are to be greeted in his name at the earliest opportunity. The main news he reports is as follows: Ferdinand's army began to besiege Buda in Hungary on the 13th of May; however, the Turkish garrison is strong, and several Turkish leaders are on their way with a huge army, more than a hundred thousand men, while Ferdinand's forces number no more than twenty thousand. Moreover, the city and fortress have such a great amount of artillery that in one day, Ferdinand's forces endured six hundred heavy shots, although not with very severe damage; only a few were lost that day. Therefore, it is certain that the Emperor (Kaiser Karl V) will be involved in this matter (as he writes), so that, once the religious issue is somewhat resolved and peace is given to Germany, deliberations on selecting and sending aid against the Turks will soon follow. The Emperor is diligent and with such zeal, demeanor, and spirit that many of our people have high hopes for him. Eck (Johannes Eck) is suffering from a fever and has not participated in the discussions for several days. There was intense debate on the article about the Eucharist and confession, and the papists demanded that inclusion, adoration, and procession be granted to them, which could not be granted in any way; they also requested the review of all sins as necessary, which was also rejected. It is thought that the Emperor's enthusiasm is being hindered by the Spaniards, the Pope, certain shaved ones, and the Frenchman, whom the Pope ensures not to observe excessively, lest he be stripped of all favor. Now writings are being prepared to be offered to the Emperor and the estates, in which it is clearly and lucidly explained in what matters the parties have agreed and in what they have differed, and for what reasons they have been moved or have requested certain things to be granted or denied. Philipp (Philipp Melanchthon) and Bucer (Martin Bucer) are actively engaged in this matter and are now considered to be in great favor with the Emperor. The doctrine of justification has indeed prevailed according to our view, which I believe you have understood otherwise, and from there Frecht thinks that the lion can be judged from its claws. I think what I predicted before will happen: that peace will be granted to our people by the Emperor and to the adversaries until some convenient reformation, and in the meantime, that Julian Edict will be reinstated, which (as handed down by Ammianus) decreed that, while Christians were disputing with some dissension, everyone should serve their queen fearlessly without anyone forbidding it; and no more can be hoped for at present than that our people will finally be granted the white of the Christian religion and in the future be less harassed, freely holding and practicing the doctrine of Christ. Since this has never been granted before, it will indeed seem something great, in which, however, how much security or tranquility is contained, we grasp more easily with the mind than with the pen. I see, however, that it is not possible for the church to be restored to its native purity suddenly in such a mass of errors, and perhaps, as they crept in over one or two centuries, so it will take many years for what has clung for so long to be finally washed away and vanish. The cure of serious diseases is slow, and what has been accepted by the prejudices of so many centuries cannot easily be uprooted from human minds. The Lord will finally take care of His church, whom we must also pray to, so that all things may turn to His glory and our salvation. Amen. I wrote this in the morning, the day after the Kalends of June, in haste. Frecht's letters are dated the 5th Kalends of June, which I wanted to remind you of, so you would understand they were sent recently. Farewell with all our people. From St. Gallen, as above, in the year of our Lord 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
