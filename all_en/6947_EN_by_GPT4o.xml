      <p>Greetings. You will learn from my brother what calamity has befallen our house. These things happen by the Lord, to whom I surrender myself completely with all that I have; may He do what seems good in His eyes. These are times when the Lord is to be praised for those whom He takes from here and places in eternal security, so that they do not see the evils to come. Meanwhile, I beg you to pray to God for us and always keep our family in your prayers. I thought the messenger who was with us in recent days was sent by the council; later I understood that he was acting only in a private capacity. I have not yet heard that a response has been given by the Swiss; thus, that matter has subsided. I am sending you cheese through the steward of Königsfelden, which you will receive when he delivers it to you; I ask that you kindly accept it, I have nothing else at the moment.</p>
      <p>You will console my brother; for I know that he will have more grief from the death of one son than I from all of mine, whom I have lost.</p>
      <p>Bern, 13th of November, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>The rest, which I am sending, I received from Winsler. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and compatriot. Zürich.</p>
