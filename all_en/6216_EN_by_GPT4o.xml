      <p>Greetings. I was not intending to write, dear father; I was recently going to express my gratitude for all your many services.</p>
      <p>But behold, yesterday evening it was said that someone had arrived from Milan, who reportedly said that all of Hannibal's forces had been destroyed, and Hannibal captured.</p>
      <p>Today, letters come to Mr. Consul Ambrosius in Bellinzona from a reliable man, in which it is announced that those forces perished in a storm, and indeed entirely.</p>
      <p>Now, what is true, we will hear shortly; I believe the matter is not without some credibility. He adds in his letters to the consul that the Genoese are in great danger, because indeed a man named St. Peter Corso has defected from them to the Turk and has taken a town in Corsica. This aligns with Mr. Beza's letters.</p>
      <p>He further adds that the Genoese have sent certain men with orders to Milan to recruit new soldiers there; but the Milanese have been forbidden from military service under penalty of death.</p>
      <p>However, the leaders and other commanders are said to have already been aware of the prohibition. I wanted to inform you of this suddenly and I doubt whether there is anyone to whom I can give letters; for I believe our people have already left.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>On the first of August, in Chur, in the year 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered lord. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
