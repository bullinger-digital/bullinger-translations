      <p>Most illustrious man, I believe the honorable envoy to be a sincere man, and that he will fulfill what he promises.</p>
      <p>He solemnly promised me money; why should I not believe that I will receive it, especially since he has given you good words.</p>
      <p>It does no harm to have written.</p>
      <p>Greetings, most excellent Bullinger, may God preserve you with your entire family, school, and church.</p>
      <p>I am indeed well; if you are well, that is good.</p>
      <p>I had received your letters from Chur, which brought me great joy.</p>
      <p>Praise be to God; the most illustrious triumphs, who is in excellent health. The grace and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>If money is to be sent, let it be sent specifically to T端bingen to the son of Cellarius, a well-known man, Rudolf Riepi. T端bingen, August 5, 1564.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Z端rich, honorable brother. In Z端rich.</p>
