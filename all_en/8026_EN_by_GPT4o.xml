      <p>Prognostication sent from Armenia to the Supreme Pontiff.</p>
      <p>The sun in the month of September in the sign of Libra, with all the planets in agreement. When the sun is in the tail of the dragon, it signifies great signs of terrible things, that is, floods of water, great winds, which will darken the entire world due to the terrible movement and terror of thunder and waters, which will destroy many buildings and trees. Many valleys will indeed be joined together, and a plain will be made from them, many cities will be utterly desolated, especially in sandy places. There will be an eclipse of the sun and moon, which will last from 3 until noon and will be of fiery and red color, which signifies great mortality of nations. In the east and west, there will be many wars, and there will be a universal earthquake. There will be great betrayals among nations; a great monarch will die. After the flood, however, a few survivors will remain, and those who survive will be very wealthy. God will grant us His holy hand. In the year one thousand five hundred sixty-nine.</p>
      <p>These things were sent from Armenia to Rome, and from Rome to our legate Peter Grantrye.</p>
      <p>The same things were communicated to me by Mr. Ruinella, who received them from Mr. Grantrye.</p>
