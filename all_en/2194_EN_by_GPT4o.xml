      <p>Greetings. I would like to gratify you with the booklets about the months; but because recently I not only found none at Oporinus, but he also affirmed that they do not exist here either, it happened that I lost the sheet that I had set aside a bit carelessly, the one, I mean, that contained the list of those authors. Therefore, I would like you to indicate the same again, so that I may inquire at the remaining booksellers or, if they cannot be found, arrange for them to be obtained from Frankfurt. I have nothing new now, except that they say a serious war is threatening Germany and that Schertlin has been appointed captain over 24 banners of Germans in the name of the confederates. The Emperor also strives to assemble 100 banners, so that with the greatest force he can muster, he may invade Picardy again; but the more prudent think that such large forces can hardly be gathered. However, I greatly fear that with a new expedition our soldiers may be called out again and that with the more frequent habit of military service, discipline, which is already very weak, may completely collapse and the guilt of blood may fall upon our heads. I will not neglect to help the son of Dr. Philipp Galliziani on any occasion I can, both because of the piety of the parent and the character of the young man, which seems to shine singularly in him to us. But it will be worthwhile for the father himself to also appeal to the rector and the four deans of the orders, so that among the competitors, of which there are usually many for the vacant stipends, consideration may be given to him. I will write about this matter to him in the next message. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 22nd of February, in the year 54.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
