    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks Bullinger and all supporters and reports on their situation. After their arrival on March 24, they lodged with Johannes Schwyzer, but are very disappointed by the high cost of living in Tübingen. They did not find suitable Greek and Hebrew teachers, but they attend a Euclid lecture and the Corinthians lecture by Paul [Phrygio], and they pursue further studies at home; Wolf himself is also privately learning mathematics. The state of the Gospel [in Tübingen] is not good; crime is high, and the people are envious and rude. Since Marburg is much better in terms of teaching and living costs, as they have heard from other students, including [Diethelm?] Keller in Zurich, they would like to move there; they therefore ask to be allowed to leave at the time of the Frankfurt Autumn Fair together with the Tübingen booksellers, because without additional money they could not spend the winter in Tübingen. The messenger is in a hurry; Wolf sends his regards to Bullinger. Should their request not be granted, he will comply and study diligently.</p>

      <p>There is no doubt that nature itself has commanded us to express gratitude, either in word or deed, to those who wish us well and do good to us, especially to fathers and those who act in the place of parents, such as teachers, guardians, magistrates, and others of that kind. Therefore, dear Bullinger, most esteemed by all students, I, now a student, wish to reciprocate by informing you of the state of our affairs, albeit somewhat clumsily and clearly.</p>
      <p>So, having left our homeland on the 14th of March, we arrived in Tübingen on the 24th of March with good omens and experienced a journey longer than the schedule promised. But there we found everything contrary to our expectations, everything indeed expensive. We arranged for board with Mr. Johannes Schwyzer from Zurich, an excellent man, for 26 florins; from what money remains, we need to rent accommodation for 6 florins and buy a bed. Why say much? Nothing is cheap except wine. But you might say: "Why are you not in the purse?" They say more is spent out of order than is stated in total. However, we were dissuaded from this.</p>
      <p>We have not found a suitable Greek or Hebrew teacher; we have no books, and no one willingly lends them, neither for free nor for money, to us who would bring them to public lectures. We bought one Euclid for everyone to use and we attend it; we listen to Dr. Paul reading the Epistle to the Corinthians. We study the rest at home; for I am privately reading mathematics in a cursory manner, so that I may then turn to the study of dialectics and rhetoric, and so on.</p>
      <p>I would not say the state of the Gospel is progressing, but rather regressing; there are frequent fires, thefts, adulteries, and murders, an envious and rustic kind of people.</p>
      <p>But what we all earnestly wish and desire, I will tell you briefly. With such high costs of everything and such negligence of studies (for there are holidays frequently), we wish to be sent to Marburg; for there are students who, led by the fame of our academy, have come to us, yet they have seen and heard something very different, indeed they have descended from oxen to donkeys (as they say); they, I say, report that in Marburg, board is prepared most lavishly for 16 florins and studies are promoted there to such an extent that it cannot be expressed; they say holidays are abolished, lectures are held continuously, and in every faculty, every art and language, everyone performs their duty excellently. Moreover, they say the Swiss are held in high regard there. One of them is a law student; he promises us letters to professors of all kinds; for he was (as he says) there for a long time and in a renowned fellowship. But I also heard the same from [Diethelm?] Keller in Zurich. Furthermore, there would be great convenience of travel by water; for it is only 32 miles from here to Marburg. And the booksellers of Tübingen (who promise all good things) would accompany us if we were to set out there for the Frankfurt Autumn Fair. We spend 26 gulden for the table and still fairly with a 4. wine and at least 10 gulden for the bed, 6 gulden for the room. So little remains over 34, there for 16 the table; for he has not been away from there for long and is a man of good faith, certainly very knowledgeable in law, and he advises this. Certainly, I know that we cannot winter in Tübingen without incurring debt. Now you experience the whole matter; what should be done, you and others know better; we certainly beg you again and again to act in the place of fathers and make us partakers of an honest, useful, and necessary wish. We will diligently ensure that what is ours is to study piously and abstain from all crime, and we certainly promise more honor than disgrace. For it is not only for us but also for the city, our homeland, that we have taken counsel. We especially dread debt because many have returned to their homeland not without great danger or loss with disgrace. Therefore, it will be yours to bring us help in this matter. Why say much? Certainly, it seems to us honest, useful, and necessary to stay here until the next fair and then set out again with the booksellers; unless this were certain, we would not want to believe the rumor.</p>
      <p>The messenger is in a hurry. Farewell, dear sir, and keep your Wolf recommended (as you have been accustomed to do). Do not think ill. Greet your wife, mother, sons, and daughters, and especially my Christoph. In Tübingen, on the Ides of April.</p>
      <p>But if it cannot be, I will endure what I can for the sake of studying, whether I return home soon.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient Johannes Wolf.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, of notable learning and prudence, and also of remarkable piety, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, his lord and esteemed father.</p>
      <p>Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
