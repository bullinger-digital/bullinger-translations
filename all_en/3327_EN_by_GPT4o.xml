      <p>S. D. Reverend man and dearest brother, it is written in Xenophon that the Spartans must be driven out of their homes, just as bees are driven out when smoke is made under their hives. Our opponents cleverly imitate this: leaving aside other matters on which we agree, they begin, they begin with the bread-worship and, in order to distract us, they ask who will defend it. This dispute has not yet been resolved here, nor has anything else been done here so far.</p>
      <p>Here Tilemann Mumius from Cologne was born into an honorable family; the large inheritance he had was diminished by the fraud of a certain impostor, who did not return the money he borrowed, and you know that "woe to the timid, and to those who stand surety for the timid." But this calamity happened to this boy due to the imprudence of others. In the region of JÃ¼lich, he taught some mocking youths, but he prefers to be in your churches; therefore, he seeks both a place to learn and to teach with you. I therefore beg you not to fail this pious and learned guest, but to help him with advice and recommendation somewhere.</p>
      <p>He will not want to burden you with expenses.</p>
      <p>On the 23rd of September.</p>
      <p>Philipp Melanchthon.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man, outstanding in learning and virtue, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
