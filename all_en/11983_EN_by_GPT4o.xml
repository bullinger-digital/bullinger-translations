    <p xml:id="regest1">Was pleased with the guests recommended by Bullinger, although the timing was unfavorable, as his wife [Katharina, née Ryff] was very ill after a suspected pregnancy; the outstanding Joseph Macarius will stay longer; he emphasized Philipp [Melanchthon's] goodwill towards their churches, so Blarer will write to him. Wonders why Bullinger did not respond to his letters [No. 1919 and 1928]. His brother-in-law Heinrich von Ulm asked him to inquire whether Bullinger and [Diethelm] Röist could advocate for the transfer of Hieronymus [Kaufmann] from Buch [am Irchel] to Leutmerken. Greetings; Bullinger should pray; at the Imperial Diet [in Speyer] an acceptable religious peace was reached, which only Christ alone can maintain. Awaits Bullinger's letter regarding their matter.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The guests you recommended to us were by far the most welcome, even though they were already highly recommended for many reasons. As for me, they arrived at a somewhat inconvenient time, as my dearest wife was gravely ill. After suspecting she was pregnant for two months, she suffered a menstrual flow with great danger, so I was unable to offer any hospitality to these excellent and delightful people in our home. That pious and learned young man, Joseph Macarius, will remain for a few more days, hopefully with some benefit! Philipp's most sincere goodwill towards our churches, as it truly is, was fully demonstrated, and we will also write to him.</p>
      <p>But hey, my venerable Bullinger, why have you not responded to my letters? I wrote to you on May 30th, and it will greatly sadden me if I learn that you did not receive those letters, and then again on June 17th through Claudius Sabaudus, to whom I entrusted the Schwenckfeldian letter and the Brunswick matter to be presented to you; please ensure that you free me from these difficulties at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>My brother-in-law Heinrich von Ulm asked me yesterday through a letter to write to you on his behalf, so that with your and the excellent consul Röist's help, Hieronymus at Buch, pastor of the Leutmerken church, can be inaugurated with the authority granted by the Zurichers. Therefore, I earnestly beseech you by our friendship and the bowels of Christian charity to assist not so much us as the cause of Christ; it is very important what kind of pastor is there, for many reasons.</p>
      <p>My brother Thomas, along with Conrad Zwicker and the fellow brothers, reverently send their greetings to you in the Lord. Pray for us and the whole house of God. The Imperial Diet has concluded with a tolerable peace for religion, but only Christ will preserve it, whom the world hates and from whom we expect nothing else than what is in His nature. But He who is in us is stronger than he who is in the world. Farewell again and forever.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, June 25, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await what you will write about the matter you know of.</p>
      <p>To his esteemed and dearest brother Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich, etc.</p>
