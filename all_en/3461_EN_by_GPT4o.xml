      <p>Greetings. I received my letter, which I had written in response to your questions, and I also read yours written on December 27th. Those omens terrify me; for I see that they foretell calamities for us, which our unrepentant life otherwise deserves. Let us pray to the Lord that, if He wishes to chastise, He does so not in fury, but in judgment and mercy. I rejoice as if about a matter most pleasing to me, that both of you are in agreement; may the Lord make this perpetual, and I have never thought otherwise.</p>
      <p>If you are called to places where you announce Christ to people not yet known, pray to the Lord to be with you; meanwhile, be faithful and fervent, instill those things which are most necessary for salvation. Preach Christ, overthrow the Antichrist, not indeed with insults, but with reason and scriptures; omit curious and contentious matters. The chosen vessel said he did not know wisdom, that he knew nothing else but Christ and Him crucified. As long as the war in Ferrara is not quelled, there is no hope of any peace either in France or Italy.</p>
      <p>Rumor spreads that in Picardy a skirmish has taken place and some have fallen on both sides; however, we have nothing certain, except that some are said to be sick and dying due to the nearby sea and harsher climate. Why stay at home? It does not help the people at all.</p>
      <p>I truly pity the wretched; but he who does not accept any advice or help, you may tell him, as he said, to be wretched willingly. Otherwise, all is silent with us; however, I do not believe the merchants of the Emperor who spread magnificent tales of Philip's victories.</p>
      <p>I see God arranging things so that one devours the flesh of another as foretold through Isaiah in chapter 49. I send you the entire action of our envoys; but see that it does not reach the hands of many, and return it to me safely. The Guises will destroy the miserable king, unless perhaps it happens now to the Guises as it once did to Sejanus under Tiberius. Vengeance is the Lord's; may the Lord have mercy on His afflicted ones.</p>
      <p>Greet our Philip most amicably; tell him that a Latin, beautiful, well-bound Bible is available for three guilders, 15 batzen from Constance for the guilder, and although none are available or for sale anymore, as they are all sold, I have nevertheless helped him with a beautiful one; he may, if he wants it, show me how and by whom I should send it up. I will write more to you about the Worms colloquy when there is more leisure; it was dissolved at the beginning of December; everyone has left Worms. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in great haste, January 7, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, my dearest godfather and brother. Chur.</p>
