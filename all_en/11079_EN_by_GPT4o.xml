Wishes to be thoroughly informed about Megander's accusations against Myconius in order to mediate. Everything is in the best order in Zürich. News has arrived from Italy about the Turkish fleet lying in Valona and about the departure of the [Grand Vizier] Ayas Pasha; there are fears for Sicily and Apulia. Sends regards to Grynaeus and wishes to receive letters from him more often, despite his difficult-to-read handwriting. Asks to inquire with [Hans] Heinrich Winkeli about the printing of his booklet ["The Old Faith"].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I give you great thanks, honorable Myconius, for writing to me so frequently and diligently about absolutely everything. Your letters are delightful to me, indeed more delightful than you might believe. As for my infrequent writing, please do not interpret it negatively. I lack both material and messengers. You know how limited my resources are, and in the meantime, how much I am burdened with tasks and sermons. Therefore, do not suspect anything unfortunate. I will, in good faith, persevere in the friendship pact with you. Continue to love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>I have helped the one you recommended in your recent letters to the best of my ability. But now there was no position, no opportunity at all, by which he could have been better assisted. Therefore, we sent him off with a small sum of money.</p>
      <p>What you wrote about Megander grieves both Leon and me greatly. We think that you have been completely deceived by false suspicions. Until now, Megander has thought very highly of you. It seems serious to us that a good man is considered treacherous. Therefore, I ask you, my brother, to explain the whole matter to me from the beginning. I will see what can be done conveniently. I love both you and Megander as my own soul. Therefore, I cannot bear any discord between the best and most delightful men.</p>
      <p>As for us, our affairs are in excellent order, thanks to the Lord. Letters sent from Italy report something about the Turkish emperor. They say he is equipped with a thousand sails at Apollonia in Epirus, waiting for some opportunity.</p>
      <p>Also, Axaxbassa, the Turkish leader, is moving from Illyria. Some fear for Sicily, others for Apulia. What the situation is, I do not know. We must pray to the Lord to have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>I wish our most honorable friend and brother Grynaeus well. I wonder if he is alive, as he writes so rarely. I would not mind his poor handwriting if only he would write something. Farewell, all of you together.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, on the first of September, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I kindly ask you to send someone to Heinrich Winkeli's house and inquire about my booklet, as he has not informed me at all, and I have not yet seen a copy, although I think he has long since printed it. Greet him for me.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, ecclesiastical leader in Basel, honorable brother. Basel.</p>
