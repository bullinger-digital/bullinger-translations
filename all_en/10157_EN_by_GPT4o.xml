      <p>I wish you the greatest happiness through Christ, most faithful and learned Heinrich.</p>
      <p>In past days, I wrote to you about the great turmoil in the republic in the Rhine Valley. Therefore, I will now refrain from writing more about it, and as for my part, I pray that you will not be burdened to listen, as you do. On the twentieth of August, our president sent a messenger to me to come to him in Berneck, to whose orders I obeyed and appeared at the appointed time. There, with his harpies [!] watching me in the consistory, I began to speak, saying that I was present at his command, waiting to see what he wanted. Then he addressed me, saying that I was accused of having noted down some articles against the sanction of the seven cantons during a sermon by a priest on the 15th of August, and thus I was considered a traitor. Moreover, he thundered about how many crimes I was liable for because of these notes, which is not the place to discuss now. To this, I responded in a very humble voice that it was not new for me to take notes on sermons; for I had been writing down sermons and lectures for nine years. Finally, it is not new. For they also write down ours. I showed him a little book of what I had collected over some years. But I was telling a story to a deaf man. He resisted with such hardened ears [!]. To this, I also added: When our Savior Christ is proclaimed, should it not be written down? For I know him as my salvation. Otherwise, it is necessary to resist impiety. I argued these and many other things, but in vain. To these arguments of mine, he replied that it was necessary for them all to be much more learned and experienced in the matter of the Gospel than me and those like me. What more can I say? I was considered perjured. He also said to me, who gave me the authority to preach or read, since I had not given or promised 100 gold coins as a pledge of faith. To this, I replied that I had neither preached nor read, but only prayed the Lord's Prayer (Herrengebet, Vaterunser) with the angelic salutation and the Apostles' Creed, and finally, I added this prayer and showed it to the president, which you pray after the sermon. And I did this because of the urgent necessity and also because of the three marriages I had on those two Sundays, which I joined in the ecclesiastical rite. For at least on those two Sundays, I had prayed. But an excuse from a sheep before a wolf was in vain.</p>
      <p>These are my crimes, offenses, and wicked deeds, dearest brother, which I have committed. For these, he will accuse me at the upcoming Diet in Baden. Therefore, most excellent Heinrich, it will be your duty, as I expect and demand, that the people of Zurich defend my cause and that of all the ministers of the word among the Rhine Valley people. For we are not even allowed to pray in the church. But since you do not need encouragement, as I wrote in previous letters, I will not use many words and entrust my studies, duties, cares, and thoughts to you. For I believe I owe you as much as is difficult to repay. The matter, when I was writing this, was brought to the utmost danger.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, on the day of Bartholomew 1532.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Str√ºbi, unworthy minister of the word of God in Marbach among the Rhine Valley people, your lowest minister and yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>Many more cavils of our president should still be written to you, but I did not want to burden you with many, lest you waste your most holy time on these ravings. Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most upright and excellent M. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful ecclesiastic of the holy church of Zurich, my dearest brother in Christ.</p>
