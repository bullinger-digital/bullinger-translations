      <p>Greetings. I do not ask for pardon for my prolonged silence, esteemed brother, because through others you have come to know how justified my excuse for ceasing has been, which still largely persists today.</p>
      <p>For although the pain in my side has subsided, my lungs are so overwhelmed with phlegm that breathing is difficult and short. A stone has occupied my bladder for twelve days now and is very troublesome; there is also anxious doubt because it has not yet been able to be expelled by any medicines. The best remedy would be riding; but an ulcer in the hemorrhoidal veins torments me bitterly even when sitting and lying in bed, so much so that the motion of a horse is far from tolerable for me. Gout has also been troublesome to me for the past three days.</p>
      <p>You will not be surprised, therefore, if so many pains render me inactive; I am hardly compelled to take food; the taste of wine is bitter. But, while I wish to fulfill my duty, I bring you nothing but a source of tedium.</p>
      <p>Concerning French affairs, Beza has promised to write; therefore, I refrain from repeating what has already been done; I will touch upon only one mystery: You heard earlier that the king was setting out for Lorraine; the reason was hidden even from the courtiers themselves, which was recently revealed to me by the one who carried messages back and forth. The king's envoy, who is with the emperor and who was once with you when he was the abbot of St. Lawrence, presents grand and magnificent hopes to the queen mother from King Maximilian; however, in the meantime, he stipulates that the queen should not show any hope; thus, I do not doubt that he is selling himself to Cardinal Lorraine. For after being cast down by other counsels, he considers this the only plan left to him, to prolong time with such evasions.</p>
      <p>No other deceit or betrayal seems to me to lie hidden in this journey, except to delude the queen mother with vain hope and to insinuate himself into undertaking matters that will never be resolved; for it is clear enough that Boschetellum abuses the name of King Maximilian, as he childishly advises the queen mother to completely dissemble and suppress everything.</p>
      <p>Now coughing and difficulty in breathing break off my voice. Farewell, therefore, reverend brother, together with Mr. Gwalther and the remaining colleagues and the whole family. May the Lord keep you all safe and enrich you more and more with His blessings and sustain you with His strength. I do not wish to waste effort writing about the state of our city.</p>
      <p>Geneva, April 6, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
