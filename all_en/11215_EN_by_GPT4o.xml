      <p>Greetings. I beseech you, my dear Bullinger, that you do not neglect a boy of outstanding talent, as I understand from the testimony of many, and a fellow countryman of yours, if it can be done in any way. He was supported here by our people for some time; but now the situation is such that he can no longer comfortably stay with his parents, his stepmother and stepfather. You will make an effort to help him wherever possible; it is unworthy if such a suitable talent is not cultivated. Amerbach and some others have asked me to request this of you and the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Christ, who keeps us in His holy will. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your Simon Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, friend.</p>
