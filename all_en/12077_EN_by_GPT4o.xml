    <p xml:id="regest1">Without Bullinger's explanation, I would not have understood his silence [or restraint?]; may the Lord act as He sees fit and avenge the innocent blood; Bullinger's considerations are by no means insignificant; the rumor of the defeat of the [Confederates] against [King Henry VIII] is also circulating [in Konstanz]; much remains uncertain, whether in regard to the peace between [Charles V] and [Francis I] or the fate of the [Confederate] mercenaries in the battle between [Francis I] and [Henry VIII]. Luther's booklet ["Short Confession"] was seen by Johannes Jung, who serves as a pastor [in Konstanz], in Ulm, and indeed with a Wittenberger [...]; Jung, who could not read it thoroughly, can already testify that it is full of curses; Zwingli is condemned; the "enthusiasts" are treated the same as the "Stenckfeldians" (as Luther calls the followers of Schwenckfeld); Blarer will send the book as soon as he receives it. It is good that Bullinger only briefly responded to Cochläus, for he is not even worth that. With his last letter to Bullinger, Blarer sent back Vadian's letter. Bullinger should return the Cologne ["Simple Consideration"], especially since Bullinger's [detailed] reading is not necessary, as Pellikan has already read the work; recently Albert Hardenberg wrote that the Cologne [Reformation] entirely depends on the future Reichstag - oh, these miserable delayers! Philipp M[elanchthon] recently wrote to [Martin Frecht] about how much the newly inflamed sacrament dispute burdens him. Blarer hopes to receive a good report from Augsburg soon through [Hans Rudolf] Lavater's son [Felix]. It is said that [Charles V] has great plans with [Francis I]; Blarer liked that Bullinger compares [Henry VIII] to Jehu; that may well be true if he continues in this way. Greetings to the family and to [Diethelm] Röist; greetings, especially from [Thomas Blarer] and K[onrad] Z[wick]. A soldier credibly reports that [Henry VIII] could not achieve much; after learning how strong the forces of France against him were, he left garrisons in Boulogne and [Montreuil] and withdrew to England; the French attacked the suburb of Boulogne, killed 800 men there, and besieged it. The people of [Schwäbisch] Gmünd captured the nobleman [Hans Christoph von Absberg], and indeed on Württemberg soil, so that [Ulrich of Württemberg] demands his release; however, in the meantime, the Emperor [Charles V] has ordered the prisoner to be held until the Nurembergers are satisfied, as the prisoner is their enemy; he is said to have been involved in the capture of [Hieronymus] Baumgärtner [by Albrecht von Rosenberg]; in response, [Ulrich] captured eight people from Gmünd and declared that he would treat them as they treated the nobleman; the Rosenberg side, in turn, captured [Christoph] Gräter of Biberach and demands 6000 guilders.</p>

      <p>Greetings in our solid salvation in Christ. Indeed, my venerable and dearest brother, I am so dull-witted that I would never have understood your silence, unless you had now explained it more clearly. I will pray to the Lord that He may do what is good in His eyes. He will indeed avenge this innocent blood when He sees fit. I would not easily believe your thoughts and dreams, about which you write, to be in vain; certainly, among us, no other news is circulating than that your forces were defeated by the English, yet everything remains uncertain, so that we all greatly wonder that nothing certain is known to anyone, neither about the conditions of peace between the Emperor and the French nor about your soldiers and the battle between the French and the English. As soon as I receive certain news, I will not allow you to remain ignorant.</p>
      <p>Our Johannes Jung, who is also a minister of the word here, saw Luther's booklet in Ulm, with a certain Wittenberger, who did not allow him to read it thoroughly due to his quick departure; however, he read one or two pages, which he affirms to be full of curses. Zwingli, as much as he is, is cursed, etc. He holds the "enthusiasts" and the "Stenckfeldians" (as he calls Schwenckfeld's followers) in the same regard. Do not doubt my faith; I will send a copy as soon as I obtain it.</p>
      <p>It is well that you responded briefly to Cochläus, for that most impudent rascal is not worthy of more.</p>
      <p>I sent my last letters to you, with which I returned Vadian's letter that you had sent.</p>
      <p>Return the Cologne reformation after you have used it enough; you seem not to make much of it, especially since Pellicanus has read it.</p>
      <p>Three days ago, Albert Hardenberg, our Frisian, wrote that the entire Cologne matter has been postponed to the future Reichstag. Oh, these miserable delayers!</p>
      <p>Philipp Melanchthon recently wrote to a certain friend (but this is for you; you know how much good Philipp is in danger): "Even if I were to shed as many tears as your Danube carries water, my grief would not be exhausted, which the renewal of the sacrament dispute brings me, nor am I greatly troubled by the change in my affairs; I grieve that the churches are disturbed, not healed; for the controversy is not resolved nor settled by these quarrels. I think of many things, about which we may perhaps soon converse," etc.</p>
      <p>I hope to receive something soon from Augsburg about Lavater's son; when that happens, I will inform you at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>They think the Emperor is planning great things with the French. It pleases me greatly that you make Jehu out of the Englishman, which we will also know to be true if he continues successfully as he has begun.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable and most delightful Bullinger, and commend us diligently to our Savior Christ, as you do. Greet all the brothers and friends with your whole household and Mr. Röist. All of ours greet you, especially my brother and Conrad Zwick.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, November 7, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your brother, A. Blarer[?]</p>
      <p>Now a capable soldier comes out, whom we can completely trust. He says that the Englishman achieved nothing after seeing the French so strong; instead, he occupied Boulogne and another city, which he also won, and returned across the sea. The French indeed fell into the suburb of Boulogne, killed about 800 there, and took the suburb; they still hold it, but otherwise could achieve nothing further.</p>
      <p>Know that those from Schwäbisch Gmünd have captured a nobleman on the Duke of Württemberg's land; the Duke has ordered them to release him and place him on his land, where they captured him. Meanwhile, the Emperor has ordered those from Gmünd to hold the nobleman until the Nurembergers are satisfied, as he is their enemy; he is said to have been a captain of those who captured Baumgärtner from Nuremberg. Now the Duke is very angry with those from Gmünd; he has captured eight of their citizens and declared that he will treat them as they treat the nobleman. Thus, there is anxiety and distress on all sides. The Rosenberg side has also captured a pious citizen, a Gräter from Biberach, and demands six thousand guilders from him, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, friend and brother to be observed above all others and by far the dearest of all. Zurich.</p>
