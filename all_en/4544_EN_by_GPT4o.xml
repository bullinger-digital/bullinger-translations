      <p>Whether Navarre is in arms, I cannot easily say; for after those letters, I have received nothing further and have not yet heard, otherwise I would share it. I will write to Mr. Calvin, as you advise, leaving the outcome to God. I have informed the consuls that the money is deposited in Milan.</p>
      <p>One of them says he has sent a withdrawal to your consul.</p>
      <p>From Clarona, I received this today: Last Friday, a countryman in Glarus became mad, took his spear, ran towards Schwanden around 2 o'clock, shouting: murder, flee. This caused a commotion, so that within an hour a considerable crowd gathered; however, when they realized the man was mad, they captured him, brought him to Glarus, put him in irons, and when he behaved nicely there, so that they trusted him, he wounded 3 honorable men, among whom was also the bailiff HÃ¤ssig, etc. From Augsburg, I hear that the seeds of war have been sown and are being sown; for Sebastian Schertlin has come into conflict with Ludwig, Count of Oettingen, over some hunting rights, etc. Each has their own supporters who incite them.</p>
      <p>Wise men gather I don't know what.</p>
      <p>From the city of Venice, it is written that the Turk has taken 3 galleys from the Florentine duke's port and there is great fear of the Turk in Italy; therefore, the Pope, the Florentine, the Savoyard, Philip of Spain, etc., are preparing, as they expect the Turkish fleet to certainly come against Italy and especially Sicily in the approaching spring. Perhaps peace will be made.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant us peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 15th November 1560.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet the excellent men, the consuls, Philipp, Pontasella, and other friends.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>[To the] most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and dear lord and compatriot. To Chur, to the pastor at St. Martin.</p>
