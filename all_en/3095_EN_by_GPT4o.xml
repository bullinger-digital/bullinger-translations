      <p>My friendly greetings along with all the love and goodness I can offer, first of all, kind, dear brother-in-law. I thank you most kindly, along with your sister, your dear wife, for the trouble and unrest you and she have taken on my behalf with the cloths, and I ask you to let me know what the said cloths have cost to spin, so that I can settle the same. If I can do or serve you and yours here in any other way, I would not spare myself in any way, but would always be found completely willing.</p>
      <p>Therefore, kind dear brother-in-law, I must not withhold from you that my husband and I have recently given one of our daughters, named Catrina, to a man named Niclaus Wyermann, and the wedding will be held on the Conversion of Paul, which will be on the 25th of this month, and the church ceremony will be conducted according to customary practice, etc. On this occasion, it is the earnest request and desire of my aforementioned husband and myself to you, your wife, my dear sister, brother-in-law Hans, his son Josue, my cousin, and his wife, along with your dear daughters, my nieces, and three daughters-in-law, my sisters-in-law, and others dear to you, that none of you be excluded, and that you would do us the honor and service of visiting us on the aforementioned day and wedding here in Bern and help celebrate it. If you and yours can come, you shall stay at our house and dine with us, and we will show you the friendliest and best hospitality we can.</p>
      <p>Further, I ask you not to be angry with me for delaying so long in writing back; for my scribe has not been here until now, but rather in Thun with his brother. He sends you all his most friendly greetings. My husband and I ask you to greet all yours most highly for us and not to fail to visit us on the mentioned day; we will inform all the others in due time.</p>
      <p>In doing so, you do us a great favor. Be faithfully entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>Dated January 10, 1557. Your willing and true sister, Christiana Frisching.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, prudent, honorable, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the holy word in ZÃ¼rich, my faithful, dear brother-in-law, to hand.</p>
      <p>The wedding of the Frisching family in Bern, January 28, 1557.</p>
