    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends a letter [from Martin Hentius] to Bullinger, which he received for forwarding; did not reply to Bullinger's letter [No. 1877] because he did not have it at hand, and does not do so now because he does not have time to look for it. He forwarded the monk recommended by Bullinger to Bern. Recommends again Johannes Fabricius [Hans Schmid], who [in Zurich] answered poorly due to exam anxiety but deserves support. Since Bullinger distrusts him, Myconius limits himself to a few pieces of news: Significant people are fleeing from severe persecutions in the Netherlands to them [in Basel]; the Andernach doctor [Johannes Winter] and the scholar [Justus] Velsius were expelled from Leuven and are now in Strasbourg; should Emperor [Charles V] defeat the French [King Francis I], Myconius would rather be with [Martin] Hentius in Kronstadt with the Turks than in Germany.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The letters you see were sent to me so that I might ensure they are delivered to you, which I do with the utmost willingness. I would have also replied to yours, which you recently sent, if they had been at hand. Since I am not doing so now, I ask you to consider it kindly, as I did not have the leisure to search for them.</p>
      <p>I hosted the monk you recommended for eight full days. Our almoner wanted to receive him temporarily at the Augustinians; however, since that was not agreeable, we sent him to Bern.</p>
      <p>I commend Johannes Fabricius to you once again, for I understand that those recommended to you are recommended to no one in vain. When he recently returned here to settle his debts, he complained that he responded poorly in the examination because fear had so completely occupied him that he could not do otherwise. He is not of a bad nature nor unfit for letters, provided he does not lack constant encouragement. Therefore, if you or someone else were to take him on, I believe he would eventually be pleasing.</p>
      <p>I would write news, but since what I recently sent lacked credibility with you, I refrain. I feel a considerable loss since you have begun to seek knowledge of new matters from others. Perhaps I will indicate something about this in the future.</p>
      <p>However, I cannot remain silent about the persecution in Lower Germany, which is so rampant that significant people have begun to flee to us. They wish to buy citizenship here. What the magistrates will do, I do not know. The doctor from Andernach and Velsius, a very learned man, have been expelled from Leuven and are now in Strasbourg. This proves the faith of the Emperor, whatever may be said about peace concerning religion. If he is victorious against the French, I would rather be with Hentius in Kronstadt among the Turks than in Germany. May God increase His spirit within us. Amen. Farewell with yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 24, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, the best Antistes of the people of Zurich, his venerable in the Lord.</p>
