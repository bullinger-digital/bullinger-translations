      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I cannot sufficiently marvel at your deep silence in this state of affairs, in which the most abundant reasons for writing present themselves daily. What is the Bolwilerian soldier doing, whom they say is being fed with the money of priests and Jews? For Moses of Mersburg, a Jew, lent 14,000 florins; the monks also contribute a large sum of money by melting sacred vessels. Where another soldier gathered among us is staying, I beg you, tell me.</p>
      <p>A new army is being gathered in Marckeltzen (a small town in the bishopric of Strasbourg); they have 15 banners, I think they will go to the Hercynian forest via the bridge over the Rhine at Breisach. They will cause trouble for the Mauritians, as the army is divided into two parts.</p>
      <p>The Margrave of Brandenburg is about to besiege Frankfurt on the Main, and the younger Landgrave is pressing due to the damage that soldiers have inflicted on his peasants. It will be a serious siege. The people of Frankfurt have recalled their citizens from the Strasbourg fairs and have asked them to return home quickly, lest they want to be in danger. They have 15 banners with them, two in the city, others outside the city in the meadows. We hear nothing about the Emperor, perhaps he is ill or insane at Villach, as some firmly assert, and it should not be surprising if he has fallen into this kind of illness, since he has been almost cast down from a high position. The Frenchman is attacking the Belgians with a hostile army. However, we hear nothing certain about what Maurice is doing with his soldiers.</p>
      <p>They are composing articles, I don't know which ones; but in the meantime, the Emperor is enlisting soldiers from all corners. What will truly happen, the Lord knows, whom we must constantly pray to for tranquility both in spreading the gospel and in achieving true peace. Furthermore, I commend to you these young men, both learned and pious; one is a doctor of medicine, if I am not mistaken, the other a student of jurisprudence. They come to us from Italy, from whom you will be able to inquire about the state of Italy, Venice, the Kingdom of Naples, and even about the Turkish envoys who were recently in Venice. Farewell. July 12, 1552. I have written nothing to Mr. Theodor, whom I expect at any moment, to whom I pray for all good things.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius of Basel from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his perpetual teacher to be honored. Zurich.</p>
