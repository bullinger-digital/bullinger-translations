      <p>Greetings. The army, which should have been assembled and led into Italy as quickly as possible, is in great doubt as to how it can be recruited and gathered, venerable father. For that Hannibal, about whom I recently wrote, had planned to gather the army in Weingarten and Füssen; however, neither location will be permitted for him to gather and review the army, nor will any other place within the boundaries of the empire be permitted.</p>
      <p>It is also decreed by a very strict imperial edict that no one who is subject to the emperor should attempt to follow another's banners or even enlist; a severe penalty is also established for transgressors, namely that the wives of the disobedient, along with their children, will be sent into exile from their paternal homes and possessions.</p>
      <p>That citizen, who was to sell arms to the army, also reported to me personally that he had not concluded anything with Hannibal, because he wanted the arms to be delivered to him within a few days, as the matter admits no delay. He also decided that if they could not obtain any place within the empire's borders from the emperor, to whom he sent an envoy with horses, they would send individual soldiers to Trento, so that they could be gathered there and equipped with everything necessary for the expedition as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he added that there is a rumor about the emperor's death being spread. Meanwhile, whatever is commanded or prohibited, the Emps are entirely focused on gathering the army and not omitting anything convenient for a swift departure. Therefore, we expect some disturbances any day now.</p>
      <p>We will pray to the Lord to thwart the plans of the impious.</p>
      <p>If I learn anything else for certain, I will let you know shortly. Farewell, together with all yours, as happily as possible, and continue to hold me and mine in your commendation as before. My regards to you all.</p>
      <p>Stein am Rhein, evening of May 24, 1564.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours in kindness, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant and faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my most esteemed lord and relative. Zürich.</p>
