    <p xml:id="regest1">The monks of R端ti have sued the caretaker Hans Kilchrat in Zurich. During the investigation, due to the monks' intrigues, the complaint then falls on the defenseless wife of the caretaker, who criticized the monks' lavish lifestyle. However, these monks are in favor with the authorities, and instead of being punished for their offense against the pastor of Wald, Martin Manhart, the innocent caretaker is now being held accountable. Stumpf requests Bullinger's intervention in favor of the pastor of Wald.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich and brother. Regarding the recent description of the monks of R端ti, it seems to us that nothing else has been done than to remove the pious caretaker and replace him with another, as the dear gentlemen might wish, because they have accused the good man before the accounting officers, and when he was to be heard, what a time to clean up.</p>
      <p>Moreover, our lords have sent a message to investigate all the actions of the caretaker. In the meantime, however, the monks have taken to the field, making all the servants, maids, and household staff in the monastery unfavorably disposed towards the pious man and incited them to complain against the caretaker. And when our lords heard the monks and all the household staff, they found nothing else (as I understand) than that he acted piously and well, and no one can complain about him. Only the wife has caused the damage. Since the caretaker's wife has praised Zurich, saying it is quick, the dear gentlemen thought it best to deal with her complaint, and yet the poor woman has no power (authority, official capacity) in the monastery, nor anything to do with the monks. But our lords are supposed to hear the complaints of the lazy boys from a poor woman and send a message because of a woman's complaint, and yet all the complaints of the synod about the arch-rogues should not be decided! Thus, the rogues stick in the government with their gifts and through their hunting.</p>
      <p>The main reason, however, why they complain about the woman is that she is impatient when the monks, during this great, pitiable famine, feed a great heap of dogs. For the little dogs, one must (when otherwise cooking peas or lentils) cook another kind of mush, pour butter over it, and give it to eat, with great offense and injury to all pious and poor children of God. Yes, the poor woman complains about that. She does not like the lazy boys' housekeeping and speaks to them about it at times. That annoys them, and if one wants to follow the liars, one would have to change the caretaker, for whom no other reason is known than that he is pious and God-fearing and a lover of truth. He should be changed because of his poor wife, and the rogues should be left in their whoring and hunting. Oh, woe to the government! If the monks succeed in getting rid of the pious man, it happens only so that sometimes a greedy, gluttonous glutton comes out, who sings the monks' song. Then the bell is cast, and the chain is whole, which will eventually strangle us poor criers. Many pious people are amazed that our lords, despite so many Christian mandates, orders, and reforms, let these monks sit in their willfulness. But it carries little hares, venison, and other good things! The monks cannot praise enough how honorably they were treated in Zurich and how friendly they were treated at the R端den. On the way home, they sang into the monastery. I thought they would be described, their mischief and misconduct against the pastor of Wald to be answered for. We all looked forward to how they would be punished and changed. So it has become a follow-up to the caretaker's, the honest man's, housekeeping, and the ball has been rolled onto the poor woman. That was called letting the rogues get away with it, starting with the guilty and ending with the innocent, etc. There is great joy and jubilation among the monks' party. What it means, I do not know. We are informed that the matter of the caretaker should come before the council, but when, one cannot know. We fear evil, the dirt that the monks have defecated, the pious caretaker must clean up, as it is gladly done in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear lord and brother, for God's honor's sake, be advised and asked by us to do as much as possible to dig up this practice, and if you know good, faithful people, lift up among those works, if the devil's cart might fall over. Do the best so that the pastor's case from Wald is not overlooked, but he is also heard. You know well where you should anchor, but we do not know, for those we once trusted are dead. Help and advise so that this pious man is not taken from us. Unfortunately, there are otherwise too many weak heads in the Gr端ningen office. Also, if you could know when they want to deal with it, if it would be good for the pastor of Wald to come there, you could inform us of this with this messenger.</p>
      <p>With this, we commend you to the Lord God, who may keep you long for the good of His church and us poor. Do not be annoyed by my unsalted writing, for the messenger took me from my bed right after midnight.</p>
      <p>Given at Bubikon, today Tuesday morning early, March 31, 1534.</p>
      <p>Hanns Stumpff, pastor at Bubikon.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich</p>
