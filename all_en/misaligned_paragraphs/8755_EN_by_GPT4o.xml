      <p>Greetings in Christ. I did not receive your letter dated February 25, 1571, until the 25th of August of the following year. Along with it, I also received a handwritten refutation of the papal bull and a response to Brentius's testament. I am surprised that Brentius wished to leave behind such a virulent testament. Your response is certainly both modest and pious. The refutation of the bull has been printed in both English and Latin; I believe you have already received several printed copies of it.</p>
      <p>We truly thank your piety for being so concerned about our churches. As for the state of my affairs after my relocation here, let me briefly inform you. I left London on the first of August 1570: two days later, during the journey itself, I fell into a tertian fever due to fatigue (since I was not accustomed to riding while in London), and for this reason, I was forced to rest for ten days in the middle of the journey. Finally, on the 17th of August, I arrived at Cawood, where I have a house by the bank of the River Ouse, seven miles from the city, with the fever not properly treated, as later events showed. For on the second of September following, I fell into another very severe and acute fever, which weakened me exceedingly, so much so that not only did the doctors and friends despair of my life, but I also accepted the sentence of death upon myself. But the Lord, who kills and makes alive, etc. (as the strength of the disease gradually decreased, yet so that I did not leave my room for the entire winter), finally, after six months, restored me to my former health. Since then, I have labored, and still labor, to the best of my ability in visiting my diocese and province, and in abolishing the remnants of superstitions, which in these parts, suffering from a greater scarcity of learned and pious ministers, clung more tenaciously. Now, after the suppression of the sedition, I find the people more obedient in external matters than I expected: for they have been sufficiently afflicted by these evils, which usually accompany civil wars, and are therefore more humble. Would that I had found them as well instructed in true religion as I left my Londoners and Essexians to my successor! Yet I hope, with the Lord giving increase, that much can be accomplished here in time. The Bishop of Durham, who is perpetually in poor health, recently suffered severely; but now, by the Lord's kindness, he has recovered.</p>
      <p>We lost, or rather sent ahead, the good Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury (the gem and sole ornament of our church, according to his name) around the beginning of October last.</p>
      <p>I know that you, as you write, wish to be informed about our affairs not out of curiosity, but for other most just reasons, just as we desire to hear about yours, whatever they may be: for we are members of the same body.</p>
      <p>I therefore hope that henceforth, with matters now settled, I will write to your piety at least twice a year, as usual, at both Frankfurt fairs. Our affairs at present, by the great kindness of God, are quite tranquil; although at the end of last summer, suspecting nothing of the sort, we were in the greatest danger, as you can easily infer from a certain document enclosed here, published in our language in the form of a letter, yet not without public authority, and translated into Latin. The Guise offspring, who calls herself the Queen of Scotland, is now assigned to stricter custody. Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, was brought to the judges' bench on the 16th of this month and condemned to death for the crime of treason. But whether the ultimate punishment will soon be inflicted on him, we, who are far from the court, still do not know. Other associates of the same conspiracy are in chains, about to undergo a similar fate.</p>
      <p>Scotland has been most miserably afflicted throughout this year due to internal dissensions. For after the death of James the Regent, the grandfather of the boy king was appointed in his place. He, nearly a year ago, unexpectedly seized the very fortified castle of Dumbarton, located at the mouth of the River Clyde, by night with ladders brought up and the sentinels killed, and forced the Archbishop of St. Andrews found there, who was the illegitimate brother of the Duke of Hamilton, to end his life by hanging. In revenge for this hanging, around the beginning of May last, the Hamiltons with 300 horsemen entered the town of Stirling by night and immediately killed the new regent, who was apprehended in his lodging. He was succeeded by the Earl of Mar, a good man, but not very powerful.</p>
      <p>Thus the Scots rage among themselves with mutual slaughter, divided into many factions, both public and private. Those who stand for the queen have occupied Edinburgh and its castle. The royalists have fortified and garrisoned Leith, a nearby port.</p>
      <p>The castle of Edinburgh was entrusted by James the Regent to a certain Kirkcaldy, as the most faithful to him and most hostile to the queen. He, shortly after, while James was still alive, perhaps corrupted by French gold, defected to the queen. That defection was the cause of all these evils; for otherwise, the queen's supporters would have found no safe seat of war anywhere. Yet we hope that our queen will soon put an end to these evils; for if the matter cannot be settled by the conference and negotiation for peace, which is now underway, there is no doubt that our queen will be an enemy to that party which rejected the fair conditions offered, to which the other party will necessarily be compelled to yield.</p>
      <p>I have written to Richard Hilles to send some crowns in July. I will have Butler recommended; if he learns our language, he will be able to serve our church in the future. I also send you along with these the history of the virtues of the Queen of Scotland, recently published by George Buchanan, a Scot. May the Lord Jesus preserve your piety for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>At Bishopthorpe in the suburbs of York, January 25, 1572.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety in the Lord, Edmund, Archbishop of York.</p>
      <p>As I was about to seal this, I received your letters and those of Mr. Gwalter, in which you commend your nephew, and he his son. I am far from our academies, but I will write to friends to have them recommended. I hear that Mr. London has sent them to Cambridge and provided them with travel funds. I will also, as much as I can, assist them with money from time to time. Please greet Mr. Gwalter in my name, to whom I did not have time to reply now. I suspect that the anonymous booklet you sent me was written by our late Bishop of Salisbury of pious memory; but besides conjecture from the style and method, I have nothing. Farewell again in Christ, dearest and most esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>Edmund, Archbishop of York.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
      <p>Archbishop of York.</p>
