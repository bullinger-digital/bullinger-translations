    <p xml:id="regest1">When Erb went to the chancellor [Sigismund Stier] the morning of the previous day, he received Bullinger's letter [No. 2209] from Bullinger's messenger [Markus Wüst] at the court gate. After reading it, he was dismayed. During the negotiations with the chancellor, he kept thinking about it. At lunch, he questioned the messenger further and immediately planned a response. Then, a letter from [Count Georg of Württemberg] arrived, announcing his imminent return from the [Worms] Diet. Erb was assigned a series of duties, so he could only respond a day later. - As a fifty-year-old, he wishes for a quieter life, but despite his efforts, it is not granted to him. - His repeated attempts to hire a colleague to help him with the task that has become too difficult for him have been unsuccessful, as everyone declines out of fear. - Furthermore, [Hans Henman] manages the finances poorly. In five years, Erb has had to spend 200 guilders from his own wealth for the church, and he does not want to complain about the resulting loss, but about the thieving harpies who tolerate no admonition and are to blame for the church being notorious for stinginess. As long as there is something to steal, they love Christ, but not when the church cannot cover the costs! Until recently, he had [two colleagues] in [Riquewihr], now Erb must handle all tasks alone and also struggles to receive his salary. In such a tricky situation, he cannot imagine leaving [his] church. - Since [1538], he has put it in order as best as he could. Now the work begun must be completed, [especially since] the neighboring Montbéliard with its [Count Christoph of Württemberg] is still wavering. Additionally, in the small, agriculture-dominated [County of Horburg and Lordship of Riquewihr], there are four schools; a fifth is planned, as well as the establishment of a scholarship. If Erb were to leave now, everything would be at risk. Moreover, the difficult [Count], angered by this, might change his mind. Erb must therefore wait for a better opportunity. - He is nonetheless deeply grateful to Bullinger, and Bullinger has only become dearer to him through the care shown to him. God will surely help Bullinger to find a good pastor for Augsburg. May Erb also be freed [from this tricky situation], or at least not collapse under the burden! However, Erb asks Bullinger not to hold such a high opinion of him in the future, as he is, in his opinion, more aware of his limits than Bullinger is. - May God grant Erb such an opportunity again! Bullinger should express Erb's thanks to the authorities of Augsburg and especially to Georg Frölich for this honorable appointment. The people of Augsburg have become dear to Erb because of this. He wishes them harmony and success in their search for a suitable Antistes; but they should not wait for him. - [Enclosure:] News: The Diet [at Worms] was dissolved without result. The [Protestants] are assured peace only until the end of the coming winter. The imperial recess has not yet been published. [Charles V.] is said to have been authorized to decide on religious matters under certain conditions. - [King] Ferdinand [I.] left [Worms] together with [Friedrich] Nausea towards Bohemia. A week later, [Charles V.] also departed. A Diet in Regensburg was announced for October. - Some advocate for a national council in Metz. [Claude I.] of Guise, the [uncle] of the deceased Duke [François I.] of Lorraine, is trying, with the help of [King Francis I.], to expel his [great]nephew [Charles III of Lorraine] from [Lorraine]. Emperor [Charles V.] promises the young [Charles III.] help and Spanish troops. This could lead to a new war with France. - Erb sends greetings to Bullinger's family, [Kaspar] Megander, Erasmus [Schmid], [Konrad] Pellikan, [Rudolf] Gwalther, and everyone else.</p>

      <p>May the grace of the Lord be with you. When I descended from the pulpit on the tenth of August and immediately went from the temple to the court (having been called by the chancellor to settle certain church matters), your messenger arrived here around the ninth hour. As I stood in the alley, he asked the servant at the door for Erb, and when the doorkeeper signaled with his eyes not to reveal me, he immediately pointed with his finger, saying: "This is him." He then approached me and inquired if my name was Erb. I said yes. He immediately produced letters, saying they were sent by you. I read them, astonished at your diligence in copying from the original, despite being otherwise very busy. Standing there stunned and almost breathless, I instructed the young man to wait until I returned, and meanwhile, during the negotiations and various disputes, I silently and continuously pondered over what you had written. After being freed from the court's noise, I went to lunch with the young man and questioned him about each matter, intending to respond to you immediately after the meal. While I was contemplating this, another messenger arrived with letters from the prince, in which many tasks were assigned to me, and they promised the prince would soon return from the Diet. Hence, although the young man frequently urged me to leave that day, I wrote nothing, postponing everything to the next day, which is today. This is about your messenger's diligence.</p>
      <p>As for the matter at hand, take this in brief. I confess that I have now passed my fiftieth year, and being at an age that desires more tranquility, I have often sought to be relieved from the courtly cares that burden me, but have made little progress; indeed, the more I wish to free myself, the more I am entangled, to the detriment of both my life and affairs. Thus it has seemed to God, the best and greatest.</p>
      <p>Regarding my life, to depict everything more clearly, old age is creeping in slowly, which is beginning to be difficult, no longer sufficient for the labors, as it is frequently exhausted day by day. I have no colleague, as you know, I believe. I have called many by the prince's order; but they dread what I lament. They fear for themselves from the sharp minds, nor do I wish to draw anyone to me unless they are willing, etc. As for my affairs, the one you know by name manages the finances poorly. In five years, I have spent nearly two hundred gold coins from my patrimony not for my own benefit, but more for the church's necessity, which the day of the Lord will reveal. I do not complain, dear brother, about the lost things, but about the thieving harpies, who do not heed those who admonish rightly and brand the church with the mark of avarice; which would not matter much, if not for the fear of destruction. As long as there is something to be taken, they love Christ; when the church's treasury fails, Christ will no longer be pleasing! Until recently, we were three in this town, where each had a designated stipend. Now I alone am in charge of all the cares, and I can hardly receive my stipend from the satraps, and if I were in need, they would scarcely relieve me with a trifle. There are also other reasons, which I do not wish to burden you with by writing, etc. And among so many storms, I do not yet see a just occasion for leaving this church.</p>
      <p>In summary, I am caught between a rock and a hard place, so that now, without harm to the church of Christ, as you easily understand, I cannot depart.</p>
      <p>And these are the main reasons. We have somehow put our churches in order for the sixth year now, as best we could - since we could not as we wished. Therefore, we must strive to complete what has been begun. To this end, the church contiguous to us, Montbéliard, with its prince, still wavers; about which a whole book could be written. Furthermore, four schools have been established in this small agricultural area, and a fifth is to be instituted in the countryside, stipends also promised to certain students a few months ago, but not all of these are confirmed and ratified, and certain decrees are still to be proposed to the church, by which they may be brought to discipline and holy morals as best as possible, and that immediately upon the prince's return. For all these were written in his absence. Therefore, if I were to change my place now, leaving everything under the knife, you easily understand what danger looms. Especially since the severe prince, on whom everything depends, could easily be changed or irritated, as is the nature of this kind of man; which would certainly be more to the church's detriment than to my inconvenience. Do you see me suspended between heaven and earth, unable to be freed by this reason or vocation, which is nevertheless both holy and just? I must wait for a more favorable opportunity, which will free me without harm to the church. For if I were to leave now, the church, deprived of a pastor, would waver among the hesitators and idlers, etc.</p>
      <p>However, I give and have immortal thanks to you, most humane Bullinger, for having labored with great care in my name, and I love you all the more for placing the duty of charity in me not deceitfully, but skillfully and candidly, indeed signifying it in this holy vocation. God, the best and greatest, will undoubtedly respond to your prayers, so that the people of Augsburg may find a holy man, worthy of the church's ministry, and I too, by your constant prayers, may either be freed by a public opportunity or not fail under the burden. But I also beseech you by Jesus Christ, not to attribute more to me in the future, as if you were an immoderate herald of my virtues, which I entirely lack, or to think more of me than the reality is. For I am very much aware of my own scant resources, which you, unless I am mistaken, estimate greater than they are, persuaded by the judgment of I know not whom.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, what the importunity of the present time denies, God, the true and only pastor of the churches, will repair with his usual clemency at another time. You will also express my immense thanks to the holy magistrate of Augsburg, especially to the learned man, Lord Georg Frölich, in my name, for having deemed me, an inept little man, worthy of such an honorable vocation. I too will henceforth have greater regard for their church - if I am able - everywhere, and I wish them stable peace and concord and such overseers, who excel in piety, learning, prudence, vigilance, and fidelity, so that Christ may take root in that republic in such a way that it is not overthrown by any impostures of Satan and the impious. Therefore, you will advise them not to expect me in the future; for I am ignorant of my liberation. May Christ keep you.</p>
      <p>News: You are not unaware of the dissolution of the Diet, in which nothing certain was decided, except that the adversaries have promised us peace for these winter months; we must provide for the coming summer. The acts of the Diet have not yet been published. Some say that everything has been entrusted to the emperor, to pronounce judgment even in the matter of religion, yet under certain conditions; if this is true, we will say that the sheep has been entrusted to the wolf.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand left the Diet last week with great noise, heading to Bohemia with his Nausea and some monks. The following week, the emperor is to depart, but to where is unknown. Another Diet was said to be called in Regensburg for the month of October, but some say it has been canceled, etc.</p>
      <p>Many urge a national council, and they demand it be held in Metz. Musher de Guise, the brother of the deceased Duke of Lorraine, is trying, with conscripted soldiers and the help of the King of France, to expel his nephew from the duchy. The emperor has promised the young successor, who succeeded his father, support and Spanish troops. If the matter is not settled, they think a new war will arise between the emperor and France. Some other news is circulating, but perhaps not credible: the world is full of lies. All this in haste.</p>
      <p>Farewell, therefore, most humane man, with the holy church and family. Greet your people in turn, especially my Megander, Erasmus, Pellican, Gwalther, and the rest.</p>
      <p>From my house, on the 11th day of August.</p>
      <p>Yours, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the truly learned and pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, vigilant minister of the church of Zurich, his singular patron, etc.</p>
