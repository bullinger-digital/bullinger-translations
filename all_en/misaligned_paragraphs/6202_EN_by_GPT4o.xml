      <p>S. My relative (reverend father in Christ) informed me with your words that things in France are going well; the same was written by the envoy, Mr. de Bellieure.</p>
      <p>I was very pleased to hear this.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I finally obtained the complete Council of Trent; although I am reluctant to part with it, I am sending it to you; if you already have it, please return it at some point; if not, keep it, but ensure that Froschauer brings some copies from Frankfurt, so that I can replace it from there. Furthermore, my Spanish opponent's disputations have been published in Venice, of which I am sending the title, but the complete book has not reached me, which greatly displeases me; some pages are missing. A booklet on traditions has been added.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Froschauer should be advised to bring these copies for friends as well. I doubt whether the envoy of Philip will return, as it was consistently rumored; I cannot affirm anything certain here.</p>
      <p>It is reported that Cardinal Madruzzo left Rome with the pope's disfavor; thus Balingketus heard in Trent, yet the cause of the offense in such a short delay could not yet be discovered.</p>
      <p>Hannibal's soldiers are in the Cremona region; soldiers are also being recruited in the Milan region. Thus Balingketus affirms.</p>
      <p>A small band of soldiers is still at Roveredo, 2 miles below Trent, where some of the leaders are captured. In Hall in the Inn Valley, it is dying honestly.</p>
      <p>The water has caused great damage here and there in Italy.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new otherwise.</p>
      <p>Italy is closed to us because of the plague; thus Balingketus affirms that those cheeses requested by Mr. Erastus cannot be obtained now.</p>
      <p>If you write to Mr. Erastus first, inform him of all this. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, as happily and for as long as possible. If you write, add the usual greetings to the colleague, so that he does not suspect through me that his matters are being disclosed; I will let him reveal himself in his own time.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, July 24, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>The letter F was redundant and in the rest, some were missing; therefore, I am sending you this page, so you have a taste and see with which letter it was printed; do not return it; I do not need it.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>Disputations against the protestation of thirty-four heretics of the Augsburg Confession held by Gaspar Cardillo, Villalpando, a Spaniard from Segovia, a theological doctor, for the sacred ecumenical Council of Trent.</p>
      <p>At the same time, an account is given of many things that happened in the same sacred council. To the most illustrious reverend Lord Charles Borromeo, S.R.E. cardinal priest.</p>
      <p>With privilege in Venice at Donato Bertelli 1564. There are 9 disputations, the titles of which, if you wish, I will send separately.</p>
      <p>Heretics, who are partly expressly, partly incidentally refuted by us in these disputations: Thirty-four Protestants, superintendents in Heidelberg, Luther, Melanchthon, Fabricius Montanus, Vergerius, Wycliffe, Huss, the Prague, Nicolaus Gallus, Ochino, Peter Martyr, Stancar, Zwingli, Schwenckfeld, Brenz, Pomeranus, Bullinger, Pellican, Calvin, Sleidan, Dorpius, Capito, Bucer, Monhem, Augsburg Confession, Urbanus Rhegius. The author himself prefaces this book first, then Jacobus Gibertus, bishop of Alife. Here the author is praised with wonderful praises as the chief scourge of Luther.</p>
      <p>He calls me a deserter and defector of the papal religion, as if I had ever been of those parts, who defected.</p>
