      <p>I received your gift along with your most kind and loving letters. I pray to God that you may never find me unworthy of your benevolence.</p>
      <p>I am now sending you an apologetic letter to our Beza, against a certain pamphlet falsely titled here under the name of a Christian Jurist. From this, you will recognize the humanity of that man, whom I could not greet in your name because he had departed to Frankfurt or Heidelberg before he had published his pamphlet here. He arranged for it to be printed so secretly that not a single page could be extorted from the printer for any price before he had left.</p>
      <p>I assume you have heard nothing about Ruffus's duplication. Ten days ago, Balduin sent it to me, [Greek]. He never revealed my surname. In some places, he says I am raving, being already fifty years old and one and a half times older than him. You have never read anything more absurd. You might say another author was responsible for that book.</p>
      <p>But I cannot respond at all at this time, partly due to countless occupations (which I admit should be postponed for the business of religion, but I am now completely devoted to them) and partly due to my French business, which is now succeeding so happily by the grace of faith that I have led two of my brothers to the knowledge of the gospel, and I have never had greater hope for my inheritance.</p>
      <p>Your son will be most recommended to me, but as I see it, unless he is advised by you, he will not come to me. However, he promised to dine with me tomorrow. We read your book here with the greatest pleasure.</p>
      <p>May God grant that an end may be put to these scandals someday. Our little church has two excellent ministers, who openly express their opinions. Sleidan, Sturm, Dasypodius, and some others agree with us.</p>
      <p>I hope that God Almighty will reveal the truth of His gospel to His chosen and His children.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, March 25, 1556.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich, my most esteemed father, Fran√ßois Hotman sends greetings.</p>
