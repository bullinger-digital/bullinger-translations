      <p>We have understood, not without great sorrow, most honorable lords and dearest brothers, that there have arisen among you men, stirred by a spirit we do not know, who dare to call into question and drag into contentious and reckless disputes the articles of our Christian faith, once piously and sacredly explained by the ancients and confirmed by the scriptures, concerning the unity and trinity of God, and finally concerning the co-eternal Father and Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. They even dare to reject and trample upon the most ancient creeds, including that of Athanasius, once bishop of Alexandria.</p>
      <p>Some of you, however, wish to hear our judgment on this matter. But we have long since publicly expressed our opinion on this entire cause in books published, and indeed most significantly, though briefly, in that letter which we sent to you, written and printed in March of the year 1561. We feel no differently now than we did then.</p>
      <p>We rather abhor those disputes initiated over those mysteries, which all the pious in all ages have preferred to adore rather than to scrutinize. We certainly do not accept into our church those who wish to dwell as strangers unless they first profess to believe as required by the prescribed articles, which we have discovered have reached you in some written letters to us.</p>
      <p>We therefore urge your piety, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to persevere in those things which holy and religious antiquity has handed down to us from the time of the apostles through the holy scriptures by means of the creeds, and not to allow them to be taken from you by men who are innovators and wickedly restless, indeed of bad faith. Rather, flee from these and abhor their impious curiosity and audacity.</p>
      <p>We indeed, for the sake of those who are curable and do not reject or ridicule sound reasoning, have composed a brief writing. We send it printed, partly published against the calumnies of Stancarus, to which we have added the admonition of our brother, Mr. Calvin, and partly in manuscript, which is opposed to unsound doctrines.</p>
      <p>We hope these will satisfy moderate minds; even the Apostle Paul himself did not satisfy insolent minds, nor is impiety, which is prodigal of words and the inventor of evil arts and always desirous of victory, cured by words.</p>
      <p>Consider these things of ours, lords and brothers, with good counsel, stand firm in the truth, pray to the Lord to deliver you from wicked and deceitful men endowed with proud, audacious, and contentious minds, and to preserve you in sincere truth and holy peace. Love us, I beseech you, who love you most dearly, and pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May the Lord bless you and deliver and protect you and your churches from all evil.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 3rd of May, 1563.</p>
      <p>The pastors, professors, ministers of the Church of Zurich, your brothers.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed men, the elders of the churches of Lesser Poland and Russia, the faithful ministers of the churches, our most respected lords and dearest brothers.</p>
