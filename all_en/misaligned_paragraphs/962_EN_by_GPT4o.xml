      <p>Greetings in Christ. My father Pelikan, my father, and you other most esteemed fathers and brothers in Christ. When our Raphael asked upon his return to you if I wished to send anything, although I was daily and hourly expecting that messenger from Wittenberg and your most learned letters, which are exceedingly pleasing to my spirit, to come to us rather than me sending something to you, I could not refrain, even though it was untimely and very inconvenient, from hastily writing this insignificant and unpolished letter to you and those other common friends and brothers in Christ, our genuine and sincere ones, just to express that my spirit towards you all in mutual friendship is and will be eternal, as it ought to be and as you would wish it to be. Our church and school are in great fear and danger due to the Saxon war, which threatens from the Duke of Brunswick and the city and from Dresden. On June 16, the city of Brunswick clashed with the Duke in a fierce conflict near the monastery, losing Wickershausen and ten of their own; but the Duke, having deserted his soldiers and infantry, withdrew with his cavalry, with a great number of soldiers killed. These were like preludes to war; but worse is feared from the diets and council by the good people. The bishopric of Halle is still vacant; but without a doubt, someone will be imposed, as also in Merseburg, the worst Joachim... some papist. There is a rumor about the bishop from Arras, although the son of the Elector Margrave had already been admitted as coadjutor with the chapter's consent. But without a doubt, the will of the Emperor will be done both in Merseburg and elsewhere. Hence, what is to be hoped for our churches concerning these matters is easy to conjecture. But even worse, indeed, discord is sown and grows among the brothers concerning the adiaphora, etc. You know, I suppose, what they are and of what kind. If I knew you desired it, I would gladly send some things often. In England, a disputation has been published in the name of Peter Martyr, as I hear, especially concerning the Eucharist, which was recently brought here, but I have not yet seen or read it. There are also great disturbances there; but it is still conducted by disputation without force; here, however, a good theologian is scorned, a rough soldier is loved, etc. I greatly desire the letters of Joachim Vadian, the most distinguished consul, and yours, so that we may be informed about the peace and hope of your churches, and as much as we grieve for ourselves, we may congratulate you and yours. I cannot say more now; otherwise, nothing would be sweeter than to converse with you as if in person; for what are we or how long will we care for these things. And so, as much as I can here and there as fully as possible, as our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are one, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love us in return.</p>
      <p>Written very quickly by the lamp on July 6, 1550, in Leipzig, etc.</p>
      <p>Eternally and sincerely yours and of yours and yours, indeed of all of ours, Valentin Paceus, etc.</p>
      <p>I very much wish that both you and Mr. Bullinger and Bibliander would write to me your opinion and judgment copiously and as fully as possible about this whole controversy, which they now call the antidiaphoristic and adiaphoristic, for it cannot be said how much trouble this gives us and will perhaps give, unless God averts it. But there are yet some worse things concerning the pseudo-brothers and pseudo-Christians, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished, most learned, most humane, most upright men, Mr. Conrad Pelikan, Heinrich Bullinger, Theodor Bibliander, and Conrad Gessner, and the other ministers of the Church of Jesus Christ in ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed lords and friends in Christ with eternal veneration.</p>
