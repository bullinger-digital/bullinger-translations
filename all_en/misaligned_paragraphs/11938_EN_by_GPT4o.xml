    <p xml:id="regest1">[Blarer's] letter, along with [Diethelm] Röist's, was read with gratitude. At the meeting in Baden on April 6th/7th, Zürich, represented by [Hans Rudolf] Lavater, and Bern warned the regions allied with France against continuing their mercenary services, as they have been doing for 20 years; these regions responded by referring to their alliance obligations and the good relationship with [Francis I], stating that they could not abandon him in times of need. Much deliberation took place, and the letter from the Imperial Estates was also read, which admonishes the Swiss against mercenary service, referring to the alliance of [Francis I] with [Suleiman I]; the response was postponed to the meeting on April 20th/21st due to a lack of instructions. The Zürich council will address this tomorrow; a delegation to Speyer is rejected by Zürich as well as by some other regions, but a joint response will likely be agreed upon. The cities [Strasbourg and Constance] have not been written to so far, to avoid putting them in a difficult position; with Emperor [Charles V], they limit themselves to maintaining formalities. Bullinger wants to reimburse Blarer for the messenger's costs. The news from Rome [about the discovery of Emperor Honorius's tomb] is strange - is the time of its decline returning? He is surprised by the capture of [Theobald] Billican, regrets the new dispute [over the electoral dignity] of Frederick [II of the Palatinate]; the Emperor has received reinforcements. He inquired with [Johannes] Haab about Blarer's question regarding inheritance cases; an inheritance claim is generally to be made where the inheritance occurs. [Jakob] Locher from Frauenfeld has brought several children to the monastery, including a daughter [Dorothea?] in Kalchrain, who married a priest [Hans Kopf?]; despite her previous renunciation of inheritance, he demanded her inheritance from the siblings and was granted it by the governing regions in Thurgau, although the siblings received an additional amount; Erasmus [Schmid] married the former Feldbach nun [Marta] Blarer, after which the mother disinherited her, and the case has not yet been negotiated; [Gregorius] Roggenmann from Baden was sent by his father to the monastery of St. Blasien, and his inheritance was promised to the monastery; after his departure, this was confirmed to the monastery by Baden as well as by the VIII regions. The decisions vary, leading to disputes between the regions; at present, it is probably better to let such cases rest. Blarer's letter was received a few hours ago. Rumors of an alliance between Charles [V] and Ferdinand against the Schmalkaldic League; a joining of [Constance] to the Swiss Confederation would be desirable.</p>

      <p>Dearly beloved, especially trusted lord and brother, I have received your letter and read it together with Mr. Röist, regarding common matters. I express my sincere and profound thanks on his behalf and also on my own; for we could never truly repay the great loyalty, effort, diligence, and work. Yet, you should always be entrusted to us in loyalty, etc. My lord sends you his warmest regards.</p>
      <p>Regarding the common affairs of our country: Upon repeated warnings from honorable, upright people and trusted individuals, my lords have set a common day for all the Confederates on Palm Sunday in Baden, where Mr. Treasurer Lavater was appointed, and they have presented to the Confederates, who are in alliance with the king, the danger that threatens the common Confederacy if they continue with their foreign wars, etc., and therefore they have been admonished, as they have been for more than 20 years; likewise, Bern has also been admonished, not with less seriousness than my lords, etc.</p>
      <p>To this, they replied: "We recognize your loyalty and our danger, in which we stand. But what should we do, especially in need? We have an agreement with the king solely for the protection of his country; therefore, he has done us much good, etc. Should we now abandon him in all need? That would be an eternal reproach to the common Confederates. And although we bear no guilt towards the Duke of Milan, we must still be heavily suspected. If we now withdraw from the king in his need, it would be shameful. Therefore, in the name of God, we will risk our lives and blood for him. Having accepted the good, we will also endure the bad, etc. But if you can honorably help us out of this, we kindly ask you to do so. We will do everything that loyal Confederates should do," etc.</p>
      <p>In this, various deliberations have taken place, and the letter from the princes from Speyer (of which you have also been informed) was delivered by a special messenger. It sounded as you wrote. It indicates how the French have allied with the Turks, how the Empire intends to save the fatherland, etc., with a serious admonition that the Confederates should recall their servants from the French and not join him, etc., with a serious request for a written response. Since the messengers had no instructions, they took the letter into consideration to bring it back, etc., and set another day in Baden on the 8th of Easter, to come to deliberations on what to answer and how to handle the matter, etc.</p>
      <p>So tomorrow there will be discussions and citizen meetings here, and also deliberations. Therefore, God has arranged it very well (thanks be to Him) that your letter, information, and advice arrived today, so it can still be considered today. It has been seriously proposed by some of the Confederates that 13 messengers from the 13 places should be sent to Speyer to justify themselves before all the estates, etc. However, this is very much opposed by some, including my lords, for many reasons. The unanimous letter, as I hope, will be well received by us.</p>
      <p>The fact that the cities have not been written to again comes from the concern that it might cause them suspicion and displeasure with the authorities, etc. You should know that my lords do nothing to ingratiate themselves with the emperor; for they inquire about him as little as about the French. What happens, happens for the preservation of the country. Regarding writing and titles, everything must be done correctly.</p>
      <p>We kindly ask you to remain steadfast in your good will and to write as before. Our request is also, since this is now the second messenger, that you indicate the costs, what they are; we will gladly send it from the heart; for I have otherwise done nothing with the messenger.</p>
      <p>The new news from Rome is strange; if there is something to it, it might well lead to some dispute. Quid, si tempora redirent Honorii, ut nunc occidentale imperium prorsus dilaberetur, quod sub Honorio inclinare et laborare coepit?</p>
      <p>I would like to know the reason why Billican was captured. I am sorry that a new dispute has arisen between Frederick and his brothers and that the best sow has become the best acorn. The emperor, however, has a wagon on his wagon, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding your questions, I have received an answer from my lord Haab. Where the inheritance falls, it must be adjudicated. If it falls in a place of the Confederacy, it must be justified there, and there is no appeal from it. If it falls in common lordships, it must be adjudicated there; the appeal goes to the places that have a share and common in the lordship. Chamber court and court process, and letters are not valid with us. One judges according to the custom of the country and fairness.</p>
      <p>In Frauenfeld, the land scribe Locher has settled, has had children, some of whom he has placed in monasteries, especially one in Kalchrain. She has renounced the inheritance, and the other siblings have been paid out in installments. Over time, the one in Kalchrain took a priest; he claimed the inheritance from the siblings after the old Locher's death, etc. The matter came before the places that have a share in Thurgau; they also awarded their share; however, since they cost 100 guilders in the monastery, each sibling should also take 100 guilders from there, then go to equal shares.</p>
      <p>M. Erasmus Fabricius has a Blaurer, was at Feldbach in the monastery; since she took a priest, the mother disinherited the daughter, and M. Erasmus waits quietly; I do not know if he will ever bring it about. In Baden in Aargau, there was one named Roggenmann, who sent his son to the monastery of St. Blasien with the condition that he would follow his father's goods and that the monastery should inherit the monk. When the father died, the young monk ran away and claimed his inheritance. Those from Baden denied it to him and awarded it to the monastery. The appeal came before the 8 places. The majority decision was: well judged, poorly appealed.</p>
      <p>From the mentioned cases, you can now notice something you desire. It does not always go the same way, and there is much dispute and strife between the places. If I had something, I would let it rest for the time being. God be with you and all yours.</p>
      <p>Given on Friday before Easter around 3 in the afternoon. I received yours around 8 in the morning.</p>
      <p>Would to God, it were for your benefit and welfare and you were with us. It is said that there is a practice to make a bond with Charles and Ferdinand so that the Schmalkaldic League is conveniently dissolved. So now if you are asked about your faith, how we remain with your rights, and that a large part of Thurgau would become your own, in which to deal with monasteries and faith and courts according to your pleasure, etc., what would you lack?</p>
      <p>I hoped it would go and you would achieve it and an honorable place in the Confederacy. Dear, consider it. Non frustra haec scribo. Non relegi.</p>
