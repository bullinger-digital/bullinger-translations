      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>The world is in such a bad state now that it is no wonder if even a pious daughter finds everything suspicious, even what is written with good intentions; this would have indeed kept me from writing to you here, if you had not known me for some years now, that my heart, mind, and thoughts are not at all inclined towards any deceit or betrayal of pious and simple people, especially towards you, who is particularly honorable and dear to me because of your discipline, simplicity, and childlike demeanor, which are so little in my mind to deceive or harm in any way, that my utmost diligence alone (I call upon my God of heaven and earth [Gen 24:3]) is directed towards ensuring that your honor and benefit in body and soul are increased. Therefore, you should now read this letter freely without worry and without any suspicion, with careful and earnest consideration, for it is not a small matter that I bring; you will also render me a great service with your earnestness, which I am always inclined to owe you.</p>
      <p>Almighty eternal God has ordained us from the beginning in Christ Jesus for eternal life, so that we walk in the footsteps of this His Son. He has earnestly taught us to flee the world and its princes along with its kingdom of darkness and to accept heavenly things, since we mortal humans live on earth for a very short time and the wages of the flesh and sin is eternal death, but the spirit and virtue bring eternal life. Therefore, it is necessary that all of us who are baptized in the name of God and trust in Him through Jesus Christ for eternal life, leave the world and conform ourselves to the image of God, in whose likeness we are created [Gen 1:27; Eph 4:24; Col 3:10] and which we desire to enjoy eternally; this happens when we adopt a virtuous life, which, although found in many states, is nowhere more vividly expressed than in the marital state, which God Himself has instituted and commanded, that all who are not capable of the high gift of purity or virginity should above all things accept this state and leave father and mother, if they are unfit, then neglect this divine order. So we all know how we should honor father and mother and how obedient we should be to them, and yet God so highly esteems marriage that He does not want even the highest obedience to be a hindrance and delay in this state, we see clearly how high, dear, and noble marriage is before God.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we find no state in divine scripture that has more promises than this one, for here we find that Almighty God promises how He will protect, guide, and raise them in love, unity, and great sweetness of spirit, in all righteousness and in His commandments; for in this state all virtues can be practiced: faith, love, mercy, hope, patience, moderation, discipline, and all godliness in Christ Jesus our Lord. Therefore, we also see that the highest and most precious friends of God [James 2:23] lived in no other state than this one, such as Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Gideon, Samuel, David, Isaiah, and in the New Testament Peter, Paul, Philip, almost all the chosen ones of God altogether; also from the most virtuous daughters of both testaments Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, Rachel, Ruth, Anna, Judith, Esther, Elizabeth, and the mother of our Savior Jesus Christ, Mary, who alone in marriage was a unique eternal gate and virgin, as prophesied by Isaiah [7:14] and Ezekiel, so that we learn from this with certainty that there is no more virtuous, no more godly, no more friendly and delightful state than marriage. For what is so holy and virtuous, what is so virtuous and lovely, that these friends of God [James 2:23] did not know? If they had known a better and more blessed state before God, they would have accepted it. But they lived in marriage, so no one among Christians should let it be known that it is not a lovely godly state to be married.</p>
      <p>For first, one overcomes all evil unbelief and is obedient to God's commandments, which the flesh finds difficult; thus children are raised to God's honor and also to the benefit of people; one can freely run to God in need and say: Lord, I have kept Your will and Your commandments, therefore help, as You have truly promised! And here hope is practiced; if it goes well, there is gratitude, so that the mind always clings to God and He is loved with all the heart. When one is sick, sad, or happy, one always has a single eternal companion who shares love and sorrow with them. Just as a guild supports each other, one serves and helps the other, so there is also here an unending love, ready service, and unbreakable unity, upon which our God and Creator has also played and spoken, "the two shall be one flesh," so that where marriage is entered into with God, there an unspeakable joy also reigns in suffering and is never extinguished until God's trial etc. Of this only those who have experienced it or are taught in God's word and spirit know, that it is not appropriate here to write more about it.</p>
      <p>You say: Where are the happy married people who live in the fear of God, in joy and peace? It is nothing but all unrest, quarrels, and fights etc. - Look here and notice that there are still many pious people and, if God wills, they will increase daily, as we learn daily God's will through His word. The true believers look only to having a clear conscience and a peaceful heart, that is, that they are well reconciled with God and do not fear Him when He comes to reckon with them; that is the highest treasure we can have on earth. But where such a peaceful mind in God is not, nothing from outside can come to set such a person at peace, and if there is some unrest and discord in the world in the marital state, it is not the fault of marriage, but of the people who do not rightly accept such a high state. For there are marriages that are forced, so there are those that are entered into only for the sake of goods or out of affection, that is, out of foolishness; from there it comes that after the honeymoon there is no peace. Few are those who begin it with God and righteousness and even fewer who seek love, discipline, and the fear of God in it. What good can there be where there is no God? And from there it comes that young fools and often also old fools rely on inherited or acquired goods and do not stop until everything is lavishly consumed. There is then whoring, playing, drinking, quarreling, wanting, at home, however, with the wife grumbling, scolding, raging, beating, yes, also hunger, misery, poverty, and contempt. But since the majority in marriage seeks only their pleasure and benefit without God, it is no wonder if we see much displeasure in marriage at this time, for it cannot be otherwise that there is unity, love, and pleasure where there is no fear of God; since wealth, world, pleasure without God is nothing but hell here and eternal damnation there. It is undoubtedly the just punishment of our unbelief and unrighteous mind from God, for since we follow our temptations more than God's light and look more to nobility, wealth, splendor, pride, arrogance, wildness, than to virtue, fear of God, humility, loyalty, and discipline, it happens to us quite rightly that we live so unfriendly like unreasonable animals with each other; but where one takes the matter in hand with God, no state surpasses this one.</p>
      <p>But as I have seriously considered this and other things with myself for almost 3 years and have always found that it will remain so eternally and that it is not fitting for me to be free from God and the world, that I cannot find any other way to virtue from sins than the only one that God has ordained, Christ Jesus shows and that most of God's friends have walked. Moreover, my office of teaching compels me that my teaching is not spiritual and life is lavish, also many honorable people and those who have authority over me advising, it seemed necessary to me that I choose for myself a single and eternal companion with whom I may rightly accept this state. And although something was offered to me in between, which I was indeed not worthy of nor suitable for, I have nevertheless never (perhaps out of God's order) set my heart and mind on any of them, but you alone are the only one I have proposed to myself. God alone knows if you are ordained for me, and my choice is based on your speech and demeanor, so that I have imagined to myself that you are such a one in whom there is fear of God and discipline and with whom I could live in love and sorrow and in all that is God's will. Yet this partly depends on you, but more on God. Since I trust Him well, I have written this letter to also hear your will, to hear your state, whether it is found so and God our Creator would arrange that we enter into this friendly state with each other. In all this, may God's will be done [Mt 6:10], but it would also be an inequality if I demanded your will and being from you and you were not informed of mine, so I want to present to you all my being, in good hope, if you have any will towards me by God's ordinance, you would do the same and also strive for the truth, which I swear to you here with all loyalty.</p>
      <p>First of all, regarding my will towards you, you now well understand that if it could be arranged with both states, I would be inclined to you alone; for it is fitting that like comes to like, and this likeness does not lie in nobility and wealth, but primarily in the mind.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is such a state with me, and first of all, you are undoubtedly well aware of my homeland and my parents, that it needs no further writing; yet you would not look at my family, but at me, you would take me and not my family, although they are pious and honest people.</p>
      <p>I have never been ordained even with the least, not even the lowest ordination, I am free, not a serf of any lord, I am 23 years old, I am not indebted or bound to anyone on earth, like the unfree.</p>
      <p>I have also lived from childhood with God's help among people in such a way that I have never committed any dishonor anywhere, so that I do not need to go back to where I have come from, except where the gospel of Christ is hated, but this article of slander is not applicable, for Christ Himself is unjustly despised.</p>
      <p>God has also preserved and protected the health of my body in such a way that I have not had any significant illness for 20 years, nor have I ever been afflicted with any significant disease, and even today (God be my shield!) I am not subject to any illnesses, such as smallpox, madness, gout, dropsy, epilepsy, etc. I do have a weak sight from studying and at times a weak head, which also includes that I am sometimes quick-tempered and prone to anger, but not spiteful and quarrelsome, as I can well let go and soon forget, especially where one does not throw gunpowder at me.</p>
      <p>I also have no association with bad boys who would cause me to play, which I have never learned, or to drink and fight, which I abhor, or to whore, which I avoid for the sake of honor; I have no child of anyone, who would be a burden to me, nor am I bound to anyone in such a way that it would be a burden to you etc. I also have no other attachments.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have an old father over 60 years and a mother over 55 years, also a brother who is 8 years older than I. To him and me, they have bequeathed everything they have, which now amounts to about 1400 pounds, but with the condition that he be lord over it for his lifetime and if he should die before the mother, we would not let the mother lack anything.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have my home in our monastery and a good position; there I am accepted as one of the convent, where I teach. There or wherever I would be, I would take you to me etc.</p>
      <p>The wealth that I might inherit from my family and the position I now have are now certainly enough, but they could be weakened by accident (as all things), therefore I have another more certain treasure, which cannot fail, that is God; He has also given me skill (sense, understanding), which, if I practice it with loyalty, will certainly benefit me. Otherwise, it is far from me to sell the gifts of God; indeed, I know that God will not forsake me, whom I have as my God. For His prophet says: "I have been young and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his children begging bread." I write this only so that you do not think I want to attract you with my wealth. Whoever places all his trust in wealth and people is cursed [Jer 17:5] and has no heavenly God in his heart. Notice, so far all things in monasteries, where the Antichrist still reigns, have been considered certain and smooth, not wanting to trust rightly in God; if you also wanted to look at my prosperity here and not also expect what God would give you and me to suffer with time, that you could then freely rely on God, know that I would have little heart for you. "For whom God loves, He seeks" at times [Prov 3:12], and "all who desire to live godly" - writes Paul -, "will be persecuted" [2 Tim 3:12]. If you wanted to complain and be impatient, seeking only sweetness with me and not also trying the sour, it would not be fitting; it should be a life, a mourning, a joy. That I would like with you, what you with me, you know well yourself and to the benefit, that I write so freely. One must say a thing out loud so that no discord arises later. I would not reproach you for anything; I would also like to have that from you. It does not need much flattery and caressing, especially here, where one marries for the long year, where there is no separation afterwards. When one buys even a simple horse, one examines it thoroughly, how much more here, where there is no change and when the purchase already regrets one? In short, where there is fear of God and a mind that is well reconciled with God and can therefore hold together well and does not want, it easily bears everything that God imposes on it to suffer, and also gains enough honor and goods, and that with God. Where not, there even great inheritances are wasted with shame and sorrow.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, know that I am not in great debt or sureties, which I would like to pay off gently with 3 guilders. So I do not need to worry about clothes in the short term, since I do not soon give mine for 50 guilders. See, thus I give you my being truthfully in the major parts, so that you do not fear any deceit.</p>
      <p>Also know that I have dedicated my office of teaching (with which I deal with you very usefully) life and limb, that if necessity, truth, and God our Lord demanded it, I would leave my skin for the truth. From there I also take the morning gift, which I would give you and likewise with the patriarch Abraham etc., to commend you to God and say: "God of heaven and earth" [Gen 24:3 and others], God, who has given us all soul and body, be your treasure and your comfort in Christ Jesus our Lord. May He not forsake you, as He has never forsaken me, and enlighten you with His spirit, that you may know Him rightly, cling to Him eternally, and bear it patiently if I had to suffer death for His name's sake etc.</p>
      <p>If God also gives us children and grants us life, we would manage the household in such a way that we raise them to the honor of our God and to be honest people. But if we had to leave them, I know that the Lord our God would not forsake them, who so well raises so many useless mocking birds, yes, wonderfully nourishes harmful animals.</p>
      <p>But what need is there for many words? In summary, this is the greatest and most certain treasure you will find with me: fear of God, piety, loyalty, love, which I can lay upon you exceedingly well, work, earnestness, diligence, that we lack nothing in time. So you see here before your eyes, if you would bear the sour as well as the sweet with me, how you would have me. Otherwise, I do not tell you of high nobility and many thousands of guilders, but I know well that nothing will be lacking for necessity. And Paul says: "We have brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out. Therefore, if we have food and clothing, it is enough." If wealth is added (as God has never denied anyone), it is a duty and a task.</p>
      <p>So you have heard my will, my being, and state so far, all presented with truth, without falsehood. Now I also hope from you, if you have any inclination, that you would also give me your will to understand, in writing or as it seems convenient and good to you; that is in summary, if you could live in love and sorrow under my loyalty and protection in the order of God, if you could change your state without conscience (qualms), if you have a heart to have a household and be prudent (thrifty), if you are of good health and how and what you are bound to your mother and your brother. So I ask you to show me all things as truthfully as you see that I have shown them to you. But consider well that you do not do anything out of temptation, and say it freely, do not be ashamed, it is nothing dishonorable, and tell no one but me. Now I have trusted you and revealed all my secrets to you. Also know that I do not want to catch you in your words, I confirm this with this letter. Be free, for I do not want to have spoken myself herewith, since I have only wanted to converse with you with this letter; therefore the writings, which are written to prevent all deceit, should not deceive or catch themselves. Accordingly, we will first give the promise and decision answer when we both hear what will and how we are for each other. You already have my will, so you can perceive from the above-mentioned articles whether I am for you and wait only for yours.</p>
      <p>Here I also know well now that you will hesitate behind this matter and think you are not wise enough to answer, therefore you might do something out of fear and shame that you would regret later. Therefore, notice the following. First, you understand well what I have written to you, that is the truth, so you know well with yourself to some extent how it is with you, secondly, what you can do well; what need is there for much advice? Read the letter 3 or 4 times, remind yourself of it, pray to God that He gives you His will to understand. Now no one is more obliged to you than you are to yourself; so you will marry yourself, it is only about you. Where people do not know each other and one does not know the states, much advice is needed, but here you hear my state and know me. 2. Do not be so foolish and senseless that you now take something out of worry. I can well recognize that you are young, you are frightened and perhaps imagine in such worries that you do not want to leave the monastery and always remain so, without a man. Beware, that would indeed be a temptation and could soon regret you badly. Notice, you are young, so God has not given you such an unfit body and created you without doubt not to be my gracious lady (nun) forever and do nothing or bear no fruit from you.</p>
      <p>Dear, read Paul in 1. Epistle to Timothy 2. chapter [9ff]; you will find in what you must be saved. It would indeed be a foolish undertaking (unless you have the high gift of purity forever), if you wanted to bury your young body between the walls. Here I ask you to consider this matter carefully and let everyone say what they want. Look to God, to His word, why you are created, what is the salvation of your body and soul, also that you are mortal, not long on earth. Beware, beware, my dear, that you do not live in sorrow forever! Dear, say, can you, why women's monasteries were originally established. Not that young women and daughters, who are otherwise good elsewhere, are raised there, but the old, incapable poor. You are too young and too capable. Read Paul 1. Tim. 5 [11ff], so understand also what is presented to you here. If I thought little of myself, that a Greti village gossip, a peasant woman, would be so little for you a rough craftsman or peasant. So I do not require from you to hoe, root, but what is fitting for you, to have a household, to be prudent etc. and what is for women. Although in the short term perhaps not much household would be needed, I would be there, but it might happen with time that we come elsewhere and no longer have the table as there, of which we would talk well etc. Here also remember how a godly lovely thing it is when two are one with each other, one wants well for the other and is capable of the other, also how it is a bitter miserable life when two do not get along well with each other and how not every time finds its place etc. All this I write to you for your good, that you consider it well and do not say out of fear or shame what is not in your heart, yes, you want to remain so, and yet knowingly carry something else in you. Who knows if perhaps for your worry, fear, and shame God has given you cause here with me to open yourself freely and to free yourself, so that you do not have to lock your young life in the prison without fruit. It is indeed a great thing to have cause and to pay attention to time, that we accept everything in its time, when it fits, if not always proposals are there that fit us, and yet in the end great regret remains when we have overlooked the opportunity. All this now stands towards you, for I do not want to have either loved or led you herewith, but I only say this so that you consider well, consider God, His word, your soul's salvation. What God then gives you, do that; you will always have me unangered, only let me know an answer.</p>
      <p>And if you still have no will at all, I ask you through loyalty, through love and honor that I grant (give) and have for you, that you honor me in this small matter and let no one see this letter, tell no one anything about it, but return it to me and see that I have sought your honor and not shame. I have trusted you with silence, all honor and good, therefore I wanted to deal with you in writing, I have also told no one else on earth about it; it must also remain so further, until its time. I could have done it orally, but I know where such things, I could not have done it. The other, who is with you, if she had become aware of it, would she not also have come to it, you know yourself that she would have hated you for it. I have also wanted to spare yours and mine, have chosen no intermediary; yours, so that no outcry would arise for you, but mine, if it did not succeed for me, that those who I did not want to take would not rejoice. Therefore spare mine, for I have also spared yours. Remember: "What comes out of the other's mouth does not remain silent." But if I understood your will and we could become one, I would then like to acquire friendship with yours, so with distinguished people, that they could not oppose it, but all with your advice. So write to me also how it is with your mother, you will always find me willing. I think, what I do not create with you myself, no one else would create. I trust you with much good, therefore, if you have any inclination, keep this letter well with you, that you keep it with you when you come to me. Answer me soon. In all things, may God's will be done [Mt 6:10]; may He enlighten you to accept what is the salvation of your soul etc.</p>
      <p>Given on Monday after Michaelmas in the year 1527.</p>
      <p>You know my hand, so my name is not necessary. What I deal with you is truth without falsehood.</p>
      <p>H. B.</p>
      <p>Act wisely in silence and trust me, for I have trusted you first. God be with you.</p>
      <p>With my own hand and seal.</p>
