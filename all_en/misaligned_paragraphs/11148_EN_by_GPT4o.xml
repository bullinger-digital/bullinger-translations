    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not responded for a long time to Bullinger's letter [No. 1053] and his criticism of the letter [by Capito and Bucer] to Luther, as he himself prefers personal conversation to correspondence. Maintains that Euander did wrong by making their letter accessible to the people of Zurich. Denies having cast [the Swiss] in an unfavorable light with Luther. It is evident that some of them attribute too much authority to Zwingli and Oecolampadius. The reference to their timidity was necessary to explain their reservations. It is not so much Luther, but rather some Swiss who are oversensitive; nevertheless, Bucer has already recommended them to the Wittenbergers earlier. Reconciliation is only possible if they are also willing to admit mistakes; in any case, he considers their reticence inappropriate. Laments the refusal of a meeting where [the people of Strasbourg] could refute the accusation of obscuring the doctrine of the Lord's Supper; one speaks appropriately about this mystery by adhering to the words of institution, according to which Christ offers himself with bread and wine. More emphatic expressions, which prevent a merely symbolic interpretation, are harmless if properly explained; although the presence of Christ is only comprehensible in faith, the traditional terms used to speak of it are not unclear - provided that there is true agreement on the matter. The refusal to discuss it remains incomprehensible. Bucer disapproves of the desire to be excessively praised in front of Luther. Denies the accusation of having reinterpreted Luther's view towards them. Has never claimed a complete agreement of the Concord with Zwingli's doctrine, as the latter is partly in clear contradiction to the [First Helvetic] Confession. Maintains that Bullinger and Jud pushed for the long letter to Luther to facilitate their approval, but denies discrediting them with this statement. By stating that the Concord depends on the confession of the true presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, he has not introduced a new condition, nor with the request for signing the Wittenberg Articles. In no way have the Swiss been allowed to simply stick to Zwingli's teaching; this would make the Concord impossible. It is also not true that their doctrine has not changed since Zwingli. Their unconditional approval [of the Wittenberg Concord] would not have offended anyone. Zwingli's doctrine, despite its support from Augustine, cannot satisfy; like Zwingli, [the people of Strasbourg] have also fought papist errors too one-sidedly, while greater danger threatens from the disdain of the office. In view of their disagreements, the refusal of a meeting is incomprehensible. If Bullinger already approves of Melanchthon's "Loci" doctrine of the Lord's Supper, then why not also his [Augsburg] Confession? Bucer insists that Bullinger once also approved of his ["Report from the Holy Scripture"]. Deepens his criticism of the publication of the letters of Oecolampadius and Zwingli and again refers to Bullinger's statements; much in these letters is incompatible with the [First Helvetic] Confession. The letter from Leo [Jud] that arrived the day before also questions much that seemed resolved; regarding his own conduct in Bern and his catechism revision, Bucer is not aware of any guilt. Summarizes his position and again offers to account before a theological convention. Leaves [the people of Zurich] to judge their Lord's Supper liturgy. In response to the letter of October 15 [No. 1055], describes how Euander came into possession of the letter to Luther, gladly acknowledges Bullinger's favorable remark about the Württemberg churches, and suspects that the harsh words of the people of Zurich are based on misinformation about the events in Bern. The resistance to a true Concord could be detrimental to them.</p>

      <p>Grace and steadfast commitment to unity in the Lord.</p>
      <p>We received a letter from you some time ago, in which you excuse Euander for our letter to Luther being stolen and shared with you, and you indicate what particularly displeases you in that letter. We seemed to be able to take some time to respond without offending you, since you expressed so late what in our letter troubled you. Therefore, we prioritized the affairs of the church over this response, as we seemed to undertake them with greater hope of fruit. For we have learned enough from so many writings exchanged back and forth how it is not granted to us in these times to express our opinions to each other through letters. Therefore, while the Lord has not yet instilled in you the spirit to meet and discuss such great controversies in the example of all the saints, we had decided to engage less in writing, and this was also the reason for our delay. Now we have decided to respond because many report that Satan is working very hard there to alienate your minds or at least some among you from us. Therefore, I beseech you in the Lord, just as you rightly advised us to receive your writing with a candid spirit, so you, in turn, strive to apply candor and a friendly heart everywhere in reading our letters.</p>
      <p>Regarding Euander's action, I ask you to make a just judgment. He obtained a copy of the letter we gave to Luther by giving his word that he would not copy it, from a good young man to whom we can safely entrust all our matters, so that he could have the opportunity to read it. However, he copied it and sent you a copy. Thus, against our will, he obtained our letter through deceit and fraud and sent it to you as if it were his own property.</p>
      <p>I ask you, as a doctor of the gospel of Christ and true humanity, whether you approve of this. However, I have forgiven him in the Lord, although I tried to make him acknowledge at Campodunum that stealing others' letters is unworthy of a Christian. For even among Christians, the right to secrecy should prevail, as often even the best words and deeds, if known by anyone, can cause harm due to our weakness. He, however, could hardly be brought to acknowledge his fault, perhaps encouraged by your authority, who defend this action.</p>
      <p>We are amazed at the reasons you use to defend this, allow me to speak the truth, theft, if you reconsider and weigh them in the balance of judgment; for if anyone used them against your opinion, I have no doubt you would judge them unworthy of a serious man and theologian. "If you acted candidly," you say, "you owe thanks to Euander, who made it known to friends; if not, you should accuse yourself, not him." So, my Bullinger, since it is so, will it be allowed to break faith and secretly copy and share friends' letters against their will with whomever one wishes, and thereby gratify or benefit them? Then do you judge that every good deed should be proclaimed everywhere and by anyone, or every evil deed exposed? We do not wish to burden you with more on a matter well known to you. Your other argument seems equally firm: "Euander owes us much; therefore, it is his duty to indicate both harmful and beneficial things." But, my brother, with perfidy and injury to others? If he is a Christian, he owes us the utmost faith and friendship. And undoubtedly, if we even had a son with you, you would not judge it appropriate for him to report to us whatever he judged would be beneficial or harmful to us, especially if you did not say or write that it should be reported to me.</p>
      <p>You also err in thinking that the copy was obtained through another or previously circulated and read by many; it was communicated to very few and only to those we wanted to share it with. How much inconvenience it caused by being sent to you, not to us, which perhaps matters little, but rather to you and even to the churches themselves, we do not need to say, as you yourself testify more than enough about it. Bitter suspicions and such sinister judgments among brothers are rightly counted among the greatest inconveniences for Christians. We have experienced enough of how some used this weapon to cause harm in Bern. But I, after this happened, accepted it as a benefit from the Lord, testified to Euander that it was a wrongdoing, and forgave all the blame.</p>
      <p>Nor did we say anything else about this matter in Bern than that it is contrary to the candor of brothers to use letters stolen by theft against us, which Theodosius considered a capital offense, as Jerome mentions. I urge you by Christ to judge this action as you would if it had been committed against you as it was against us, indeed as it is appropriate to judge a matter done with lies and fraud against the laws of charity. I do not allow my children to report to me what humanity commands to keep secret, much less would I tolerate them bringing me anything obtained by theft and lies. Let this suffice about Euander's case, whom I embrace in the Lord all the more truly - and I do embrace him very truly - the more I wish him not to commit anything like this in the future, even if it seems to him that the greatest benefit would come to me from it.</p>
      <p>In our letter to Luther, the first thing you disapprove of is that I seemed to you to have acted contemptuously and coldly on behalf of the most deserving brothers, whom I should have commended to you beyond measure and insinuated above measure. I, my brother, have always commended you and your churches to Luther in such a way that I testify before Christ, our judge, that I have never had any consciousness of neglect or coldness, but often of greater zeal and warmth than appropriate, nor did I undertake to commend you for the first time in this letter, but rather to defend you, lest you seem to respond malignantly to our most ample commendations with your writing.</p>
      <p>Although, if these are not enough for you: that there are many among your people who teach and confirm everything rightly with the utmost zeal for Christ, that there is a great abundance of truly good and wise people among you, and that the leading churchmen who gathered at the first Basel convention earnestly desire to achieve concord, I wonder what more your modesty could require.</p>
      <p>Was I to deny that there are also bad and weak people among you? And since you receive the truth of Christ in the words of scripture and the fathers so timidly, and also of Oecolampadius and Zwingli themselves, and you deal with a sharp man who can be taught about any matter with few words, which I knew would be received in various ways, was I not to provide some reason for this hesitation, trepidation, and caution? And on whom did it fit to place this cause other than on the bad and weak, on whom you yourselves placed it when we examined this very long writing in Basel? How many things have we always acknowledged in Luther and his fellow ministers and churches that need to be reproved among you, content to assert that they are held by a true zeal for Christ and do not believe about the sacraments what you falsely believed; beyond or above this manner, we have never undertaken to commend and insinuate them to you. You should have considered, excellent men, that what is to be sought from others is what you strive to convey to others. We testify before Christ: If we have not commended you to Luther and others above what is appropriate, certainly we have not stopped below what is appropriate.</p>
      <p>But let us examine those things by which we seem to you to have either omitted or diminished just commendation. The first is that we wrote to Luther that we cited the authority of Zwingli and Oecolampadius in the exposition of the Wittenberg Articles to "remove the obstacle to receiving the truth, which we feared would not be in vain due to the excessive admiration of Zwingli and Oecolampadius." These are our words. To these, you add: "As if indeed our famous churches, planted and confirmed by the blood of saints, have hitherto been in the darkness of lies, and those who have migrated in the mists of errors, who have hitherto slumbered in the doctrine received among us." I ask you, my Bullinger, does this inference seem to you to agree with your candor? Have we, therefore, from this statement of ours, condemned the blood of martyrs and the faith of the rest of the saints and accused the famous churches of lies and impious doctrine? For us, the truth is not empty and meaningless symbols in the holy supper, but that Christ himself is also offered. For us, the truth is that this truth, which I have just professed, is aptly expressed in the words of the holy fathers and our Wittenberg Articles. Finally, we do not doubt that it is true that Luther does not believe any of the things attributed to him in the writings of Oecolampadius and Zwingli, I mean those that detract from the true human nature in Christ, his heavenly glory, and the office of salvation. Now we have discovered not a few among you who acknowledge nothing in the holy supper but the symbols of the absent Christ and attribute to Luther an opinion about the presence of the Lord in the supper, which leaves neither the human nature nor the heavenly glory nor the office of the savior to Christ, and these people held this opinion without any reason or scripture, nor did they offer any other reason for their belief than that Zwingli and Oecolampadius taught so. From these, we have led not a few to the side of truth when we showed that Zwingli and Oecolampadius thought differently. Therefore, we rightly testified before Luther that we mentioned the agreement of Zwingli and Oecolampadius in our exposition to remove the obstacle to receiving the truth, which we offered in the cause of concord, because we did not fear without reason that the excessive admiration of Zwingli and Oecolampadius would hinder us in this cause. Which is indeed excessive if some rely more on their authority than on divine scriptures and reason, of whom there are not a few, especially in the cause of the Eucharist, if you deny this, I will admit that I wrote poorly. We indeed do not ignore how easily we have approved our words about the Eucharist to most when we showed that everything is read in the writings of Zwingli and Oecolampadius, which were previously judged very absurd and unbearable. And those who oppose concord today hinder it as much as they boast that Zwingli taught otherwise, Oecolampadius otherwise, that Luther wrote otherwise, that he did not rashly refuse to admit the confession of the people of Strasbourg and the Lutherans. Therefore, fearing this excessive admiration of Zwingli and Oecolampadius among most, lest it hinder the truth to be admitted in concord both about the cause itself and about the words in which this mystery should be preached, and finally about the opinion and mind of Luther, we gladly used the authority of both for the truth among you. What harm is there now that we also wrote the same to Luther? And what consequence do you draw from this that we either feel or say that your famous churches are in the darkness of lies and that those who have migrated in the mists of errors, who have hitherto slumbered in the doctrine received among you? Although we have not denied that those who slumbered in the opinion that the holy supper is empty symbols of the absent Christ have slumbered in error. But to those who truly believe in Christ, neither this nor other errors are imputed to condemnation. But neither does it follow that if a church is planted and confirmed by the blood of saints, it cannot err in anything; otherwise, Rome would be the most holy. We also gladly hear from you about the blood of the saints, but we consider it to be referred to the glory of Christ, so that it is not magnified everywhere. The Lord knows how much these two men, whom we are discussing, mean to us, how much your churches and you mean to us; yet we must honor the truth above all and regard these ministers of truth, your churches, and you yourselves, while also considering others in their own place and number.</p>
      <p>The second point of this accusation is that you write that we take away your judgment and attribute obstinacy and a preposterous affectation of constancy. We did not write in such a way that your candor should have inferred this so broadly. Wanting to repeat the reason why you sent such long speeches and made so many exceptions to the impanation of Christ, local presence, etc., which Luther, because he never felt that way, rightly bears with difficulty being attributed to him, even indirectly, we wrote that you considered your people, who are not of such subtle but rather obstinate judgment, and also yourselves, while you shudder more than enough to agree with the papists, often seeking a knot in a bulrush and hesitating to simply admit formulas that are otherwise entirely sound. We immediately added the honest cause of this horror and hesitation, "lest you seem to affix salvation again to ministers, words, or symbols," etc. This is how our words are. Is this simply taking away your judgment, attributing obstinacy? In our letter, you read: "who are not of such subtle but rather obstinate judgment." We attribute judgment, not take it away, but not as subtle as obstinate. We do not attribute obstinacy with any word, and candor will not interpret obstinate judgment as obstinacy. How often have I heard you testify the same about your people? How many times have we testified that such a verbose exposition, so many and so often repeated exceptions, cannot be conveniently received by Luther and his churches, because they are too manifestly an argument that you do not trust either us or Luther well, and also that they would cast suspicion on you, as if you were preparing escapes from the truth you confessed through those exceptions, to retreat whenever you pleased. For if you had believed us testifying about Luther's opinion, you could have testified with much fewer and simpler words that you agree with Luther and approve the opinion, if not the words, of the Wittenberg Articles.</p>
      <p>What then did you think we should do? Did you want us to write openly to Luther: "They fear lest they be circumvented by you and us and ensnared by some verbal tricks, so that we may boast with their and their churches' ruin that they have defected from their doctrine to ours, and therefore they judged it necessary to fortify their writing to you with so many exceptions and cautious interpretations"? If we had written this to Luther, we would indeed have written the truth, as far as many are concerned; but how would that have benefited concord? Therefore, since you yourselves, both the legates and the churchmen who were in Basel when that writing was examined, repeatedly said: "We have a harsh people; they must be prudently handled, lest they think we are relapsing into papist abominations; they cannot grasp those subtle and acute things," it seemed to us that we would best serve both truth and humanity in this matter if we rendered this cause, which you yourselves brought forward, to Luther as the cause of such multiple and long interpretations and cautions, given to your people, who are not of such subtle but rather obstinate judgment - judgment, however, not error or obstinacy. Thus, neither does that about the lack of judgment and preposterous affectation of constancy apply to all, as you mention it. For our words are: "There is a lack of judgment among many, and in this people especially a preposterous affectation of constancy." We write "among many," not "among all." But what need is there for words? Some cause had to be given for such cautious, suspended, and hesitant writing, which suspension, caution, and hesitation could not be approved by us, as it also displeased many among you, as you know. Now our conscience reproached us for placing this whole cause on your people, it compelled us to add, but as humanely as we could, the cause we discovered in you, namely that you shun too much from appearing to agree with the papists, and fear for yourselves from otherwise sound formulas, lest you seem to affix salvation again to external things. Hence it happens that you ministers often seek a knot in a bulrush. For we judged and still judge your anxiety in interpreting and fortifying your position in this matter to be entirely superfluous. For before the Lord, we know Luther so well and are so conscious of ourselves that you do not need to act with such caution with us. But that you should use it for your people, as we have always acknowledged to be the cause, we did not see enough cause from this. For both the people of Basel and that most learned and holy Vadianus, to say nothing of the people of Mulhouse, did not think it necessary or useful to act with Luther with such a long writing and so cautiously rather than appropriately to the matter. These things, I beseech you, my Bullinger, consider with just judgment and compare them with what has been done between us; then you will see how you could have complained more mildly when you wrote that you are called imprudent by us with a remarkable diminution of the estimation of your name, as those who often seek a knot in a bulrush and who compose long speeches. What, I ask you, brother, is there in our words that so remarkably diminishes the estimation of your name? Where do we call you imprudent, who testify that there has been too much prudence and caution in you?</p>
      <p>The words you add here, I recognize as more words of anger than judgment; therefore, I will pass over them briefly, except to say once that it is also to be said about what is the simple, plain, and clear way of speaking in the church about the mysteries of Christ. You call Luther an irritable man; but this man, I testify to Jesus Christ, in this cause of concord, whatever he may have been in contention and may be otherwise, we have found much less irritable than most among you. Then I also require candor here, that you seem to acknowledge no other commendation of yours to Luther made by us than what is in this letter, in which, as we said, it was more necessary to sustain the commendations we had previously made of you and your churches both in person and by letters.</p>
      <p>It also seems strange to us that you, otherwise prudent and experienced men, do not more rightly consider what is the duty of one who seeks to reconcile those who are at odds with each other. You certainly would not have tolerated nor do you tolerate today if we had undertaken or were undertaking to excuse and praise everything about Luther, acknowledging no fault or sin in him. Therefore, excellent brothers, allow us to also desire some things in you and to acknowledge about you to him with whom you will never be able to agree solidly unless you acknowledge some faults on both sides and forgive each other. And if you could have taken it well that the people of Basel judged with the people of Mulhouse and St. Gallen that your speeches were longer and more cautious than necessary, what great, I ask you, insult, what great injury to your reputation is it that we acknowledged and wrote the same to Luther, that you often seek a knot in a bulrush? We wrote "often," not "always," although, if we must confess what we feel, you do this too much and often and anxiously even today. We wish with you, my brother, that we do not trust too much in our subtle judgment nor, thus deficient in just simplicity and constancy, are gradually carried away into inextricable perplexities of things and words. You recognize your words, we the figure. You want your caution in the writing to Luther to be applied to this, that you give a clear and perspicuous testimony of the truth to posterity and provide no occasion for error or new contention. Excellent men, it was not about testifying or commending this matter to posterity, but about your and Luther's agreement privately and with us interceding, to whom you could safely and should have trusted, if you had held us in the place you should have. However, it was carefully provided that nothing about our concord should be published until the agreement on both sides was fully established and the very formula of testifying was agreed upon between both parties. And since nothing but truth can follow from truth, there was no need to fear that anything false could be deduced from a few and simply given truths.</p>
      <p>But let it be about your writing as you please. For our part, you may have it as beautiful and perfect as you wish, however the midwife may judge better of the infant than the mother. We have always allowed you to judge our writings and deeds as it seemed to you; allow us the same, at least about those of your writings that you have entrusted to us to commend to others. In the cause of Christ and to such a minister of Christ, it could have been permissible to overlook many things, but not all. How much we wish that you would make your judgments about our writings with the same caution and sincerity in your letters, which you send to various places, with which caution and sincerity we made this judgment about your writing.</p>
      <p>I come, therefore, to that accusation which your people very eagerly and among many impute to us, of obscuring and involving the truth in subtleties in the mystery of the Eucharist. In which I wish you would finally remember what is fitting for you and what we deserve, and what is also beneficial to the churches of Christ: And since it has seemed altogether impious to accuse us of this error or attempt so harshly and so generally, we wish you would finally set a day for us before some assembly of brothers and also hear our defense, and not perpetually assume the role of both accusers and judges against those absent and unheard, which we have so often asked and implored you by Christ; but you have not yet deemed us worthy of any response to that petition. But to the matter: What will you finally call speaking about the mysteries of Christ clearly and perspicuously, simply and plainly? What obscurely, darkly, perplexedly, and obliquely or, if you prefer, tortuously? We indeed consider it right, simple, sincere, open, and clear in handling divine mysteries if we express them in their own words with their genuine understanding and admit nothing either remote from the use of the saints or inverted, twisted, and obscured by some untimely composition, translation, or even interpretation. Let us now establish what that matter is about which we are disputing its proper explanation. For us, it is a certain secret and heavenly presentation and communication of our Lord Jesus Christ, God and man, to his saints, which is made with the sacred ministry in words and symbols, particularly the words and symbols of the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>This, I say, is the matter about which we are disputing its proper explanation; it is in vain if we do not agree on this very matter among ourselves. We do not doubt that Christians ought to believe that this presentation and communication of our Lord in the holy supper is truly and really made. If it seems otherwise to you, now the dispute is about the matter, not about words or speech, as we have often said. If you feel and judge the same, that the Lord himself is presented to us in the holy supper and we become partakers of him, as you have testified in so many assemblies and even in published books, let us see by what speech and words this opinion can be openly and clearly said and written. The matter is secret and heavenly, which cannot be understood or named by any human by the light of nature. Therefore, it is fitting to seek proper words and a rightly fitting speech for this matter from the Lord, not from man. If we listen to the Lord, he speaks of this matter with his own mouth, offering bread and wine: "Take, eat, drink; this is my body, this is my blood" [Mt 26:26-28 par]. If we accept these words simply, as is fitting, what else shall we say the Lord offers here than perception, for he says "take," eating, for he says "eat," and drinking, for he says "drink," and the perception, eating, drinking of his one and true body and blood. For he added: "which is given for you" [1 Cor 11:24], "which is poured out for you" [Mt 26:28 par]. And since the body and blood of the Lord, both when he first delivered these and today, were and are living body and living blood and therefore not only united with the soul but also with the word - for the word became flesh [John 1:14] - what else shall we confess than that in the holy supper Christ himself, God and man, is offered, so that the saints truly perceive, eat, and drink him - for these are true and real works of Christ - and receive, eat, and drink with bread and wine. For offering bread and wine, he said: "Take, eat," etc. Hence Paul called the bread we break the communion of the body and the cup we drink the communion of the blood, not of bread and wine. For what was evident to the senses, the preacher of faith was silent about, what was to be perceived by faith, he expressed. Otherwise, this is the communion of both things, earthly and heavenly, that is, both of bread and wine and of the body and blood of the Lord; therefore, it is also given and received. For we do not admit that about the assembly and panegyric, as neither Oecolampadius nor any of the fathers admitted. From these words of the Lord, which he spoke to us with his own and the apostle's mouth, we can learn nothing else than that he calls that secret presentation and communication of himself, which he offers and grants in the holy supper, the acceptance, eating, drinking of his body and blood and therefore of his whole self, and, as the apostle interpreted these, the communion, which we perceive with bread and wine, the symbols of this communion, in the holy supper. And the communion, which all the holy fathers, without exception, interpret as that communion by which he lives in us, we in him [John 6:56], by which we are his members, of his flesh and bones [Eph 5:30], etc., by which we live his life. If, moreover, no one could properly name and express the matter we are discussing than the Lord, the proper words and proper expression of this mystery are those words and that expression we have just mentioned. These are also so customary among all the saints. Therefore, to speak about this mystery in this way is to speak about it simply, purely, and clearly. In the words "eat" and "drink" there is either a translation or a metonymy or rather both tropes; but even translated and renamed, they are proper if they are peculiarly significant. However, it would be impious to say that we can speak more significantly about these matters than the Lord, whether we use simple or translated or denominated words.</p>
      <p>Now it is not allowed to call anything else customary in the church than what the apostles and the purer church, which was in the time of the martyrs and fathers, used. Therefore, it is properly and clearly said that the Lord Jesus is given and received with the sacred symbols. For these things are said and done today in the supper of the saints with no less efficacy than they were said and done in the first supper. For our Lord is no less present to his saints now than he was then, nor are his words, which the saints hear from the mouth of the minister as the words of the Lord, less than those he himself spoke with his own mouth.</p>
      <p>Now let us see about the added words, if perhaps we corrupt and distort the purity and simplicity already mentioned with them. We say that the Lord Jesus is given, received, and therefore also held and truly present to his own in the holy supper; for it is impious to think anything fictitious here. There are those who add "really," "substantially," "corporally," "carnally," which they say and want to be understood in this sense that the Lord is perceived here in reality, not only in imagination or by the mere representation of empty symbols, himself in his own substance, in his own body, in his own flesh, not for himself, for his own substance, body, flesh, empty symbols of these, nor can we condemn or reject these additions. And those who use these words, we acknowledge them to use and speak piously and religiously, provided they also sufficiently explain their pious and religious sense with which they use these words. Therefore, the purity and simplicity that is in the words of the Lord is not contaminated or violated, neither by what we add for the sake of explanation nor by what those we defend with the holy fathers add.</p>
      <p>But since there are unlearned people and, through papists and other unfit handlers of divine matters, led into false opinions about these words of the Lord, they do not understand the pure and simple words of the Lord purely and simply and conceive an opinion unworthy of Christ by "exhibiting," "perceiving," and "eating" Christ with bread and wine, as if he is held there locally, becomes food for the stomach, is impaned, and other things of this kind. Therefore, we diligently counter these false opinions with suitable explanations of all these things. We explicitly testify that bread and wine remain in themselves and their nature what they are; that the Lord Jesus remains in heaven and is not drawn back into this world, remains free from all mixture with bread or inclusion in bread and from all action of our body and the whole world; that the minister does nothing by himself, but everything through the Lord, indeed the Lord acts through the minister; yet the Lord is truly here, speaks, acts, and truly offers and communicates himself to us, but in a manner not of this world, but heavenly, but divine. Therefore, this communication of Christ is understood and felt not by reason or sense, but by faith alone. It is a matter of the new testament, the work of Christ reigning in heaven as true God and true man, but who acts in that condition which is outside and above the world and above all heavens and cannot be enclosed in any categories of predicaments, which "eye has not seen, ear has not heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man" [1 Cor 2:9], hence it cannot be explained by human words. These things, I confess, seem obscure, involved, perplexed to the natural man; for he cannot understand the things of the Spirit of God, nor can he suspect where Christ dwells, "who ascended above all heavens" [Eph 4:10]. He includes everything in places, times, and other bodily conditions and cannot at all know the state of resurrection. But faith constantly adheres to the word of the Lord and surpasses the weakness of the natural man, who certainly cannot understand that a man exalted above all heavens acts here in our souls. For he restores all things in heaven and on earth as mediator and man, not only as God, and thus he is with us until the end of the age. "I," he says, "am with you" [Mt 28:20], not only my spirit or my divinity, however, as some fathers are wont to write, he is not present to us according to the human nature, that is, the condition of the present life, but according to the divinity, that is, the condition of the future life and divine. They do not say that God is present, man is not present, but that Christ, God and man, is present, truly according to the divine nature, not the human, that is, according to the condition of the divine, not the human. If these things seem obscure, perplexed, involved to you, and whatever you wish to call them, it was your duty in the Lord to convene, set a day for us, hear us at length about each of these things, examine the scripture, pray to the Lord to impart his sense. We, as we have testified, when we use the words of the Lord, do not doubt that we use proper and pure words, and with these very words the better church has always used, as indeed piety demanded, also customary ones. Finally, when we diligently remove the false understanding of these words, which either the flesh itself or the antichrist suggests, we seem to omit nothing, but that these words of the Lord are rightly understood by others. Now rhetoricians judge that speech to be clear and perspicuous, which consists of proper, significant, customary words and is suitably adapted to the capacity of those with whom you communicate it. But if your opinion is, of which you certainly make me doubt and myself at times, that in the holy supper not the Lord himself is perceived, but for him bread and wine, symbols of the absent thing - only in memory and contemplation present - and that here only bread and wine, not also the body and blood of the Lord, are given with the symbols and perceived as κοινωνία, that is, communion, participation, and common enjoyment, certainly our words are alien to this opinion, and if they are accommodated to it, we admit they would not be proper or customary, and therefore we ourselves acknowledge they would be obscure and inept. But then the dispute will be about the matter, not about the ways of speaking among us.</p>
      <p>We have undertaken to explain these things here, so that, if nothing else, we may at least give you the opportunity to consider a little more carefully how far this matter extends and how worthy it is of more serious examination. Since we have not yet been able to obtain this from you, however earnestly we have sought it from you, we are certainly not worthy to be so infamously accused by you everywhere of weaving enigmas to the offense of the simple, being carried away into inextricable perplexities of things and words, and attempting to lead all churches into these. For it was entirely your part, after you think so of us, by the example of all the saints and the most certain law of charity, to hear us on a set day about all these things and to judge us justly, either condemning or absolving us after hearing. In this matter, how much you offend the Lord and how much you harm the present and future churches, we fear that the Lord will show you with some severe chastisement. You rightly do not ignore how the Lord does not bear us striving and trusting in ourselves under his name. But whether it is not striving and trusting in oneself to fight so much for a renewed way of discussing the most holy mystery of the Eucharist and to pertinaciously oppose the way of commending it, which the scriptures and the fathers have handed down and the better church has always religiously used, and not to be persuaded to examine such a matter with brothers with worthy treatment? May the Lord grant his spirit, who may also teach you in this matter what is duty and what truly edifies.</p>
      <p>But let us return to your letter, the rest of which we will go through as briefly as possible. You seem to have provided enough reason to judge that we commended you and your cause to Luther more coldly, and you add a formula of commendation that we should have used. In which there is the highest commendation of the ministers and churches of the Swiss, finally also of the most sincere faith of all, likewise about the great increase and zeal for the gospel among you, etc.; you recognize your words. Earlier, my brother, we testified that long before we gave this letter to Luther, we had most diligently made a commendation of you, if not truly greater, yet certainly equal, to Luther both in words and writings. If you do not sustain believing this, it is well that Christ here bears witness to us and our conscience. But why do you demand that the most sincere faith of all, the great increase, and great zeal be proclaimed about you, likewise why that bulrush of ours pricked you so much and the long speeches disturbed you so much, we greatly wonder, since it is the duty of all of us to glory only in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, and since you would never endure with an even mind that such great praises be conveyed to Luther and others. Moderate things are more fitting for Christians and more stable, nor can we with a sound conscience attribute to you the most sincere faith of all, whose faith certainly could easily be shown to have its own leaven adhering, if it were fitting and you could endure to hear it with a Christian mind. Then if we attribute to you the most sincere faith of all, you easily see how much we detract from other churches; for we think that you claim the most sincere faith of all because you profess the purest and most solid doctrine of all. But in this matter, not so many churches agree with your opinion.</p>
      <p>But let us pass to what follows. We struggle with ourselves because we testified in the Basel convention that we would certainly explain Luther's opinion and yet in the letter we ask Luther's pardon for accommodating this explanation to the weakness of your people, which none of you asked of us, but rather that we explain Luther's very sense. But we (as you indeed take and amplify our words) write to Luther that we were asked by you to accommodate ourselves to your weakness and to grant some things. If, as charity dictates, you had labored more to take our letter in a better part than a worse, you would not make this objection. You are the chief one who asked us to adapt the exposition of the articles to the understanding of your churches.</p>
      <p>I do not think you have forgotten what you suggested, even when our interpretation was already being copied in the house of the first scribe? Moreover, that your people could not simply acknowledge the truth of Christ in the Wittenberg Articles, and that it was also doubted about Luther's opinion, as if it detracted from the human nature in Christ, his heavenly glory, and the office of the savior, so that such a verbose exposition and explanation of these matters was necessary for them, we judge this to be a weakness, and when we gave this extensive interpretation in words and writing, we accommodated ourselves to your and your people's weakness.</p>
      <p>And we thought it necessary to excuse this to Luther, because we easily knew he would be offended and that you still suspect such impiety about him, especially after so many of our intercessions over so many years, and that you do not even trust yourselves. We have explained Luther's very opinion to you and have not accommodated anything to Luther from our own to make him more agreeable to you, which can now be seen from Luther's response to you. For he testifies that he found no insincerity in us concerning this cause, and therefore he entrusts the whole matter to our faith. He read that interpretation of ours, which you sent to him, so that he might more clearly see that you do not have faith in us in this matter. Therefore, we do not accuse ourselves of any dissimulation here, as you dare to write, drawing a bad conclusion. We have granted you nothing about the matter itself, but we have served the interpretations and exceptions, which were of no use if you and your people had been firm enough to perceive the truth itself in its words and had accommodated as much faith to Luther and us as candor and charity required.</p>
      <p>You object to another contradiction in that we write that we were asked by you to adapt the exposition of the articles to the understanding of the Swiss churches, so that they might hear some kind of agreement of Zwingli and Oecolampadius; for long before we testified that there was not just any kind of agreement, but full agreement with our opinion in the writings of Zwingli and Oecolampadius. Here again, we miss candor in you, who do not report our words as they are; but we have more useful matters than to respond to each thing, which indeed appears very calumnious. We have always clearly testified that Oecolampadius fully agreed with us, Zwingli did not satisfy; but while we consider his latest writings, in which he accepts Augustine, we also acknowledge him as agreeing with us in reality. With these, it is true that you have fallen into ignorance of the elenchus in every fight with Luther; for he does not establish the presence of Christ in the supper, which you attack, nor the use of the sacrament, which you refuted. And if you stand in the opinion of Augustine and acknowledge the true presence of the Lord in the supper, now neither do those things which Luther wrote against those who feel nothing but bread and wine are truly exhibited fight against you. But because this word "some kind of agreement" slipped out, the reason is that Luther, when he considers the first writings of Zwingli, especially those published in contention, openly sees the presence of the Lord in the supper simply denied. And you, Bullinger, know well enough that there are many things in Zwingli's writings, with which if you compare the Basel Confession, a contradiction in words clearly appears. For in how many places does he simply state: "Christ is not present in the supper, and the sacraments are nothing but tokens of Christian fellowship." Now in the Basel Confession, the opposite of both is clearly stated. Although, when we look at our letter, we did not use this word "some kind of agreement" to signify that there is not a true or full agreement, but that your people would be satisfied if they heard that there was some agreement of Zwingli and Oecolampadius with our articles.</p>
      <p>For it would have been impudent to testify to them that there is complete agreement even in words; for even today you learned men do not acknowledge the articles to agree with the opinion of Zwingli and Oecolampadius. Therefore, you, Bullinger, have no cause provided by us to use such bitter inferences here, that you seem to have extracted from us by prayers a testimony not of full, but of some kind of agreement, that you seem to be aware that there is no agreement here, yet want to appear that there is some, than which nothing could be thought more illiberal and base of you, since it would be nothing else than to try to deceive your churches. We would not want to interpret any of your letters in this way. Moreover, what we have affirmed in writing and words about the agreement of both Zwingli and Oecolampadius and yours, we also affirm today. As we indeed understand your confession published in so many writings, there is agreement in the matter itself with all those things that remain sincere in that confession; for that confession expresses the true presence and exhibition of the Lord in the supper. But how could we have affirmed that there is agreement in every single word, when even today you do not cease to fight about them?</p>
      <p>Of the same kind, that is, as you wish to appear, is the injury you do by what we wrote that you denied that agreement in the articles and that concord could have been obtained from your churches unless the verbose exposition of the whole dispensation of the church had soothed the minds of some. With these words, as you write, certainly bold, we have thrown you into some unknown dangers of capital punishment, unless your faith and integrity are somewhat more evident to your people than to believe such things about Leo and you, that you would deceive them and involve them in clouds of words, not some, but simply your people. What we wrote, you know well enough to be true. How often have you testified that the Wittenberg Articles, naked or even with our added interpretation, could by no means be received by your people if you did not so extensively expound your opinion in that writing we are discussing. Did you then soothe the minds of some with this verbose exposition so that they would give their consent to the articles and solid concord? Certainly, it was about your people consenting to the articles and concord. Since your people could not have received the articles we brought from Wittenberg, we gave the first verbose interpretation ourselves. It had the effect that the people of Basel, St. Gallen, and Mulhouse consented; you said the rest still required a more extensive interpretation. You gave them yours, which did not overturn the Wittenberg Articles - for at the beginning of your writing to Luther you receive them according to our interpretation - but which explained those articles better and more verbosely for the understanding of your people. Therefore, with this exposition, when the minds of the rest were led to consent to the articles and concord, having removed the unjust suspicions about Luther and his way of speaking from their minds, we think they could not have been so ineptly said to have been soothed by your interpretation. And if we had not used the word "soothed" so properly here, yet it was charity not to make from this "soothing the minds of some, deceiving and involving in clouds of words" not some, but your people, that is, all your churches, and indeed to deceive and involve them in such a way that it would be capital for you among your people if you had spoken as we wrote about you.</p>
      <p>You object to a third contradiction in that we wrote to Luther that we have always clearly testified to you that concord would be in this if you solidly believe and fully teach that in the Eucharist the very body and blood of the Lord are truly and substantially distributed and received; for you deny that we have always testified this and add that we wrote at the beginning that there is error on both sides due to ignorance of the elenchus, that Luther does not establish what you attack, nor do you affirm what he attacks, and that we did not always, especially at the beginning, say that concord would be in this. If you understand this about the word "substantially" and about the beginning of reconciling you with Luther, which we did before the Wittenberg convention, we admit that we did not deal with the word "substantially" at the beginning. But how could we have testified from the beginning that there is fighting between you due to ignorance of the elenchus and that Luther does not establish what you attack, nor do you affirm what he attacks, unless we attributed to you the confession of the true presence of Christ in the supper? For it would have been insane to say that Luther did not fight for the true presence of the Lord in the supper. But since he never fought for that presence which detracts from the truth of the human nature in Christ, the heavenly glory of Christ, and the office of the savior, and you clearly affirmed such a presence that diminishes Christ's nature, glory, and office, not simply attacking his presence in the supper, but also acknowledging the true presence of him in the supper, hence it was that we said and wrote that neither Luther affirms what you deny, that gross and Christ-detracting presence, nor do you affirm what he denies, that only bread and wine are ministered in the holy supper, but also acknowledging that besides bread and wine, here also the body and blood are ministered and received. Which opinion of yours, since you have expressed it in published books and several times in person, finally also in the Basel Confession, so that you seemed to solidly stand in this, we have affirmed that Luther asserts nothing different from your - but this very one, which we have just explained - opinion, nor does he establish any of those things you wanted to appear to have attacked alone. Therefore, when we judged about your confession, especially the Basel one, we wrote that we returned from Wittenberg with the conviction that perfect concord would be if you would accommodate yourselves in all things to your own confession, understanding the Basel one, and not reject what is equally valid with it. We affirm the same today, and so the matter stands. But then you will accommodate yourselves in all things to this confession if you diligently and clearly teach in sermons about the sacraments and in the administration of the sacraments that in the Eucharist two things are exhibited: the symbols, bread and wine, and the matter of the sacrament, the true body and true blood of Christ, just as in baptism the symbol, washing or immersion, and the matter of the sacrament, regeneration.</p>
      <p>And since the Wittenberg Articles are equally valid with this your confession, they should by no means be condemned or rejected by you; for "substantially" in them means nothing more than "truly" and expresses the true body being exhibited. In this way, you yourselves acknowledged that the rest agree with your confession when you perceived our interpretation. What will you now say that our later requests contain something dissonant from our earlier writings? Or how is it not true that we have always clearly testified to you that concord would be in this if you acknowledge and teach that besides the symbols, the very communication of the Lord is administered and received in the holy supper? We indeed refer the whole matter to the testimonies of both our writings and your legates. But you contend that we contradict ourselves in that we made no mention of subscription at the beginning, which we then requested from you in Basel as if we had forgotten the previous things. You seek contradictions very acutely if it seems so different from our earlier writings that we requested subscription from you in the later action, about which we made no mention in the earlier action, that you judge us to have forgotten the previous things. It was beyond all doubt for us and still is that perfect concord exists if you accommodate yourselves in all things to your Basel confession and do not reject what is equally valid with it. Now you could have acknowledged whether the Wittenberg Articles agree with this confession or not; if you acknowledge, what is so contrary to the earlier things that we requested you to subscribe to what you confessed with us to be true and holy? If you could not acknowledge this, we were not requesting any subscription. For how often did we repeat: "You sent your confession to Luther through us in your own words; he does not disapprove of it as he understands it. But so that it may be better and more clearly known on both sides what the opinion of both is and how much you agree, the Wittenbergers ask that you also express your opinion about those few articles we brought to you. If, having heard and perceived our interpretation, you can judge them to be true and orthodox, testify to this clearly; if not, what you desire in them, publish and perceive our reasons mutually. The Lord will grant that by comparing the scriptures and reasons we follow on both sides, we may finally agree. No one asks for any subscription from you except for those things you also feel to be true." But you would by no means admit a collation before the legates. But what we discussed separately among us churchmen always had the end that no dissension would appear among us, however much we would have preferred your writings to be more consonant with the forms of the scriptures and the fathers and especially in the last writing to have used exceptions and cautions more sparingly and declared greater trust in Luther's sincerity. Among these, you never objected that it seemed unjust and contrary to our previous actions that we requested you to testify by subscription to what you confessed with your mouth. In this way, you denied: to simply subscribe to the Wittenberg Articles without the added interpretation. Therefore, my Bullinger, it was not then that we first broke out and clearly pronounced, as you write, that concord would be in this if you acknowledge that with bread and wine the true body and blood of the Lord are distributed and eaten and if you acknowledge the Wittenberg Articles as true. This is sufficiently testified by that writing in which we interpreted the Wittenberg Articles, which you churchmen did not disapprove of so much that you clearly gave hope that your people would also receive the articles explained with our interpretation. For by then the word "substantially" had begun to be not so dangerous.</p>
      <p>The deeper we go into your letter, my Bullinger, in responding, the less it seems to have come from your simple and candid nature; therefore, we pray you in the Lord, since we sometimes respond more freely, and as we signify something in places that appear captious, not to say calumnious, that you will attribute this to those who were the authors of that sharper observation and examination of our letter and words than your candor would allow.</p>
      <p>A matter of the greatest importance is being disputed between us and concerns all the churches of God; therefore, we must endure anything rather than be unjustly accused of deceit and fraud or even of dissension from ourselves and inconstancy, since - thanks to Christ - the matter is otherwise. It seemed appropriate to interject this here, which now the order of your letter requires us to respond to that place which rightly presses us most and seems most unworthy to you. It is when you write that we have affirmed that it would be enough to establish concord if you bear Luther's forms of speaking, nevertheless with your opinion safe and unharmed, with your forms of speaking also safe and unharmed. These are your words, which some among you interpret to mean that they may speak about the Eucharist and use such words as to say openly that in the holy supper nothing but bread and wine is administered, that Christ is present in heaven and no more of Christ is exhibited here than of Paul and Peter when their images are exhibited. And it has been said to us by some that the Basel Confession was given for Luther and others and that no one in your churches should use the words and ways of speaking that are in it. If we have permitted you all these things, we have indeed conducted this cause of concord perfidiously and impiously. Good men, the legates who were in Basel will testify, and our writings will testify that we have affirmed this to you: If you believe and teach that with the sacred symbols the true communication of our Lord Jesus Christ is also administered and received in the divine supper, then it is allowed for you to commend this truth to your people with such words and forms of speaking that are most suitable for them, nor is it required that you use the forms of speaking that others use. What, Bullinger, would be this betrayal of such a great cause, to grant you any forms of speaking and any opinion of yours and then testify that there would be concord between you and Luther? In how many places in Zwingli's writings is it most affirmatively stated that Christ is simply absent from the supper. If now others want to speak in this way, as most do, what, I ask you, will be the agreement with those churches that have fought against this very thing and with us rightly consider it impious not to acknowledge the true presence and exhibition of the Lord in the supper? And why did we undertake so many journeys, why did we give you so many writings, if the only thing was to bear the forms of speaking used by Luther? For this Zwingli and Oecolampadius offered them at Marburg. Why would it have been necessary to contend so much in the Basel Confession and in the writing to Luther that you express your opinion in such words in which the churches could recognize that you also feel that the communication of Christ is offered and received in the holy supper, not empty symbols, bread and wine? Therefore, excellent Bullinger, and your venerable fellow ministers, otherwise men to us in the Lord, we beseech and implore you by our Lord Jesus Christ and the peace of so many churches not to afflict us with such a grievous injury as to affirm about us that we have permitted you to simply remain in your opinion and use your words and yet that there would be agreement between you and Luther's church. This we affirm and have always affirmed, if you remain in that opinion of yours, which we understood to be your opinion both at other times and when you gave the Basel Confession, namely that with the symbols, bread and wine, the very body of the Lord, the true body, the very blood of the Lord, the true blood, is truly given and received in the holy supper, and that you teach this truth in good faith and solidly in your churches with those ways of speaking that are most suitable for it, so that your people receive that truth without any offense, only that you do not condemn the forms of speaking used by Luther's churches, since there is nothing unworthy of Christ and this mystery in them, as was believed when the contention still prevailed. In this way, your legates know that we have testified to you about the manner of concord, and it is sufficiently expressed in that interpretation of ours which we gave in Basel.</p>
      <p>Therefore, report our things as they are when you consider them to be reported. We will strive to do the same for you and have hitherto done so in good faith, wherever your words or writings have been entrusted to us to be presented or will be in the future.</p>
      <p>It follows now that we wanted to mitigate with Luther that you affirm that you have also taught this before, which indeed usually offends him greatly; for in those first writings it is simply denied that the Lord is present in the supper and that the sacraments confirm the conscience. But in the Basel Confession and the writing to Luther, both are simply affirmed, and you know, my Bullinger, that it is very true that very few among you have spoken and taught about the sacraments in the way the Basel Confession proclaims. For you acknowledged this in Basel. Since this is the case and there are not lacking today among the Swiss churches those who neither speak nor allow others to speak as the Basel Confession has, what is so illiberal, so contrived in our excuse? But what was inserted in your writing in this way: "We have denied this with our predecessors in the teaching of Christ, and we still deny it to this day, that the body of Christ is bodily or fleshly," etc., did we obtain this from you when you began to praise your previous way of teaching more simply and fully? For as you take eating the body of Christ bodily and fleshly in these words, neither did Luther ever affirm this. We know what your scribe testified, nor does it in any way contradict what we wrote. We have long seen, excellent men, that the whole cause that calls you back from concord is that you are so reluctant to seem to have conceded anything to other churches and to have deviated from your doctrine even so much in the way of speaking. But it was once to be established whether the authority of Christ and the agreement in Christ of so many churches should prevail more with us or your reputation. It was a sufficiently honorable reason: When we had to deal with papists attributing more than enough to the sacraments, we spoke in such a way that we ascribed everything as fully as possible to Christ, and therefore we can be seen, as the apostle himself in some places, to leave less to the sacraments than is fitting; now, when we see arising in the church those who completely evacuate all ministry of the church, likewise we are held among so many churches as to consent to these heretics, we gladly now speak a little more augustly about the exhibition of God's gifts in the sacraments, yet in such a way that even today we ascribe everything to Christ and condemn papist superstition. Otherwise, if you want to stand in everything that was written by your people at the beginning, you will persist in that way of teaching which both condemns other churches and is condemned by them, and nothing is to be expected of concord. Formerly you did not admit our confession exhibited at Augsburg. Zwingli also disapproved of Oecolampadius's Dialogue; the confession of the princes could be borne much less. Many things were explicitly rejected, which you explicitly gave in the Basel Confession. So other churches also admit and concede forms of speaking, which they could not bear in you, when they were taught about your sounder opinion by fuller confessions, which they previously held too suspect. But what need is there for words? If we are both in everything who we were, we condemn each other, and there is no agreement between us; if we embrace each other in the Lord and there is agreement, we must not be the same as we were, nor speak the same in everything. Would that we both acknowledge this ingenuously, deferring this glory to the Lord - for by our contention we have too gravely harmed the kingdom of Christ - or, if we are reluctant to acknowledge it plainly, we would dissimulate. Now when we both want to be who we were, and to teach what we taught, and neither wants to seem to have conceded anything to the other, when will the pastors sincerely come together and the churches agree among themselves again and this most grievous offense be removed? These restorers of Christianity and purifiers of the doctrine of Christ, so learned, so spiritual, cannot agree among themselves about the true commendation and use of both the word and the sacraments, that is, the whole sacred ministry, by which alone the church can be restored. Which the Lord instituted to be used by all Christians and also, as much as it can conduce to salvation for each one, to be understood, these sophists descended from heaven cannot understand. About this they have fought so fiercely among themselves for so many years, nor do they endure to hear each other or others interceding, they shun every assembly and conference in the Lord. How much more bitterly do the enemies of Christ in all the kingdoms of Europe harass these things, how many of the sons of God also stumble gravely at these things, how useful they are finally to antichristian popes to drive princes away from the pursuit of truth and the attempt to reform the churches, who is so eloquent and articulate that he can expound and declare this worthily? But your charity, whatever we urge about our minds and zeal to restore concord, and this so immense offense, which we wish to be removed from the churches once and for all, urges us only to external alliances.</p>
      <p>It also burns you that we wrote that you hesitate to simply admit formulas that are nevertheless true and sound. You doubt how we take the word "simply." We indeed understand the simple admission of formulas, which does not apply so many exceptions and cautions. But you apply them lest you provide an occasion for error to the simpler. But you should have remembered that you are not dealing with such simple and unlearned people who would seize an occasion for error from sound forms of speaking when you are dealing with Luther and other leading churchmen. For it has always been granted to you to exclude every error as diligently as possible from your people, and since there are now three false opinions to be feared among the unlearned from the forms of scripture and the fathers when they speak about the Eucharist, lest anyone imagines anything unworthy of the human nature in Christ or his heavenly glory or finally the office of the savior, you could have abundantly excluded these imaginations, even if you were teaching about the Eucharist, you would say simply that here the body of the Lord is given and received: the bread we break is the communion not only of bread but also of the body of the Lord, nor to express in a sacred sermon what a certain chief among you dared to do not so long ago, that for what the scripture has "this is my blood" "this signifies my blood" as if said by the Lord. And when dealing with Luther or the learned, you could testify about the forms they use as sound, what you testify below about the words of Philip, that they are true and plain in themselves, unless someone perverts them with a malicious interpretation.</p>
      <p>Finally, it also offends that we wrote that Zwingli did not satisfy us, and this seems absurdly written by us, since he admitted Augustine, with whom you prefer to be considered less polished than with some illustrious and subtle. We are truly amazed at the desire to criticize, which made it seem here that if Augustine satisfies, Zwingli, who admits Augustine, must also satisfy. You also admit Augustine, yet you do not satisfy either us or other churches, because you do not use all the forms of Augustine and bring exceptions and interpretations that seem very clear and plain to you, but are either not understood by others or they reject again what you seem to have received by admitting Augustine's authority. You will indeed need a new rhetoric and dialectic to prove to the churches and learned men that that treatment, which is in the confession to the king of France, which you published posthumously and adorned with the title of the swan's voice, agrees with the opinion and doctrine of Augustine. We have always considered it a most convenient argument to prove to your people that Zwingli did not abhor the truth concerning the mystery of the Eucharist and its religious explanation, that he admitted Augustine's treatment in the writing to the princes. But what he added both in that writing and in others, which so many learned and so many churches cannot understand otherwise than as dissenting from Augustine's confession, we have always undertaken to interpret as written against that impure and impious imagination of the presence of Christ in the supper, which does not leave Christ either to be a man or to reign in heaven or to save the elect by his own power alone. But since neither Luther nor the churches that listen to him ever established such a presence nor used forms of speaking that establish this impious imagination from themselves, we rightly miss in Zwingli and in you, as well as in ourselves, that we have accused these servants of God and distinguished churches of such impiety and that we have made it so that so many among us and elsewhere today also feel, from our doctrine, occasion if not cause taken, that in the supper nothing else happens than that, having taken bread and wine, a commemoration of Christ absent from here in heaven is made, a testimony of the Christian society of those who equally communicate in the Eucharist. Although we have always endeavored to express the presence and perception of Christ in the supper, because we too, when we did not yet fully understand Luther's mind, used too many exceptions and explained the power of the sacred ministry - fearing to agree with the papists - more sparingly than was fitting and not only declined but also attacked the sound forms of speaking about this mystery, we too did not satisfy ourselves in these things and yet wanted to be Augustinians. We have now deemed it necessary to correct this, since the superstition of the papists lies and on the other hand the impious audacity of those who evacuate the sacred ministry has so greatly raised itself. Although it also rightly urges that we speak more augustly and fully about the sacraments and all the sacred ministry, so that we may repel from us and our churches the calumny of the despised and emptied ministry, by which the enemies have often greatly hindered and rendered ineffective the work of the Lord among us with the greatest damage to piety among many. In which we rightly fear the offense of the weaker, which is much graver and extends more widely than any of us has ever justly considered. These are the reasons, excellent Bullinger, why most of our and others' treatments of the sacraments do not satisfy us, however much we have always wanted to follow Augustine.</p>
      <p>These are, dearest brother, what we have now seen fit to respond to your criticisms in the letter to Luther. You write that you have made these with a simple mind; for it is the duty of friends and brothers to conceal nothing and to judge freely and without pretense what you desire and would like to see changed in a brother. Now we swear to you by the Lord that we too, as far as we are conscious of ourselves, have responded to your objections with a simple and sincere mind. Just as we take your admonition well and thank you for so clearly expressing what you desire in us, however much it pains us that you feel and are affected in this way about us and our deeds and writings, so we pray you by Christ, take our response also well and fairly. But those things of yours are not so pleasing: "Nor is there any reason for you to think that it is already settled about just concord or to think that it is necessary to meet again, to purge, to demand, and to contend; for I will persevere in those things that are of the confessed truth," etc.</p>
      <p>You dissent from us in so many and grave questions, which you abundantly declare in this your letter. We indeed are dearest brothers to you and even to be honored, and you so greatly abhor our meeting? Has no desire arisen that we may at some time agree in everything and speak the same among ourselves? And do you permit yourself to write that you have done nothing about concord in this your letter to us? Is it so unworthy of us to purge among ourselves and to demand not only in writings, when we profit so little by writings, but also in person, when so many things of the doctrine of Christ are still disputed among us?</p>
      <p>To contend indeed and to draw the contentious rope is not ours; but to meet and to converse in the Lord and to dispel those clouds that have arisen between us by the word of the Lord and prayers, if it is not ours, neither does the spirit that leads and has led the sons of God, as many as have existed since the foundation of the world, act in this cause. You write that you will persevere in those things that are of the confessed truth; that there is agreement in what was agreed upon in Basel. In these, we also persevere; yet we both miss not a few nor light things in each other.</p>
      <p>We are everywhere slandered by you as those who have turned away from the clear and certain explanation of the mysteries of God into I know not what dark and uncertain things for the sake of human favor and who labor to lead others into the same, that we have not candidly and faithfully performed the role of mediator between you and Luther. We indeed complain about you, but only among you and the most sensible ministers of the churches, first, that you interpret our and Luther's writings unjustly, then, that you suspect about us what you have no cause for from us, and so is alien to charity, finally, that from the beginning of the attempted reconciliation to this day we have not been able to persuade you to endure to seek the sense of Christ with us in these matters with a worthy and just conference. If now these do not seem to you worthy causes to say nothing first, and as soon as possible to fly together in the Lord and with the utmost religion and just delay to consult and hear the Lord in ourselves mutually, Paul indeed cannot be excused of the greatest rashness, who for matters of much less importance and danger both met with the brothers himself and sent those who would meet, having traversed great distances both of land and sea. But since this is your settled opinion and you deny access to you - for we have never insisted vehemently that you follow us - we will not seek to be troublesome to you without hope of fruit. You will see whom you repel while you repel us in this cause. For we know that we are conducting the cause of Christ. This cause, I confess, is not private, but if we do not seek to agree even privately, we do not seek to agree in the Lord. It is not our office to prescribe confessions to others, but it is our proper office to lead others to understand and make true confessions. But into what agreement will we lead the churches entrusted to us by the Lord if we ourselves still dissent so gravely and there is not even a just care to agree, after we have so strongly rejected those things by which the Lord has always been accustomed to reconcile his own and lead them into the same and his own opinion? We pray to the Lord, pray also you, that he may grant both of us the spirit by which we may both ardently desire the agreement of the churches and seek it by his means.</p>
      <p>You add here that you approve of what Philip wrote about the sacraments in his "Loci"; for they are simple and plain, while ours are intricate and obscure, and unless we hinder ourselves by our excessive diligence, you are confident that we will soon beautifully unite in the Lord. It is well, dearest Bullinger, if now Philip's treatment is considered more tolerable to you than ours, indeed simple and plain.</p>
      <p>Therefore, use this, and since he does not doubt that he wrote the same in the "Loci" as he had previously written in the confession of the princes and the apology of that confession, and you acknowledge these as the same, piously and rightly written, with those you read in the "Loci," and the matter is safe and the concord is intact. And since we have never asked you to speak about the Eucharist with any other words nor do we ask today, we will not trouble you with ours, which seem so intricate and obscure.</p>
      <p>You also add a complaint about the fact that we repeatedly bring up your testimony about our book "To the Monasterians" in our favor, and you write that you do not want your opinion about the supper to be proposed from our writings, neglecting all your other writings that you have written and published. You add that you have long since explained that testimony, finally, that what we have published since the time of the publication of the book "To the Monasterians" seems to be more involved than what is in that book. We, excellent Bullinger, have never aimed by adducing your testimony to propose your opinion about the supper from our writing, but to show that our treatment of the supper in that book was once approved by you, and that with such a full and so ample testimony, which you gave of your own accord, not provoked by us.</p>
      <p xml:id="regest1">As we did with the Bernese, with the Lord's help, we can also demonstrate to you that we have not demanded anything beyond what is contained in that book, neither in thought nor in words, and we affirm that neither you nor anyone else will ever prove that what we have written about the Holy Eucharist since the publication of that book is different or other than what we published in that book, however more obscure it may seem to you. As for what you write, that you have presented your testimony to Myconius in writing and to us verbally, we do not object; interpret and explain it in any way you please, as long as the interpretation does not contradict the literal words, and allow the words with which you voluntarily approved our book, beyond what we desired, to be used without any deceit or distortion. And if you wish to retract everything, if you do so driven by a zeal for truth, we will not oppose it; for we all strongly wish that we would be less reluctant to retract and explain our words and writings, as we, who were educated in our youth with the worst examples of church administration, have come to this immense task of restoring the churches of Christ from such ruin, which cannot be managed tolerably without the spirit of Paul, no matter how much doctrine we claim for ourselves. We do not wish to add more here, but we do not doubt that we will be greatly displeased with ourselves before the tribunal of Christ, for now we are so pleased with ourselves in everything and immediately assume that we have seen and comprehended the matter of Christ in everything, that we abhor such retractions and explanations of our words and writings, which even the most perfect instrument of Christ, Paul, did not disdain, to say nothing of the wisest fathers. You accuse us of deceit in the use of your testimony, as if we argue from the specific to the general and say that Bullinger approved the whole book, of which he only approved some parts, just as you also approved certain things of Luther in the book on visitation, from which, however, you do not want it inferred that you entirely agree with him on the Lord's Supper, which Luther has testified to in his writings. You can acknowledge, dear Bullinger, that your testimony given to us about that place of Luther is not similar to what you wrote to us about the Monasterian book; for about this you wrote without any exception that Bucer has now completely bound you to himself, although you were already bound to him before, that he expressed your mind in that book and bore witness to your spirit. If you now wish to contract this so ample testimony given about the whole book without any exception to some part of the book through interpretation, we will not obstruct you; only allow that, if we ever have to show that our writings, which are now judged to be so intricate, obscure, dark, contrary to our previously rightly written works and agreeing with the papists' commentaries, were not always seen by you as so intricate, obscure, etc.; for since all these things are contained in the book "To the Monasterians," you nevertheless approved the book without any notation of them and without any exception. Although we have never eagerly used your testimony; for in this cause we rely on the testimony of Christ, not yours. In Bern, however, we were accused of fraudulent use of your testimony, which we had not used there, and it was openly denied that you had written anything of the sort to us. There, lest our faith in the cause of Christ be overthrown, the lie had to be repelled and what your handwriting testifies had to be confirmed. Otherwise, my dear Bullinger, since you are entirely free to testify about our writings what you judge of them today, whatever you may have testified before, we indeed do not wish to be troublesome to you anywhere with that testimony of yours. Only let no one accuse us of having ever boasted of your testimony, which you did not give.</p>
      <p>Your last complaint is about the publication of the book of letters. We said in Bern and elsewhere, but never unless provoked by your people, that we disapprove of the publication of that book and that you also do not approve of it because of certain letters that you do not want published, and we specifically remember the one to Somius and another to Zviccius. And when we were asked the reason why we disapprove of that publication, we gave those reasons, that most of the letters have now been published again, in which both the mystery of the sacraments is treated more coldly and Luther is accused by name of intolerable impiety, it cannot be otherwise than that this publication greatly hinders the restoration of concord, as we have abundantly experienced that it has hindered too much. Therefore, it is not false that we said you also regret that this collection was not published more prudently and with greater selection.</p>
      <p>We did not say that the publication displeases you for any reason or for any letters; for we do not grieve over the publication of everything contained in that book. The dialogue of Oecolampadius and many other things are pleasing. But if it pleases you that those letters are published, which were written in the first fervor of contention and falsely accuse Luther of the greatest impiety, we indeed grieve for your sake; for in such a spirit you would neither love concord nor truth and would prefer that a man who has deserved excellently of the church of God, whom we do not honor greatly in the Lord, we are most ungrateful to the Lord, be handed down to posterity and the present as of the greatest impiety, rather than that something, which had fallen from your people in any way, be abolished. Then, if you do not acknowledge that the mystery of the sacraments is treated more dilutedly in some places, with what faith did you subscribe to the fuller treatment in the Basel Confession? Which in many places in the collection either plainly contradicts or you gave us words in that confession. In the collection, in how many places is it written that in the supper bread and wine are taken as symbols of the absent, while the Basel Confession acknowledges Christ as present and exhibited together; in the collection it is condemned as impiety to say that the sacraments confirm faith, in the Basel Confession it is affirmed as pious and necessary? Therefore, either there is a contradiction of the matter between the collection and the confession or in the collection the treatment is more diluted and diminished.</p>
      <p>To acknowledge this frankly and to defer to Christ the Lord rather than to ourselves, we indeed judge to be the mark of a good man and one who rightly thinks of his teachers. Therefore, those words of yours greatly disturb us: "For who would believe that man to be good, who thinks so unjustly of his teachers and a good and useful book? I would indeed not want an excellent book to be suppressed, nor would I want this mark to be branded on well-deserving men, nor do I desire anything of truth in the doctrine of the Eucharist in that book." You write these things. Is this, Bullinger, how your opinion stands? The cause of God is at stake here. Therefore, if there is nothing written about the Eucharist in this book, in which you rightly desire something, all those are bad men and think unjustly of this book, who desire something in it. For because men are our teachers, they are not to be deferred to in the doctrines of Christ, for truth is to be honored more. But unless we desire many things in most letters, we can neither admit the Basel Confession nor hope for concord. For as we said before, many things are expressly denied in those letters, which the confession affirms, and they condemn Luther of the greatest impiety, whom you later embraced as orthodox.</p>
      <p>But how would you prove yourselves, if Luther were to take care to publish his writings of the first contention again and testify that he desires nothing in them? Would you write what you write about your own action with I don't know what conscience, that you do not see how it would hinder concord, unless the opposing party is pleased to interpret everything in the worst way? Therefore, if it is true that you never regretted the collection or rather those letters, which were written in the first heat of dispute and fight more bitterly, being published, you certainly never truly desired concord with a true heart. For as you judge it not impious to desire something in your teachers, so how would you embrace with worthy charity a Christian teacher, against whom truly apply the things contained in most letters of the collection? But why do we hold each other in vain contention? We grieve beyond measure that so many pious princes and republics, but especially so many excellent churches, have been so foully imposed upon by our imprudence, while we trusted you with the Basel Confession given to us and the writing to Luther. For now you give too much testimony; you wish to be entirely in sentiment and words those who you were from the beginning of the contention, that is, neither to think nor speak about the holy ministry what the canonical writers think and speak, and meanwhile to condemn Luther and those who agree with him of the greatest impiety, as those who leave neither the human body nor the heavenly glory nor the office of the savior inviolate to Christ. You sufficiently profess this about yourself, when you are so greatly pleased with whatever is written about the sacraments in the collection; for in many places these great crimes are imputed to Luther and those who stand with him.</p>
      <p>The same Leo also cries out too bitterly in his letter to me, which I received yesterday, that is, on February 14. But how does it not bother you in such a great matter, to say nothing more serious, to unravel the web of Penelope and to deceive so many churches? Bucer's Retractions were extant and everything was said, when we last met in Basel, which are now so contrary to the word of God and faith, so pernicious to the churches, and yet you carried before you the zeal for concord.</p>
      <p>You received our articles, in which they are to the point, in which our Leo rages so much, with your interpretation added, and yet we parted in Basel as concordant and consenting, except that, as we could not approve your excessive exceptions in the writing to Luther, so we feared that they would hinder concord with others. We did what we could for your salvation and the concord of the churches, as far as it concerns you. If now it pleases you to listen only to yourselves and judge others unheard, we will commit the whole cause to the Lord. If certain people had stood by the agreements in Basel and had not so atrociously accused us of impiety everywhere on the occasion of the letter to Luther, we would not have been compelled to ask for a day in Bern, and if, when we were in Bern, certain people had not accused us of so many things, we would not have needed a response that would extend so widely and burn you so much. Now you condemn us for a true defense; but I do not see you disapprove of the false accusation, which we could not neglect without impiety. We adapted the catechism there to the Basel Confession and not a word was placed by us that Megander did not admit in our presence. What is it to us if any disturbance arose later without our knowledge? We grieve and are distressed if anyone is offended or harmed; yet they should not be a detriment to us, which did not happen by our fault. As I wrote to Leo, so I know no remedy for this great evil and such atrocious exacerbation of your minds than to earnestly pray to the Lord to shape both sides to his will. He knows how truly we love you and honor you in the Lord; but you yourselves know that the truth of Christ and the churches are to be loved and respected above all men.</p>
      <p>The sum of all is this: We strive to follow the sentence of scripture and to use the words of scripture in all things. We understand the Basel Confession to be consistent with scripture, so also our Retractions, and the Wittenberg Articles; it is a calumny that we obscure the truth of Christ and have not acted in good faith in commending you; it is also unworthy of you and ungrateful to Christ that you have hitherto refused and today refuse to admit a just συζήτησιν (discussion) of these matters in some holy council of brothers. We wish to sustain this before your own church and before any assembly of holy and learned men, to whom we appeal for judgment.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we will always strive to be and become everything in Christ for you. This is what we wanted to respond to the letter you sent to us on October 6.</p>
      <p>As for the rite of administering the supper among you, as with other things, we commit it to Christ the Lord. You yourselves, if you please, will easily judge how your words of action are consistent with scripture, the fathers, and the Basel Confession, for you sufficiently take care not to seem to acknowledge the presence and exhibition of the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the letter added on October 15, take this: Euander secretly read part of our letter to Luther in the house of Doctor Kräl in Isny, then asked Conrad Böckel, who succeeded him in the school of Isny, for a copy of the whole letter; for an example of the letter had been given to him. And when he refused, saying that it was not written in a way that suited him, he could understand some things in a worse way or convey them to others, from which some offense might arise, Euander insisted and otherwise affirmed that he had read a good part, would accept everything candidly, and would not convey anything to others, swearing. Finally, he prevailed upon his friend with prayers, who nevertheless allowed the letter to be read in such a way that Euander gave his word not to copy it.</p>
      <p>Euander gave his word, but forgetting this, he spent the whole night copying the letter, having also accomplished it with various tricks, so that the letter was entrusted to him that night. Thus the deed stands, and Euander does not deny it. I have forgiven all injury, but I cannot deny that what Euander did was an injury, nor can you certainly think it proper, without warning him not to dare anything like this in anyone's favor in the future. For you see better than I how much inconvenience the betrayal of this letter has brought. We certainly think that if an example of this letter had not reached Bern, we would not have easily had a reason to go there and to vindicate the cause of the Lord and ourselves. Thus perhaps those things would not have followed, which you consider so inauspicious, although we do not doubt that the church and republic of Bern are much better than our Leo writes. He who hears only one side judges uncertainly. Concerning your benevolence and faith towards us outside of this contention, my dear Bullinger, we promise ourselves everything, and even in this very contention, we do not doubt that if it were allowed to hear us in a just assembly of brothers and to thoroughly and deeply examine what offends on both sides, you would be of such a mind towards us that we would dare to entrust you with ourselves and all our matters. We also have a sufficient understanding of Leo's sincerity and charity, although, as he is more vehement in his cause, he allows himself to be more harsh and, if you consider the words, very injurious towards us. I am glad that you are satisfied with the churches of Württemberg; however, we would like you to remember how direly false things were said and believed about them among you. We would have desired nothing more than to commend you to Luther with the most abundant praises, but if things are as they are with you, as Leo's letters testify and yours also in those places where you contend that everything ever written or said by your people about the holy ministry and sacraments is praised indiscriminately, you easily see in what position our entire labor for concord stands, as far as it concerns you.</p>
      <p>For if our opinion is contrary to the word of God and our words obscure the truth of God, as Leo laments so much, you certainly should neither bear nor approve it, nor acknowledge agreement with us. But we hope the Lord will still grant better things and that your words are harsher than your minds. For we fear that our actions in Bern have not been reported to you truthfully.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and diligently pray that the Lord may not allow you now, when the remaining holy churches and necessary concord are so beautifully accommodating themselves, to stir up disturbances. For this would be especially pernicious to you; for others, it will render the truth more confirmed, as the Lord gave us in Bern. The cause is the Lord's; against him, you will not prevail. May he guard you from all evil and make you blessed in all things, etc.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, February 25, 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
      <p>M. Bucer.</p>
