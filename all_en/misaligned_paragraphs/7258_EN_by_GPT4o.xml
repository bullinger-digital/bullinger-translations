      <p>Greetings. You may perhaps wonder, most beloved father and brother in Christ, about the silence of my letters, especially concerning the matters recently conducted in our presence with Lord Mauritius Schnewolphius, pastor in Steckborn, before our president and court. The reason I have not yet written to you about this affair is partly due to the long expectation of an outcome and conclusion, which, however, seems nowhere in sight, and partly because I hoped that Lord Camblin, the proconsul, and Georg Fitzrum, the orator, would explain it better in person than in writing, as well as the people of Steckborn, who came to you for the sake of seeking counsel. However, since other things have happened since the court session, which seemed important for you to know, I wanted to briefly include them in this letter, so that our compatriots may also see with what great deceit and trickery they deal with this good man, and especially our president and other adversaries.</p>
      <p>On the first departure of our proconsul, which was the day after the court session, it was barely granted through the greatest entreaties from our president that the captive Lord Mauritius be released to his church and family, on the condition that the consuls, senate, and the entire assembly of Steckborn (who indeed have done much for their pastor and continue to do so daily) would promise in writing and with diplomas to present their pastor Mauritius in good faith to the court, whether it be in Frauenfeld or Baden, on whatever day he wishes.</p>
      <p>Both the president and the people of Steckborn accepted this condition. However, since the people of Steckborn suspected something else was underlying, namely that they and all their possessions would be bound to the president if they gave the letters. For among other things, the president is reported to have said (as he is very vehement against us) that he would seriously deal with the entire assembly, because they have tolerated such a seditious man for so long and did not report it in time according to their duty and oath, to which they are bound.</p>
      <p>At the appointed time, as our proconsul had agreed with the president, the people of Steckborn appeared without letters: they thought it sufficient if two pledged for all, as is the case in other matters. The president received them with harsh words, as I heard from those who were sent, saying that he would not be content with anything other than letters, and furthermore, unless they pay all the expenses he has incurred.</p>
      <p>Of which, as I received from our proconsul himself, he had not made the slightest mention at first; it was a new invention. He perhaps fears that the matter will eventually turn against him, as it did recently when he dealt with Traber the farmer, and he had to pay all the expenses.</p>
      <p>The wife, out of conjugal love, had first promised to pay all the expenses she had incurred so far. Furthermore, before the people of Steckborn could hold a meeting, as the very imminent grape harvest greatly hindered them, our president left on horseback together with Lord Joachim Ruplin and the chief bailiff - whom our people call the land bailiff - to the Virgin Mary in the Hermitage: it is known that they consulted the governors of Switzerland and those who are needed for the deed. Meanwhile, at the request of the captive's wife and the people of Steckborn, to whom the president's conditions seemed too severe, Lord Camblin, the proconsul, returned to us to intercede and learn the cause from our president, whom he did not know was absent. But since the president was not present, he summoned the notary, whom our people call the landscribe, with Lord Ludwig Werlin, who acts as the president's agent, whom the common people call the landammann. These two received our proconsul very kindly and responded to his inquiry about the cause of the long captivity that there was no other reason than the delay of the people of Steckborn, who do not fulfill the promises and conditions. They have orders from the president that whenever the pledges sent from Steckborn come with letters written in the name of the consuls, senate, and the entire evangelical parish, they will release him. Meanwhile, at the proconsul's urging, they held a meeting and wrote letters regarding the surety for their captive pastor.</p>
      <p>Our proconsul, who could not stay longer due to business - because of the grape harvest - returned home on horseback, thinking the matter, as they say, was in the bag. However, the next day, when the president's arrival was also expected, the promised surety with the letters arrived, with great hope of freeing their captive pastor.</p>
      <p>But when the president was expected on the same day, namely in the evening, they were ordered to stay so that they could present them themselves, which they did. However, the president, being a man particularly cruel and tyrannical towards people of our religion, did not want to inspect, read, or accept the letters from their hands. But he said, "You have come too late," and that he would present the whole matter (I think the Hermitage Virgin or rather the Swiss whispered it in his ear) to all the lords of our county, that is, the seven cantons, and would do whatever they command him to do in this matter. But if they are willing to guarantee all costs and damages with 1500 guilders (see what he seeks), he would release him; however, they must present him to the right place. Those who were sent replied that they did not have such orders from their people, but they would inform them. Many advised them not to do anything beyond the first condition, partly because they could easily guess what he was seeking, partly because he had threatened to communicate the matter to the Swiss lords. We expect a message with the Swiss response daily. May it bring, if not joyful and fair, at least tolerable news.</p>
      <p>But to come to the captive, for whose sake all these things are being done, you may perhaps wonder (venerable father and most beloved brother in Christ) what he is doing and how he is bearing this long captivity. Let it be known, therefore, that he is full of consolation and endowed with singular constancy from the most good and great God, to whom all things must be attributed, and relying on the highest hope that God will bring the truth to light. I have this from writings and from those who are allowed to visit him. I have never been granted permission, although he is detained nearby, bound with an iron chain.</p>
      <p>Recently, when I secretly sent him a consolatory letter along with some books through my maid, and among other things, at the request of many brothers, I asked him, as it is a very necessary and useful matter, to write the summary of his accusation and defense, first the articles on which he was accused before the court, then the responses, of which I send a copy here (for he asked me to transcribe and send them to you).</p>
      <p>He is treated very humanely by the guard, although the man is of the opposing religion. His bonds are a source of pain for almost all people of both sides, and they almost all curse the president for this deed. Many faithful people help him with food, drink, and prayers to the same. I have written these things at greater length than expected, which, however, reverend father, as they are necessary to know, I hope you will consider well. The rest perhaps in person. Farewell, my father, and continue to love me and all my fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Given on the 9th of October in the year 1567.</p>
      <p>Your servant, Christian NÃ¤geli, pastor of the purer religion's church in Frauenfeld.</p>
      <p>The place of the Holy Scripture I have noted in the margin. etc.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich, my kind, dear lord and brother (etc.?) in Zurich.</p>
