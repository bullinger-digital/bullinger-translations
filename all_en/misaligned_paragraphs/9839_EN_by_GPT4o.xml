      <p>Greetings. Just as nothing more distressing has happened to me for a long time than hearing that you were struggling with such great pains that your life was in danger, so indeed nothing more desirable has occurred than learning from my brother's latest letters that those pains have subsided and there is good hope that you will resume your duties within a few days. Therefore, as I previously interceded with the Lord for your health as much as I could with my prayers, so now I give the greatest thanks to Him for raising you up again, and I further pray that He may prolong your life, grant you strength and health, so that you may be able to benefit, assist, and comfort His church and all of us for as long as possible. All the pious and good people among us, indeed our entire church, pray for the same.</p>
      <p>However, just as I took great pleasure in your recovery, I took immense sorrow from the death of our dearest brother Tobias from Chur; for I see how the affairs of that church stand, how torn they are, and how few good people there are who truly love truth and integrity from the heart. And although there are some, how little they can do, how widely others prevail, who care more for other things than for religion. But I pray to the Lord, to whom the churches belong, that He may always look after this one and all of ours in the best way.</p>
      <p>As for us, everything is moderately well. Diesbach, Gravenried, and the chief scribe have been sent to Aarau; we are now waiting to see what they will report back.</p>
      <p>The people of Schaffhausen were here last week and asked our people to sell them their share of the Paradies, and they obtained it for two thousand Rhenish guilders. I do not know if they will ask the same from you. Our people have finally considered the matter of the people of Chur, although, as far as I know, no definite gift has been assigned to them yet; but the matter is in preparation.</p>
      <p>We receive no good news about the king. He has gone down to Avignon, partly to indulge himself more freely there, partly to stir up war from nearby. Strange things are reported about his cruelty and luxury. He summoned our man from Valais to him; he excused himself. The king accepts the excuse but imposes a large sum of money to be paid by him. Our people intercede, but I think in vain. It is known that the Duke of Savoy is ill-disposed towards the king; for he has deceived him in remarkable ways. He has exchanged some places in Piedmont, Saluzzo, Pinerolo, etc., and a large cannon; it is to be weighed against each other, and the Savoyard has the one here on this side of the mountains, and when he demanded his in Piedmont, he could not get a decision, and his envoy, whom he sent to the king for this purpose, the lord of Montfort, is said to have been dismissed. If he did not fear the Spaniard and the pope, all the neutrals in Gallia Narbonensis would surrender to him, and he would have opportunities for great undertakings. The Duke of Savoy allows Coligny's people to follow their goods, which they have under him, and writes to them familiarly and offers them hospitality; but they are better on their guard in this place. Nothing else comes to mind now.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you and commend your health to the Lord. Farewell. November 28, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my lord compatriot and relative, always to be honored with the highest respect.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
