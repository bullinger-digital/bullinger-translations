    <p xml:id="regest1">The Bernese authorities are striving to strengthen the common confession of faith throughout their entire dominion. It is heard that the Duke of Württemberg wants to introduce the Reformation. A messenger from Württemberg has reported that there is a shortage of pastors everywhere. Therefore, these two preachers from the Solothurn region, who were expelled a year ago, are trying to obtain a position in Württemberg. Zehnder asks Bullinger to recommend them in letters to Blarer or Otter and vouches for their integrity.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace through Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>I am always very pleased to hear that you are doing well. Meanwhile, there is nothing new here with us that might interest or delight you, except that it is the wish of our lords in Bern to establish a common confession of faith throughout their entire dominion. May God grant that things may be arranged for the better throughout the whole Swiss territory with God's goodwill.</p>
      <p>But listen to what I wish to say. There is indeed a common rumor among us that the Duke of Württemberg is taking great care to have the Gospel preached throughout his dominion as much as possible without any disturbance. Hence, it is beyond doubt for everyone who truly favors the Gospel that they can be promoted by him, and those who resist out of malice can be expelled. Whether this is true or not, I do not know, but I do not hesitate to believe that you know more certainly.</p>
      <p>Recently, a messenger from Württemberg, a man both pious and quite reliable, reported to us how there is a considerable shortage of preachers throughout the duchy, almost up to three hundred. Therefore, it is quite certain that if any of our Württemberg friends can endure both the customs and the seriousness of the journey, they will easily find conditions suitable to their measure.</p>
      <p>Consequently, these two brothers, who have been moved by this and have served in the preaching office in the Solothurn region and were expelled during the recent tumult, have decided to travel there and seek some means, however things may stand there, to make a living at least in part. Indeed, they have been driven by extreme necessity. It has now been a year since they have been completely without any position. Meanwhile, they have endured poverty, even hunger, with their children, which does not need to be written about, but you can imagine what must be endured, what absurdities must be heard, what distress remains for one who has nothing, knows nothing by which he can live at home on his own resources, but is entirely dependent on the grace of others.</p>
      <p>However, since they have no acquaintance in the entire duchy with whom they can discuss the matter, they ask your kindness to provide letters of recommendation to Blarer or Otter, so that it may be known by what right or wrong they were expelled by the Solothurn authorities. And I ask you to consider them worthy of your recommendation, as they truly are. They are indeed men both pious and sufficiently learned, certainly worthy of such a benefit.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your wife and children. My wife sends her greetings to you and your wife.</p>
      <p>From Aarau, October 26.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zehnder, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the no less upright than learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher among the Zurichers, a friend and brother not of the common sort.</p>
