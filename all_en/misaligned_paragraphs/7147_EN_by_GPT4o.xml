      <p>Venerable, well-learned sir, my friendly willing service is ready for you as before. Your letter reached me well 8 days ago; however, I did not respond because the company from Baden prevented me. Nevertheless, I and other gentlemen were pleased to hear that you have returned home fresh and healthy. May the faithful God grant it to last long. I am glad to hear that your son and the one from Valais are well received in the Confederation, although I think they are doing their honor and have good fortune for the best attire; for truly nothing good has happened to them here with us. On the same day they were here, a council meeting was held, and no one kept them company. I was ill in one leg and could not go out, and they did not want to stay overnight with me; one of them was a curate in Chur. Michel would have gladly kept them company as much as possible. In summary: I am most pleased that they have visited the country and can also assess the situation. May God grant them luck so that they return to their duties in good health, etc. What the Spaniard intends with his people, no one can know for sure. A horse dealer from Milan arrives at night; he reports that some Spaniards have crossed the mountains but are considering returning, which greatly alarmed the Milanese, fearing they will camp on them all summer. No one knows yet where the King of France will send the Swiss, hence various opinions exist: some say he fears the Queen of England, others that he wants to convene the council throughout France, and whoever does not want to accept it must leave the country, etc. The third opinion is that the Spaniard himself comes out to bring some Catholic princes (who have been despised by Lutheran princes until now) back to their old status and finally become emperor with their help; the fourth say there is a plan for the Roman King to marry the Queen of England; however, they cannot agree on one article, namely regarding religion, as the Queen is willing to take him if he will leave religion free; therefore, she has agreed to accept his religion; he has refused that if she does not want to hold the Catholic religion in her right commonly, he will not, etc.</p>
      <p>The last opinion (which seems most credible to me) is that the Emperor, Roman King, King Philip, and some German princes are inclined to bring the council into the entire German land and to stake their life, goods, and fortune on it, to which the Pope and the E. etc. are vehemently urging and seeking much help. And if it is so (as I do not doubt, if it is possible for them, they will not cease), it will be necessary for the evangelical princes to be well-prepared and not so sluggish (as they have been until now); for if they do not resist this danger from the beginning and look through their fingers, it could become too late for them. But all these plans are in the righteous hand of God; He can and may break many plans with a single word; this has been well seen until now. May the same faithful God preserve a common Christianity under His divine protection! I am glad to hear that the regent has answered the princes in this way; they see what they should prepare for, although the peace and treaty with Bern and Savoy should be made, one finds other reasons, like the wolf with the sheep drinking below. A plot might be devised to encircle the city of Geneva and prevent Bern from providing help and thus bring out his Spaniards in front of Geneva under the pretense.</p>
      <p>In summary, I trust nothing in the matter; there are many intrigues and the worldly children are swift, whereas the evangelicals are sluggish, sparing their resources until the game is lost and cannot be retrieved, believing that God should arrange all things and they are not obliged to do anything, although He has given them as much land and people, wealth, and understanding as the opposite side. I think often and much, if one had sent soldiers to the Count in past years or let them run from the evangelical places themselves, everything would stand upright in France to this day. But it could not be raised; they fear us no more. Now, be it as it may, one sees, hears, and grasps where the game ultimately wants to go. If we now stand and watch, God have mercy. We would have it all the better if we trusted God well, called upon Him for help, and alongside that, also exerted our possible diligence, not just discussing these matters behind the wine with a godfather or a young lord and then doing nothing further about it. My age should not hinder me; if seriousness were needed, I would gladly put my hat into it. May the faithful merciful God grant His grace that one considers this matter with seriousness and godliness in time, uses good timely counsel, and opposes the Antichrist in good time.</p>
      <p>May the same faithful God preserve you and yours and all believers under His divine protection.</p>
      <p>Given in Glarus on the 8th of July, in the year 1567. Your willing servant Joachim BÃ¤ldi.</p>
      <p>I ask you to greet all my gentlemen along with your son in Berg and his wife.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned sir Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher in Zurich, my especially gracious, dear lord.</p>
