    <p xml:id="regest1">Returns documents of Frankish history [ZUB I, No. 37/Revision, 68 and 343], which he read with pleasure and translated according to Bullinger's request; for clarity, he was sometimes forced to paraphrase instead of translating literally when translating into German. It is noted that the writers of that era [the 9th century] were as uneducated as hardly ever before; therefore, it was impossible for Vadian to adequately reproduce all the linguistic peculiarities of the documents; he also made corrections in some cases, such as in the donation charter of Louis the German, where it seemed sensible to him to refer the opening sentence to a larger group of people. – Explanations of the translated documents and medieval document terminology: [1.] Terminology concerning property [and the domain of manorialism]: "Allodium" refers to legally secured [fully owned] property; according to Beatus Rhenanus, the term goes back to the word "anlodt"; different declension of "mansus" in the old documents. For goods subject to the honor tax, a transfer fee had to be paid upon a change of ownership; "terra salica" means a freehold or free property cultivated under certain conditions, whose tenant can only be dispossessed in case of breach of contract; the receipt of the contractual agreement is called a "reversbrief," the lease as a whole is called "erblehen"; this form of cultivation was subject to taxes, as can be seen from Justinian's Pandects, but not to the arbitrariness of the landlord; in the age of Justinian, the term "emphyteusis" expressed the close bond of the tenant to his hereditary lease; "[ius] emphyteuticum" is to be translated into German as "erblehenrecht"; hereditary lease because the lease passes to the heirs and descendants; such land ownership was referred to by the Alemanni and Franks with the word "mansus"; since the maintenance of the responsible clergyman was imposed on the farms, these farms were commonly called "Kelnhöfe" after the human throat; these [revenues] were actually intended for the parishes but were increasingly taken away from them by the monks through incorporation; to this day, the word "Kelnhof" has remained known, especially among the Benedictines. "Mansus" was used by the Franks as a collective term for "farm," "terra salica" meant free property that fell to the male descendants from the inheritance; the term was often mentioned in the charters of the Frankish kings; the donation charters were called "chartae" at that time, many of which have been preserved in German monasteries. [2.] The term "curtis" means like "cors/cohors" fundamentally assembly or meeting place, but was used by the Frankish writers in various ways, the range of applications extends from the royal court to a pasture; it seems to Vadian that he encountered a similar use of the word "cohors" in the Codex Justinianus, but he can no longer remember the exact place; "curtis" also means jurisdiction and authority; if the latter occurs in a quasi-pure form, it is called "Hochgericht" or "high authority" in German, whereas a mixed authority exists when high and low courts are found in a dominion, as was undoubtedly the case in the Zurich dominion of Louis [the German]. The lower jurisdiction – without maleficence – was often transferred to monasteries and churches; for a long time, the church and the cities of that middle age shied away from taking over the high jurisdiction, in contrast to the monks and bishops of later times; a "curtis" is always associated with a form of jurisdiction and authority and can be described in German as "Vogtei," but the respective specific rights differ; Helvetia was, as the old documents testify, completely subjected to the harsh Frankish rule; the "curtes" and also the much larger "pagi," which are to be translated into German as "regions/districts" or "Gaue," are encompassed by boundaries called "marcae"; a "pagus" was governed by a count and was divided into several "curtes," which in turn were divided into several villages and farms. [3.] Other expressions in need of explanation: "Vestitura" means the same as investiture and can be translated into German as "Lehenbestätigung"; "distringere" means "to summon to court," a common expression in the old folk laws; "fredus" corresponds to the word "peace," more precisely the state of peace or land peace, whereby the term includes the penalties legally threatened to the peacebreaker, which are still drastic today; regarding the ban, a larger and a smaller ban are distinguished, the larger belongs to the king, for both a monetary amount is due for a violation; of a different kind is the ban, which is translated into German as "Acht" or "Reichsacht." So much for the factual expressions, further word explanations can be found in Vadian's writing about the old foundations and monasteries of Germany. – Regarding Berthold [V.], Duke of Zähringen, who is mentioned in a document, it should be noted that he did not preside over the great Burgundian kingdom, but only a part of it located on this side of the Jura, an area that today is under Bernese, Solothurn, and Freiburg rule; Berthold had his seat of power in Burgdorf; the entire area on this side of the Jura from the Aare and Lake Neuchâtel to [Lake Geneva] and into the Valais once belonged to Burgundy. Otto of Freising has written some things about Zurich in his chronicle, which Bullinger has at hand. The use of the term "redhibitio" in the donation of Louis [the German] documents the influence of Roman legal terminology on the Frankish and Alemannic document language. According to Ulpian's definition, "redhibitio" means the reversal of a purchase, which served as a protection against abuses; such frauds in connection with buying and selling are described in the 21st book of the Digests. The same abuse was present in the "cancellation of the guarantors," which is also mentioned in Louis's document when a legitimate guarantee was declared unlawful and subsequently dissolved. The confirmation of the churches belonging to the provostry of Zurich in Berthold's [V. of Zähringen] document refers to churches of the landscape belonging to the parish. Vadian sends an epitaph on Hildegard, the first abbess of the Fraumünster Abbey, written by a monk from St. Gallen, which is preserved in a codex of the St. Gallen [Abbey] Library. Epitaph on Hildegard, together with a necrology entry and a building inscription for the Fraumünster Church. These artful lines of the monastic author stand in stark contrast to the current representatives of monasticism, fattened by idleness, who love nothing less than education and scholarship. Bullinger knows better about these [discussed] middle ages of the Franks and Alemanni, Vadian asks for occasional advice and for a Latin copy of the founding charter of the Reichenau Monastery; he suspects that such a copy is in Bullinger's possession, as he has sent him a German translation, presumably made by himself; Vadian also asks for the chronicle [of Hermann] the Lame from Bullinger's library, if he cannot obtain it from another source. Thanks for a letter from Bullinger, which Vadian received together with a hekatostichon made by [Simon] Grynaeus. Emperor Charles [V.] is on his way to Nuremberg with a large escort, the Papists want to prevent an agreement; greetings, also to wife and children as well as to colleagues. Enclosure: Three documents translated by Vadian concerning the Grossmünster and Fraumünster of Zurich: 1. List of possessions of the Grossmünster, 2. Confirmation by Duke Berthold [V.] of Zähringen regarding the election of the parish priest by the canons of the provostry of Zurich and the appointment of two assistant priests, 3. Foundation of the Fraumünster Abbey by Louis the German.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. I return to your kindness those Frankish antiquities, namely copies of old documents, which I read with great pleasure and not a little benefit, and I have complied with your request to translate them into several letters. However, in translating them into our language, I was forced to act as a kind of paraphraser to achieve clarity of meaning, since rendering word for word was not possible without revealing ignorance and barbarism. Those centuries, far from being cultivated, had scribes of such a kind in the courts and councils of princes as no other, either ancient or recent, are recorded to have had. The roughness of the language was such that they could not report anything clearly or with the unoffensive simplicity of words in writing. Meanwhile, no one wrote anything in the vernacular language, which was so harsh at that time that it could not even be expressed orally without great hissing, yawning, and grimacing, let alone conveniently depicted with a pen. However, I have changed some persons, as in the donation of Louis the Younger at the beginning, where it seemed to me more appropriate to refer the common sentiment, which the scribe used as a preface, to all liberal princes rather than to Louis alone.</p>
      <p>For the sense has more gravity when rendered in this way, so that the reward of heavenly things is understood to be set for the liberality of all, rather than attributed to one alone. But it will be your judgment to either leave these things as they are or change them according to your opinion.</p>
      <p>As for certain words used by the old Franks and Alemanni, I would not easily respond to your request unless you allow room for conjecture; for we will use this more safely, even if we hold more things clearly and well known. First, indeed, the scribes did not seem to me to have used the word "praedium" ineptly, however insipid and not barbaric, since by the name of "praedium" as a general term, they signified fields, gardens, pastures, willow groves, vineyards, buildings, and other things of that kind included under the name of "fundus," which are in our possession. Indeed, both Salic land and allodium and mansa could be counted among the praedia. For although allodia were the noble's, as certain patrimonial goods held not by anyone's favor but by a certain right, so to speak, of their own, yet from the law concerning allodium, which exists among the Alemanni, unless I am mistaken, it appears that others also had allodia. I accept Rhenanus's conjecture that the word "allodium" originated from the fact that these goods were, as it were, joined and united to families, "anlodt." The Alemanni called a fund with a small villa "mansum." Barbarian scribes, who used any terminations for themselves without rule, also called it "mansam" and even "mansos," which we find in several charters. For some were so unskilled that they did not hesitate to write "clostarnum" with a Latin declension for "claustro." However, purer old tables produced "mansum" in the masculine gender and in the fourth declension.</p>
      <p>Indeed, fields in that nation were of various rights; many were called fiscal, whose revenues served the prince's treasury. These, when donated to colleges or monasteries, were called ecclesiastical; but those bought arrogated the same name to themselves; their servitude was such, and it is still in many places today, that even when sold and alienated and made private possessions, they must pay a certain sum of money to the churches or monasteries in whose original possession they were, as often as they receive a new tenant. Those fields are called in our language "eeerschetzige hofguͤter." Salic land or Salic earth was free from that servitude. Salic was the same as Frankish; for the chief of the old Franks were surnamed Salingi; for the Salic law was given by them, which was also diligently observed by Beatus Rhenanus, a man of great judgment. We call Salic land in our language "freylehenguͦt" and also "frey aigenguͦt." This kind of field was sometimes leased in perpetual possession with a certain condition of returns and cultivation, indeed on the condition that neither the tenant nor his descendants could be changed or deprived of possession unless they violated the lease agreement, either by not paying the returns on time or by neglecting the estate or any part of the estate being sold without the owner's knowledge or burdened with new usuries. Therefore, the tenants also gave receipts, in which the agreement and condition under which the field was leased were guaranteed, which today are commonly called "reversbrief" in our language, and the lease itself is called "erblehen." A field leased and assigned under this law was called "vectigalis" by the ancients, which Paulus the jurist elegantly described. We read his words in the title: "If a field is vectigalis, etc." in the sixth book of Justinian's Pandects. However, it was not vectigalis if it was leased under the law that it was in the owner's hand to change the tenant and take away the field whenever he pleased. Justinian's age made the rare and indeed Greek word ἐµϕύτευσιν frequent from the verb, I think, ἐµϕυτεύω, which means "to insert" or "to implant," because in this kind of lease, the field could be seen as inserted and implanted into the family's possession, so that it could not be removed by right unless the lease agreement, as we said, was violated. Ulpian used this word "De rebus eorum, qui sub tutoribus" etc. in the third law, penultimate. In the sixth book of Justinian's Code, the emphyteutic right is commonly called in the published books. Alciatus in the first book of παρέργων confirms that it should be read and pronounced not as emphyteutic but as ἐµϕυτευτικὸν according to the Greek language; for ἐµϕύτευσις is grafting and implantation, by which a plant grows to the trunk so that it not only adheres but also makes one tree. Therefore, we still call emphyteutic in German "erblehen recht," and the emphyteutic field in Justinian's age, which was leased by emphyteusis; we call it "erblehen" in German from inheritance, because that right of perpetual lease passes to the heir and descendants. The Franks and Alemanni embraced this very field with the word "mansus."</p>
      <p>Furthermore, those centuries almost always attributed a "mansus" to churches to be established and donated, namely for the sustenance of the priest who was imposed on it; for this reason, the ancients called them "kelnhöf" from nourishment, namely from the part of the throat and stomach, which we call "gula" in Latin, but in our language "kelen." These "mansus" were once sacred and annexed to the parish, so that nothing could be taken away or alienated from them except with great benefit to the church. Later, monks, inflamed by that plague of incorporation, so that nothing integral would be left to the churches of Christ, took away those "mansus" from many churches, especially those whose right of collation, as they call it, they had received from the Roman bishop either by prayer or price, not without increased revenues. The word "kelnhof" is still known today, especially among the Benedictine communities.</p>
      <p>Therefore, to continue the subject, the Franks called a "mansus" a "hof," whether it was an "eerschetziger hof" or an "erblehen g[uͦt]" or a "freylehen," but Salic land was called a "fry aigen guͦt." For this was properly called Salic, whose possession only males from the inheritance could enter, with no portion at all pertaining to females, provided there were males whose inheritance was just, as was stipulated in the Salic and Alemannic law.</p>
      <p>There is frequent mention of Salic land in the charters written under Pepin, Charles, Louis, the Fat, and Arnulf, kings and emperors of the Franks. The donation charters of that age were called "chartae," many of which still exist in the monasteries of Alemannia.</p>
      <p>And these things indeed incidentally about the "mansus" or "mansa," as it is written in your tables.</p>
      <p>Now a few words about the "curtis." The corrupted word "curtis" meant the same as "cors," by which word, although it signifies a place for poultry and congregation, yet among the Latins, it also means a gathering of people, indeed in some place associated and as if cohabiting, although the name "cohort" is more commonly used than "cortis." For Cicero, in the fifth action against Verres, if I remember correctly, takes that word in a bad sense to signify a gathering of people associated for some base cause, while Caesar takes it in the same sense but in a good sense. Certainly, it happened in this way that the Frankish scribes sometimes called the king's palace a "curtis" (as in the law "If anyone commits theft in the king's curtis"), sometimes a district or village consisting of several buildings, and they called a small villa with few buildings a "curtilem" (for the old charters also use this word). However, it could have happened that they also took "curtis" for a "mansus" or a place of domestic pastures, but the more frequent use retained the aforementioned meaning and the one we will soon explain. And I remember reading, unless I am mistaken, the word "cohort" in a similar sense in the last three books of Justinian's Code, but in which title or law or where it was, it did not occur to me while I was writing this. It should be noted incidentally that the word "curtis" among the Franks and Alemanni, who were also counted in Eastern Francia, did not simply signify a place where many lived in groups or the people themselves living together, but also the authority and jurisdiction, furthermore the ownership of slaves and generally that possession which jurists call "integri status." Authority, as we learn from the first book of the Digest, title "De iurisditione omnium iudicum," is twofold, namely pure, which is used against criminals and is properly the use of public judgments. This authority is called in German "das hochgericht" or "die hoch oberkhait," which counts in many places of Alemannia were once administered in the name of the kings. Authority becomes mixed when jurisdiction is added to pure authority, "wan man in ainer herschaft hoch und nidere gericht hat," such authority undoubtedly existed in his curtis in Thurgau, which Louis, who established the monastery of nuns, had. Different from those is that part of justice administration which is joined to no authority and is called jurisdiction, commonly "die ainigen nidern gericht" or "das ainig nider gericht," where there is no power over any crime, such jurisdiction was often granted to cathedrals and monasteries by kings and attributed to churches, while no one even thought about granting or accepting authorities. For that middle age religion, however afflicted and corrupted, abhorred authorities and judgments of blood most of all, which most of the towns of Germany did for many centuries.</p>
      <p>But it happened later that both monks, blinded by ambition and the desire for license, and bishops sometimes proceeded to buy and make their own mixed and pure authorities under any pretext, although this happened late. However, I think that no curtis was without jurisdiction and that by that name it was signified what we call in German "ain vogtey" or "gerichtz[wang]" with ownership of people and fixed (established) revenues and rents, with fixed pot and verpott, etc. Indeed, I think that often a "curtilem" was called jurisdiction with ownership of slaves and a certain part of revenues by the Franks and Alemanni. However, the royal curtes were by far the greatest and of the most extensive right and also had authority with slaves, fields, pastures, taxes, hunting, fishing, and all that possession of the entire status we mentioned, etc. Others, meanwhile, were smaller, sometimes with the right of jurisdiction alone with ownership of services and possession of the estate. Hence, in those old tables of the Franks and Alemanni, we often read that curtes were bequeathed with slaves, forests, waters, and watercourses, and the estate itself with slaves and jurisdiction was understood to have been bequeathed by donation. Alemannia, which was a large part of what is today called Helvetia, was once full of slaves and servitudes, nor is there any non-mountainous district, as far as I know, which did not serve that harsh servitude when the Franks flourished.</p>
      <p>For there are old tables that testify very clearly about this matter, and the defiance of the tyrants: "Kutlen (entrails) and khat (dung) in your belly are ours," etc., has been raised and brought down by a praiseworthy Confederation. However, curtes and, which were much larger, pagi, which the Germans call "gegni" (regions, districts) or "geuw" (Gaue), were distinguished by certain boundaries in the kingdoms of the Franks and Alemanni, which they themselves called "marcae," as is very clearly understood from almost all the tables. Counts presided over the pagi, and there were many curtes in one pagus, and in a curtis, there were several buildings, villages, and farms, in all of which distinct and carefully administered judgments were exercised.</p>
      <p>There are also some other words that frequently occur in those old charters and are also found in our donations, among which are these: vestitura, advocatus, bannus, fredum, distringere, and several others of that kind, which are explained more easily, I think, than those earlier ones. For vestitura is the same as investiture, that is, the granting or confirmation of possession, which those centuries also called a benefit and a fief with a word born and introduced by the Franks, which we today call "lehen" or "lehnsbestätung" in German. However, the name of investiture is very common today and has a place in matters both profane and ecclesiastical. Distringere meant to summon to court or cite, which is clearly understood from the laws of these times. For both the Salic and Ripuarian and Alemannic laws are filled with a wonderful and almost inexplicable barbarism of things and words, in which the word distringendi is frequent. Fredum was called what we today commonly call "friden." For that most fierce people, almost born for arms alone, was perpetually restrained by the care of the kings with fredum, lest anything be done by force or arms that would harm public tranquility. This custom was also observed by the Germans for many years after Frederick the First, whom the Italians nicknamed Barbarossa, in all of Germany, and we still usually call those public laws or pacifications, which restrain armed force, "fridstand" or "landtzfriden." The scribes did not only signify peace with this word, but also the fine that the laws imposed on the violator of peace. Hence, we often read in the Frankish and Alemannic laws these words: "And let him also pay or settle the fredum," that is: Let him pay the fine for the violated fredum, using the word "componendi" for the word "transigendi." Nor is the penalty light today for violating even privately ordered peace, if anyone breaks the peace that is commanded or imposed on him with words or deeds. In your city of Zurich, the penalty of death is imposed on one who violates the fredum by inflicting a wound. There was a greater and a lesser bannus; the greater was also called dominicus, that is, issued by the king or emperor's command. Both were redeemed with a certain sum of gold and silver. However, rarely and only for significant crimes were offenders punished with death by the Franks and Alemanni. Almost all punishment was pecuniary. Of a different kind is the bannus, which we signify with the word proscription and call in German "die acht" or "dess reychs acht."</p>
      <p>These are the things we had to report about those words at present. However, we have explained more in the books we have written about the old colleges and monasteries of Germany, of which if I ever have the opportunity to publish, you will learn these very things and some others not entirely commonly known, explained more diligently than could be done now. Regarding Berchtold, Duke of Zähringen, whom one table mentions, I thought it necessary to note that he was the ruler and duke of Burgundy, not the great one, which was once a famous kingdom, but of the part that extends on this side of our Jura into the Allobroges and Valais, which today is almost entirely held by the Bernese, Solothurn, and Freiburgers, and there are also German tables that call this Burgundy "in Bürgünden"; this was also called Vüthlandia by the Alemanni, today Üechtland, the origin of which name Rhenanus has certainly indicated. Berchtold had his palace in a castle that was plainly royal, under which today lies the famous town of the Bernese dominion, commonly called Burgdorf, "und ist alle landtschaft hie disset (diesseits) demm Läbern" (for thus the Jura mountain is called by the inhabitants in that region) "umb Bern und Soloturn bey der Aren und den Nüwenburgersee uf biß an Walliß und den Genfersee hin etc. in Burgünden gelägen."</p>
      <p>Regarding that Thurgau prefecture, which he himself mentions in his letters translated by me, Otto of Freising has noted some things in his chronicle, which we know you have at hand. Now, as for the word "redibitionis" read in the donation of Louis the Younger, who was the son of Pius, I thought it necessary to note that the Franks and Alemanni used not only their own laws, which seemed to be established only to restrain the common people, but also Roman laws, especially those introduced by Justinian, which is clearly evident in all the tables, and from there several legal terms were inserted into their tables.</p>
      <p>Redibition, as defined by Ulpian, was the dissolution of a purchase; when a purchase was annulled or canceled and the seller was ordered or rightly shown to receive back what he had sold. In this matter, amazing frauds were committed by buyers, especially in returning slaves as defective or such that for their sake the purchase was judged not to be valid. For often purchased slaves were either pledged or committed theft with the owner's knowledge, the actions of which later fell back on the returned slave and consequently to the detriment of the owner and property. There is a title in the 21st book of the Digests "De aedilitio aedicto et redhibitoria," in which much mention is made of that multiple fraud, especially in the law "Redhibere" in the same title. The same deceit occurred in the removal of guarantors, which the same table mentions. Guarantors were removed, as I conjecture, when a legitimate guarantee was dissolved as unjust and against the law, just as in redhibitory cases a just and legitimate purchase was sometimes dissolved as unjust. And since Berchtold's confirmation mentions chapels whose revenues were owed to the parish priest, it is not about urban chapels, which were then either none or few, but about those that were built here and there in the parish and nearby Thurgau countryside and then obtained parochial rights, as they call it. I send you among the last things an epitaph of Hildegard, the first abbess of the Fraumünster monastery in Zurich, written by a monk from our monastery, which I do not know whether it was sent to Zurich and is seen written or carved there in any place or not, which I read written in these words in a certain codex of our library: On the 10th day before the Kalends of January, Hildigarda, a virgin of Christ and daughter of King Louis, departed from this world to Christ and was buried in the church of St. Regula and Felix (Fraumünster Church), martyrs of Christ, in the castle of Zurich. Here lies in the tomb the most worthy virgin of Christ, Hildigarda, shining with excellent morals.</p>
      <p>This was the daughter of the illustrious King Louis She had vowed her mind to God of her own accord She had completed twice ten and eight years of life Departing to her blessed spouse.</p>
      <p>In the same book, this eulogy also appeared: She founded this holy temple on a firm foundation With her pious father Louis, prince of the land, Hildigarda, powerful, most illustrious virgin of Christ, To whom God grants the joys of eternal life.</p>
      <p>Thus once our monks played with numbers and verse, devoted to letters and the muses, as in a public and famous school, while ours today, fattened in idleness, cultivate far different muses and love nothing less than letters. But enough of these things.</p>
      <p>Whatever I have written, I send to you, lest I fail to gratify you, a most excellent man, to whom I have long confessed I owe much. For I have no doubt that the centuries of that middle age of the Franks and Alemanni are more familiar to you than they could have been to me from any observations. Therefore, I ask you to consider these things written incidentally kindly and to send me the Latin example of the foundation of the Reichenau monastery; for I conjecture that you have the Latin one, since you sent me the German one, which I think you translated. If I cannot obtain the Chronicle of Hermann the Lame from another source, I will request it from your library.</p>
      <p>We received your letters the day before yesterday with the most elegant hekatostichon of our Grynaeus, and I was amazed that you could find so much leisure to serve us with your own hand.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us, except that they say Charles the Emperor, having passed Heidelberg, is approaching Nuremberg with a large and varied retinue.</p>
      <p>In this, however, all the papists are, lest any peace be granted to our people. But we promise ourselves the best things from that noble and gentle prince, indeed agitated by many stinging goads of counsel, but to this day alien to internal arms, with great hope. But if the peace of the world cannot befall our people, let the peace of Christ suffice for us, the prow and stern of our salvation. Farewell with your wife and children and with the college of most esteemed brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, on the 8th day of February in the year 1541.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his own.</p>
      <p>1. Carolingian Donation.</p>
      <p>In the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity. I, Charles, by divine mercy Roman Emperor, augmenter of the empire, with the counsel of my bishops and other princes and at the earnest request and desire of certain pious Christians, who with their own goods, which they have now recognized or may yet recognize, located in many and various places, with our permission, so that they may free their souls from sins, are willing to give and provide to the churches and burial places of the saints, have ordered and commanded this our instrument and business letter to be drawn up and established, namely for the elucidation and investigation of the goods (of the churches of Zurich), where the holy martyrs have buried their heads, cut off by the command of the tyrant Decius, from the river called Lindmagt, forty cubits away to the plain of the nearest hill, with their hands, and there, together with their bodies, through the help of Christ, the grace and providence of God, have been laid to rest for the improvement of all believers in long-lasting peace.</p>
      <p>Therefore, now we, for the honor of God and out of love, which we bear to the holy martyrs, the siblings Felix and Regula, for the improvement of the nourishment and maintenance of the choir brothers there (as they then, according to the regular rule, walking and confessing the praise of God the Lord seven times day and night) and that they may henceforth remain and continue without lack and want in perpetuity, have here commanded and decreed by imperial power that the aforementioned gifts of God, together with the goods and gifts that our ancestors have given to the aforementioned mother and church, shall belong and remain to the same church henceforth and always without anyone's interference and error, together with the gifts that our bishop of blessed memory Theodorus at the time, when the church was consecrated, as he had received them from us before, has given to the aforementioned church, namely the village of Rieden located on the Albiss with people and goods in mountain and valley, which belong thereto. Item at Höngg two fiefs and a half fief outside the free fief of Frankish goods, as he has received them from my hand into his hand (as is customary). At Zurich located some separate goods with vineyards and fish, together with the mills and the tithe, which we have ordered and provided from our courts and bailiwicks of the free fief goods to the table of the canons, namely from Stadelhofen, from Wibicheta, from Östen, from Illingen, Velland, from Mür, from Hövstetten, from Meilen, from Boswil. But the tithe, which comes to us from all the region and parish there, I have confirmed and returned to the aforementioned mother and church for free possession. To all this, Picho, the son of Ertilonis, in our and our presence, for the sake of his soul and his ancestors' salvation, has given to the aforementioned choir brothers as his own and handed over for perpetual maintenance all that he has held at Schwamendingen and in the surrounding boundary in mountain and valley. Likewise, Isenbert, for the discharge and recompense of his prebend, has given a farm at Wollisseld. Item Comolt, the priest, has given to the church and the brothers all that he has possessed at Flobotisrein and in the same boundary. Similarly, the cleric named Helfrych, to commend himself to the brothers and the assembly, has given to the church and the brothers all that he has possessed at Rüty and in the same boundary. Furthermore, the young man Frieso, son of Lady Perchta, has given to the brothers all that he has possessed at Meyla and in the same boundary. Item Peringhart the layman has given to the brothers all his possessions in Fenkhland and the same boundary, what he has possessed therein. One also of the brothers has handed over a farm located at Boswil with people and goods to the church. And these gifts and named goods have all been given and donated to the church with people, with buildings, with ground and degree, with fields, meadows, pastures, with wood in mountain and valleys, with water, watercourses, with built and unbuilt, whether they are now recognized or may yet be recognized, with entrance, exit, and all appurtenances, with the clear command and order of Emperor Charles, that the brothers, who are now living or will be there in future times, shall be confirmed and remain in the aforementioned gifts and goods without anyone's interference and error, and no one shall have power or authority to withdraw any part of the aforementioned goods from the church or to give them to anyone else and to lease them, or to burden the aforementioned brothers with any complaint or innovation in any way or manner. All this has been done and given at Zurich in the tenth year of our empire, the Roman census number (indiction) 13, counted after the birth of Christ eight hundred and ten.</p>
      <p>2. Letters of Berchtold, Duke of Zähringen, concerning the parish of the greater monastery of Zurich.</p>
      <p>In the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity. I, Berchtold of Zähringen, duke and ruler in Burgundy, by the grace of God and the emperor chosen and appointed castellan of the monastery of Zurich, to the venerable lord Walther, provost of the aforementioned monastery, and to his other brothers. So that the things, which are brought to an end with good consideration for the sake of many, may be confirmed with due freedoms and may not come into any forgetfulness or danger of any hindrance, we hereby make known to all Christians: Since the parish of the provostry of Zurich from the beginning of its foundation has been provided by the brothers of the church in such a way that all the canons have diligently and faithfully performed and shared their due and diligent service to the common people of the parish (as true shepherds are required), yet in the course of time it has happened that the common people of the parish have requested and asked for a special (own) pastor and have also desired to place him under special protection and care. Therefore, we, considering that such a request and desire is not contrary to the provost and the brothers and with the consent of their bishop, and we have also permitted it by imperial command, the aforementioned canons have chosen one of them as pastor and unanimously accepted him, so that in future times no one else may be chosen for such an office than only the one who is from the number and community of the canons and brothers. And since (as the scripture says) he who serves the altar should also have his nourishment from the altar, a special entrance from the common aforementioned church goods has been assigned and marked out for the aforementioned chosen pastor for the sake of his nourishment, in the measure as follows and is written. Namely, first the foundations of all the chapels of the parish and the tithes of the whole village of Witliken, likewise half the offerings and alms, which the sick in dying needs are accustomed to give and provide for the sake of their soul's salvation. With this measure and elucidation, that a rightly chosen pastor, after he has been admitted by the provost and has come into possession, shall always have two priests with him and shall diligently fulfill and provide the pastoral rights together with them, etc. Since now we have been asked to establish and confirm such an order and that the aforementioned canons may henceforth and no one else have the choice and appointment of a pastor and be protected in this, with our letter and seal to establish and confirm, we have, considering the reasonable request of the brothers, granted them the free choice, and that a provost alone shall have the chosen pastor appointed and confirmed, with this our given freedom granted, to give and confirm with the document and in the power of this letter, also granting and confirming that by imperial permission, of which we are confident in this our bailiwick, to the highest commanding, that none of our successors shall undertake to challenge, hinder, or disturb in any way this our confirmation. Therefore, we have also granted for greater security that this undertaken order may be further confirmed and established with imperial and papal instruments. Given and done in the presence of the witnesses written below, Walther, the provost, and all his brothers (etc. as in the letters).</p>
      <p>3. Donation of Louis the Younger, who was the father of Charles the Fat.</p>
      <p>In the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity, Louis by the grace of God king. Since it is openly and to all believers known that those who, out of royal generosity, give and order the earthly goods, which have been shared and assigned to them by the providence of God's goodness, to the holy places for the praise and honor of God, will be repaid and richly rewarded with heavenly goods and eternal recompense in the next life, we hereby make known and declare to all present and future Christians that we, for the sake of eternal reward of the illustrious Emperor Charles, our dear ancestor, and Lord Louis, emperor and augmenter of the empire, our dear lord and father of blessed memory, and ourselves together with our children and spouses eternal reward and happiness, have given, provided, and handed over our court and bailiwick at Zurich in the duchy of Swabia (or Alemannia) and in the district of Thurgau with all ownership, rights, and appurtenances together with other administrations belonging to this bailiwick, namely with the little land at Ure, with the church seats, with houses, buildings, which are there, together with the ownership of the people, male and female, young and old, with ground and soil, whether built or unbuilt, with forest, with field, with meadow and pasture, with water, with watercourses, with appurtenances, roads, entrances and exits, whether they are now recognized or may yet be recognized, together with all taxes, revenues, and rents, also the forest, which is called the Albiss, together with all that is the administration, possession, and ownership of that place, nothing excepted or set aside, to the Fraumünster in the place of Zurich, where the holy martyrs St. Felix and Regula rest, given, provided, and handed over, in such a manner and form that henceforth in perpetuity there shall always be spiritual women there, who are subject to the rule and monastic discipline and other spiritual conduct, received and maintained, so that the service of God and the veneration of the aforementioned martyrs may be performed and fulfilled with greater devotion at the aforementioned place and the mercy of God may be more diligently and richly prayed for our and our people's guilt. Therefore, we hereby make known and declare to all that we, moved by paternal affection for the aforementioned reason, have given and handed over the aforementioned monastery with all appurtenances and endowments to our dearest daughter Hiltgard as her own home, so that she may preside over the aforementioned women, keep them under her discipline and rule and order, and thus serve, live, and die for the Lord with the help and grace of God, and may preserve, increase, and improve the spiritual monastic discipline with daily growth, as much as God gives grace. Therefore, we command with earnestness and will that no common judge or count or anyone else shall undertake to challenge, trouble, or summon to any foreign court any of the aforementioned goods or people, whether they are owned or free, from the jurisdiction of the aforementioned places, nor to withdraw them from the surety of upright purchase or to harm them with the announcement of honest purchases, nor to compel any compensations, fines, and severe penalties from them, nor to undertake to burden them with any violent means, but we will and shall let them remain in our protection and care and given freedoms and in the administration of the castellans, who are given to the monastery there, peacefully and without challenge at all times. And so that this our gift and order may have lasting force and stability, also in present and future times as much more respect and belief, we have signed this letter with our hand and had it confirmed with our seal, which is given on the 19th day of August in the 20th year of our East Frankish empire at Regensburg in the city, in God's name happily. Amen.</p>
