    <p xml:id="regest1">Finally, God has averted the danger from His church, after the departure or even the violent expulsion of Farel seemed inevitable. This would have had serious consequences for the church, yet Farel never wavered in his determination. God's work can be seen in this, and the pleas of the people of Zurich and others contributed to it; their letter to the people of Neuchâtel [No. 1585] greatly delighted and encouraged them. Besides the danger posed by [the Turks] and the plague, it was especially the looming uprising against Farel that prompted them to earnestly admonish their congregations. Even before the writing of the people of Zurich, an extraordinary communion had been celebrated throughout the Neuchâtel region, during which many who had been led astray came to their senses; also, sermons, [Farel's] visits to the sick, and his friendly dealings with opponents contributed to this. When the deadline set by the Bernese mediators expired, the letters from the pastors and the council of Zurich [Zurich StA, B IV 12, 23v.-24r.] were already present; the decision about Farel's stay was initially postponed to [November 27]. The Bernese council wrote to Neuchâtel, stating that they had not intended to push for Farel's departure with the earlier arbitration award. After a majority in the assembly - in the absence of the governor [Georges de Rive] - voted for Farel's stay, the conflict would have been settled if the opponents had not caused new unrest after the governor's return. They eventually succeeded in having Bern hear both parties again through envoys. Towards the end of January, both sides presented their positions in Bern, after which an assembly was convened to find a final majority. The representatives of both sides had already agreed in advance on Farel's stay, but some opponents wanted to be exempted from attending his sermons due to a rashly sworn oath; however, at the assembly [on January 29], Farel's supporters prevailed with a clear majority. The pastors of Neuchâtel report so extensively on this because they want to share the joy of God's support with the people of Zurich. Like King [David], they wish to praise God for His victory over Satan together with them. They assure them of their gratitude and willingness for mutual service and remain united with them in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Greetings and thanks also to the Zurich council.</p>

      <p>Greetings, grace, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Finally, at some point, most gracious and highly esteemed brothers in the Lord Jesus, it has pleased our most merciful Father to not only console and restore His struggling church but also, as we trust, to completely deliver it from that most severe danger in which it has been involved for such a long time, not without our deepest sorrow. In this matter, who could be so dull as not to marvel greatly at the power, goodness, and providence of our God, who knows how to assist His own so opportunely and wonderfully in the utmost despair of circumstances? For in this affair of Farel, our excellent brother, where the authority of this most sacred ministry was at risk, we saw the situation brought to such a point that even the best among us, except for one or two, thought it expedient that he, with the good peace and testimony of the city, should leave the administration of this church and move elsewhere as soon as possible. Indeed, we sometimes feared that the matter might turn to arms and civil war due to some rash fury and tumult.</p>
      <p>At that time, whoever considered only human strength and plans expected nothing else than the imminent expulsion of our brother at any moment. Although this seemed desirable for him in a human way (for it brought great peace of mind and body, indeed, according to the word of Christ, happiness and glory), nothing appeared more miserable or sorrowful for us or our churches. For what, by the immortal God, would have become of us insignificant men if he, upon whom, next to God, all the churches of our language rely as a most solid pillar, had been removed from his place? How could we have long remained safe in this ministry with any sense of purpose or courage? But the Lord God, who had set His servant as a bronze wall, had armed him with such strength and constancy that he was prepared to stand manfully to the very last drop of his blood for the defense of the church and the preservation of the sacred ministry. And although to many it did not seem of such great importance if he departed peacefully and with everyone's favor, he always had this on his lips, that he would rather undergo a thousand deaths, if it were possible, than consent to anything that would allow the church of God to suffer any harm, especially where the most sacred right and honor of the divine ministry might be violated in any part. Therefore, whatever happened, he was never cast down from his perpetual firmness of mind: but the more desperate the cause seemed, the more steadfastly he persisted in his purpose. But why so much, most gracious brothers?</p>
      <p>Namely, so that we may continually acknowledge, praise, and admire such great grace and virtues in His servants. For whence, I ask, have these great gifts come if not from that eternal source of all good things? How few, unless thus fortified by the divine spirit, would not have turned their backs at the first or second attack? O truly magnificent and wonderful Lord in all His works! O with what counsel has that eternal wisdom provided here! For He did not wish His church to be shaken by such a bitter wound, especially at this time, when He has shown us such great hope of more widely spreading the kingdom of His gospel. In this matter, we do not doubt that the prayers of you and other excellent brothers have greatly helped. For what shall we say of your letters which you wrote to us and our senate and people with such diligence? How timely, how at the very moment were they delivered to us? What could have been more useful, more delightful to us from the best and greatest God, especially in those most miserable and turbulent times? Nor is there any doubt that they were divinely written by the inspiration and influence of the Holy Spirit: so much so that they contained nothing that was not spiritual and divine: they were so pious, learned, full of brotherly love, unadorned eloquence, divine counsel, sincere doctrine, and finally all consolation and most holy admonitions. In sum, we dare to affirm before God and the Lord Jesus that no letters have ever been more joyfully received by us, more willingly heard, or more beneficial for teaching, consoling, or strengthening the minds of all our people. For although the matter itself, both from the person and the cause, sufficiently urged us to never fail in our duty, yet your letters somehow added such great incentives to us that whatever we had done before in that matter seemed to be nothing, or certainly very little, and we thought it our duty, as you most sacredly admonished us through those letters, to apply much greater care, zeal, and diligence to the cause itself.</p>
      <p>And indeed, at that time, both privately and publicly in sacred sermons, we had already taken pains to admonish and exhort the people so that almost everyone would strive to turn to the Lord, so that the most gracious Father, appeased by the prayers of the faithful, would cease to strike His people and finally be gracious to all and especially to this His church. We were strongly impelled to this by the common necessity of the whole church. For we clearly saw how many and great calamities were pressing upon it from all sides. In particular, we heard that most savage tyrant, whom no one does not know to be the most bitter enemy of every nation that professes the name of Christ, was almost threatening our very heads. Moreover, we saw that the plague, with which the hand of the Lord had long and widely scourged His people, was raging most atrociously everywhere, and that it had already begun to affect not a few in this city as well. These and other scourges of our God, as we said above, moved us not a little to diligently and carefully exhort the flock of Christ to pray piously. But most of all, we were incited by the affair of our excellent brother, as it was the first and most commended among other matters.</p>
      <p>For it was quite apparent that there would be a great stumbling block and irreparable disaster in the churches if such a great servant of God, upon whose ministry the authority of all of us, next to God, depended, were forced to leave this church of his, commended to him by Christ in so many ways, without cause, through faction and tumult. But to return to our purpose, by our exhortation of this kind, the Lord had so affected the minds of the whole people before your letters that with the greatest consensus and with the greatest love and zeal for piety, the Lord's Supper, established outside the usual order and times, was celebrated openly not only in this city but also throughout the entire Neuchâtel region. This indeed brought us no small consolation and aid to the cause, because many simple people, ignorant of that satanic deceit (who at the beginning had been seduced and corrupted by the authors of the tragedy themselves under the appearance of truth), at that time came to their senses and confessed their error and fault. Thus it happened that the cause itself, which seemed almost hopeless, showed hope and evidence of better success for the future. And now, by the grace of God, the people were flocking more fervently and in greater numbers to hear the word, and the success of the matter was increasing daily: not only from the preaching itself, but also because the most vigilant pastor himself visited each sick person daily to comfort them with all duty and love. Added to this was the fact that, according to Christ's command, as each one was most hostile to our brother, so he pursued them with the greatest benevolence and strove to bestow many benefits, especially when illness or any other necessity offered an opportunity to do good to someone. Thus it happened that, with the help of the Lord God, the ferocity of minds was gradually softened, and the matter itself seemed to incline entirely towards the highest concord.</p>
      <p>And indeed, things had been almost like this for the entire span of two months, during which (as we had written to you before) this very controversy had been suspended by the pronouncement of the Bernese envoys. But when the end of that time was approaching, behold, our messenger, having just returned from you, was present with us with your letters and those which your diligence had arranged to be written publicly by your city. When these were delivered, it seemed good to the magistrate that both senates should be convened within a few days. However, on the day they were convened, nothing was done about the cause due to the infrequency of senators: it was only decreed that on the next day of Christian vacation, the senate and the entire people should convene. Meanwhile, the Bernese had been so affected by the letters they had received from your senate that they quickly summoned our Farel with a messenger and public letters. After hearing his most serious speech in the senate, they immediately sent the messenger back to this city with letters in which the meaning of that pronouncement, which we mentioned above, was more clearly explained. For they had heard that it had been misinterpreted by our adversaries, who said that it had been pronounced that after those two months had passed, our Farel would peacefully and without any controversy lay down the province of ministry only in this city. This, therefore, was the sum of those letters: Whatever had been pronounced before about Farel's cause by our envoys, the senate intended it to be for the purpose of quelling the present fury and tumult of the people, and meanwhile, if possible, for the people themselves to return to favor with their pastor. What remains, you will have done us a great favor if, consulting for concord and the public good of the churches, you retain that very pastor of yours and, having confirmed his ministry, live with him henceforth in unity. These letters of the Bernese were approved with wonderful applause by almost the entire assembly. The people decided, according to the sense of the letters, that the pastor should be retained and confirmed in his ministry forever. Furthermore, by the consensus and votes of the people, the senate and the four consuls decreed that a reply should be written to the Lords of Bern in the same sense. Letters are written, sealed, and immediately given to the messenger. There were few from the opposing side who said that the absent governor of the province should be awaited, and that the reply should be deferred until his arrival, because he had pronounced with the Bernese envoys about that two-month delay. Therefore, since those few dissented from the common opinion, they left the court against the will of the magistrate. Hence it happened that later various but slight dissensions arose, and that concord, although publicly established, was disturbed and could not remain sufficiently ratified and firm. Thus, the sum of the matter was again prolonged for a long time. However, from that time on, our side was always far superior in both number and the authority of persons. What need is there for words? Unless he had returned who had been the leader and author of this faction from the beginning, albeit secretly, it had already come to the point that the entire dissension was almost hoped to be buried. But upon his arrival, those remnants of the factious immediately approached the man, devised new plans, renewed their forces, murmured, caused tumult, addressed each one, collected votes individually, harshly rebuked those who had defected, solicited the Bernese, in short, mixed and disturbed everything. You would indeed say that Satan had either then released someone from prison or certainly broken open a huge dungeon.</p>
      <p>For they had this very person whom we mentioned a little earlier as their absolute instigator, not just a supporter, who secretly assisted with both counsel and all other means. It would be too long and difficult to recount individually what they had attempted, what plans they had taken, to either completely annul or certainly infringe upon that aforementioned decree of the senate about retaining Farel. Ultimately, however, by their importunity, they persuaded the Lords of Bern to send other envoys again, who would diligently investigate whence this new tumult had arisen, and then faithfully report the known causes to the senate. The envoys were most gravely and steadfastly answered by our side that it was by no means proper to rescind what had been recently transacted by the legitimately convened senate and people of Neuchâtel: nothing here had been done either by deceit or force or secretly: therefore, it was necessary to stand by those letters which had recently been sent publicly to the Lords of Bern by decree of the senate, by which matters it was sufficiently established and ratified that Farel had been retained and confirmed by public consensus in the administration of the Neuchâtel church. To this, they added that they would rather leave their lives and whatever the Lord had given them than allow such ignominy and atrocious insult to be done to the gospel of Christ and its ministers. On the other hand, the other side, since they already perceived themselves to be inferior in every way, no longer seemed to labor greatly about expelling the pastor, but complained about some words which they affirmed had been spoken publicly to their disgrace. Thus, with this contention prolonged for several hours, the envoys returned home with the matter unresolved.</p>
      <p>But finally, towards the end of January, a few from each side were chosen and sent to Bern to discuss these matters. The Bernese senate, having heard the arguments of both sides, when it saw that it was scarcely possible for the controversy to be resolved otherwise, decided that in the assembly, which would be held eight days later, the matter should be contested by votes, and thus the side that prevailed would achieve its desire, unless perhaps in the meantime the Lord showed a better way of restoring concord. If the latter happened, the Neuchâtel people were instructed to immediately send a messenger to Bern about this matter: if not, a delegation would come from Bern to Neuchâtel to be present at the assembly as if to witness and testify. Therefore, within those few days, when twelve from each side had been chosen to whom the sum of the matter was entrusted, and various conditions of peace had been proposed from both sides, it had already been agreed between both parties that Farel would remain permanently, and that all would acknowledge him as the true and legitimate pastor. But one thing finally stood in the way, that some from the opposing side demanded that they should not be compelled to attend his sermons.</p>
      <p>For they were bound by a religious obligation due to a certain rash oath concerning this matter, by which they had bound themselves to each other from the beginning of the discord. But our side plainly refused to admit that condition. For it was against good morals and Christian religion; and it seemed likely to be a kind of seedbed and origin for always stirring up new schisms. Finally, therefore, as had been decided by the Bernese, the matter was brought to the votes of the people. Our side was superior by almost half.</p>
      <p>The matter was concluded (which we must attribute solely to the Lord) so easily, so peacefully that now it did not appear that any dissension had ever intervened. We have explained these things in more words, most excellent brothers, so that ignorance of this history may not cause you any trouble.</p>
      <p>Written on the day before the Calends of March, given on the sixth day before the Calends of April in Neuchâtel, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your most loving brothers in name and most ready for every duty towards you in the Lord, and fellow ministers, the Dean and the other ministers of the Neuchâtel class in the word of the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed pastors of the Zurich church, adorned with all piety, learning, and love, in the Lord Jesus. In Zurich.</p>
