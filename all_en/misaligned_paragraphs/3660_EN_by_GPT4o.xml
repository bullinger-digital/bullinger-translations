      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, minister of the church in Geneva, my most faithful teacher and brother, to be honored with perpetual respect. In Geneva.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I have already written to you some time ago, most illustrious man, about the diet of this kingdom to be held this year, in which it seems that not a little hope is placed by all the pious. The adversaries, sensing this, are taking care to delay it with as much effort as they can. Meanwhile, the harvest here is plentiful everywhere, and many are daily coming more and more to the knowledge of the gospel, and they are joining the church of God. In Greater Poland, there are many of ours, but some are more attached to the Bohemians than is reasonable: others, however, to the Saxons themselves, among whom is the illustrious Stanislaus von Ostroróg, Castellan of Międzyrzecz, who among all the noble men of Greater Poland, both in the splendor of his lineage and also in authority, easily holds the first place, not to mention his prudence, eloquence, magnanimity, power, and liberality. He does not seem so obstinate that he could not easily be led, with God's help, to a sound opinion on the Eucharistic matter. For he listened not unwillingly to Mr. Johannes a Lasco, whose niece by his sister he married, when we were recently with him, and he holds him in high regard, and when I recently mentioned your memory to him, he said your letters would be pleasing to him, and he would gladly reply. Therefore, if you were to write to him and kindly invite him to some agreement with Mr. a Lasco and with the brothers of Lesser Poland, you would undoubtedly be doing a service to the church of Christ the Lord. If he could be won over in this part, a very great addition would indeed be made to the church, especially in Greater Poland. For he alone is recognized to draw a great part of the spirits with him.</p>
      <p>All his preachers, whom he has in his domains, do not disagree with our opinion, except for one superintendent who is said to have gone to Wittenberg for the sake of studies.</p>
      <p>Mr. Johannes Boner, Baron of Balice, Castellan of Biecz, etc., who indeed conducted himself manfully not so long ago, and quite steadfastly against Zebrydowski, the Bishop of Kraków, now commends himself to your prayers there, and through me, he very kindly conveys his regards to all of you. If you also have the time to write something to him, to encourage him to strength of mind and Christian constancy, I ask you not to hesitate to do so. For there is no doubt that much importance is placed on that man.</p>
      <p>Mr. Johannes a Lasco on the eighth day of this month gave his eldest daughter in marriage to Mr. Stanislaus Lutomirski, a royal secretary, pious, learned, truly noble, and a man of great renown.</p>
      <p>How little the bishops congratulate these nuptials, I leave to you to consider. For he, as always until now, while he still held a canonry, opposed the Antichrist strenuously at great expense to his affairs, and now also opposes with an unbroken spirit, and faithfully performs the ministry of the word.</p>
      <p>The rest will be narrated by our messenger Sebastian, whom I commend to you with all the zeal I can, and I ask you again and again to not fail to support his studies with your advice. For there is no doubt that, with God's help, he will be useful to the church of Christ the Lord. If I can serve you in any way in return, I would like you to be assured that I will never fail your requests in Christ the Lord. We are now sending to Mr. Crispin the history of our English pilgrimage to Denmark to be printed, truly worthy of being made known to the whole world. It was indeed extorted from us, even against our will, by the excessive impudence of the adversaries, which was so great, after those otherwise truly pitiable events of ours, that it could no longer be suppressed without the utmost pain of the brothers everywhere, and the greatest insult to our church and our ministry, and finally to the cause itself. Nor does Philip Melanchthon himself advise that we suppress it any longer, especially since Westphalus has burdened us with so many slanders, who is now said to have written something against you again. Moreover, from that history, it will be easily known what kind of person Westphalus is.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, in Christ Jesus, to whom I commend your labors from the heart, that He may sanctify them and bless them for the perpetual increase of His kingdom. Love me as you are accustomed, and commend me to God the best and greatest with your prayers and pious sighs, and expect every return from me.</p>
      <p>Mr. Stanislaus Lasocki, who easily holds the first place in true piety among all the nobles here, asked that I wish you all happiness in his name and write you many greetings. Near Kraków, July 30, 1558.</p>
      <p>Yours as much as he is, Johannes Utenhove.</p>
