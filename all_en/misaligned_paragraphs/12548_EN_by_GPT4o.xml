    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has presumably not yet been able to respond to Myconius' last letter [No. 2491] due to the lack of messengers caused by the [Baden] Diet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Myconius had asked Bullinger about the Nurembergers. In the meantime, he has heard nothing good about them. They remain the same in their talkativeness!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Duke [Maurice] of Saxony is said to have secretly departed from Regensburg, raging at home against the treachery of Emperor [Charles V.] and being fully armed. May it turn out well, also for the other Protestant princes!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- A knight from Basel coming from Regensburg [...] reported that [Charles V.] and his brother [King Ferdinand] joyfully celebrated the wedding of [Ferdinand's] daughter, [Anna of Austria], with [Albert], the son of [Duke William of] Bavaria, and that the Emperor said he did not know why the [Schmalkaldic League] was so active, as he did not wish to harm them. Myconius was initially beside himself but then replied that he would tell this fox his opinion with God's help if it were in his power. Does he think the Germans are stupid?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- A carter [...] reported about the [Netherlands]. The Black Riders, whom Charles V. had made available to [King Henry VIII of] England [against France], are said to have been shipped to Spain. The road to Basel was, however, safe. It is also known that Strasbourg is sending mercenaries to [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Yesterday it was reported that the small town of Füssen, along with three castles, was taken by a commander [Sebastian Schertlin] and the imperial army fled from there to Bavaria.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Some expect nothing good from the Five Places. However, Myconius will learn more after the conclusion of the [Baden] Diet. If only the [Five Places] would realize that Charles V. with his letter to the [Confederates] wants nothing but to sow discord!</p>

      <p>Greetings. You remain silent regarding the last matters; which I do not wonder about because of the Diet, as it seems to be the reason why no messengers come from there to us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I had inquired about the Nurembergers; but in truth, I have learned nothing good about them. They remain true to themselves. They have never pleased me. Besides their talkativeness, I do not know if they have anything else that could make them appear to be something.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I had also inquired about Duke Maurice, but in the meantime, I hear this: He secretly escaped from Regensburg with only four horses and is now raging at home against the treachery of Emperor Charles and is fully armed; may this be fortunate and auspicious for him as well as for the other princes who stand by evangelical justice, I hope.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>But listen to what a knight from Basel, coming directly from Regensburg, reports. The Emperor, he says, lives happily with his brother. They celebrate weddings as usual. For the Bavarian has married his son to the daughter of the king. Nothing about war, except that the Emperor says: "What are they doing? Who stirs them up, when I neither harm nor attempt to harm?"</p>
      <p>Indeed, upon hearing this, I was unable to speak out of anger, until finally, after somewhat regaining myself, such words escaped me: "If I were who I am not, Charles would not dare to despise me so. I would bet on the wedding, then God would help me. Should Germany be mocked like this?" The fox uses his tricks. For he tries to instill weariness in our people, if he can finally oppress them unawares. But I hope the Lord will give counsel, by which the trickster will finally be expelled.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>A carter carrying Saracens was asked what was happening in Lower Germany and replied: "Nothing, except that the Black Riders, who have so far served the English sent by Charles, are crossing over to Spain, where the Emperor needs their services. Otherwise, our journey was safe." This he said, while it is known that the people of Strasbourg are continually sending soldiers to Hesse, certainly not without reason.</p>
      <p>Yesterday it was reported that the town of Füssen was occupied by the Duke with three castles. And the Emperor's army, gathered there, escaped and went to Bavaria, with the Duke following. I do not know if it is true or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Some do not predict well about the Five Places. However, I hear nothing certain yet. I await the end of the Diet. Unless they have rightly considered the present matter, it could happen that it will turn out to be a misfortune for the whole country. If only they understood that Charles, with his letters to our people, wanted nothing else than to foster discord among us! May he go where he deserves!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell in Christ with your family and all brothers. In Basel, hastily, July 15, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Pasquinade to Charles of Ghent</p>
      <p>When you decided to destroy the German nation</p>
      <p>And wish to be a traitor in the place of a protector,</p>
      <p>I predict for you that for such cruel deeds</p>
      <p>The fate of your maternal ancestor awaits you.</p>
      <p>Os. Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most learned D. Heinrich Bullinger, brother and lord in his Christ. Zurich.</p>
