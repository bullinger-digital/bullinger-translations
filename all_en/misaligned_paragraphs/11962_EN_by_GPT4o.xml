However, he does not know how to show his gratitude other than with a sincere disposition and the assurance of his loyalty. He wrote to Pellikan about the tactics used in the persecution in [Italy] and hopes for God's intervention in this tragedy, provided that the Christians remain steadfast in faith. At the Diet of Speyer, the Papists and their followers suffered a defeat. Will gladly assist Bullinger if needed.

He abundantly testified to who you are towards me; I cannot help but, to avoid the vice of ingratitude, thank you for wishing to include an unknown person like me in the number of your friends. What I can give in return, I truly do not know; only a sincere heart remains, which I have decided to devote to you. I pray, accept this, and be assured of this from Merbelli, as sincerely as you can, you will not be deceived.</p><p>I have discussed with Pellikan the persecution that the pious suffer here for Christ's sake; such tactics only deter the weak and fearful, but not the steadfast. God will one day destroy such cruelty.</p><p>For it is the duty of a Christian to endure any adversity with a strong spirit and patience, to place firm hope and trust in Christ alone, and to leave vengeance to Him to repay. I hope that God will soon put an end to this tragedy.</p><p>At the Diet of Speyer, I hear that matters have reached a point where the Papists and all who adhere to Babylon have almost despaired, having long fled with hands and feet, unable to escape any longer; like butter in the sun, they will melt away. God will preserve His powerful word against all the gates of hell.</p><p>Accept these few words and keep Merbelli, as you have begun, inscribed in your book. If there is anything I can do here for your sake, command it, and you will know Merbelli in action. Give my greetings to Theodor Bibliander and commend me to him. May God preserve your church in purity.</p><p>Farewell in Christ.</p><p>Milan, 18th of May, 1544.</p><p>Your most obedient, Pe. Merbelli.</p><p>To the distinguished theologian, president of the Zurich church, Heinrich Bullinger, a candid and esteemed lord and friend. In Zurich.</p></div></body> The translation is now aligned with the original letter's paragraphs. Each paragraph in the translation corresponds to a paragraph in the original letter.</letter>
