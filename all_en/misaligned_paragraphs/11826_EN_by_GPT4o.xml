    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes to Honter at the suggestion of Martin Hentius about several points on which there is agreement in the Swiss churches. They consider private or auricular confession as a non-apostolic human invention, which is why it has been completely abolished; only the personal confession of the individual before God and the general confession of sins at the end of the sermon have been maintained. While Gratian in his decree only vaguely refers to auricular confession, Peter Lombard considers it a prerequisite for entry into paradise, which obviously contradicts the biblical testimony that recognizes only Christ as the mediator; later, Pope Innocent III issued a law at the [Fourth] Lateran Council, which was included in the decretals under Gregory IX, obligating the faithful to auricular confession at least once a year. The defenders of auricular confession refer to the Church Fathers, but confession of sins was part of the penitential discipline with a different character in ancient church times, as Tertullian, [Eusebius], Sozomen, and [Pope] Leo [I] testify; from this non-apostolic tradition, the various [Roman Catholic] acts of satisfaction developed, which directly threaten to overshadow the unique act of redemption by Christ. Auricular confession also does not contribute - contrary to the opinion of its proponents - to the improvement of discipline, as the disgraceful excesses of this practice show; the public communal confession of sins and the confession of the individual before God suffice, especially since the believer is free to seek a conversation with a pastor or fellow believer in individual cases; the [Swiss churches] cannot be reproached for the abolition of auricular confession, considering the abolition of this practice by [the Patriarch of Constantinople] Nectarius due to a single scandal. Private absolution is also a human invention without biblical precedent, for what is absolution other than the forgiveness of sins, which only Christ can effect? The proclamation of this message should be done publicly following the example of the apostles and does not need a private setting. The images have also been removed from the churches by [the Swiss churches] according to the Word of God and apostolic custom, for no form whatsoever can adequately depict the divine majesty or even the saints. The objection that the Bible does not forbid images altogether, but only pagan idols, carries no weight, for the judgment of the Bible also applies to our images, and the opinion that images serve for admonition and edification has already been rejected by Athanasius. We simply say that the Lord builds up His people with His Word and the symbols He has instituted, not with paintings and other images; why did Jesus send preachers into the world, not painters? That the early church did not use images is testified by Epiphanius and Augustine, and Erasmus is also convinced that this was not the case until the time of Jerome; in particular, images of Christ are inadmissible; Bullinger has written more extensively about images in the first book of his work "On the Origin of False Belief." Earthly goods are absolutely necessary for the work of the church; whoever denies this and wants to force the church into poverty is its enemy. However, the distribution of church goods must be undertaken by suitable persons who are free from greed, envy, and wastefulness and who are accountable to the church and the council to prevent abuse. Church goods are primarily to be used for the adequate maintenance of pastors, teachers, and students - if schools are neglected, suitable pastors will soon be lacking - and also for church buildings, libraries, and care for the poor; however, it is sacrilege if they are misappropriated by priests and monks or by princes and councils; Bullinger has written more about the use of church goods in his work "On the Office of Bishops." Asks Honter to continue his work as before and offers his help; Honter should also make the content of the letter known to [city] judge Johannes Fuchs and the other friends. Greetings; recommendation for Martin Hentius.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior.</p>
      <p>Although you are unknown to me by face, most pious Honter, you are very well known to me by the illustrious fame of your name. But our beloved brother, Mr. Martin Heintzius, who came to us this summer for the purpose of discussing and visiting our churches, gave me the occasion to write to you. He said it would be most pleasing if I would send you something concerning the common cause of religion, and when I inquired about what I might write most usefully, he enumerated certain points, about which I would not only express my own opinion, to teach you who are otherwise most learned, but also explain what all the pious among us in the churches of the Swiss think about them. Therefore, out of zeal for piety and a certain singular love towards you, I decided to send you these few things; I pray you will consider them favorably according to your humanity.</p>
      <p>Regarding auricular and private confession, we all feel it is a human invention; therefore, we have abolished it entirely. However, we have retained private confession, where each person confesses their sin to God in private, whenever the good spirit of God and repentance through faith stimulate them. We have also retained public confession, where publicly in the church at the end of the sacred sermon, all together make a confession led by the minister. And these forms of confession, as necessary and confirmed by sacred scriptures, are urged by all the ministers of the churches.</p>
      <p>We abolished auricular confession because no example or trace of it is found in apostolic writings, and it is a mere human invention with impiety connected to it.</p>
      <p>Gratian, the author of the Decretum, who lived around the year 1150, does not define or prescribe anything certain when he discusses confession made to a priest, but after proposing or enumerating ecclesiastical writers on both sides, and that confession should be made to a priest and that it should not be made, he leaves the judgment free to the reader, saying: "To which of these should be adhered to, is reserved to the judgment of the reader; for both have wise and religious men as supporters." These are read near the end of Distinction 1, On Penance. But who would believe that Gratian left the judgment of confession to the free judgment of readers if it had been believed in his time that confession was of divine law?</p>
      <p>However, Peter Lombard in his Book of Sentences, Distinction 17 and 18, after a lengthy discussion on this matter, says: "It is certain that it is not sufficient to confess to God without a priest and that otherwise one cannot reach the entrance to paradise." Here he assumes and claims as certain and indubitable what still needed to be proven and confirmed by the holy scriptures, indeed it manifestly contradicts scripture, which says it is not sufficient if one confesses to God and not also to a priest. For the prophet David pronounces differently in Psalm 32, saying: "I said: I will confess my transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave the iniquity of my sin" [Ps 32:5 (Vulg. 31:5)]. The apostle John also pronounces differently, saying: "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" [1 John 1:9].</p>
      <p>Moreover, it is impious, it instills a false, indeed harmful confidence in the hearts of men, that he added that access to paradise is opened to us through this confession. For Christ is the door, the gate, and the way to heaven for those who believe in God through him; he is our priest and high priest, present to us by his spirit, so that we need no auxiliary priest, to whom by recounting our sins in the ear we prepare access to paradise by that work.</p>
      <p>Christ by his death and resurrection opened heaven to the faithful and transferred the thief straight from death to life, confessed to him alone, that is, to Christ, promising the same to all who repent and confess in the manner of the thief. And although Lombard wrote thus about confession to be made to a priest, it was not yet commanded to the faithful. Only fifty years after Lombard, Innocent III made a law at the Lateran Council, ordering everyone to confess their own sin to a priest at least once a year.</p>
      <p>The law is verbatim included in the Decretals by Gregory IX and exists in the book On Penance and Remissions, book 5, chapter 12, "Omnis utriusque." But no one who has seen that law is ignorant of how absurd, foolish, and rash many things in it are. Therefore, we have lawfully and for just reasons abolished that auricular confession entirely through our churches as contrary to sacred writings, instilling false confidence, and invented by human complacency outside the word of God and apostolic example.</p>
      <p>But they object that the most ancient doctors of the church frequently mention confession, from which it seems likely that its institution is not new. To which we respond that exomologesis was a rite among the ancients, consisting of certain ceremonies and thus a discipline. This can be seen in Tertullian's book On Penance near the end; its example exists in Ecclesiastical History, book 5, last chapter. Isidore, certainly a writer of the middle ages, in his book Etymologies 6, chapter 18, almost repeats Tertullian's words: "Exomologesis," he says, "is the discipline of prostrating and humbling a man, lying in sackcloth and ashes, obscuring the body with filth, casting down the soul with sorrows," etc. This pertains to what Sozomenus reports in the Tripartite History, book 9, chapter 35, saying: "It seemed good to the ancient bishops that sins should be revealed as if in a theater under the testimony of the ecclesiastical people," and what follows. The same author also states that this custom or rite was changed in the Greek church. Something of this was also relaxed in the Roman church, as can be gathered from a certain fragment of Bishop Leo in Gratian, On Penance, Distinction 1, chapter "Quamvis," and also from his letter to Theodorus of Foroiuli, which is number 69. However it may be, it is certain that even that rite was not received by apostolic tradition. It is certain that from it those formulas of satisfactions arose, which directly tend to the detriment of the unique satisfaction through Christ Jesus; it is also certain that those indulgence markets were finally drawn from the same rite by those greedy ones. Hence, by not using even that in our churches, we do not sin against the example of the apostolic church, which we propose to follow especially. Meanwhile, we speak of penance and works worthy of penance as we have learned from the books of the prophets, the sermons of the Baptist and the Lord Jesus, and from the writings of the apostles.</p>
      <p>Now, as some not unlearned people think that private confession should not be entirely abolished, first because of discipline or shame, for which many sin less, second because of private absolution and the consolation of the gospel, this is such that it cannot convince the reluctant. For if private confession is so useful to the church, as they want it to seem, how is it that the church has lacked such a useful thing for a thousand years and more? What kind of discipline private confession planted in the church of the Lord is proven by the impure crimes and the more closely wicked. Both the confessor and the penitent learned from that discussion of circumstances horrendous crimes. Causes and occasions were supplied for adulteries; for often even the chastity of the most chaste matrons was tempted, often the integrity of maidens was plotted against. But they do not want sins to be digested by circumstances, they do not want all to be enumerated. To which we respond: Therefore, public confession, which is made openly in the temple with the minister leading, suffices for God from all and each of us. Or who, I pray, commanded or whispered certain or specific things in the ear of the minister? Meanwhile, no one is prohibited from seeking counsel in certain cases either from the minister of the word or from another brother aware of their will.</p>
      <p>However, we prohibit imposing certain and prescribed laws on the whole church about confessing sins to the minister. And although the reason of discipline may require confession, certainly private confession had a good appearance from the beginning among the ancients; what kind it acquired in succeeding times, no one is ignorant. But since the nature and disposition of our flesh is the same and almost everything becomes worse over time, it is to be feared that even from the remnants of private confession some plague may invade and affect our descendants. Therefore, if that most holy Greek bishop Nectarius with the famous church of Constantinople escaped the judgment of heresy, because he abolished the rite of exomologesis entirely due to a single adultery of a matron brought by a confessor, certainly no one can accuse our churches of heresy because we want no trace of auricular and private confession to exist in our churches. Indeed, it is a great achievement if we cease to sin out of the shame and carnal modesty of one man, not out of sincere fear of God, when we do not fear to have God as a witness of our conscience, when we do not tremble at his judgment! Add that leaving that private confession makes us confess to God more rarely; for whenever the knowledge of sins comes to mind, we will postpone it to that time designated for confession. But when that time comes, how many, I ask, approach confession with a cheerful mind? All wise people easily judge from these things what kind of shame can arise from confession. Moreover, the apostolic church, wanting to celebrate the sacred supper of the Lord, was content with that public confession of crimes; therefore, the same suffices for ours.</p>
      <p>And concerning private absolution, what they bring forward is a human invention, having no example or command in the sacred writings. But what is absolution other than justification, that is, liberation from the penalty that was due to us because of sins, and thus the remission of sins? This is conferred on the church by Christ the Lord alone by the merit of his passion through faith. The minister announces and testifies from the word of the gospel that sins are forgiven to believers through Christ.</p>
      <p>But who would believe that this message and this preaching become more effective because of private preaching? "But he," they say, "who approaches absolution understands that it now pertains to him." As if no one could understand this from public preaching. Therefore, it was badly done with all those to whom the apostles preached absolution from the beginning. For nowhere did they privately call individuals and whisper in the ears of bishops: "The Lord Jesus forgives you your sin if you believe in him." For they announced this openly and simply in public discourse, as can be seen in the example of Peter in Acts 2 and in the example of Paul in Acts 13 and 16. Therefore, public absolution and preaching, by which we testify to each of the faithful through Christ that sins are forgiven, suffices for the church, nor does it become more effective if we whisper it in the ears of sinners.</p>
      <p>And so much for confession.</p>
      <p>We have once and for all removed images from the temples, not looking at anything here but the word of the Lord and the rite of the ancient apostolic church. You are not ignorant of what scripture says about images of God and creatures in temples: it prohibits them entirely in Exodus 20, Isaiah 40, Romans 1, 1 John 5. For no species, form, or material can express and depict the majesty of the eternal deity. Since Christians do not worship any creature, no matter how holy, they do not place the image of any creature in the temple for the sake of worship, unless it is done for the sake of decoration, as Solomon is read to have carved oxen, lions, and birds in the instruments of the temple, who nevertheless placed no pictures or statues of Abraham or Moses. For what is chief in the saints, the mind, soul, and spirit, cannot be expressed by any colors, at least the image of the perishable body can be depicted, although even that does not properly express the appearance of the saint, I do not say now the vegetative or animal life, but not even the appearance or form it had while living. Therefore, the prophets most truly called images of all kinds lies. They cannot provide what they seem to promise, they cannot truly express those whose images they have.</p>
      <p>What some object that the scriptures do not prohibit images of all kinds, but only the idols of the Gentiles, is a most vain argument. For what the sacred writings say against idols also applies to our images, unless someone wants to say that our images have mouths and speak, have ears and hear, etc.</p>
      <p>Most therefore finally resort to saying that the office of idols in temples is nothing other than to admonish and instruct. But Athanasius testifies that even the Gentiles used this very pretext in his book Against the Gentiles, in which he also refutes that latest invention. We simply say from the scriptures that God fully revealed his will to his people on Mount Sinai and then indeed only a voice was heard, no form of God was seen, to teach the Lord's people that they should be instructed by words and symbols given by him, not by pictures and images. Moses dealt with this matter more extensively in Deuteronomy 4.</p>
      <p>And now the famous prophet Habakkuk: "Woe," he says, "to him who says to wood: Awake! And to the silent stone: Arise! Shall it teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath in it. But the Lord is in his holy temple" [Hab 2:19f].</p>
      <p>What, that the Lord Jesus himself sent preachers into the world, not painters?</p>
      <p>Concerning the primitive church, it is certain that it had no images in the temples; indeed, Epiphanius, bishop of Salamis in Cyprus, and St. Augustine count those using images of Jesus the Savior, St. Paul, and the Virgin Mother among heresies and heretics. But Erasmus in his Catechism, catechesis 6, disputing much back and forth about the use of images in temples, is nevertheless compelled by the evidence of truth to admit among other things that up to the time of Jerome there were men of approved religion who tolerated no image in the temples, neither painted nor sculpted nor woven, and not even of Christ. Of whom we especially believe none should be tolerated, first, because he is true God, and no statue or image should be placed for God; second, because he is true man and did not assume his humanity for this purpose from us, to become the archetype of painters, but to deliver the body given over to death for our sins, resurrected for our justification, and place the pledge of our salvation in heaven. Therefore, he openly professed that his carnal presence would not benefit the church. If the figure itself does not profit, the figured, that is, the empty picture and statue of the crucified, profits even less. Third, because he left us his word, by which he most holy and truly expresses himself to us in our hearts. He left us his holy supper, the breaking of bread, by which he presents and represents the whole power of his passion to our eyes with this saving symbol. What then would empty and inept idols of the Lord Christ do in the churches of the saints, where the word of Christ is preached and the supper of Christ is exercised? "What agreement," says the apostle, "has the temple of God with idols?" 2 Cor. 6 [16]. But I have written copiously about images in the first book of our work On the Origin of Error.</p>
      <p>We believe that earthly goods, that is, estates, houses, lands, revenues, and taxes, are absolutely necessary for the churches of God, and we feel and believe that a new contribution should be collected from the faithful where they have not been previously arranged by the liberality and foundation of the fathers. For the faith of the evangelical and apostolic histories, as well as the authority of the most ancient ecclesiastical writers, teaches us that the apostolic church and indeed Christ with his disciples had wealth for necessity and the relief of the poor.</p>
      <p>For the enemies of the church and wicked men are those who strive to reduce the church to beggary or to deny the church altogether.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the administration of the church's wealth should be referred to men of proven faith, such as those first stewards were known to be from Acts 6.</p>
      <p>Let faithful, merciful elders be chosen from among the saints, who are experienced in administration, free from greed and envy, from luxury and hypocrisy. Let them be chosen from among the senators, the learned, the common people, that is, the most suitable men, of whatever condition and status they may be. To these, the administration of ecclesiastical goods should be entrusted by the magistrate and the pastors of the church. Let them give an account of each year to the pastors and the magistrate, so that no fraud or malice of private individuals is admitted.</p>
      <p>Let the stewards expend the church's wealth first on the ministers of the word, schoolmasters, and students, each as much as is sufficient, where both luxury and malice must be equally guarded against. For there are ministers who abound to luxury; there are others who, although they have what to eat, are still in need of other necessities.</p>
      <p>For they cannot be so hospitable as to be able to provide for their own children as craftsmen do. Equality should be observed, especially since the apostle in almost all his epistles exhorts the churches not to be sparing and malicious towards the ministers of the word. Now, unless schools and scholars are liberally provided for, the crop of the church will perish in the grass, and within a few years, we will have few or no suitable ministers of the word and churches. And those who founded the old colleges and monasteries wanted nothing other than to establish Christian schools, from which at some time pious and learned, and also prudent men would be called to the ministry of the church. Let the ecclesiastical stewards also expend the church's wealth on the repair and maintenance of the temple and public church buildings, to acquire useful books for the church and school, that is, to prepare libraries. Finally, let them expend on the needs of the poor of the church, orphans, widows, the elderly, the sick, and travelers. If anything remains beyond this, let it be reserved for public calamities to be repaired. Indeed, priests and monks who are nourished by the church's wealth and especially abuse it for luxury are sacrilegious; and princes and magistrates who, having despoiled them, convert and collect the church's goods into their own treasury, neglect the church and allow it to be in need, are sacrilegious. The Lord approves justice and equity.</p>
      <p>But I have written more extensively about the use of ecclesiastical goods in my book On the Function of Bishops.</p>
      <p>These are what I had, most illustrious Honter, to give you concerning those certain points and to signify the opinion of our church on these matters. I urge your piety to diligently continue to care for the business of truth and the safety of the church, as you have done so far. You understand what reward you expect from the highest God; you understand that he will not fail you with his spirit and most powerful help.</p>
      <p>You will also preserve your own soul and your most beloved country. And if anything can be accomplished by our work for you, we all promise help and counsel.</p>
      <p>I wish, however, that you share these things with the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Fuchs, the judge, my most esteemed lord, and the other pious and holy men, with whom we wish you to fare well in Christ, as many as serve the church of Zurich, Gaspar Megander, Mr. Pellicanus, who, I believe, will also write, Rodolphus Gwalther, Mr. Theodorus Bibliander, Erasmus Fabritius, Johannes Jacobus Ammianus, Otto Werdmüller, Rodolphus Collinus, Mr. Conradus Gessner, and the other brothers. We also commend to your faith Mr. Martin Heintzius with all the faithful ministers of the word.</p>
      <p>Zurich in Switzerland, August 28, 1543. Yours sincerely, Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Johannes Honter of Kronstadt, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
