      <p>Greetings. To my fathers and brothers in the Lord, whom I hold in the highest regard, nothing would have been more desirable for me, so often and in so many ways endangered in France, than to be aided by your counsel and refreshed by your exhortations.</p>
      <p>But with all roads beset by robbers, I could scarcely and with great difficulty write here once or twice, and for eight whole months, I could not receive even a word from you. Thus, I first heard in Strasbourg of the death of our most excellent and in every way best Martyr, a wound that, although shared with the entire church of God, was particularly grievous to me in the fresh memory of his most delightful and useful companionship, which I will certainly preserve perpetually, as I ought.</p>
      <p>Therefore, to return to the matter at hand, I do not doubt that you will interpret my prolonged silence favorably.</p>
      <p>Now, having returned home, that is, to the haven of this church, by the singular grace of God, where shall I begin to speak? These matters require not so much a letter as an entire volume, and would that someone be stirred by the Lord to explain this whole history, which is certainly the most memorable ever, truly and diligently to our age and also to posterity.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I will briefly summarize the events that followed our battle, in those places where I was involved. For otherwise, there is no region of France that could not provide material for a particular history.</p>
      <p>A little after the battle, of which you have already abundantly learned the form and outcome, our army, led by the Admiral, crossed the Loire River below Orléans and invaded the province they call Sologne, and after capturing several towns, almost entirely subdued the Bituriges under the very eyes of the enemy.</p>
      <p>A few days later, Guise advanced very slowly, having sent the king and queen ahead to Blois and Amboise, and placed our prince Condé safely between those two cities, and occupied the very city we had crossed a little earlier, called Beaugency, seven miles below Orléans, without any trouble, so that he might have free access to besiege Orléans or pursue us.</p>
      <p>When the Admiral saw this, he stationed his army, now refreshed, in another city, Gien, five miles above Orléans, with a bridge, so that he might both assist the city if it were besieged and confront the enemy wherever they might choose to attack.</p>
      <p>Thus, several days passed, consumed in fortifying Orléans, with our forces not at all avoiding battle, while Guise was contemplating anything else, namely, by what means he might draw away the German cavalry, to whom three months' pay was owed, from us, and capture the city by treachery rather than open force.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Admiral, leaving all the infantry in the city, which numbered about four thousand, and appointing his brother Andelot along with several troops of noble French cavalry as the city's prefect, marched straight towards Normandy with the remaining forces, that is, more than four thousand well-equipped cavalry, across the plains of Beauce, to receive money and new soldiers from the English. Our journey was safe and peaceful, with no one daring to oppose such a large force.</p>
      <p>But neither had the money been brought to the port of Le Havre, nor had any new soldiers crossed from England. Moreover, the winds were most adverse, which brought our affairs to the brink of disaster, as the foreign soldiers were threateningly demanding their pay, and therefore we could not in any way assist the city, which Guise was meanwhile pressing very hard. But even within the very heart of Normandy, Ringrave was maneuvering with a not insignificant army, with the Seine River lying between his forces and ours, and one of Guise's brothers, whom they call the Marquis, had recently entered the fortress of Caen, a very fortified and nearby place, to hinder all our plans.</p>
      <p>Behold, while we were entangled in these extreme difficulties, and were waiting for favorable winds from England on the other side of the Seine, whose estuaries blocked us from the port of Le Havre, the brothers who had been miraculously preserved by God at Caen until that day, asked the Admiral to assist them against the Marquis, and at the same time informed him that the fortress could be easily captured, being fortified but held by an unskilled leader and few soldiers.</p>
      <p>Therefore, having received five cohorts of English infantry from the port of Le Havre, and several soldiers from Dieppe, which was another more distant port captured by our forces a month earlier, and with the very brave leader Montgomery joining us, we marched straight to Caen with eight heavy cannons. The city was immediately handed over by the brothers, the walls of the fortress were battered, so that on the second day after the assault, against all expectations, it voluntarily surrendered to us.</p>
      <p>Those inside were released with their arms, but were later stripped by our cavalry and treated very badly, as the disaster at Rouen was still fresh in their minds. Moreover, this victory so broke the spirits of the enemy, especially with the news of Guise's assassination, that within ten days we not only recaptured thirteen famous cities, including four episcopal seats, but also the Cenomani, Angevins, Poitevins, Touraine, and all neighboring peoples seemed to be entirely under our control.</p>
      <p>While these events were taking place in Normandy, Guise captured the suburb of Orléans, which the Loire separates from the city, along with the bridge's castle, partly through the negligence of the garrison soldiers, partly through treachery. The citizens, on the opposite side, suddenly demolished several arches of the bridge, raised embankments, and fortified the island that divided the middle of the bridge, bravely withstanding the assault, until our victorious army arrived, when behold, God raised up another Ehud for us, who, by killing Guise, would not only free that city but all of France.</p>
      <p>From that time, while we, having finally paid our soldiers, rushed to aid the besieged, peace negotiations began. Condé and the Constable first met on the island, with mutual trust given to their guards, at the queen's behest. The next day, he crossed into the city to our forces, and the other to the queen across the Loire to take counsel, and thus finally, with that one removed, with whom alive a firm peace could in no way be established, the conditions of peace were written, a copy of which we believe has already been delivered to you.</p>
      <p>The Admiral arrived when it was already concluded, so eager were the enemies to forestall our return, and at first, indeed, those conditions seemed harsher to us, especially since we held complete victory in our hands; but finally, with better hope given to us, lest we seem to have sought the ruin of our country, we also acquiesced. A little later, the remnants of the Spaniards were sent back to Spain by the river, and both armies gradually dispersed; however, the Swiss and also the German cavalry on our side were retained to intimidate those who refused to accept the conditions of peace.</p>
      <p>Now, therefore, the leaders are intent on ensuring that peace prevails with all tumults quelled. The Parisians, although included in the peace, and many others following their example, most stubbornly oppose Christ. But I hope that soon they will pay the penalty for their obstinacy and that the kingdom of Christ will prevail despite their resistance; for throughout this war, God's singular kindness towards us has been observed, and all the leaders of the enemy, who were of any authority, have either been slain or reduced to such a state that they are not greatly to be feared by us, and with Prince Condé himself sitting with the principal leaders of our party at the helm of the kingdom, I can hope for nothing but the best, unless perhaps the magnitude of our sins impedes the course of divine mercy.</p>
      <p>For such is the character of our king and even of his brothers, which should not fail to promise certain and great increases of piety to all the godly. May God, the best and greatest, grant that we, united in His gospel, may serve His glory in holiness and righteousness! Meanwhile, brothers, since I was not dismissed from this church under any other condition than that I should return to it as soon as possible, I have gladly returned to my station, in which I have resolved to remain as long as it pleases the Lord.</p>
      <p>As for what was later decided about the tyrannicide, I assume you have heard. At first, indeed, he named Lord Admiral along with several others, including me by name, as accomplices. We responded with the truth, and he himself later abundantly cleared us before the judges. He was then handed over to the Parisian senate, that is, to the most savage enemies, not so much to be judged as to be tortured with every kind of cruelty.</p>
      <p>Thus, shortly after, above almost the very corpse of Guise, he was first lacerated with a hot iron through each part of his body, then, with his right hand amputated, he was torn apart by four horses, and the crowd, not content with this unheard-of cruelty, did not cease to rage against the parts of his dismembered body until nothing at all remained of it. He himself is said to have been no less brave in all these torments than in the very act of the deed, and even dying, he is said to have clearly predicted the imminent destruction of Christ's enemies.</p>
      <p>These are the wondrous and hidden judgments of God, to whom be praise and glory forever. You have, brothers, a brief and unpolished history of many things, such as it was possible to write suddenly and on the spot, with the courier hastening, who appeared unexpectedly. I ask that you take everything in good part, and as I have continually experienced you doing in reality, so also henceforth commend me to the Lord, that He may look upon wretched me and bless our labors.</p>
      <p>I, in turn, pray to Him, most esteemed fathers and brothers, that He may protect you unharmed, and extend His kingdom as far as possible through your industry and diligence, to the glory of His name and your consolation. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Geneva, May 12, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Théodore Beza.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed servants of Christ, brothers, and fellow ministers, the pastors and doctors of the church in Zurich.</p>
