      <p>S. Your letters, in which the best hope of stable peace was revealed, arrived just after the supper had been completed, most reverend father, providing me with a convenient opportunity to interpret them to all the people of Chur, among whom were several senators. They all received this hope with great applause. But by then both the count and Abbot Theodor had already departed; otherwise, we would have ensured that this most sorrowful news would have reached their ears.</p>
      <p>On August 24th, after having bathed quite comfortably, we rose at dawn, ready to leave these most healthful springs; but behold, as we were preparing to depart, we were suddenly surrounded on all sides by the most rapid torrents, which unexpectedly rushed down from both mountains on either side, sweeping away everything in their path. The very bowels of the mountains were torn out, so that the enormous rocks, gathered together, exceeded human belief both in number and weight.</p>
      <p>I saw and touched one that was 7 feet wide, 16 feet long, and in height equaled the stature of a tall man; this one rolled very close to the bathhouse and was embedded in the ground. It was almost taken away along with the embankment, suddenly removed.</p>
      <p>Everyone was forced to leap from the springs and seek a safe place, which we barely found. You would have seen a miserable scene here; for with three embankments thrown up as a bulwark for that building, along with the market stalls torn apart and suddenly demolished, the very hypocaust, which the abbot occupied, began to be undermined by the immense force of the water, and we were miserably thrown from our elevated bed. All the places of all the houses were emptied of their contents, belongings, and little children, and everything was carried to the mountain tops, from where the whole drenched company looked down on the ruin and mass of waters. Here you would have heard the cries of women and children, the terrifying crashes of mountains and forests, etc. To sum it up briefly: we were so surrounded on all sides by floods that, with the bridge carried away, we could not escape from this corner, but having remained idle the whole day, we could barely cross over the next day with a beam thrown across.</p>
      <p>After we managed to return home, we saw and heard that our Plessur had caused horrendous damage in more than a thousand places around the city, which, according to the judgment of experts, could not be repaired for a thousand crowns.</p>
      <p>Thus, the affliction of the most torrential rivers on the same day made us more religious, if only truly and steadfastly from the heart! - Yesterday evening, the interpreter of the legate knocked at the house, but did not find me at home. This morning, Consul Ambrosius informed me through a messenger what he wanted: namely, that peace had been concluded in France. Soon followed a letter from Mr. Ruinelli, which confirmed the same.</p>
      <p>The accounts of certain distinguished men also agree, who believe that this last act has turned out badly for the Swiss. I now add only this: our bishop is now investing another abbot in the ministry of Spelunca, which is called Disentis. Cardinal Borromeo, who was in Bellinzona the day before yesterday and will travel through the Swiss cantons on his way, is supposed to be present at this investiture. What the arrival of such a monster means, surpasses my understanding, except that it is clear from common rumor and experience that such birds and owls always harbor something monstrous and carry their bloodthirsty spirits conspiring for our destruction. If I discover anything certain, I will let you know as soon as possible. - The mint master Hieronymus Carlinus has now taken himself to the bishop's court, under whose jurisdiction he intends to mint coins.</p>
      <p>His wife recently gave birth and absolutely refused to have the child baptized with papal baptism; but both parents were forced by the bishop not to have it baptized by us in the city. - With great pomp, Count Heinrich recently left Fideris and entered our city; they drank so much that one opened his mouth for the other and poured in a copious amount of wine. Duke Herdlius presented him with gilded bread, etc. But enough of this for now. It remains, most illustrious sir, most reverend father, that I commend myself to you humbly and pray to the Lord for a long and most happy life for you, to whom you have unceasingly dedicated and devoted all your studies and labors.</p>
      <p>Farewell, then, most excellently in Christ Jesus, our Lord. Amen.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly from Chur, August 28, 1570.</p>
      <p>Most kindly greetings from the consuls, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gregor Carl, Mr. Johann von Salis, etc.</p>
      <p>I received, along with your letters, those of the distinguished Mr. Froschauer, in which he informs me that nothing has been agreed upon regarding the remaining sum with the bookseller. Therefore, I ask you to tell him in my name that I will diligently pursue his case and will write soon about all matters, both done and to be done. That persistent man solicits many with secret letters, so that a return to his homeland may be open to him, meanwhile promising no amendment. I also hear that my colleague is working with many to bring back that perverse man. But if I sniff out the matter more deeply, I will act as befits me and as will be necessary in reality.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief and most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord. Zurich</p>
