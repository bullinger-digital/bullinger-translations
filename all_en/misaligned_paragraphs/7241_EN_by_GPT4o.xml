      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Rather than excusing my long silence, I now, after nearly a year and a half, have finally decided to write to you, my most learned and venerable Bullinger. Indeed, I find no reason to excuse myself for neglecting our correspondence for so long, except that I was ashamed and still am ashamed to respond after such a long interval to your last letter. Therefore, let me use this one excuse with you, that during the entire time of the last Diet of Augsburg, I was too occupied to send even a small letter to any of my friends. After the Diet was dissolved, having obtained an honorable dismissal from the court, I returned home, and, following the advice, encouragement, and even urging of friends, I took a wife. For 18 continuous years prior, during which I was at court, I had carried all my belongings and household goods with me like a nomad. I spent no small amount of time establishing and arranging my household affairs. You will learn more fully shortly what troubles awaited me upon my return to my homeland. Meanwhile, as I awaited a suitable messenger to send to you and delayed from day to day, so much time passed that I began to doubt whether you would accept my late response with equanimity. But your singular kindness and goodwill towards me, which I have long observed and confirmed through many proofs, finally overcame my hesitation and encouraged me to set aside my shame and judge it better to send a late letter than none at all, and to maintain the friendship initiated between us two years ago through mutual correspondence, which is dearer and more precious to me than anything else. If I understand that this excuse of mine satisfies you even a little and that my zeal and goodwill towards you are approved, I promise and assure you in good faith that I will compensate for my previous neglect of writing with regular correspondence in the future. Now I come to your latest letter.</p>
      <p>You recommended to me in it the consul of the Republic of Zürich, Bernhard von Cham, who, along with some others, was serving as an envoy to the Emperor on behalf of all the Swiss. However, while he was in Augsburg, not only did he not meet with me, but I never even saw him; for it happened inconveniently that, while several secretaries were assigned to various tasks of the Imperial court, the business that the Swiss envoys were conducting at court was entrusted to another secretary. My occupations were so numerous at that time that one followed another, and I had scarcely enough time left for eating and sleeping. Therefore, it happened that I could neither meet the consul nor greet him, nor could I host him with hospitality and a banquet, as was proper and as I desired solely for your sake, nor could I do anything to show my devotion to you that would have pleased him. I beg you, for the sake of my respect for you, to attribute this not to my inhumanity but rather to the injustice of the time and my constant occupational duties, in which I was then wholly immersed and nearly overwhelmed. Certainly, neither zeal nor willingness was lacking on my part to bind to me by some benefit the excellent man whom you so earnestly recommended to me, if time and my occupations had allowed it, and I greatly regret that the opportunity to do a good service to such an excellent man, who has done so much good for you and the Church of Christ, was taken from me. May the Lord grant that, since I could not do so for him, I may be able to do good for many others!</p>
      <p>Your advice not to change my courtly position, as it was pious and prudent and came from the best of intentions, I approve, and I would have followed it without regard for the difficulties and troubles of court life, the constant labors of my duties, or the neglect of public ecclesiastical ministry at court, if I could have hoped, even in the slightest degree, that my presence at court would bring some benefit to the church.</p>
      <p>However, since all hope of that had long since perished for me, I judged it to be extreme folly to strive in vain and, by much exertion, to gain nothing but trouble and envy for myself. Moreover, since the frequent travels of the Emperor with the court were adverse to me due to my not very robust health, I decided to choose a certain place where I could settle and spend the rest of my life comfortably, and so, after many requests, I obtained a dismissal from the court from the Emperor and came here, where I was born and raised and where, for my good services to this republic, I long ago obtained immunity from civil burdens from the magistrate of this city, firmly persuaded that here I could live a pious, comfortable, and tranquil life, attend public ministry, participate in common worship, and enjoy the familiarity and company of some learned men. But things turned out far differently than I had hoped. For since I could neither subscribe to the vain and more than papistic dreams of our Frenchmen and their associates about the carnal presence of Christ's body in the bread of the sacred supper, nor could I or should I venerate and adore them as the most steadfast defenders and most zealous protectors of pure and sound doctrine against all corruptions, it cannot be said how these venomous asps have poured out all their poison on me. Not only have they publicly denounced me as a most deplorable, lost, and pestilent heretic with full mouths (though not by name, yet described by all circumstances so that I could easily be recognized by anyone), and consigned me to hell, but they have also worked strenuously day and night to inflame the magistrate against me with false accusations and to incite them to take action against me and set an example either by proscription or some other severe punishment. Although nothing could be more distressing to me than that the minds of both the magistrate and the people are so occupied and bewitched by these charlatans that they will hear nothing but what these new Aristarchs approve and will accept nothing but what they affirm, however alien from the truth, absurd, paradoxical, frivolous, and inept it may be, and that I, who have deserved so well both publicly from the republic and privately from many people of this city (which I wish to say without boasting), am drawn into hatred and envy by the instigation of these arrogant rabbis, yet relying on the firmness of my cause, the conscience of my right actions, and the immunity I mentioned above, I have yielded nothing to the rage and intemperance of these furies, nor will I yield, God willing, let the French burst with rage, whom it is likely, if he grows old, will eventually turn into a basilisk; for he already emits serpentine hisses and portends some terrifying metamorphosis. For he does not hesitate to affirm that in theology, from true foundations and reasons, even a good consequence can follow a false one, and this paradox of his, although I have kindly admonished him to correct it, he not only does not correct but also continues to defend in writing and speech, so that by this axiom of his, he may elude the force of our arguments, by which he sometimes perceives himself to be pressed and held so tightly that he cannot escape.</p>
      <p>He vigorously defends the ubiquity of Christ's body, even if not explicitly, yet when he thinks it serves his cause, with the ubiquists. He also openly teaches that just as the proposition about Christ is convertible, namely "God is man" and "Man is God," so this proposition about the bread of the supper is convertible: "The bread is the body of Christ" and "The body of Christ is bread," and that the λόγος (Word) is united with human nature in Christ for redemption, but the body of Christ is united with the bread for the application of redemption, and that there is a most intimate connection of the substance of the bread with the body of Christ. While he spreads these and many other similar monstrous and intolerable doctrines openly, yet he is worshipped here by our people as some deity descended from heaven, and all his pronouncements are received as oracles as if from a tripod. Those who contradict these are immediately labeled as Schwärmer (enthusiasts), sectarians, fanatical spirits, charlatans, impostors, corrupters of truth, violators and adulterators of Christ's Testament, and slaves of Satan, and if anything more atrocious and more insulting can be said. For some time, the Augsburg Confession was publicly recited from the pulpit in our church here to burden our people and exclude them from public peace. It is shouted to the point of hoarseness that our writings are full of blasphemies and foul errors; but so far from showing the errors with which they are falsely charged from them, they even prohibit the reading of them to everyone under severe penalties imposed on those in whose possession such books are found. If anyone says that Luther was mistaken somewhere, as in the cause of the sacred supper, and that he did not defend that cause against adversaries legitimately and that it was not rightly determined and defined by his judgment, he is anathema. And so the devil, with only a change of person, begins to papalize again in these our people. For the traditions and decrees of men are equated with the word of God; our people are condemned as heretics without a hearing and are committed to tyrants to be tortured and utterly exterminated as unworthy of public peace; our books are prohibited and suppressed as execrable; the sole authority of Luther is the rule and norm of truth, as in the previous century was the rule of the fathers and councils. It cannot be said what struggles and battles I have endured with these inept rabbis when I first returned here; how much trouble they have caused me and my wife concerning the rite of marriage, I could testify in large volumes written on the matter. Since there is no limit or end to the accusations, insults, slander, and execrations against our people among this furious kind of men, I have hitherto abstained not only from their sacred rites (to avoid scandal and not to appear to subscribe to their impure doctrines) but also from both public and private gatherings. How pleasant it is for a pious heart to live among such, I do not say men, but rather infernal furies, to devour their slanders, lies, and most atrocious insults, and moreover to be deprived of common sacred rites and all the company of those with whom I could otherwise enjoy familiar fellowship here, you can easily judge with your prudence, and so, fleeing courtly troubles, I have fallen into far greater ones, as the proverb says, from the frying pan into the fire, from Charybdis into Scylla. It has seemed good to the most excellent and greatest God that I should be exercised by these other difficulties and buffeted in this way by the angel of Satan, lest I be too elated by prosperous affairs and forget the Lord, and lest I conceal anything from you, it has occurred to me more than once that these things are divinely sent to me because I perhaps imprudently abandoned the station in which I was placed, with all hope of fruit to be obtained cast aside, and did not rather follow my calling, endure hatred, envy, and other courtly difficulties and troubles, and expect favorable outcomes from God. But if anything imprudent was done or performed by me in this, I pray the Lord to graciously forgive it.</p>
      <p>Who can understand his errors? Although I may seem not to have entirely deserted my calling, since the Emperor still honors me with the title of counselor, and moreover with an annual stipend, and uses my services. Having been cast into these difficulties, I am now again considering changing my place and transferring my residence to the Palatinate, where the foundations of pious reformation and sound doctrine have been laid, albeit imperfectly, although there too everything is full of dissensions, contentions, hatreds, and enmities, and even dangers. May Christ Jesus graciously regard his church and grant it peace, if not external, at least internal and never-ending, and deliver it from all evil. Amen.</p>
      <p>I received the Compendium of Christian Religion, which you compiled in ten books and sent to me, and I thank you for it; I have nothing to repay you with. I had asked you to indicate the price of the books you sent earlier, but I could not obtain that from you. I am sending, not indeed as the price of the books, which I know are worth more, but only as a μνΗμοσθνς (remembrance) or gift for your little children, your sons or grandsons, daughters or granddaughters, three gold coins, and I ask you to accept it in good part. I have read your compendium and it pleases me greatly; I have seen nothing more in agreement with my theses, and therefore it not only fully satisfies my wish and desire but also far exceeds it. However, if you judge it worthwhile and if you or any of your colleagues have enough time from other studies and ecclesiastical labors to expand my theses, either in the very order in which they are written or in another order, and to illustrate and confirm them with testimonies from sacred scripture, that labor will undoubtedly be most welcome and useful not only to me but to many pious people. For you will find, alas, many even among those who have heard the doctrine of Christ for many years, indeed who have also taught it to others, who either completely ignore or certainly do not rightly hold the causes of the incarnate λόγος (Word) and the mystery of our redemption and restoration, for which reason I would wish these things to be clearly, perspicuously, and openly, as far as possible, delivered and explained.</p>
      <p>I read the heads of the disputation between Martin Bucer of blessed memory and Dr. Young, the Englishman, on usury, which you sent to me, and I compared them with what Dr. Calvin commented on in Exodus 22, Leviticus 25, and Deuteronomy 23, and I found that both examined this cause learnedly and accurately and that Calvin agrees beautifully with Bucer in it. Dr. Musculus, in the appendix on Usury, which he wrote on Psalm 15, although he seems somewhat harsher, nevertheless agrees with both in reality, as he wants the whole cause to be judged by the rule of charity, which indeed is the best rule and was given by Christ himself in that very place, which many bring against any usury and from Luke 6, when he says: "Whatever you want men to do to you," etc. I had inquired about this matter so that the scruple introduced about the annual rent, which the Emperor pays me for a certain sum of money, might be removed from me, which no longer torments me; for I cannot seem to exceed the limits of charity, who would prefer ready money to what is paid from it. I recently came across your apologetic exposition on the sacred supper and some other articles of our faith published against the calumnies of certain people, and I communicated it to one of the ministers of our church here, who is somewhat more moderate and fairer to our cause, with a recommendation, as you will learn from the example attached to this letter. He has not yet responded to me. If only he would read it, I would consider myself well off; but these architects of the bodily presence of Christ's flesh in the bread of the supper seem to be bound and obliged by an oath among themselves that none of them should read adversarial writings, but that they should guard against them as if from the most present pestilence, while in the meantime they insolently and shamelessly accuse our people of errors that never even came into our minds in a dream, and about these they bitterly attack our people and slander and defame them among the unlearned populace, than which nothing more unjust or more alien from a Christian man can be imagined? The most illustrious Prince Elector of the Palatinate complained about this matter in letters sent to the senate of this city, who indeed enjoined the ministers to restrain themselves from calumnies and slander. But they, fearing nothing of the senate's orders, become more ferocious and insane day by day and shout that the light of truth will be extinguished if they remain silent. May the Lord restrain their impudent mouths!</p>
      <p>I have thought it right to write to you at length, though late, since I learned from the letters of Matthias Schenck, the head of the school in Augsburg, that when he recently met you in Zürich, you made an honorable mention of me to him and desired my letters. Although I am greatly pleased that you still steadfastly preserve the memory of me, it would have been much more gratifying if you had reproached my slowness in sending letters to you by sending letters to me and invited me to write, which I kindly ask you to do frequently in the future, and in return, I promise you that I will take care that you can never justly complain of any lack of zeal and duty in me in cultivating our friendship. For I love you, honor, and respect you for your remarkable piety, learning, and dexterity of judgment, of which your writings and among these your Commentaries on all the epistles of the divine Paul and other apostles, which I now handle, are the most abundant witnesses. May the Lord be with you by his Spirit and preserve you in safety for a long time, so that your salutary writings may edify the church and the doctrine of truth may be propagated as widely as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily and prosperously in Christ Jesus forever. Given at Regensburg on the 8th day before the calends of October in the year 1567.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Wolf.</p>
      <p>Haller has signed.</p>
      <p>If I have erred now by prolixity or excessive talkativeness as I did before by silence, I beg you to forgive both.</p>
      <p>Of the writings of your people opposed to the vehement and bitter invectives of Martin Luther, almost nothing remains with us; everything has been suppressed in most places. However, I especially desire your last response to Luther's final invective, which he titled "Brief Confession"; for I have long sought it in vain for sale. If it exists with you, I ask you to send it to me, but not without the price written, which I will pay in good faith.</p>
      <p>Whatever letters or books you are going to send, direct them to Schenck in Augsburg; for he can then take care that they are properly delivered to me.</p>
      <p>I ask you to convey my most abundant greetings in return to your sons, sons-in-law, relatives, and all your friends, in whose name you greeted me in your latest letters.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and upright man in piety, learning, and judgment, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, minister of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
