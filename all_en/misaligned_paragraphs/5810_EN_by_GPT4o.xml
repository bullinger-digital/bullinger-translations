      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I give you the highest thanks, most illustrious man, for having so kindly and piously cared for my children in your home, and I do not doubt that they too, if they survive and remain in piety, will do the same, to render you deserved thanks. Now, since I am occupied with military affairs, I am compelled to conclude briefly what I have begun. I do not doubt that you are aware of the disturbances in our churches concerning the principal article of our religion, but with God's grace, I am now certain that we ought to believe in such a Trinity, where there are three of one nature or deity: God the Father, the Son of God, and the Holy Spirit, where Christ the mediator is God and man, or the incarnate Word to God the Father, which Stancaro denies and from this deduces two gods. I do not wish to inquire further into this matter, content with the simplicity of God's Word, but because some here teach variously about certain things, such as invocation, I also wanted to inquire of you. Some say that when in the Lord's Prayer we say: "Our Father," the Son and the Holy Spirit are to be understood under the name of the Father, so that God the Trinity is invoked, not God the Father through the Son in the Holy Spirit. Then we have almost all songs here, in which they invoke one God in Trinity, and the conclusions of the songs are similar, where the name of the triune God or one in Trinity is blessed, for our language uses these terms, while I read nothing of the sort in your prayers and ceremonies, which I have also seen in Latin and Italian, and the prayers of Master Calvin in the prophets have nothing of the sort, but prayers are always directed to the Father through the Son or sometimes to the Son of God. However, since some here say that you feel differently than we see, I ask that you not hesitate to describe it to us. It would be much more useful if ours here also sang nothing other than the Psalms of David. For in these songs, there are many absurdities. One God in Trinity is invoked to grant us the Holy Spirit, this God is invoked through Christ, while Christ is only the mediator to the Father, etc. Then also those here who contend among themselves say that the Apostles' Creed should be divided when we say "I believe in God," and then, after inserting a pause, they say "the Father." Thus, they also divide the Nicene Creed, separating one God from the Father, when concerning Christ the Son of God, they later say true God from true God. Finally, there was also contention about whether the names of idolaters should be given in baptism to children, such as here was Stanislaus the Pole, whose temples, altars, and bones are still held, worshipped as a god among us, and there was no other from whom his name was taken. Some ministers no longer wish to baptize with his name, but we should be content with the names of the Old and New Testaments. I wish to know from you what should be followed and what is the custom of your church; I ask that you not hesitate to respond to these matters. I also wrote to Master Calvin about this matter, to whom I ask you to deliver my letters and commend me to him, and urge him to respond to me. Please transmit his letters to me to Sebastian Ketzler, a citizen of Nuremberg, or if there is anyone who can deliver them more quickly. I commend myself to your prayers. May the Lord bless you and guide you with His Spirit.</p>
