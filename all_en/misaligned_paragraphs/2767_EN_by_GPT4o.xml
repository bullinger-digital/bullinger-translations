      <p>Greetings. I have received the letters of Your Sacred Majesty, filled with royal clemency, for which I give eternal thanks to Your Clemency.</p>
      <p>I pray to God our Father through His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that He may preserve Your Royal Majesty not only in a happy state and grant you peace, authority, wealth, victories, and other temporal goods, but also keep the eyes of Your Royal Majesty's mind enlightened, so that they may look to Him alone, who proclaims in the most true gospel: "I am the light of the world; whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." Indeed, clouds pour forth from human wisdom and the cunning of the evil one to darken this true and eternal light; but these are dispelled again by heavenly grace and the diligence of the pious, who do not cease to search the law of the Lord, which the Lord God Himself, the best and greatest, commends to His kings, promising to bless them with every kind of blessing if they adhere to Him alone and govern their kingdoms according to that clear word of the law. I implore that blessing from God the Father through Jesus Christ for Your Royal Majesty, and at the same time, I offer all my services.</p>
      <p>May the Lord our God preserve Your Sacred Royal Majesty unharmed and inspire you with His spirit, so that you may one day, following the example of the most sacred kings Josiah and Constantine, undertake and accomplish a sincere and necessary reformation in the church. In ZÃ¼rich, the principal city of the Swiss, November 12, in the year of our salvation 1555.</p>
      <p>To the most serene and powerful prince Sigismund II Augustus, by the grace of God King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Russia, Prussia, Masovia, Samogitia, etc., lord and heir, my most clement lord.</p>
